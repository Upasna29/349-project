It is a minimal, abstract platform game. Aside from that, it is a really cool platform rhythm game. The levels start out "simple" the music isn't too complicated. As you get to checkpoints, more complex rhythms are put into the soundtrack and these make other things happen: blocks appear and disappear, shapes grow and shrink, static fields jump, bouncy floors activate, gravity shifts. Paying attention to the music and how it affects the level is crucial to finishing. At the end of each level there is a boss fight. Each level the boss fights get more complex.\n\nOnce you have finished the game three mirror levels open up. One wrong move and you fail - you must complete the entire level without dying. And all the patterns are backwards. Yeah right.\n\nFun but short platform game.","April 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","64","66","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/242820/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","140 is a very short (~45 minutes or so, maybe less) platformer with ultra-minimal geometric graphics, a little reminiscent of Thomas Was Alone with even more of a commitment to visual minimalism and trashy, angry-psychadelic graphics. What sets it apart is that the platforming is built around rhythm elements, much like something like Beatbuddy or Sony/PSN's "Sound Shapes". Basically, as you go through the levels there are timed obstacles, platforms, and other mechanics that play along with the dirty, dub-step / glitch electronica that comprises the music. Periodically you will collect an orb which you bring to a set point, which causes the colour palette, sound, and mechanics to shift. At the end of each of the three levels is a boss which functions kind of like a shoot-em-up-ish genre. If you die, the screen dissolves into analog TV fuzz as the music glitches out even further and you respawn at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nCheat code: If you want to make the game easier, go slowly and count out a beat. Mostly the rhythm patterns seem to be 4/4 or 8/8 so if you can count the beat in your head you'll be able to crack the code no problem.\n\nWhether you feel like you'll get $5 out of such a short game is up to you, but I found it to be a great experience. Often times when I died, I chuckled in spite of myself because I found the rhythm mechanics very clever. I especially liked the bosses.\n\nBecause of the emphasis on music, I recommend headphones--certainly you would find it very difficult to play without audio.\n\nHopefully this review has given you the information you need to try to decide whether or not this is for you.","July 6, 2014","true","0.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","0"

Everything in the world moves to the beat of the music, effectively you could probably complete parts of this game with your eyes closed; judging it by the beat of the music. I did really enjoy the plat-forming of this game though, I just wish that it was longer with some more mechanics added in.\n\n\nAudio - 8/10:\nThis is where the game really shines, like I said before, everything in the world is tied in with the music, it all flows really well and the music itself sounds really bloody cool as well. It's techno-style music... Kind of hard to describe but below you'll find a Gameplay and Commentary on my channel so you can hear it there anyways (Coming soon...).\n\n\nOverall - 8.0/10:\nEven though this game was very short I really enjoyed it, the sound absolutely makes this game what it is and the visuals just look really crisp. The developer(s) obviously knew what kind of game they wanted to create and they made it. I'd say it's more of an art piece than a game!

Nothing was impossible and it was all enjoyable due to the soundtrack and visuals. In my personal recommendation, if you have $5 to spare on this game, you should probably buy it, if you don't have the 5 dollars, it's been on the humble bundle a few times and its not super popular, so you could probably pick it up from someone for very cheap, if not free from a friend. The best way to explain this game is fresh and relaxing. Which doesn't come very often in puzzle/platform games.\n\nOnly true regret: the game is very very short. would've been angry if it was $5, but I spent $1 on a bundle.\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 8/10 (Nothing is over complicated, but at the same rate you could argue no story.)\nGameplay: 10/10 (Beats affect the game, and has a few creative elements to it. Plenty of challenge and timing, and perfection.)\nPresentation: 10/10 (Simplistic style, but all in all, very fitting, very fresh.)\nSoundtrack: 10/10 (these beats don't get old.)\nReplayability: 9/10 (Has a frustratingly hard set of mirror levels, which reward you with very rare achieves. separates the good from the mediocre.)","September 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","1"

In the platforming you have to go from point A to point B to dodging and using objects in the map. The game has in total 3 levels with each of them having 1 endboss. The endbosses are pretty challenging and really let you know you have to focus on what is happening on screen but also to the music that you hear.  What I like about the game is that it explains itself with no text, using only music and the world itself. This really helps the minimalist style. As you progress through the game, you can really hear and see that the levels are getting harder and have to think about what you are doing. The game is well designed, so when you die you know it is your fault. The music is also fun to listen to.  I first played the game on okay-speakers and later on a good-headset. The difference in enjoyment was huge. So I would recommend good audio equipment while you play the game.  Steam says the game took me in total 104 minutes.( I have to say that I left level 2 partway through once, so I had to start from the beginning of level 2. So the games doesn't save your checkpoints in a level. ) After you complete the main game you also unlock all the levels in mirror mode where you don't have any checkpoints. This can be fun for people who are searching for a challenge but I am not interested in playing it. All in all, the game was fun but felt too short for me. I had hoped the game had more harder levels.\n\nIn short: A nice, but short, minimalist style platformer where music is the key.\n","November 1, 2014","true","1.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/recommended/242820/","TrevorJr","Trevor Jr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/","356 products in account","This is a challenging platformer with some of the best music I've heard in a game since things like 'Sword and Sworcery EP' and 'Fez'. The music itself as well as some of the visuals are quite reminiscent of 'Fez' although they are very different games.\n\nWhen you first open the game, you are treated to the music straight away. There is no menu or text, other than the large '140' in the middle of the screen. Upon pressing any button you are thrust into the game itself, still with no instructions. This isn't a game for those new to the platforming genre, but those who have played the simplest flash game will easily be able to understand what to do.\n\nEach level of the game has it's own music to match the obstacles present there. You will need the music on, as all the obstacles are synced up to the beat and mastering the rhythms can mean the difference between life and death. At the end of each level there is a boss, it will challenge the skills you have learnt through the level leading up to it. These bosses aren't the typical 'fights' you may be used to from other games, but I find them to be fairer and more challenging than most.\n\nI absolutely adore the visual style of the game and the way it matches the music so well. The simplest touches can effect the game massively and when you first play it can be overwhelming, especially when you die. The patterns in the background that seemingly dance to the music fit the rest of the levels perfectly and aren't distracting or annoying, even when you are stuck on a particularly difficult section.\n\nOverall this is one of the best platformers I have ever played, the controls are extremely responsive and I never felt like I died because it was the game's fault. For the price there is the perfect amount of content in my opinion. With just enough challenge and variety to give you a few hours of gameplay, and even more if you want all the achievements.\n\nI would give '140' 5 stars, 10/10, 8/8 or whatever rating system you prefer, I love it. I will certainly be buying the soundtrack and I hope a sequel will be made one day.

Usually, the normal part can be blasted through in no more than 2 hours, and then you'll be presented with the ending sequence. If you're not paying attention to the game's "menu" afterward - or if you're not interested in the mirror stages challenge at all - you're seriously missing out. The 1-life nature of the challenge will force you to sync your mind with the rhythms, and that's when the true nature of this game really shines.\n\nIn-Depth Comment\nThere exists typically two types of platformers: one that tests your intelligence and one that tests your reflexes. 140 belongs to the latter type which I loathe and usually refrain from buying at all, but the inclusion of strongly rhythmic elements has made this game far more approachable than other sadistic titles in the genre. Most of the obstacles in particular act in tight concert with background music loops and aren't influenced by user behaviors, eliminating a lot of luck factor commonly observed in other reflex-based platformers. For the 3 mirror stages I was able to master each one within a 1 ~ 1.5 hour timeframe, making steady and perceivable progress in memorizing the level each time, thanks to the aid of the strong beats.\n\nAt the end of each stage there's also a "boss fight", featuring obstacles that react to user behaviors. This introduces certain degree of randomness into the play - while all the bosses still act with patterns, the boss fights can become a major source of frustrations in the mirror stages due to their reflex-centric nature. The only mirror stage boss I was able to get in one go was the final (3rd) one - the only boss that isn't actually influenced by user behaviors and thus the easiest to beat providing that you've done your homework (though the fight still remains highly intense). I found it immensely helpful to spell out the next pattern loudly and assertively as if I'm countermoving the final boss with my incantation, and experienced tremendous relief and satisfaction as my final word sealed the fate of the boss with all the well-timed rhythms and musics. Priceless moment.\n\nAll in all, this game is very challenging but was nicely designed in a way to prevent it from becoming a torture. It certainly ain't gonna end up in my list of top games, but it's a quality one nonetheless.","December 13, 2015","true","6.4"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

It's simple elegance pervades every corner of the experience, to the extent it almost manages to push gameplay entirely out of the picture. The basic shapes and purposeful use of contrasting colors invokes comparisons to Mondrian, with a calculated simplicity and conspicuousness that elevates the presentation from rudimentary to a captivating example of minimalism. Moved by the beat of a reserved yet distinctive audio track, the experience feels alive as you move through levels, perfectly in sync with each other as if performing an elaborate dance.\n\nIn this way, you are something of an outlier; awkwardly progressing through areas you ought not to be in. This creates an odd sort of disconnect between the gameplay and the atmosphere, as while both work wonderfully together to create a brilliant rhythm based platformer, their is just something off about all of it that left me somewhat unsatisfied over the whole affair. I enjoyed every second of the one hour experience, but I also feel no need to spend anymore time within the game.\n\n140 is undeniably a very cool game, one which demands a closer dissection of its elements than you would assume at first glance, the core of which is incredibly tight and polished. It made me think and left me feeling smarter for overcoming its challenges, but as the small side project of a single developer it is, it shouldn't be expected to have the amount of content or range of mechanics to feel like a fully fleshed out concept. It's an experiment, one that succeeds at what it attempts while prompting you to dig deeper into its refined define, but that is all it is and expectations should be set accordingly before entering its psychedelic world.","July 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","4"

It mixes a rhythm game with a platformer, where as it goes on you'll need to use the abstract but enjoyable electronic music in order to time your movements.\n\nVisually it's extremely simple, but surprisingly appealing and even beautiful at times. Screenshots absolutely do not do it justice. I feel the slick animations in time with the music and sound effects, particularly in the boss encounters, raise the visuals above what you'd expect from such simple assets. Even the way the character morphs between shapes while jump and move is brilliant, even better than the squash and stretch animations of Thomas Was Alone.\n\nMechanically I felt the game did an excellent job at throwing new ideas at the player constantly, while giving concise organic lessons before throwing them into something more difficult. Each of the 3 bosses I fought had that small learning period as well. The checkpoints are frequent and I was rarely frustrated. It seems some players aren't even aware of the "second half", as they only appear if you go through the main menu back into the game, and go just further to the right than you had to go the first time. These 3 extra levels seem to be identical to the original 3, but mirrored left to right, using different color combinations, with permadeath... I didn't realize it the first time I tried the first mirrored level, until I died and spawned back at the intro. I decided to give it another crack and I was able to complete it without dying on the next try. The level of stress shoots through the roof, as the whole level becomes as tense as the hardest sections of the game. I don't really enjoy that level of difficulty, specifically the concept of punishing failure with repetition, but in this case it's not really extra content, so it can be safely skipped if you're not up to it.\n\nMy playtime so far, beating 4 of the 6 levels was just shy of an hour, but I quickly fell in love with it's simplicity. It doesn't match the charm of Thomas Was Alone, or the unbelievable visuals of FEZ, but it's damn good for what it is. It runs flawlessly at 120FPS at 1080P, but it probably supports higher resolutions as well. I played with a keyboard rather than a controller because I honestly just started it to see it, but it hooked me and I ended up beating the whole thing in one go. Pricing is up to the buyer, but I'd say it's certainly worth the asking price on a moderate sale, or in one of the dozen bundles it's been in.","June 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You play as a square, and your goal is to get to the end of each level (3 in total). The only controls are left/right and jump, so it's not exactly complicated, nor are any of the jumps particularly difficult. What makes it interesting (and marginally challenging) is the timing of the jumps - you are typically tasked with jumping on or through obstacles that appear, disappear, or move in time with the music. Once you figure out the pattern of a particular area, it's pretty easy. The soundtrack is your typical indie-electronica type music, but suits the game well. Visually, although it is very simple, the look is pretty cool and even hypnotic at times (it looks like an Atari 2600 game on acid). The game only takes about 1 hour or so to complete, so keep that in mind when contemplating a purchase. If you like indie platformers or rhythm-based platformers and don't mind the price-to-length ratio, give it a go. Otherwise, if you're on the fence, I'd say wait for a 50% off (or more) sale.","August 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/recommended/242820/","FallenAngelEyes","FAE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/","847 products in account","This game took me completely by surprise. I recently picked it up in the Humble Eye Candy Weekly Bundle, in which it was included for its aesthetic. I hadn't read anything about it yet, so I decided to just fire it up and go in cold. What I ended up playing was one of the best games I've ever played that uses music to engage the player with the gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe game's pretty good about ramping up the difficulty moderately, introducing new stage mechanics at a decent pace. The only time I really felt it was at all unfair about it was the boss fight at the end of Level 2, which seems to just involve guesswork if you don't know the pattern already. The rest of the time, my deaths were due to my own mistakes, either getting off rhythm or trying to rush too soon. Getting a feel for the rhythm of the music is crucial to successfully navigating a level and completing the boss fights.\n\nThe visuals are minimalist, but colorful, with the backgrounds pulsing in time to the music as the stage elements change. The bright palette is in stark contrast to Limbo, which was directed by the developer of 140, and it fits well with the electronic soundtrack (which I'll likely be purchasing).\n\nThe game was fairly short, as I finished the main levels within a little over an hour. There are additional levels which are mirrored versions of the main ones, but they're without checkpoints. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to finish those, but they're an option for those looking for an even greater challenge.\n\nI'd advise using a gamepad if you're more comfortable playing platformers with one, even though the controls are very simple (just directionals and jumping). As you can imagine, it's unfortunately not a game I'd recommend for anyone who has difficulty with hand/eye coordination.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, especially at the price I bought it at, but even at its (low) full price, I'd still recommend it at its short length, just for the simplistic brilliance of the way it melded gameplay and music. Even though I probably won't be able to finish the challenge levels, I'll probably go back to play through the old ones just to re-experience them.\n\nIf it's playable for you and you're a fan of platformers or music games, definitely check it out.","July 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The game requires you to jump and roll your way through a series of timing-based challenges, all of which are set to the throbbing, toe-tap-worthy beat of the game's Electronic Super Joy-esque soundtrack.\n\nYour goal throughout each level is to collect dual-colored orbs and then return them to various checkpoints. Each returned orb causes the level to fluctuate, activating moving panels and changing the game's color scheme. To collect each orb, you'll be faced with moving blocks, grey-matter platforms that kill you on contact, and tricky tests of your ability to time impressively challenging jumps. However, the levels provide plenty of checkpoints, saving your progress before each threat you face.\n\nThe end of each level features, like most games, a boss. The boss levels of 140 are the only times when your otherwise peaceful shape is armed with a weapon: a beam that shoots out of your shape automatically in time to the music's beat. Boss levels are long, creatively designed levels that require you to avoid projectiles while also correctly timing your attacks, making them often frustrating (but, in the end, rewarding) moments of the game.\n\nThe only noticeable downside to 140 is its astonishing lack of true save points. While there are several checkpoints within each level that you can return to when you die, exiting out of the game entirely will cause your progress in each level to be lost. Therefore, each level must be beat in one sitting, otherwise you'll simply have to start completely over next time you come back to the game.\n\nDespite this, the game is both fun and challenging and, if you manage to make it through all three levels, the end will unlock three extra bonus levels that allow you to play the first three levels backwards without checkpoints. This added challenge adds a few extra hours of gameplay—I have to assume, since I've never been skilled enough to play the bonus levels!","December 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

None of the challenges were at all satisfying to complete.\n\nSuper Meat Boy-style finesse is rarely required--just basic timing and a LOT of waiting. Many of the levels are designed to make gracefully darting through them impossible: for every second you actually spend moving or jumping, you'll spend a second waiting for a platform to materialize or move or deactivate, because it wasn't set correctly when you reached it. With such bite-size levels and challenges, these constant five-second mandatory pauses become grating, and clash with the music, which has a tempo and rhythm that encourage a sense of constant motion.\n\nAs for the art style? Eh, it's inoffensive, not great. It's going for a sort of pseudo-De Stijl look: each level contains lots of blocks of two arbitrary colors, with slightly different values for different level assets. The music might be tense with warm colors, or softer with cool colors, but that's the extent of the game's tonal consistency: the level mood jumps around from somber to exciting to chill with no real rhyme or reason. What is this trying to make me feel?\n\nWell, I certainly felt bored.","July 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played through a few levels, and found the rhythm parts up to the first boss a bit tedious.  It mostly involved waiting for a downbeat, and wasn't as exciting as a rhythm game should be.  I thought it was warming me up for better rhythm antics, but I was wrong.  Instead, it was warming me up for a terrible "boss", where you're micromanaging a "gun" that only shoots on every fourth beat, while trying to survive bullet hell.  Ten minutes of levels that are so easy that they border on tedious, and then it just throws you into "f***-you" hardmode.

The platforming gameplay is as shallow as one can imagine, your only actions consisting of jumping and moving (always at a fixed speed). Since the whole game revolves around stage hazards following musical rhythms, you always progress at the pace of the levels, waiting for the right time to advance. Boss fights are a little more interesting for deviating from the main game in different ways, though you are still a slave to the game's music-based mechanics in those.\n\nOh, and you can beat the main game in 1 hour. It's like, three stages long, and after the end you can replay mirrored versions of those same stages without checkpoints (you can't get much lazier than that with hard modes). That's about the entire game for you.\n\nThere's nothing broken about 140. It's just that it's boring, unfullfiling and has as much content as miss south carolina's skull. For the price it charges, you can get way more interesting games around gabe's funhouse.","January 10, 2015","false","7.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","22","39","4","2"

It's brief, and it's easy, but it is wonderful.\n\n140 is a simple platformer that is almost entirely about executing basic rhythm puzzles.  The levels are alive around you, and as the elements of level design move they create sound, stereo positioned relative to you, that participates in the music.  That music in turn guides you through the game's obstacles which comprise it.\n\nAt the same time, it is an aesthetic delight that plays with color and shape just as much as with sound and rhythm.  There is some replay value in the traditional sense in the form of mirrored versions of the three levels that remove checkpoints, but I would play through the game again anyway just because I like it.\n\nThe entire structural idea of moving past half-spherical ports embedded within the ground, finding an orb, returning to a receptacle, watching the world become washed over by the colors contained in the orb, and seeing that new environmental mechanics have come to life and are contributing to the music is absolutely enchanting to me. It just captures my imagination so vividly.\n\nThe fact that the orbs emit micro versions of the music that they will add before they have been integrated—and exhibit behavior similar to the level element that will come to life with that sound—makes it even better by providing thematic and logical consistency.\n\nJust one of many things that I love about this gem of a game.\n\nInexpensive and well worth experiencing.  I hope you'll pick it up.","November 10, 2013","true","4.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKaleidoscope/recommended/242820/","SuperKaleidoscope","SuperKaleido","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKaleidoscope/","204 products in account","140 is essentially a minimalistic musical platformer developed by Jeppe Carlsen, known for his gameplay direction in Limbo. Players however, will fondly remember this game as both a visual and musical marvel. Despite being relatively short, the game remains challenging and enjoyable with oodles of replay value to boot. I can confess to having completed three playthroughs myself - one of them probably under the influence of something.\n\nPlayers will be in awe of the minimalistic and colourful visuals, as this is a game that is indeed rife with aesthetic beauty. One stage of a level will be coated in an abundance of pastel colours, while the next will feel as warm as a summer's day in Dubai.\n\nThe music is dynamic to the extent that it feels like a living, breathing, entity. Fortunately, for fans of electronic music like myself, the progressive house soundtrack will melt your ears and have you floating away like you were having the best heroin trip of your life.\n\nThe gameplay is wholly unique in that it utilizes the ancient greek theory of Synesthesia in it's gameplay design. Platforms will move and enemies will shoot in time with the music like a well rehearsed play. In fact - this feature is the key to completing the game, as paying close attention to the music for cues, will signal when to traverse a platform or blast a ball of oppressive static into nothingness.\n\nThere are slight issues with the lack of a pause feature, framerate issues on lower end systems, and not being able to change the settings in the game client itself and only from the launch window. Fortunately, none of these are even anywhere close to ruining the game's integral experience.\n\n140 is a relatively cheaply priced game, suited for stoners, contemplative thinkers, and sensory junkies looking for a quick and potent fix.","July 20, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I thought for sure that an entire game could be built around this concept, and here's one at last.\n\nSo how is it? ... Well, it's a brilliant proof-of-concept, with interesting and satisfying puzzles and mechanics, but it's way too short. You can breeze through Normal mode in about 30 minutes, and the difficulty is smooth sailing all the way until the second half of level 3. If you like tension and frustration, you can give Hard mode a shot, which removes all checkpoints and gives you one life.\n\nBut still, this really needs to be a full-length game with dozens more levels and ideas. As it is, it's probably not worth the $5.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't much variety to the soundtrack so it quickly fell off and became boring. Though, it did slightly change...you can still feel it being recycled.\n\nThe graphical choice was probably more so due to lazyness, lack of imagination, time restraints, or even budget. Either way, this kind of style has been done before. Despite the fact that graphics obviously don't make the game...the devs could at least tried to do something new with it. (I do like the equalizer, though. That was somewhat nifty.)\n\nGameplay is straight forward. However, it becomes almost tedious. Your timing has to be absolutely perfect otherwise, you're going to have to hear the annoying static sound along with a checkpoint set back. At least there's checkpoints...\n\nThough, I do not mind pinpoint precision. Games like Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Boy require such. But...they have more of a satisfaction to it once completing levels and a better soundtrack.\n\nI do understand that soundtrack and graphical choice are matter of opinion. Nevertheless, I believe that only goes to an extent.\n\nIf you're interested in this game; I suggest waiting for a pricedrop. It is definitely not worth $5 with the amount of OTHER indie games you can get for that price. Or, you know...get Super Meat Boy or Electronic Super Joy.

The game has no menus, no text, no pause function. If you want to wait before taking your next move, just stop where you are. Go make a sandwich. 140 is a series of system introductions that reminds us what gaming has lost -- remember when there was no tutorial, and no one read the manual? But we didn't need either, the game taught us by letting us make mistakes, letting us explore. Here we have a rhythm-oriented platformer that begs the question "Why did we stray?" Screw twelve hour tutorial mission sets. If you don't learn the rules, you die, and try again, until you do.\n\nThis game is graphically simplistic, but beautiful. The soundtrack is the same thumping piece for the most part, and yet you never mind. Nothing feels repetitive, and you always want "one more try." I haven't beaten the three permadeath levels yet, but I haven't stopped trying, and I likely won't stop trying until I've 100%ed this thing, even if it takes me a dozen hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/recommended/242820/","zaphite","Zaphite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/","486 products in account","140 is a rythm platformer that is generally enjoyable but ultimately falls short of being a better game due to its very short length.\n\nThe Good:\nThe art style is very simplistic and consists almost completely of basic shapes, but is still appealing and the background and other objects in the game move and interact with the music. The music is upbeat and works well with the rythm aspect of the gameplay, which consists mostly of timing your jumps and some puzzle solving in order to progress through the level. As each level progresses the music gets more complicated with different sounds that in turn correspond to platforms and hazards in the level, so that you can use the music and sounds to time jumps and plan movements. The controls are great and work perfectly with a keyboard, which is what I used to play.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe biggest downside is that this game is extremely short, I managed to complete the three levels in the game in under an hour. This game is $5 and the amount of content provided is not enough to constitute the asking price. After completing the three levels there are 3 more versions of the levels that have increased challenge as you only have one life to complete the whole level, rather than having many checkpoints like in the first three levels. This is better than nothing but personally they become a bit too difficult with only one life and is still not enough content for $5.\n\nAlthough it is a good game, I would definitely recommend purchasing this game in a sale. I got it in a bundle for a greatly reduced price and really enjoyed the gameplay it offered despite it leaving me wanting more, which could at least be considered proof that the gameplay was engaging.","November 13, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/242820/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","140 is another in the line of difficult platformers. It does have a twist to it, rather than it just being insanely difficult. You have to use the background sounds and music to time your actions. The great advantage of this is that, unlike other "hard platformers", it isn't just one massive kaizo trap that needs you to do trial-and-error. It is theoretically possible to use the music cues to complete a level in a single run (which is a challenge unlocked once you complete the game).\n\nI think the way the game used this mechanic was very well executed. The level design is simple enough that you don't get distracted by every little thing, but it doesn't look boring, (which is a problem in a lot of "minimal design" type games these days). The syle is reminiscent of Thomas was alone, with simple geometric shapes and flat colours.\n\nDefinitely a game worth playing if you're into the hard platformer types, but probably worth avoiding otherwise.","November 15, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just played this game from start to end this evening, and I'm totally blown away. The amazing soundtrack is still playing in my head, which is also a quite important element of the game. The soundtrack I mean, not my head. The graphics are very enjoyable as well. They fit perfectlly with the music, and they're both super tight, crispy and geometric. And the colours are  beautiful. I would say that this has been one of the greatest game experiences I've had. Another great thing about 140 is the difficulty. It's not easy. The last battle in 140 (no spoilers) was one of the hardest moments I've had in gaming. It's difficult in another way than most puzzle platformers, because you have to really be in sync with the rhythm and in the end you have to kind of split your brain in two in order to win. At least that's what I experienced. That made it very satisfying to finally beat it in the end, after I'd done it over and over and over and ended up in a more or less meditative state of mind.\n\nSkip this paragraph, if you haven't played the game and don't want a spoiler. I haven't beaten the mirror part of the game yet. That's the one with no checkpoints. And I don't think that I'll be able to, at least not the third (or sixth) level, it's simply too hard. I've beaten games like Megaman, VVVVVV and Metroid 2, but at least they have save systems all the way through. Hopefully I wont miss too much by not beating the mirror part, it seems to be the same as the normal part, but there might be surprises. Hopefully I'll find out one day.\n\nThe next thing I do after writing this review is finding that soundtrack. I've heard that it's made by Bjørn Svin, who's a really cool Danish electronic musician, but it's hard to find any info on it. The game is Danish, I'm sure of that. It's made by some of the guys from Playdead behind Limbo (which is also a seriously amazing game). And one last thing: Remember to play this game with the best speakers or headphones you got in your house, it deserves it.\n\nEdit:\nThe soundtrack is not by Bjørn Svin, as I've been told. It's made by Jakob Schmid, who's also from Playdead. Here's his soundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/schmid\n\nI found this nice little article about the game that tells about the people behind it. One of the graphic designers apparently made a music video for Bjørn Svin, so maybe that's the source to the misunderstanding. Here it is:\nhttp://aiaiai.dk/blog/140-the-rhythm-based-minimalist-platform-game\n\nAnd here's a thread in which he's promised to write, when ever he is done with fine tuning the soundtrack (on the last page there's also a link to an unofficial soundtrack made by one of the commenters):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/242820/discussions/0/792924412012466475/","January 6","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeric/recommended/242820/","seeric","Seeric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeric/","1183 products in account","140 is an interesting, if exceptionally short, abstract musical platformer. Each of the three levels in 140 has a unique song which evolves as the player makes progress. This musical evolution is important as the level itself will also shift and become more alive as new beats are added; platforms will activate, blocks will shift, and deadly static will move, all to the beat of the music. For such a short game, 140 packs a massive amount of creativity and style into each of its stages and a large amount of the enjoyment to be had from 140 comes from figuring out which rules each object follows and keeping track of which parts of the environment synchronize with which parts of the song.\n\nWhile by no means the hardest platformer out there, 140 nevertheless often asks quite a bit of the player, so I am rather happy to be able to say that the controls are not only simple and intuitive, but very precise. Visually, 140 is a game composed of simple geometrical shapes and its various color schemes can at times be outright ugly, but the graphics never feel lazy nor mundane. This is a game for which a specific aesthetic was chosen and repeatedly pushed to its limits in various ways without being outright broken and, at the end of the day, the simple shapes and often-ugly color schemes compliment each other and work surprisingly well.\n\nAlthough I have mentioned it in passing previously, the biggest downside to 140 really is its length. Players can beat the game in under an hour and, after that, there's just not much reason to go back. Yes, there are mirror mode stages with no checkpoints which unlock after beating the game, but reversed versions of the original stages with new color schemes are not particularly interesting and the lack of checkpointing (which is quite well-placed in the normal stages) feels like a lazy way to inflate difficulty and mostly just results in frustration and boredom. 140 is definitely a game which values quality over quantity and, while it has quality in spades, it's a bit tough to recommend a game which is quite this short for its normal asking price of $5.\n\nBrevity aside, 140 is ultimately a wonderful and wonderfully creative game which fully embraces the beauty of simplicity in every way it can.","August 28, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/242820/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/140-cub-game-review/\n\nI’ll admit it, 140 surprised me. I’ve played quite a few platformers in my time, but this… this was an experience. In a nutshell, 140 is a very minimalistic platformer set to the rhythm of upbeat electronic music. It is quite challenging at times and requires “rhythmic awareness” in order to pass the levels.\n\nGamepaly is where 140 shines. I had a lot of fun with the various platforming mechanics of this game, some of which I’ve never seen before. It’s interesting that your one enemy is this “static” and, upon touching it, your immediately reset to your last checkpoint. There was one segment where the static was forming into blocks that the player had to jump on, but, in coordination with the beat of the song playing, these blocks would shrink back to a smaller block. The catch here was that while the block was shrinking or enlarging, it would be static. This mechanic was used effectively in the third level, the last level. I did notice that the last level seemed to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, compared to the pace that the first two levels were going at. The last boss “battle” was utterly brutal to complete and required quick acting, or you’d have to restart the fight. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the difficult should have been panned out better over the three levels of the game, instead of throwing it all into the last level. The game also has another mode, which I was told is “hardcore” mode. I played a bit of this mode, not knowing what to expect. Upon death in hardcore mode, I was kicked to the main menu of the game. In order to beat hardcore mode, you’ll have to go through it all without dying. Yep, that sounds hardcore enough for me, a little too hardcore. I was unable to complete hardcore mode and quit after five or six tries. Overall, the gameplay was challenging, unique, and kept me entertained.\n\nThe graphics of 140 might turn a few people away, but I assure you, they fit very well with the gameplay. I’m glad the game was chosen to have this minimalistic style, its been my first exposure to an art style like this. The vibrant colors and the varying shapes of the player sparked my interest in the game to begin with, well, along with the fact that the music was awesome too. When idling, the player remains as a square, when moving, a circle, and, when jumping, a triangle. These shapes fit well with the task that they’re assigned to now that I think about it, square remains flat and is not easily moves, circle can roll, allowing movement, and the triangle allows for easy landing opon a surface. The background seen in the game appears to follow the beat of the music as well, which is quite nice. Overall, minimalistic graphics = win.\n\nThe sound and music in the game was very catchy, working very well with the other aspects of the game. The game even won an IGF award for excellence in audio, which was well-deserved. I believe that the title of the game is also derived from the BPM of the music playing, I found quite interesting. I’m probably going to go looking for the soundtrack after I write this, if it exists. Anyways, the audio was excellent! Nothing much to say about the controls here. I used an Xbox 360 controller during my playthrough. The game has only a few actions: move, jump, and exit. In my case, an analog stick, the A button, and the pause button. Very simple, nothing needing changing here, easy to understand controls.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pN7M00auP0","November 25, 2013","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are essentially three levels with three boss-style scenarios, which are all fun and challenging, but there isn't much more to acheive in this game. If you complete it the game, you get some optional mirror stages (with no checkpoints) to acquire all of the achievements, but after that the game is complete and there is nothing else to do. Never-the-less, I really enjoyed the way the game moved with the music.\n\nI recommend this game, it is a good one, but I don't recommend you pay full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/recommended/242820/","novalinnhe","novalinnhe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/","425 products in account","140 is a deceptively simple-looking 2D platformer, where you play as a silently morphing geometric shape attempting to collect all the shiny things and dodge all the obstacles. Pretty standard platformer fare, although the little twist on this one is that everything moves to the beat. I enjoy myself a good rhythm game - here's lookin' at you Space Channel 5 - so it's a pet peeve of mine when a "rhythm" title has nothing to show for it other than a few elements moving to a basic pulse. From the screenshots I assumed 140 would be a prime example of that, but was proven wrong almost as soon as I started the first level.\n\nThere is no screenshot in the world that can truly demonstrate how flawless the rhythmic aspects of this game are. Everything responds to the music both technically and visually, whether it's the way an object moves, how it changes aesthetically to "describe" a sound, or how the background music morphs, builds and fires off as you plunge further forward. It also offers a whole lot of rhythmic complexity, so if you were expecting to breeze through by counting 1-2-3-4 then brace yourself - we're talking tied notes, dotted rhythms and syncopation with this one. Finally, I especially loved some of the fantastic audio-visual moments that this game offers up, which I won't spoil but can guarantee you'll love seeing if you happen to be musically minded.\n\nGetting worried that I'm talking about music and rhythm a lot? I wouldn't worry too much. The game is still playable if you find it hard to clap in time; it just means that certain obstacles will feel much, much harder to get through as the answer almost always involves just listening. Thankfully, the default levels come with unlimited deaths and generous checkpointing, so as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement you'll be fine.\n\nSo, the final verdict? 140 is a solid testimony to the rhythm-crossover genre, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a rhythm game. I'd also give it a try if you're just looking for something a little different to play, as I'm not sure I've ever seen a game like this before. However... the second I post this review I will be uninstalling the game and never playing it again. Funny considering I'm singing such high praises of it, right? Yeah, well - you know that little 'as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement' disclaimer I made in the previous paragraph?\n\nI have every achievement.\nNever.\nAgain.","July 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

On the surface the idea of a side scrolling platformer that goes along with the beat of the music sounds fantastic, and I was really excited to play it.\nThe unfortunate side is that because of the way the level reacts to the music, your actions and button presses need to actually be off beat with the music the vast majority of the time. This really breaks the flow of the game. I had to try platforms again and again because my brain automatically assumed my actions would need to go along with the beat, but often times that led me to my death.\nI enjoyed the music, and the visual style was pretty cool, but in the end the frustrating timing ruined it for me.","February 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

There is no tutorial but the aim is straightforward: collect small, circular objects to unlock the next stage without making contact with the static (you'll die and get blasted by a quick dubstep drop if you do).\n\nThe rhythm-synced puzzles are unique and steadily increase in difficulty as you go along. "Bosses" mark the end of each level and are appropriately challenging. There are save points before most (if not all) of the puzzles so there's no need to worry about redoing the entire level after a death; if you quit in the  middle of a level and close out of the game, however, you will have to restart the stage. The controls are simply the directional keys and the set-up options should ensure smooth play on any machine.\n\n140 is an indie gem that warrants a play by any lover of challenging platformers. Though the levels may be somewhat short, mirror mode will keep you occupied for the times those beat-'em-up/FPS/hack-and-slasher what-have-yous just won't cut it. Snap this up at half price and entertain the little masochist in you.\n\nNOTE: 140 features bright colours and quick-moving, flashing, and/or warping sequences. Anyone who may be sensitive to these sorts of things should tread with caution and do the appropriate research before jumping in.","April 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's basically a shooter with enemies popping up at the beat or standard platformers where you don't really need to pay attention to the rhythms to succeed.\nIn this game understanding of the beat is crucial for success. I for one felt truly thankful for my time as a drummer since it helped me tremendously through the harder parts of the game.\nThere is so much detail put into the puzzles where you really learn to predict patterns and movements if you listen carefully to the music.\n\nThe graphics are simplistic but very functional. It's very clear how you must traverse the obstacles to proceed.\n\nMy only gripe as it stands is that it's kinda short.\nAlso, if the devs decide to work on a sequel, make more songs instead of just the one. Maybe 1st stage = 120 BPM, second 130 and so on.\n\nExcellent game!","April 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, it has the appearance of a passion project coded over a few weeks' work in XNA, and that's exactly why you should love it. (That's about the right origin story too, it was made by one of Playdead (Limbo)'s coders afterhours.)\n\nMore importantly than any of that fluff however, and the core of this game's experience: its audio design. It won that IGF award for good reason; the music is great, the sounds are entrancing, and everything audio is well-implemented. Collecting items, landing on platforms, and nearing the game's checkpoint-like floating objects are all incredibly unique, rewarding, and expertly-crafted. The game plays well - as someone else suggested, its similarity to Bit.Trip Runner ends at the conceptual: this game gives you more control, and feeds back more information to you. You really do have more control, to take things at your pace, to screw up as you will.\n\nThe game is short and sweet and well worth the $2.50 I paid. I figured it was going to be quite short, but I've already spent quite a decent amount of time with it (more than my short attention span tends to spend on games) - if you like electronic soundscapes and platformers, you'll like this one.\n\nIt is very minimalistic/barebones however.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/courtneyaverett/recommended/242820/","courtneyaverett","Clarity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/courtneyaverett/","24 products in account","If you’re into games that require simultaneous focus on rhythm, time, patterns, direction, then this is for you. If you’re into deep medi or minimal dubstep, then 140 then definitely check this out. As someone who listens to and mixes a lot of minimal dubstep, I didn’t even have to try to figure out what 140 means. The music basically has a meditative, dark, bassy, and psychedelic feel to it at 140 beats per minute. I highly recommend **subwoofers, quality speakers with great bass**, or quality headphones during gameplay. I always cranked up the volume to really feel the music.\n\n140 really forces you to exercise different parts of your brain simultaneously. That’s what made it tricky yet interesting for me. I had to focus on direction, shape, timing, and sometimes memorization all at once. You basically have to find equilibrium in concentrating on all of those aspects.  However, it is easy to accidentally focus on one thing just a little too much. You’ll see what I mean when you get there. That last segment of the third level almost drove me insane!!! I literally felt like I was going crazy with those rotating arrows. I probably was. I loved and hated it at the same time. It felt psychedelic!\n\n140 was developed by the same designers of Limbo. I sort of had the feeling due to the similar simplicity of the visual design, which I really admire This balances well with the simplicity of sound. 140 is a two-dimensional design comprised of a circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. The developers kept color theory in mind, as different colors or lack of colors went well with the tone of the music. The colors are flat, but chosen in such a way to balance well with the music.\n\n140 is more complex than it appears. The deeper you get into each level, the more rhythmic concentration is required to complete each level.  If you’re musically inclined and have appreciation for minimal dubstep, you’ll probably really enjoy this.\n\nAs you progress through the game, so do the rhythmic sounds. They begin with a simple low frequency samples, then get layered with more beats as you encounter different segments of the levels.  Within these segments, there are various obstacles that animate to the beat of the rhythm.  As the beats layer, so do the obstacles. This really kept me locked in.\n\nHowever, this is also what made it tricky. As I was feeling the sounds, I had to stay focused. I’ll be playing and sometimes I wanna start dancing or nod my head to the beat. There were times when I had briefly memorize a beat or move in a rhythmic manner to overcome obstacles. This is why I think it’s helpful if you’re musically inclined and/or you pay close attention to the sound of music. The slightest wrong movement can throw you off. So it’s important to really listen and observe what the obstacles are doing and where you’re located. Also pay attention to patterns.\n\nAlso, as someone who gets distracted easily, I really had to force myself to stay concentrated. I actually think this is a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their focus.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThink twice before completely exiting the game in the middle of a level (holding ESC). You will only be able to start from the beginning of the level(s) once you completely escape. So if you’re playing Level 2 and you escape in the middle of Level 2, you will have to start at the beginning of Level 2 once you reopen 140. However, it the levels after you surpass each one (there's only 3 levels).\n\nLuckily, you can continue after your last checkpoint if you didn’t completely escape.\n\nYou also cannot pause.\n\nAs annoying as that was, it kept me playing and forced me not to give up so easily. This has really sharpened my concentration and I hope they release more levels or some kind of addition.\n\nLet me know how it goes if you guys start playing. It's a fair price too.\n","November 7, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With no other objective other than moving a "shape-shifting" geometric figure (a circle while moving, a triangle while jumping and a square while standing still) through rhythm-based obstacles, it can still be quite a challenge. Although the game's learning curve is pretty smooth, it crosses a rather wide spectrum of difficulty: starting stages are pretty basic, but the "boss battles" border the   Nintendo hard [tvtropes.org]! Added to that is the special mode, unlocked after beating the main game, which requires you to beat the stages in a single take -- failing takes you back to the beginning, regardless of the checkpoints you may have reached during your run. To compensate for that, the soundtrack is a pretty driving mix of ambient electronic music and dubstep, getting you pumped up to not give up.\n\nIn fewer words,  140  is a clever side-scrolling platform puzzle with elements of rhythm-based games and even a hint of  Space Invaders -like gameplay; an odd combination that works impressively well.","December 19, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)\n\nThe game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!\n\n\nAs usual, presentation!\n140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical "2D retro pixelated graphics" that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style.\nIt never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly.\nI really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole "atmosphere".\n\nIt's hard to talk about its music without talking about the gameplay at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.\n\nAs I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of.\nAll your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets.\nWell, how can you still make an unique game with that?\nMusic!\n\nSimilarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.\n\nAnother game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!\n\nI've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!\n\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it teaches you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse!\nSometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges.\nI never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret!\nAfter you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.\n\nEvery big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller "level", something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight.\nIt is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!\n\nAnother thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah.\nBut it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated.\nIt really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.\n\nOne nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!\n\nI could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!\n\n\nAll in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about.\nI'm really surprised about it, great little game!\nIf you're a bit skeptical of the 5€ it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.","July 21, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason for this is, that the game pretends to be auditive, i.e. learn the music by hard and know every beat when to press which button for how long, yet what it is is totally visual. I tried playing it without the music, same result.\nAs for 140, that's a totally different thing! You HAVE to count the beats of every bar, if you want to get past certain scenes. And it'll feel so rewarding, when you know every "ONE" when you have to move on and every "two AND" when you have to jump and it never fails you. The music itself is catchy, too! Only downside is, that it is a bit short, yet the mirror stages will keep you occupied for a little longer...","October 19, 2013","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's probably a great way to enter it, because it turns out it's actually a well crafted little platformer.\n\nLike many other great platformers that strike a balance between challenging, inventive, and not too long (VVVVVV, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo all accomplish this in different ways), 140 is a very nice little game.\n\nThere is a sort of rhythm component, in that the music will assist you in timing a jump or move just right with the soundtrack. But aside from that, it's just simple, clean, and nicely honed gameplay that makes this game definitely enjoyable. The jumps feel weighty and good. The responsiveness of a stop is very comfortable.\n\nThe charmingly inventive character is a great touch. A square when you're still, a circle when you're moving, and a triangle when you jump, with nicely flowing animation between shapes. The simplicity really works in favor of 140, rather than against it.\n\nThe only part of the game configuration I'm not a huge fan of, is where save-points exist. Only after you complete each grouping does the game save. I'd love to take a break and come back to the final stage for example, but I have to play the several levels beforehand each time I want to get to that level for example. Not a dealbreaker in a game of this size and scope, but annoying if you can't devote enough time to completion of a group of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe game isn't much more than a few hours (you can play it through the first three stages, then in reverse direction back through those same stages). But those are well made hours, and only the final stage is really punshing (for me it's equivalent to a mental tongue twister, which I find too frustrating to see through). I didn't finish it entirely, got to the final level, and maybe I'll try again one day, but I don't know... The remaining 90% of the game though is worth the time.","July 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/courtneyaverett/recommended/242820/","courtneyaverett","Clarity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/courtneyaverett/","24 products in account","If you’re into games that require simultaneous focus on rhythm, time, patterns, direction, then this is for you. If you’re into deep medi or minimal dubstep, then 140 then definitely check this out. As someone who listens to and mixes a lot of minimal dubstep, I didn’t even have to try to figure out what 140 means. The music basically has a meditative, dark, bassy, and psychedelic feel to it at 140 beats per minute. I highly recommend **subwoofers, quality speakers with great bass**, or quality headphones during gameplay. I always cranked up the volume to really feel the music.\n\n140 really forces you to exercise different parts of your brain simultaneously. That’s what made it tricky yet interesting for me. I had to focus on direction, shape, timing, and sometimes memorization all at once. You basically have to find equilibrium in concentrating on all of those aspects.  However, it is easy to accidentally focus on one thing just a little too much. You’ll see what I mean when you get there. That last segment of the third level almost drove me insane!!! I literally felt like I was going crazy with those rotating arrows. I probably was. I loved and hated it at the same time. It felt psychedelic!\n\n140 was developed by the same designers of Limbo. I sort of had the feeling due to the similar simplicity of the visual design, which I really admire This balances well with the simplicity of sound. 140 is a two-dimensional design comprised of a circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. The developers kept color theory in mind, as different colors or lack of colors went well with the tone of the music. The colors are flat, but chosen in such a way to balance well with the music.\n\n140 is more complex than it appears. The deeper you get into each level, the more rhythmic concentration is required to complete each level.  If you’re musically inclined and have appreciation for minimal dubstep, you’ll probably really enjoy this.\n\nAs you progress through the game, so do the rhythmic sounds. They begin with a simple low frequency samples, then get layered with more beats as you encounter different segments of the levels.  Within these segments, there are various obstacles that animate to the beat of the rhythm.  As the beats layer, so do the obstacles. This really kept me locked in.\n\nHowever, this is also what made it tricky. As I was feeling the sounds, I had to stay focused. I’ll be playing and sometimes I wanna start dancing or nod my head to the beat. There were times when I had briefly memorize a beat or move in a rhythmic manner to overcome obstacles. This is why I think it’s helpful if you’re musically inclined and/or you pay close attention to the sound of music. The slightest wrong movement can throw you off. So it’s important to really listen and observe what the obstacles are doing and where you’re located. Also pay attention to patterns.\n\nAlso, as someone who gets distracted easily, I really had to force myself to stay concentrated. I actually think this is a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their focus.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThink twice before completely exiting the game in the middle of a level (holding ESC). You will only be able to start from the beginning of the level(s) once you completely escape. So if you’re playing Level 2 and you escape in the middle of Level 2, you will have to start at the beginning of Level 2 once you reopen 140. However, it the levels after you surpass each one (there's only 3 levels).\n\nLuckily, you can continue after your last checkpoint if you didn’t completely escape.\n\nYou also cannot pause.\n\nAs annoying as that was, it kept me playing and forced me not to give up so easily. This has really sharpened my concentration and I hope they release more levels or some kind of addition.\n\nLet me know how it goes if you guys start playing. It's a fair price too.\n","November 7, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is brilliant in just about every regard. It involves jumpy shapes and procedurally generated music.\n\n\nMusic - 25/10: Yes, it's that good. The entire game revolves around the music. All the puzzles in this game are based on the fluctuations the music is going through. Everything is really seamless; if you're just listening to the audio and you die somehow, it honestly sounds like part of the song even though it's very harsh static. The music also only progresses when you do, which in my opinion is one of the best things about the game - and it always sounds so seamless when it does. And besides, the "drop" that happens when you progress to the next sequence of a stage is one of the most amazing sounds I've heard so far.\n\nArt - 6/10: The art style is a bit like Thomas Was Alone, but not quite as nice. It's basically just a bunch of rectangles and circles and triangles. Nothing much. However, there are some really tiny details, like the jump and the level progression sequence. It does have a sort of odd charm to it though, which is why I'm giving it a 6 and not something lower\n\nGameplay - 8/10: You're essentially just trying to navigate your way through a series of obstacles and static-y square things. Nothing too special when considered by itself, but when you add the music to the equation, it's phenomenal. Everything changes based on what's going on in the music, for example, platforms will start moving as a new sequence is added to the ever-changing song. Really, the only negative is that the boss battles are a bit more trial-and-error than actually puzzle based, but honestly that's not a bad thing.\n\nPrice - 10/10: At $5, this game is a steal. Hell, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay $15 for it; it's just that good. If you're still not convinced, get it on sale when it's somewhere hovering around the $3/$4 range. You'll be glad you did.\n\n\nOverall Rating - 9.5/10: This isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. The music is so much more than brilliant, and the gameplay and art style works fantastically well with the concepts it's working towards. The only downside I would say would be the shortness of it all - it only has three "stages", but they're all intuitively designed and great fun to play.","December 4, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's probably a great way to enter it, because it turns out it's actually a well crafted little platformer.\n\nLike many other great platformers that strike a balance between challenging, inventive, and not too long (VVVVVV, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo all accomplish this in different ways), 140 is a very nice little game.\n\nThere is a sort of rhythm component, in that the music will assist you in timing a jump or move just right with the soundtrack. But aside from that, it's just simple, clean, and nicely honed gameplay that makes this game definitely enjoyable. The jumps feel weighty and good. The responsiveness of a stop is very comfortable.\n\nThe charmingly inventive character is a great touch. A square when you're still, a circle when you're moving, and a triangle when you jump, with nicely flowing animation between shapes. The simplicity really works in favor of 140, rather than against it.\n\nThe only part of the game configuration I'm not a huge fan of, is where save-points exist. Only after you complete each grouping does the game save. I'd love to take a break and come back to the final stage for example, but I have to play the several levels beforehand each time I want to get to that level for example. Not a dealbreaker in a game of this size and scope, but annoying if you can't devote enough time to completion of a group of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe game isn't much more than a few hours (you can play it through the first three stages, then in reverse direction back through those same stages). But those are well made hours, and only the final stage is really punshing (for me it's equivalent to a mental tongue twister, which I find too frustrating to see through). I didn't finish it entirely, got to the final level, and maybe I'll try again one day, but I don't know... The remaining 90% of the game though is worth the time.","July 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is good dubstep thats also great game music at the same time. The game is quite minimalist though with just a title screen and level select. There is no menu, no saves and no pause.  But it turns out you dont need those things if you got good music and a game worth playing. I think some of the negative reviews might be from the games simplicity but the programmers werent lazy, they just knew what the game needed and what it didn't. The gameplay is based off obstacles that are in sync with the beat of the music. The more "in the zone" you are the better you'll be able to time your jumps and your movements. The music really makes the game and is best listened to loud enough to properly enjoy it, or at least use headphones because the music really is half the game. The game progresses in difficulty nicely, and there is a boss battle and the end of each level.

Most people don't like this game because of how short it is, but it put it this way: If somebody hears a song, and they love it, then naturally they want to hear it again. Once they're tired of the song, they take a break, then later they just might want to hear it yet again. 140 is a game that revolves around sound. It's like a song that you listen to that goes at your pace, and if it gets stuck in you head, then you (naturally) want to hear it again, so you decide to replay a level. If this goes on long enough, the game won't be short at all, it will actually last for as long as you want it too. I really enjoy this game, and the price seems just fine for me.

With no other objective other than moving a "shape-shifting" geometric figure (a circle while moving, a triangle while jumping and a square while standing still) through rhythm-based obstacles, it can still be quite a challenge. Although the game's learning curve is pretty smooth, it crosses a rather wide spectrum of difficulty: starting stages are pretty basic, but the "boss battles" border the   Nintendo hard [tvtropes.org]! Added to that is the special mode, unlocked after beating the main game, which requires you to beat the stages in a single take -- failing takes you back to the beginning, regardless of the checkpoints you may have reached during your run. To compensate for that, the soundtrack is a pretty driving mix of ambient electronic music and dubstep, getting you pumped up to not give up.\n\nIn fewer words,  140  is a clever side-scrolling platform puzzle with elements of rhythm-based games and even a hint of  Space Invaders -like gameplay; an odd combination that works impressively well.","December 19, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you’re into deep medi or minimal dubstep, then 140 then definitely check this out. As someone who listens to and mixes a lot of minimal dubstep, I didn’t even have to try to figure out what 140 means. The music basically has a meditative, dark, bassy, and psychedelic feel to it at 140 beats per minute. I highly recommend **subwoofers, quality speakers with great bass**, or quality headphones during gameplay. I always cranked up the volume to really feel the music.\n\n140 really forces you to exercise different parts of your brain simultaneously. That’s what made it tricky yet interesting for me. I had to focus on direction, shape, timing, and sometimes memorization all at once. You basically have to find equilibrium in concentrating on all of those aspects.  However, it is easy to accidentally focus on one thing just a little too much. You’ll see what I mean when you get there. That last segment of the third level almost drove me insane!!! I literally felt like I was going crazy with those rotating arrows. I probably was. I loved and hated it at the same time. It felt psychedelic!\n\n140 was developed by the same designers of Limbo. I sort of had the feeling due to the similar simplicity of the visual design, which I really admire This balances well with the simplicity of sound. 140 is a two-dimensional design comprised of a circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. The developers kept color theory in mind, as different colors or lack of colors went well with the tone of the music. The colors are flat, but chosen in such a way to balance well with the music.\n\n140 is more complex than it appears. The deeper you get into each level, the more rhythmic concentration is required to complete each level.  If you’re musically inclined and have appreciation for minimal dubstep, you’ll probably really enjoy this.\n\nAs you progress through the game, so do the rhythmic sounds. They begin with a simple low frequency samples, then get layered with more beats as you encounter different segments of the levels.  Within these segments, there are various obstacles that animate to the beat of the rhythm.  As the beats layer, so do the obstacles. This really kept me locked in.\n\nHowever, this is also what made it tricky. As I was feeling the sounds, I had to stay focused. I’ll be playing and sometimes I wanna start dancing or nod my head to the beat. There were times when I had briefly memorize a beat or move in a rhythmic manner to overcome obstacles. This is why I think it’s helpful if you’re musically inclined and/or you pay close attention to the sound of music. The slightest wrong movement can throw you off. So it’s important to really listen and observe what the obstacles are doing and where you’re located. Also pay attention to patterns.\n\nAlso, as someone who gets distracted easily, I really had to force myself to stay concentrated. I actually think this is a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their focus.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThink twice before completely exiting the game in the middle of a level (holding ESC). You will only be able to start from the beginning of the level(s) once you completely escape. So if you’re playing Level 2 and you escape in the middle of Level 2, you will have to start at the beginning of Level 2 once you reopen 140. However, it the levels after you surpass each one (there's only 3 levels).\n\nLuckily, you can continue after your last checkpoint if you didn’t completely escape.\n\nYou also cannot pause.\n\nAs annoying as that was, it kept me playing and forced me not to give up so easily. This has really sharpened my concentration and I hope they release more levels or some kind of addition.\n\nLet me know how it goes if you guys start playing. It's a fair price too.\n","November 7, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is brilliant in just about every regard. It involves jumpy shapes and procedurally generated music.\n\n\nMusic - 25/10: Yes, it's that good. The entire game revolves around the music. All the puzzles in this game are based on the fluctuations the music is going through. Everything is really seamless; if you're just listening to the audio and you die somehow, it honestly sounds like part of the song even though it's very harsh static. The music also only progresses when you do, which in my opinion is one of the best things about the game - and it always sounds so seamless when it does. And besides, the "drop" that happens when you progress to the next sequence of a stage is one of the most amazing sounds I've heard so far.\n\nArt - 6/10: The art style is a bit like Thomas Was Alone, but not quite as nice. It's basically just a bunch of rectangles and circles and triangles. Nothing much. However, there are some really tiny details, like the jump and the level progression sequence. It does have a sort of odd charm to it though, which is why I'm giving it a 6 and not something lower\n\nGameplay - 8/10: You're essentially just trying to navigate your way through a series of obstacles and static-y square things. Nothing too special when considered by itself, but when you add the music to the equation, it's phenomenal. Everything changes based on what's going on in the music, for example, platforms will start moving as a new sequence is added to the ever-changing song. Really, the only negative is that the boss battles are a bit more trial-and-error than actually puzzle based, but honestly that's not a bad thing.\n\nPrice - 10/10: At $5, this game is a steal. Hell, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay $15 for it; it's just that good. If you're still not convinced, get it on sale when it's somewhere hovering around the $3/$4 range. You'll be glad you did.\n\n\nOverall Rating - 9.5/10: This isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. The music is so much more than brilliant, and the gameplay and art style works fantastically well with the concepts it's working towards. The only downside I would say would be the shortness of it all - it only has three "stages", but they're all intuitively designed and great fun to play.","December 4, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game lacks any screen like options or level selections for the levels you beat from a previous time.  It does have checkpoints within levels, which is always helpful with jumpers where death results from missing a platform in a jump.\n\nDid like the overall feeling of the game.  Not sure it is the work of art some reviewers claim it to be, but it is a very solid action platformer. It's not as unforgiving as some in the same genre, such as Super Electronic Joy\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/244870/\n\nnor as clever in its mechanisms as some puzzle platformers like Thomas Was Alone\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/\n\nbut still holds it own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/242820/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","140 is a very "primitive" platformer, if not for the seemless implementation of the music into its level design.\nIt's great to see such a concept used this well and while simple, and very short, it's almost perfect it what it does.\n\nBeware, I beat the game in about 1 hour. After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)\n\nThe game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!\n\n\nAs usual, presentation!\n140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical "2D retro pixelated graphics" that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style.\nIt never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly.\nI really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole "atmosphere".\n\nIt's hard to talk about its music without talking about the gameplay at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.\n\nAs I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of.\nAll your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets.\nWell, how can you still make an unique game with that?\nMusic!\n\nSimilarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.\n\nAnother game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!\n\nI've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!\n\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it teaches you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse!\nSometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges.\nI never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret!\nAfter you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.\n\nEvery big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller "level", something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight.\nIt is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!\n\nAnother thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah.\nBut it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated.\nIt really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.\n\nOne nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!\n\nI could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!\n\n\nAll in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about.\nI'm really surprised about it, great little game!\nIf you're a bit skeptical of the 5€ it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.","July 21, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of just doing things in rhythm, you need to really grasp how everything going on around you ties in with the music, then move through obstacles using that understanding.  Sometimes it seems like you're not going to make it, but if you've listened well, things will fall into place right as you need them to.  140's minimalism really puts the focus on the music and gameplay as well.  You're never left wondering if you need to pay attention to something.\n\nThe only downside, as others have noted, is that it's a pretty short game. There are six levels, and the last three are basically harder versions of the first three.  It almost makes the game feel like a proof of concept, though a very enjoyable and well-executed one.  If there is ever a more developed follow-up released, I'll buy it as soon as I find out about it.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it even at full price ($5 as of this writing).

The game lacks any screen like options or level selections for the levels you beat from a previous time.  It does have checkpoints within levels, which is always helpful with jumpers where death results from missing a platform in a jump.\n\nDid like the overall feeling of the game.  Not sure it is the work of art some reviewers claim it to be, but it is a very solid action platformer. It's not as unforgiving as some in the same genre, such as Super Electronic Joy\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/244870/\n\nnor as clever in its mechanisms as some puzzle platformers like Thomas Was Alone\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/\n\nbut still holds it own.

You gotta align your jumps and movements to the beat and it's often quite challenging, but satisfying when you manage to get it done. It's really cool when they introduce new mechanics, which each produce their own sounds that align to the beat as well. Within each level, the music keeps layering and changing, and the color scheme keeps switching. Very well thought out progression in these levels. And the basic, flat geometry and simple color scheme, although barebones and minimalist, are quite beautiful to look at and see in motion. Even better with the euphoric music and how well they complement each other. It has very interesting boss fights too, unlike what I have seen in any other game. Because they match the unique stlye and mechanics of the game. It's all very abstract and minimalist, but that is exactly what is intended and it enhances the mechanics that much more. Everything is tightly and cleverly designed to match a simple vision. It's really simple, but often the most genius things are the most simple. And that is how I can go into all this detail over some squares, circles and triangles.\n\nSo 140 is a great audio and visual experience, and a fun and challenging platformer. It's pretty short though, being just 6 levels. But for the price and the experience, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out.","January 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/recommended/242820/","Lyrit","Lyrit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/","167 products in account","To simplify what I think of this game, I'm splitting it into two major paragraphs: the first about the game and its first half, the second about specifically the second half of the game.\n\n140 is definitely a simple yet charming platformer, and although some may be turned off by such simplicity, I personally find it nice. The graphics, although minimalistic, represent the playing field and hitboxes well (so you don't have any "that shouldn't of hit me" moments) and have a nice colorful vibe. 140's graphics are like abstract art, and you'll either love it or hate it. As far as sound goes, the music was very enjoyable and fit the game very well -- up-beat with a strong rhythm. After playing the game, I legitimately wanted to find loops of some of the game's music online. In gameplay, 140 is as simple as its graphics, which again may either be a plus or minus to individuals. As a straight-up platformer, I personally find 140 great: it's not too hard, but it's not too easy, either. 140's platforming definitely takes some practice, but it's nothing impossible, and you really feel like you master it as you play it. The only bit of simplicity in 140's nature that I find disappointing is its shortness; discluding the second half of the game, which will be spoken about in a moment, there are only three stages, and they can be beaten in 1 to 2 hours. Although they're long and unique from another, I still feel like there could have been more stages.\n\nThe second half of the game is, again, a major deciding factor for what people think of this game. For those who aren't in the know: after beating the first three stages in 140, you can play the "mirror" stages. These mirror stages are literally just the first stages again except inverted (you go left instead of right, which makes no actual gameplay difference) and with no checkpoints (meaning you must do the entire stage and boss without dying once). I've always been picky about adding difficulty by simply removing checkpoints, and I feel that this second half of the game is directly on the line of what qualifies as good or bad in regards to this. I stand by my point that repeating sections of a stage that you've clearly mastered is only a time waste, and the mirror stages are definitely guilty of this; however, I have to admit that, upon beating the last mirror stage, I felt genuine excitement and achievement (Get it? Because there's an achievement...?). From the first half to the second, the game spikes in difficulty only due to the lack of checkpoints, and although it can be repetitious to redo the whole stage if you die, it is also incredibly rewarding to beat it. Even after beating all of the mirror stages, I still feel like having more unique stages would be far more enjoyable than just repeating what was already given without checkpoints; however, those with a strong urge to master the game might get some extra time and enjoyability out of the game via these stages. Otherwise, the mirror stages may feel unnecessary as an element to the game.\n\nIn total, after having beaten all of the game, I recommend 140. The only gameplay I would question is the second half of the game because of its easily repetitious gameplay (from restarting a whole stage over if you die). The overall atmosphere and style of 140 can only be praised or spited, and I, for one, fall into praising it. It was short, admittedly, but it was also sweet.","March 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/recommended/242820/","tonakai","Tonakai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/","293 products in account","Music is often used to set the feeling for a game. In horror games you can rarely be sure if what you hear is harmless ambience or the playable character's sanity (or your own) going nuts. In action games, the battle music vary from epic choirs to hard rock, but the goal is to make the player FEEL the battle - with intense and up-lifting sounds, as if something large is behind the sounds.\n\nRarely music is made for other reasons than that. 140 seeks to experiment other variations, and that it has definitely done well.\n\n140 is a rhythmic platformer game where the music guides you. It tells you how the environment warps, either for your favor or to kill you. Every time you catch one of those fleeing, round music machines and drag them to a check point, the world changes. The color theme changes, and the music gets a new addition while enhancing the already existing soundtrack. An another part of the level has now been unlocked, either by formerly static objects starting to move or you suddenly going all anti-gravity. Whatever happens, the new instrument in the concert that is 140's changing soundtrack tells you how do they work. Just don't forget that the music doesn't tell you when to jump!\n\n140 was mainly developed by a person also involved in LIMBO. While playing the game, I could really feel the fact when failing the outwardly simple yet mind-bending timing requiring platforming.\n\nThe game includes three stages with one boss for each. The boss fights are the moments where you REALLY get tested! And if after clearing the game once you still seek a challenge, you might want to try the mirror worlds, where you get only one attempt to clearing each level.\n\nIn other words and in short, despite the game being short and looking simple both graphically and gameplay-wise, it still manages to bring in fresh experiences with well thought-out design. It's a kind of a game that you have to play to understand its worth.\n\nHowever, as much as I want to blurt out fancy phrases to describe 140's greatness, it's still a short game. One can easily finish this game in one to two hours. But is that such a bad thing? I got the feeling that this game was experimental, and a well thought-out one, if I may be so shameful as to re-use my early wording. The price is also a good measurement of the game's length: the full price is a meekly $5, and every now and then I spot that it's on sale with 80 % off the price.\n\nIn short:\n- Simple yet challenging, but still doesn't make it seem like it's impossible\n- Fun boss fights that differ from usual platforming, even within this game itself\n- Graphically fluid and simple\n- The music, along with being used in a new way, is also pretty good 'n catchy!\n\nIf you thought platformers can not have anything new to offer, that everything has already been done, this game proves that there is still a lot to be done to reach that point.","October 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You gotta align your jumps and movements to the beat and it's often quite challenging, but satisfying when you manage to get it done. It's really cool when they introduce new mechanics, which each produce their own sounds that align to the beat as well. Within each level, the music keeps layering and changing, and the color scheme keeps switching. Very well thought out progression in these levels. And the basic, flat geometry and simple color scheme, although barebones and minimalist, are quite beautiful to look at and see in motion. Even better with the euphoric music and how well they complement each other. It has very interesting boss fights too, unlike what I have seen in any other game. Because they match the unique stlye and mechanics of the game. It's all very abstract and minimalist, but that is exactly what is intended and it enhances the mechanics that much more. Everything is tightly and cleverly designed to match a simple vision. It's really simple, but often the most genius things are the most simple. And that is how I can go into all this detail over some squares, circles and triangles.\n\nSo 140 is a great audio and visual experience, and a fun and challenging platformer. It's pretty short though, being just 6 levels. But for the price and the experience, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out.","January 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

It is a minimal, abstract platform game. Aside from that, it is a really cool platform rhythm game. The levels start out "simple" the music isn't too complicated. As you get to checkpoints, more complex rhythms are put into the soundtrack and these make other things happen: blocks appear and disappear, shapes grow and shrink, static fields jump, bouncy floors activate, gravity shifts. Paying attention to the music and how it affects the level is crucial to finishing. At the end of each level there is a boss fight. Each level the boss fights get more complex.\n\nOnce you have finished the game three mirror levels open up. One wrong move and you fail - you must complete the entire level without dying. And all the patterns are backwards.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowspaz/recommended/242820/","Shadowspaz","Shadowspaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowspaz/","499 products in account","This is a proper rhythm platformer.\n\nIn other mashups of "rhythm game + some other genre," the music takes the back burner. In Bit.Trip Runner (1&2), music is made by you dodging things in a static fashion. You are making the music the game wants you to make, by playing a "dodge the obstacles" running game. In BeatBuddy, the music dictates your movement, and the sound just happens around you. It's just part of the environment.\n\nBut in 140, the music doesn't force you to do anything. You don't need to listen to it to play the game, and you can move how you want. All of the obstacles, though, follow specific rhythms, set up by specific instruments throughout the music. You don't need to listen to it, or pay attention to it, or count the measures as you play. But if you hope to win, you're going to want to.\n\n140 doesn't force you into a game of Simon with a metronome. It presents to you the music, and you'll need to be deeply in touch with it to get through the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/242820/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","140 is a very short platformer game for the PC with a simple but distinctive aesthetic.\n\nStory\n\nThe game has no story.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is mostly fairly simple, but really has two modes; there is the gameplay during the levels, and the gameplay during the “bosses”.\nThe levels are all full of fairly standard platforming elements; moving platforms, “spikes/lava” which takes the form of static, and various other simplistic elements. The game does mix these up somewhat, with blocks which trigger other blocks to appear or disappear, expanding and contracting blocks which hover in place but can crush the player, blocks which temporarily turn themselves into ground which will kill the player if they touch it, and, in one level, brief, periodic periods of anti-gravity, where the player will fall up (but cannot jump off the ceiling).\nThe game is quite brief, consisting of only three levels of increasing difficulty, and checkpoints are frequent – a very necessary feature in the third, quite difficult level of the game. The player must periodically retrieve floating orbs and bring them to platforms to transform the level in order to continue on their way through it, and each time the level grows deadlier and more complicated, until they have reached the end of it.\nAt the end of every level there is a boss of sorts, though in reality they are merely segments of very different gameplay. The first one is a fairly traditional boss which shoots at the player from above and splits in half every time the player shoots it with a little hovering shooter which fires automatically every few seconds, requiring the player to time their presence underneath the boss to harm them. The second one has the player navigating through an environment which feels like they are racing down a narrowing track as an enemy whose touch means death zooms back and forth past the player. The third and final one has the player trying to defend themselves from enemies, pointing their blaster at them before they attack; as the player only has one shot per group of enemies, they have to make it count. This last one is quite frustrating as it plays heavily with interface screw, first by making it so that the blaster rotates either 90 or 180 degrees before firing (in a predictable pattern), and secondly, by shifting around the entire screen and thus giving the player only a very tiny amount of time to react. This was the most frustrating part of the game, and was a poor design choice as it felt very awkward rather than like a fun puzzle.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a very simple aesthetic to it; everything in the game is a geometric shape of some sort, and the player themselves turns from a triangle to a circle to a square depending on their movement and actions. Even the music is very simple, the game being silent at first, then gradually building up a more and more complicated soundtrack which beats in time with movements of objects in the environment.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nThe game is decent overall, but it is very short, and the third “boss” is quite obnoxious as the game experimented with interface screw in the place of interesting gameplay. On the whole the game was not terrible, but given its very short length, with the entire game likely taking no more than an hour to beat, and the frustrating final “boss”, there’s not a whole lot to recommend beyond its aesthetic.\n","November 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

The degree of col♥♥♥♥♥♥ varies by level, but most of my experience was wrought with eye strain. For a very short game like this, you don't want a headache to be your lasting impression on the player.\n\nBeneath the pain is a fairly enjoyable precision platformer. The game doesn't have any real 'puzzles,' aside from figuring out where you need to go and not flunking the jump (which happens often), but the integration of the music is the real selling point. Hitting a checkpoint adds a new instrument to the soundtrack, and a new mechanic to the level tied to that instrument, and the mechanic is then used to progress.\n\nIt's a very compact experience, taking only an hour or two and sticking closely to its minimalist aesthetic. However, the levels really drag on; there are only three of them, and if the game runs you two hours, that's about 40 minutes per level. It's not too bad at first, since the checkpoints are quite frequent and there's hardly any delay to respawning and trying again. If the game ended after the third level, with no extra content, this would be an overall positive review; however, completing the main game unlocks a set of 'mirror levels,' and the game falls apart then.\n\nFirstly, the mirror levels invert all the colors, leading to even more obnoxious color palettes than before. Then you replay the same levels, butmirrored - an interesting idea, except now death starts you over from the beginning. Of what might be a 20+ minute level. Which will end with some sort of bullet-hell boss. And good luck spacing your jumps if you're trying to defend your eyes from a painful assortment of hot pinks and sun yellows.\n\nYou need to learn these levels deeply, and practice them often, and dedicate lots of time to completing them. This is the core problem with this segment of the game: it is a 1-2 hour experience that then demands significantly more commitment in order to 'complete' it. You don't HAVE to finish the mirror levels, but if you uninstall it then, have you really "completed" the game? Since you need to complete the mirror levels to unlock all the achievements, it suggests the devs don't think you've won until you've gone through that hell.\n\nIf you are content to play only half the game, you probably won't regret it. But overall, 140 does not respect the player's time, and as a result I won't recommend it.","June 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/recommended/242820/","CoderJet","Coder Jet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/","667 products in account","This is a fantastic little indie gem, and here's why.\n\nThe game is just a simple platformer which is based around the music playing in the background. The music helps drive the player into moving and jumping at the right times, to over come obstacles. The music is quite smooth and soothing electronic tunes. Nothing too extreme.\n\nIn each of the levels, you're main objective is to go along and acquire a small floating ball, which starts to follow you after you've bumped into it. You then take it to a 'point' which then changes the music playing, and how the level looks / flows. New areas are accessible, static objects start to move and even the gravity can change.\n\nThe best part of this game, in my opinion, are the boss fights at the end of each level. Each one is well thought out, and brings a challenge to the player fighting them.\n\nIt's quite a short game, around 45 minutes to an hour, if you just want to play the base 3 levels.\n\nYou'll get a lot more time out of the game if you choose to do the 'advance' levels, which are mirror worlds of the first three, without any check points. So it's a die once, start the level again situation.\n\nWell worth the full price, which isn't asking for much in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThe levels are well planned out.\nFantastic music, fits into levels nicely.\nSimple, but effective use of abstract colours.\nFantastic boss fights.\n8 / 10, still playing.","August 27, 2014","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Minimalist abstract art and design at its best. Every puzzle is unique and rewarding. As I played I became more and more aware of the music until I was relying on it to progress.\n140 is a game with no filler. You must use everything you're given to solve the puzzles. But at the same time, this game is not your enemy trying to make you fail while you battle against it to win (like in most games e.g. your typical shooter or racing game), it is there to guide you through by teaching you as you go. When a new element is introduced in a puzzle game, so often I am just left to figure out myself what to do with it. In 140, you are subtly shown the mechanics of new elements before you must interact with them. This allows the player to always feel confident and in control. As the complexity and difficulty increased at just the right pace, I began to find some puzzles had a bit more too them than they seemed. I would have to watch as the elements reacted to the music and learn their patterns. Some of the puzzles may take you a minute or two to complete, but you are never confused for more than a few seconds. It’s the perfect mix of mental and physical skill.\nIf you’ve enjoyed games like Thomas Was Alone or The Impossible Game you will probably enjoy this.\n140/10\n","July 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

A simple indie game for simple indie people.\n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth...\n\nI've just spent an hour getting passed what I thought to be the "last" level. Turns out, I'm only half way there. But my first playthrough was an enriching experience. The feedback loop the player recieves in the form of a changing soundtrack serves as an indicator of progression, and encourages you to keep going. This background mechanism combined with levels that layer on their complexity with each checkpoint the player completes, demonstrates a subtle mastery of game design and player psycology. 140 could have gone down the route of asking the player to hunt down the next check point, hiding them in places that require a good quarter of an hour to forage for - or a couple of minutes looking at youtube videos - but teh developer's focus on "here and now" gameplay, where reflexes matter more than cunning, make the game instantly accessible and addictive.\n\n140 is neither music game nor platformer: it surfs a gorgeous in-between. It doesn't require an instantanious on-tap supply of rythmic ability like titles such as Bit Trip: Beat or guitar hero. Essentially: you can play 140, and everyone will find it wonderfully challenging and fulfilling.","November 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is an interesting premise, sort of, in the sense that a lot of the more complicated platforming is alleviated by timing your movements with the music. That's pretty cool but the developers never really expand upon this idea. The game is essentially a couple good ideas without an substance. To make matters worse, this game is incredibly easy (despite developer's claims) and very short. I beat the game in about 40 minutes with no inclination to play again.\n\nI would love to recommend this, I really would, but simply put it's a mediocre game with some great ideas that are never really executed beyond an extremely simplistic manner.

There is an interesting premise, sort of, in the sense that a lot of the more complicated platforming is alleviated by timing your movements with the music. That's pretty cool but the developers never really expand upon this idea. The game is essentially a couple good ideas without an substance. To make matters worse, this game is incredibly easy (despite developer's claims) and very short. I beat the game in about 40 minutes with no inclination to play again.\n\nI would love to recommend this, I really would, but simply put it's a mediocre game with some great ideas that are never really executed beyond an extremely simplistic manner.

Color that world with neon shades, sharp geometric landscapes and bind it together with minimalistic tech-house music. A world of stark beauty and remarkable simplicity; the player exists as a transforming piece of geometry - a square, triangle and circle altogether.\n\nThe geography of this flatland is not inert though. Environments comes to life in synergy with the music - music that is dependent on the player's progress in each of the three vistas. Can't make that jump? Well, the backing-track is probably missing an instrument; escorting a mysterious, floating orb to a docking station will add it to the soundtrack. Obstacles that were previously laying stubbornly static will come to life, rhythmically shifting all the way.\n\nGlide, jump, roll, and shoot - 140 is an auditory and visual delicacy.\n","January 4, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hell, if you know nothing about this game you'll probably enjoy it, but at the end of the day you'll be stuck with 3 (or 5, after the sale) bucks out of your pocket and a completed game that has no replayability.

Not that this is a bad thing, but for what this game presents itself to be is rather boring with little to no replay value. The gameplay is rather weak and doesn't have much to sustain the player's interest. Although it is easy to tell the angle of this game is not gameplay but through the atmoshere and music. I have to admit the biggest redeeming quality of this game is he music which is quite good, but doesn't help in the department of pulling yourself through the game. The game is very short, clocking in at an hour at most, and feels like more could have been done.

Theres no story in 140 but the game is amazing none the less. 140 consists of three stages and three reverse stages. In the game you go throught enviroments to get a ball that unlcoks a portal to the next level which changes the colour and the music of the part of the stage. The game Also has a simple art style that works. The game has boss battles at the end of each stage which all of them are a great challenge. The game also has a mirror stage that increases the difficulty and makes the game insanely difficult. Now for the bad. The game is incredibly short. Many of the extra hours are because of the tought sections of the game. The mirror stages will grant you a longer time of the game because theyre pretty difficult. Overall 140 is a fun and cheap game that i suggest you check out. 140 is a great platformer also has a great soundtrack.

It isn't worth that much, even if it is only 5 bucks. The game is fun, and very interestingly designed. I love the rhythmic levels and it was a joy playing through them.\n\nBut the game is just too short. I beat the 3 levels in something under 30 minutes, maybe? My play time since then has been the mirrored versions of those levels. The mirrored versions are literally exact mirrors of the levels you already played, so there isn't anything really new or exciting.\n\nThe only difference is that dying in the mirrored levels returns you to the main area and you have to restart the level all over. If anything, that leads to a pain in the ♥♥♥ more than fun replay value.\n\nSo, initially, the game is enjoyable. And I would recommend you try it out. But get it for as cheap as possible. Spending 5 bucks on something I beat in 30 minutes and haven't really enjoyed since left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nAgain, the time I played was enjoyable and intriguing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe40001/recommended/242820/","joe40001","joe40001","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe40001/","138 products in account","I almost never take the time to write a review of a steam game, most steam games I'm simply pleased with but not blown away, occasionally I'll write a positive review of a steam game I absolutely love. However, I don't believe I've taken the time to write a negative review of any steam game before this, so take all that into consideration when reading this review.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nForgive the caps lock but I had to be clear, this game is a very good example of what people mean when they call a game "indie" as a pejorative. Is it lazy? Yep. Is it self congradulatory? Yep. Is it overpriced and exploitative in design such that it takes a lot of time to beat just because of bad game design choices? Yep.\n\nThink what you will about "miminalism" but time and time again the indie community has shown that they believe it to mean "getting away with being lazy by calling it an artistic choice". This game uses solid colors like crazy, they aren't "beautifully rendered" solid colors, they are just solid colors. In every area of game design aside from the music (which is decent) this game cuts corners on production.\n\nFirst of all the mechanics consist of little more than basic "avoid hazards, time jumps". The hazards are a lazy static design. Honestly, this game looks a whole lot like what a game would look like if you set out with the idea of "making the game requiring the least amount of effort to make and charging the most money you could get away with". And you might suggest this is cynical or baseless, but think of this: This game does not have an options screen. You can adjust window size before playing but once you are in, you are in. Why doesn't this game have an options screen? Pretty much every game in the past 20 years has had an options screen, but for some reason this game is "above having an options screen".\n\nWhat nerve the developer must have to think so highly of this game. And now, for the coding, this game could be coded by most decent coders in a week or two. That's it! Compare that to a game like "The Binding of Isaac" a game with so much more depth and variety that most programmers couldn't even code or imagine. And take note, both games cost the same amount. That's the biggest insult is the price point. This game has THREE LEVELS. That's it, and how does the developer pad out the game with "additional content"? He adds THE SAME THREE LEVELS again but with the X axis inverted on the level.\n\n"Mirror mode" is acknowledged as incredibly easy to do, it's one line of code most of the time, inverting a level can be done in under a minute, it is absurdly easy, that's why some games have it as a "cheat code". Here, the almighty genius of a developer thinks so much of his game that he thinks these 3 inverted levels without checkpoints constitute "new levels".\n\nWhat really irks me though is that somehow some people seem to be buying into this game. Read the reviews, I can't wrap my head around it, are we really such sheep that this passes as a quality 5 dollar game? I can't imagine all those reviews are real, I don't want to believe I live in a world where so many people could be such suckers. This guy is selling the video game equivalent of snake oil and people are gobbling it up.\n\nTo everybody who loves this game, I have a suggestion: You can play games of superior quality like this online FOR FREE, google kongregate or newgrounds, or google some game jam like ludum dare where people make games in literally 3 days and the top 200 entries for any game jam will be better (and less lazy) than this game. AND they will be free. I know for a fact that this developer has made more than enough money scamming people with "minimalist" game design. The least he could do if he was going to be a lazy game designer is make it pretty. LIMBO is a pretty unremarkable game gameplay-wise, but at least it looked like the art took more that 2 seconds to make.\n\nBy this point I'd estimate most people have tuned out this review because it's quite long, but I had to make it and I had to make it long because I feel that passionately. Most of the indie game design community are very kind and selfless people they want their audience to enjoy their game. Here is the most damning thing about this game, and I truly believe it:\n\nI don't think the developer cares if you like their game, only if you buy it.\n\nI truly believe that, I got this game on some hefty sale and I still feel like I was ripped off. There are so many games of this and better quality online for free, this game has no art production value, very little innovation, and ONLY 3 LEVELS. It's a platformer with no art assets and only 3 levels that costs 5 bucks. Do you think a developer so selfish as to try to peddle such a scam of a game deserves any of your money?\n\nPlease do not buy this game, if for no other reason than to teach developers that they should care about their audience and not take advantage of them. Keep the indie community a better place by supporting good developers and not giving money to lazy exploitative developers such as this one.","June 14, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The music is just straight up bad, and minimalism is used as an excuse for glitchy lo-fi tunes. In a good music based platformer you should feel like everything is moving naturally, and you should be moving in time with the beat. This game has you pausing to wait for a platform to reset constantly. And if you're a nanosecond off you will die.\n\nThe game also has 3 boss fights, each one more frustrating than the last. 1 is a bullet hell shoot, except you can only move slowly and jump, 2 is dodging an enemy that moves about .3 seconds before the beat, and the last one is like a rhythm game where you shoot in four directions...except that your aim moves away from where you are shooting ON PURPOSE, in addition to your targets moving at total random.","January 3, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

You can cover the three levels in an hour, after which you can attempt to do them in mirror mode w/o checkpoints. This is the real test because when playing the levels for the first time, you can die as many times and therefore the importance of keeping the beat/rhythm may be lost on you. But when you play the levels in mirror mode, where every death sends you to the START of each level...you will learn how important keeping the beat is.\n\nIt is fairly priced for what it's worth.

But I would advice anyone, who says they're gamers, to just forget those preconceptions and pick this gem up.\n\nYeah, I won't lie to you, the game is pretty "short" (about 1 - 3h, depending of your experience with platformers), BUT the reason why I put the word "short" inside quotes is, that this game is just pure desing masterpiece from the very beginning to the end. Shortness of a game is sometimes very relative and this is one of those times. When you have a game, that offers entertainment on this level all the way, you really can't put the concept of "how long it takes to beat it" on a high pedestal. Quality over quantity. Even the minimalistic visuals make a lot of sense, when you play the game. It just looks like a beautiful union with the stellar soundscape, that play a huge role in the game, and the damn awesome level design.\n\nI won't spoil anything, I just want people to experience this gem on their own. Put the headphones, and your gameface on, and enjoy. Totally worth the money. This one here is the real deal. I have absolutely nothing in my mind, that I would change in 140.","November 29, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half the time, you're waiting for blocks in a silent spot, hearing the same boring sounds just to get to the next check point. When the beat starts to finally pick up though, its boss time. The bosses were the best thing about the game, everything else was just a waiting game.\n\nThe first boss was pretty fun, not going to lie.\nThe second was a let down. A great big let down.\nThe 3rd boss could have been way better, but it was at least enjoyable after the first round.\n\nPeople say the soundtrack was great, but there really isn't much of one.\nI do understand that the game is a minimalist type, so I wasn't expecting too much, but was at least hoping for more of a musical experience.\n\n5/10 in my opinion.","November 29, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As others have mentioned, it has a certain novelty to it, with the combination of rhythm game and plaformer mechanics.  The difficulty between level progression and boss fights can be rather severe, particularly on level 3, but it isn't insurmountable by any means.  That said, the game is very short and light on content.  If you can pick it up during a sale or bundle for a buck or two, you might want to pull the trigger, but there probably isn't enough here for most gamers to feel that they got their money's worth at full price.","August 26, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me exactly an hour to complete. If you ever see this game on sale, you might as well get it. But I'm not convinced I would spend over 8 cents a minute to play this again.\n\nI like rhythm games a lot, and the idea of a rhythm platformer is very attractive to me. One major con of 140 is that, although the trailer tells a different tale, there is minimal emphasis on rhythm. Though it seems odd to say that about a rhythm game, it's true; the designers spent more time on style, and not enough on functionality and creativity. The second boss, for instance, not only had no rhythm, it was easier without the music. This should never be true for any rhythm game: there should be an emphasis on rhythm.\n\nGameplay is fun at times, tedious at others. It's quite easy, most of the time. To be honest, it's quite forgettable. The third boss is amazing, and the first one isn't that bad, but anything in between failed to excite me.\n\nThe appearance of the game, holistically, is nice! I really like the minimalist feel. The controls, as well, were simple and nice.\n\nThe designer probably considers the three secret achievements, which can be gotten by going through a mirror-mode version of the levels without dying ever, as "replay value". I have absolutely no incentive to play it this way, and neither did almost anybody else. There's no denying that the game is too short, and it has no replay value whatsoever.\n\nIf you're looking for a good way to spend an hour, money isn't an object, and you like platformers, look no further: 140 is for you. If you're anybody else - you want to spend a longer time, you like rhythm games, and you want to get your money's worth? Don't buy it.","August 29, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Generally these features come in the form of timed jumps and moving to specific beats given by the background tracks.\n\nI personally found these concepts unique and enjoyable but what let the game down for me was its lack of content. There are only three 10-20 minute levels (six, if you include the inverted levels) and there is a disturbing lack of instructions or information about anything going on when you begin the game (to be fair though the goal is easy to pick up once you get started).\n\nIn terms of story, well... there is none... but the gameplay and audio are the two aspects in which this game shines. You can tell that the musician that produced the upbeat soundtracks and catchy sound effects spent a lot of time perfecting it for the game.\n\nThe controls are quite smooth and handle well, this makes the difficult parts of levels somewhat more tolerable (especially the bosses).\n\nIn terms of replay value, you have the opportunity to play the three original levels again without checkpoints for a real challenge but apart from that there isn't really anything else to do in the game.\n\nI would suggest getting this game if you feel like something different from your average platform game and have a decent hour or two to spare but apart from that I would give it a miss. I feel bad about rating this game negatively but I felt it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading about the game before I installed it.\n\nRating:\n\nStory = N / A\nGameplay & Controls= 3/5\nGraphics = 3/5\nAudio = 4/5\nReplay Value = 2/5\nDifficulty = 3/5","December 9, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People have different tastes, of course, but for lovers of puzzles and those who don't mind a bit--only a bit because this game isn't THAT difficult--of mental workout, 140 is a winner. Screens are simple, colorful--you might even wanna snap a couple of them and use them as wallpapers on your HD LCDs (I did)--and reverberate with pulsating beat music. Game's beat music is the key to way forward, because you will need to time your moves in rhythm with these beats. Puzzles are intelligently crafted and made me laugh in amazement when  I figured them out. There are, in total, three levels, and at the end of each level, you are challenged with a boss screen. The third level, however, has two boss screens, the last one of which is a disappointment since it is solvable with a fixed sequence of key presses however many times you play it. I like this game in particular above many other puzzlers as it doesn't test you on how fast you are at your keyboard, but instead challenges your patience and alertness by offering you unlimited time for each puzzle piece. 9/10.","September 14, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not be less sceptical about this game before I got it but after playing through the game (I play offline so my play time seems short) I can reccomend this game highly. The mechanic of puzzle platforming to the beat of the music seems very gimmicky but its used to great effect. The change in beat and varying puzzle mechanic keeps the game fresh even to its later levels. Some of the puzzles are a bit tricky but what good puzzle platformer doesn't have hard sections to challenge your skills? Pick this game up for a short entertaining time that you will definitely enjoy.","August 22, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically the same as "The Impossible Game", in the sense that it's a aesthetically minimalist platformer in which gameplay is based upon rhythm, although you actually get to control your minimalist avatar.\n\nSo you'll jump your way through 3 levels based on the background music plus 3 bossfights. While the bossfights can be quite challenging, the rest of the game is fairly easy, although I imagine that the 3 additional stages where you have to get through without dying once can be quite challenging depending how well you can deal with rhythm, but I as a musician have no trouble at all.\n\nThe actual levels can be beaten in less than an hour which is just way too short for $5, but since I've bought it at a Humble Bundle sale for $0.33 I can let that slide. Still I feel that for what it is, it could've easily been a free flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's just so incredibly insubstantial, there's no narrative to engage you with, just raw gameplay that while competently executed in the end becomes somewhat repetitive since there's really no incentive for me to play it again and again. Stuff like FEZ at least had a kind of atmosphere that you can soak in based on its art and music where you can just simply leave it running, look at it and relax, but 140 doesn't offer the same appeal. And the reason I bring up FEZ is because there's actually a quite lengthy part of that game which is also based on timed jumping and rhythm, but it is enhanced by the rest of what the game can offer.\n\nSo in summary, it's one well executed idea that can be beaten in less than an hour for $5. If you feel that justifies the cost then go ahead, but I can say I'm glad I waited for an opportunity to get it cheaper because I would've felt ripped off at its regular price.","August 22, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is pretty decent, a dubstep kind of beat to it. Now, I don't really care for it but because this is a sound-based platformer, it fits in strangely. It feels like the game, "Thomas was Alone," in a way. You control a square, which turns into a triangle when you jump, going through levels to the beat of the music. For the time playing, you will probably enjoy it. But that's the problem, for the time that you play it. This game is extremely simple, I've only played for almost an hour and I've beaten the game. Now, the other problem is when you beat a level. The only things which this 'character' can do it move left, right, and jump. At the end of every level are bosses which kill you in one shot. It's trial and error but someone takes the fun out of it when you get it right. It just feels out of place. This game is also 5 bucks and for how long you'll play it, I don't recommend it. To wrap up, this game has a lot of potential, being a simple game which can bring you delight while you play it. Maybe for a sale or on a bundle, otherwise, stay away from this game, just 5 dollars you could've spent on something that would hold your time for longer.","July 12, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character is a small square while sitting still, triangle whilst jumping and a circle while moving. You intereact with the enviroment around you that reacts on the current tempo of the music. There's several tricky obsticles that will keep you dying and dying again until you master it, only to be launched into another tricky tempo puzzle. There's checkpoints sprinkled throughout each level so you don't have to worry about having to start all the way over like "The Impossible Game" (PC or xbox 360 arcade)\n\nIt took me around an hour to complete, and then if you decide to replay the game completely flips causing you to go from right to left and without checkpoints... so there's a little hardcore mode for you if dare take that on.\n\nI personally wouldn't spend the current $4.99 price tag (7/12/2014) However, I picked this game up in a humble bundle and it evened out to a buck a game which I feel is worth it.

It starts out simple, but becomes very challenging as the levels progress. You play as simple shapes which change as your movements differ (i.e. run = circle, jump = triangle, stop = square). Essentially, you have to use the music as your guide to the end, as it changes with each stage, which creates more complex beats for the obstacles you are faced with to follow.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd say this game is very impressive. I was surprised that I enjoyed playing it so much, and actually wanted more after I had beat it. For something so simple and minimal, I never thought that I'd be so in love with it. I spent $5, and I don't regret a penny of that price, regardless of the length of the game.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n-Simple\n-Challenging\n-Good progression of complexity\n-Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Too short, not enough levels (~40 minutes playtime)\n\nScores:\nGameplay: 8/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nStyle: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nAddictiveness: 10/10\nOverall: 9/10","July 31, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly the closest I think I've ever played to a true rhythm platformer and that's what makes it so strong; the rhythm elements are well-implemented and the level designs use them effectively without ever unfairly. The game's honestly not too difficult to clear normally, though the reverse stages certainly present a bit more of a challenge. The bosses also tend to break the mold of the game, though they're not too challenging once you figure out strategies for them. The minimal graphic style I'm neutral on; doesn't detract from the game but doesn't add to it either, it's just there and I'm fine with that.\n\nOverall though, a neat little game that I'm glad I played.","July 25, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An offset of beat or timing will cause you to have to start back at your last spawn point, and after the first part of the game you can try to do the levels flawless and reverse.\n\n140 has good game design when it comes to learning how to play the game, and they ease you into it. There tutorial level where it teaches you how to jump and what does what, you just kind of get a vibe of what you need to do, and every time one completes a section of the level, they throw a new element at the player but show them in a nearly safe environment,  (you could still fail), how to the new element functions.\n\nThe game is simple and is easy to understand. However I have found that this game can hurt the eyes based on their color schemes and there are parts where I would fear for those whom have epilepsy.\n\nSo if you are one with such problems I suggest you Don't play this game, however if you are not a person with such problems, then by all means.

In all cases, the price is a little high - not because the game is not worth that much, but because experience-based games tend to be overshadowed by sweeping soundtracks and beautifully rendered RPG games, or FPSes which have been with us as a gaming community since the early days alongside RTSes.\n\nI might not have bought this for five dollars - heck, I didn't even know this game existed.  However, the Weekly Humble Bundle this week was an excellent time to learn it existed and to plop it into my library.  I might be biased - I produce music of all sorts for fun, and I've always had my eye on music-based games.  I also know when to say no to a game, and this was not that time.\n\n140 is not a normal music-based game.  At least, when Normal for music-based games is Audiosurf or Beat Hazard or DDR.  140 turns everything upside down to create a very simplified gaming experience that lends itself to actually experiencing the game.  In the end, a short set of gameplay sessions is what this game is meant to provide, as are most game-like experiences, though I do wish there were more levels.\n\nSo after all that, is it worth five bucks?

Let's run through:\nPROS:\n>Extremely unique and cool design, artistic choices, and animation\n>Nails "minimalism" on the head; super simple, no main menus (launching the game throws you straight into gameplay, and exiting just crashes the game)\n>Purveys a strange feeling of both relaxation and stress at the same time\n>The best kind of challenging- causes you to rage, but silently, and you still feel motivated to play on.\n>Rythmic beats that interestingly are consistent with environmental hazards\n>Super unique, awesome boss battles\nCONS:\n>IT'S SO DAMN POINTLESSLY SIMPLE.  Your character is nothing more than a shape that runs at uniform speed jumping on platforms.  I kid you not there is absolutely nothing to it.  No meaning, no unique controls or gameplay mechanics.\n>It's short.  I like nice short games, but this is a whole new level.  Steam tells me I have 1.8 hours in it, and this includes having beaten the whole game start to finish, spending 20 minutes in the "hardcore" mode*, and having replayed the first 1/3 of the entire game\n>*The only gameplay addition is that once you beat the game, you unlock a mode whereby the world is mirrored, and dying causes you to start the game all over.  Is it welcome, and adds to the challenge? Of course.  However, if it is added as an actual "feature" of the game, that is pathetic and seriously lazy.\n\nOverall, I honestly had a ton of fun in this game.  It was unique, enthralling, enchanting, and challenging.  However, this does not justify even a 5$ price tag.  If you have endless money, got this in a bundle such as myself, or are just overwhelmed by curiosity, get it.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.   However, if you're only mildly curious and don't care too much, don't bother.  You'd regret wasting your money.\n\nTL:DR; 6.5/10, pretty great, but not go-out-of-your-way-to-play great.","April 14, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But truthfully, it means that you are able to shapeshift into 3 different kinds of shapes: Square, Triangle, and Circle.\n\nYeah I dont f***ing know.\n\nTHE REVIEW-\n\nEverything this game has to offer is given through powerful musical tunes in the background. All of the enemies (obstacles) are presented with unique consquences to bypass. If you fail, you may get mad. If you fail more than once after failing prior to the second time, you will be prone to ragequitting.\n\nThe beats are solid and energetic, as well as the entirety of the game. One thing that may ♥♥♥♥ off many players who dare challenge their minds to this near-impossible work of art, is the frequent need to have a long walk from your last checkpoint. While in mid-game, checkpoints become more subtle and unreasonably missing- as to add more difficulty to the hand-sweating completionists' necessity to quit.\n\nRemember, even if a game like this pisses you off most of your journey into it-\njust remind yourself of those hand-sweating completionits who have to go through the whole game spending 5+ hours on it, regardless of its length/duration.\n\n***8/10***\n\n-Hand-Sweating Completionist","April 3, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control a square that turns into a circle when moving that turns into a traingle when jumping. Much like being bored in geometry class, you move these shapes around in what can be considered a doodle of a world. There is music playing that, spoiler-alert, tries to hypnotize you in order to make you move your triangle-square-circle hybrid to the beat. As you run, gun and jump through this elaborate world, you start encountering evil staic whose only goal is, much like in a real-life geometry class, to make you pay attention and stop doodling. There is also a hardcore mode where failing once makes you restart the game from the beggining instead of at the checkpoints as usual. I find this mode to be a bit insulting as in real life you do not get second chance, so it is in my humble opinion that in hardcore mode if you die once the game should auto uninstall and you should get a steam badge saying you are a failure, once again to keep up with how it is in real life.

It's short and sweet for someone who's familiar with rhythm, and an enticing challenge for those who aren't. I fall into the latter group. I've never been musically inclined myself, but the concept is spectacular and beautifully executed. The background is comprised of sound bars that aren't just for show; they really do reflect the behavior of the music, which is an integral part of the game.\n\nThe main objective as a platformer is to retrieve orbs that, for solidarity, I'll call beat orbs. These orbs can be deposited in various parts of the map in subwoofer-esque circles in the floor to add a new beat to the music and influence the behavior of the map. Indeed, there are far too few visual ques(The fact that it's minimalistic is just a bonus) for you to be able to succeed without training your ears to the music. Every little action produces a sound just like in real life, and bringing yourself in tune with these intermingling sounds and focusing on individual sounds are the key to success. I won't say similar things haven't been done before (See: Devil's Tuning Fork[www.devilstuningfork.com]), but never have they been done quite like this.\n\nNormally I'm very critical of anything with less than three dimensions, call it a character flaw if you must... but this game does something that simply can't be done in 3d and for that I applaud this game.\n\n\nI also recorded my experiences with the game if you'd like to see what you're getting for your money.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79avp3FqxxY\n","September 23, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a shape which changes forms based on what action you're doing. If\nyou're running, you'll be a circle, if you're jumping you'll be a triangle, and if you're idle you'll be a triangle. This game's visuals\nand sounds are a major part of the game's mechanics, which is interesting and relatively original.\n\nThe game begins quiet and very simple, but as the game progresses it throws more and more mechanics at you, until you reach a point where the game is extremely tense and a bundle of fun at the same time.\nThroughout the short campaign you will experinece 3 chapters, each with a unique boss at the end. At this point the game becomes less of a platformer and more of a bullethell game, as you crazily dive from side to side trying to dodge the mass of  bullets flaling across the screen.\nThe major fault with this game is that the campaign is far too short, barely lasting an hour. Which leaves you just getting started with the game by the time you're asked to pack up and leave.

Honestly the closest I think I've ever played to a true rhythm platformer and that's what makes it so strong; the rhythm elements are well-implemented and the level designs use them effectively without ever unfairly. The game's honestly not too difficult to clear normally, though the reverse stages certainly present a bit more of a challenge. The bosses also tend to break the mold of the game, though they're not too challenging once you figure out strategies for them. The minimal graphic style I'm neutral on; doesn't detract from the game but doesn't add to it either, it's just there and I'm fine with that.\n\nOverall though, a neat little game that I'm glad I played.","July 25, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An offset of beat or timing will cause you to have to start back at your last spawn point, and after the first part of the game you can try to do the levels flawless and reverse.\n\n140 has good game design when it comes to learning how to play the game, and they ease you into it. There tutorial level where it teaches you how to jump and what does what, you just kind of get a vibe of what you need to do, and every time one completes a section of the level, they throw a new element at the player but show them in a nearly safe environment,  (you could still fail), how to the new element functions.\n\nThe game is simple and is easy to understand. However I have found that this game can hurt the eyes based on their color schemes and there are parts where I would fear for those whom have epilepsy.\n\nSo if you are one with such problems I suggest you Don't play this game, however if you are not a person with such problems, then by all means.

The music is pretty decent, a dubstep kind of beat to it. Now, I don't really care for it but because this is a sound-based platformer, it fits in strangely. It feels like the game, "Thomas was Alone," in a way. You control a square, which turns into a triangle when you jump, going through levels to the beat of the music. For the time playing, you will probably enjoy it. But that's the problem, for the time that you play it. This game is extremely simple, I've only played for almost an hour and I've beaten the game. Now, the other problem is when you beat a level. The only things which this 'character' can do it move left, right, and jump. At the end of every level are bosses which kill you in one shot. It's trial and error but someone takes the fun out of it when you get it right. It just feels out of place. This game is also 5 bucks and for how long you'll play it, I don't recommend it. To wrap up, this game has a lot of potential, being a simple game which can bring you delight while you play it. Maybe for a sale or on a bundle, otherwise, stay away from this game, just 5 dollars you could've spent on something that would hold your time for longer.","July 12, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character is a small square while sitting still, triangle whilst jumping and a circle while moving. You intereact with the enviroment around you that reacts on the current tempo of the music. There's several tricky obsticles that will keep you dying and dying again until you master it, only to be launched into another tricky tempo puzzle. There's checkpoints sprinkled throughout each level so you don't have to worry about having to start all the way over like "The Impossible Game" (PC or xbox 360 arcade)\n\nIt took me around an hour to complete, and then if you decide to replay the game completely flips causing you to go from right to left and without checkpoints... so there's a little hardcore mode for you if dare take that on.\n\nI personally wouldn't spend the current $4.99 price tag (7/12/2014) However, I picked this game up in a humble bundle and it evened out to a buck a game which I feel is worth it. So if you see this on sale, or on a humble bundle pick it up if you think it's the game for you.\n\nAll in all I would not recomend to this game if you're prone to headaches, seizures, or motion sickness. Also would not recomend this game to anyone who hates super meat boy and the impossible game.","July 12, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really don't know which way to go with it.\n\nLook, this is a flash game. It has gorgeous visuals and sounds but it is still a flash game. This is okay though. I am absolutely a million times behind small time indie developers getting a more minimalist yet heavily polished experience onto steam so they can make some money and start off, even if the whole experience feels like a flash game. An example of this done right is Antichamber. It has the most blindingly shiny polish ever and it has length to boot. 140 has....well it has the polish at least.\n\n140 is a moderately challenging platform game. Sadly though it only has 3 very short levels and it can be completed within a lunch break. Now you may be thinking that this might be a Nintendo hard game that makes up for its short life span with complicated levels, and really the levels aren't that hard at all, in fact the game doesn't really start to show its teeth until the third and final boss fight, and that's only because I'm completely thick and it took me a while to get used to the switch of gravity. I expect with practice you could probably speed run this without glitching in 25 or so minutes.\n\nThat is not to say that this is bad, by no means at all is it bad. Were it a free flash game it would be up there in most peoples top 10s. My only real complaints is the hit box seems to be a little bit out.\n\nYou see this is a platformer with static areas that will kill you and push you back to the last check point. There are no enemies to speak of which makes the experience feel a little lonely, rather the environment reacts with the music in the background which means that you have to get into rhythm with the sound track in order to progress which makes a very nice experience. The graphics are very simple and programmer arty which is fine with me. I see this as a very clever way of doing your first steps if you know a little about code but don't have the resources to hire a team. However everything is incredibly blocky but its stylistic, I am kind of on the fence for graphics. The hit detection seems a little unfairly sided to the static too, resting against a wall that suddenly changes will kill you, its only a pixel but you should really give the player the benefit of the doubt in most cases.\n\nWhen you finish the game you can play a hard mode version of it, sadly though all the stages just go from right to left instead and they removed the check points. Not really worth much but at least its there, might add another hour or 2 to the game if you want to get your moneys worth. I would also like to point out that this game runs fine on low graphics for me but was a bit slow on high with my native res. I personally could not tell the difference and as its just 2d squares coloured I don't really see how you could up or lower the graphics, my rigs a little old now but it might be something for you to look out for.\n\nAt time of writing the game is £4 on steam and when I give my rating and recommendation I have to take that into account. Now remember I like the fact that these smaller flash type games are getting on steam, they are good fun little games, but they need a little bit more than what this offers and in this case its length. As I say, were this a freebie on newgrounds it would probably be getting an 8 or a 9 but as it stands I can only really give it a 4.\nDon't take that as it being crap though! This score is just relative to its price. Make sure that you do play it if its in a bundle and you own it. But unless you really really really love the music/minimalistic genre you might want to wait until its a steam sale for at least half price or you might feel disappointed.\n\nRemember 4/10 just means its below average, it doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. You may feel differently and I would love to hear your reasonings. Feel free to comment :)","July 13, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is very good and changes with your surroundings. Also the surroundings of the level change as you progress through it. You really have to listen well to solve some of the puzzles. The last puzzle is really frustrating because you have to anticipate what is happening with your "character" by listening to the music. The game is very minimalistic and colorful, not much to distract you from the actual platforming.\n\nI had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles in this game. It takes about 1.5 hours to finish this game. After that there are some achievements to gain. So i'd say 5 euro's is a good price.

Instead of rushing through (which will certainly result in several deaths), most sections of all the levels almost REQUIRE you to pause and wait for the path to become clear. In some ways this is enjoyable, as it emphasizes the mental reasoning over twitch reflexes, but it can also come across like driving down a highway and hitting every light red; even if there is absolutely no rush, it gets frustrating.\n\nEverything in the game is responsive to different track sections that the player activates to progress through the game, but the caveat to this is that while the level is perfectly in time with the music, this actually requires the character to move OUT of sync with that same music. Instead of jamming to the beat, you're really jamming in counterpoint, almost like you are actually fighting against the track. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those who have grown up on or mastered DDR, Guitar Hero, Elite Beat Agents, or even games like Audiosurf or the Bit Trip series, will find themselves getting a number of annoying flase starts when they try to move to the music and match it's timing.\n\nThe controls are smooth, and incredibly simple. This could easily translate to a smartphone, using the gyroscope for movement and a single button press to jump, or the bottom half of the screen split for left and right movement, with the entire top half of the screen as a big jump button that the thumb for the inactive direction can press.\n\nIt only has 3 levels, which are then recycled into mirror levels that strip out all the checkpoints for extra challenge. There are "Boss battles" and I really enjoyed the first and second battles for these, but the final boss battle made the mistake of increasing its challenge by making it the player's ability to control their avatar more difficult, instead of making the boss smarter, tougher, or less predictable.\n\nDue to the small size, lack of opportunity for quirky/creative acheivements (all the current steam list that are merely "beat X level" even the hidden ones) that would add to replay value, I wouldn't really recommend paying more than $2 - $3 for it, preferrably on something like a humble bundle sale that would let you get it for multiple platforms. All the same, I DO recommend it.\n\nWhat this game really needs is a mixer level, that would let the player gather together and manually activate all of the different track section they had been able to aquire. This would easily add $2 to the total I'd be willing to recomend.","May 26, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a particiularly difficult game, but provides enough challenge to keep one interested.\n\nThe only negative I really have for the game is my personal experience with the final segment. I understood exactly what the mechanics at play were and how they followed the music, but visually it just really messed with me in a way that I could not wrap my brain around quickly enough. I essentially beat it through luck and have no desire to ever go back to the game because of that. Still, I think it is unfair to dismiss the game because of one short segment that likely will not be as bad for most people.\n\n140 is worth a play, for sure. It might not be the most impressive title around, but it succeeds on every front that it sets out to, and that is far more than most games can claim.","May 27, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it a long time ago on humble when it was on sale. It took me like an hour and half to complete. It has primarily 3 levels. To complete each level, you have to pass a series of smaller obstacle avoiding courses and capture a ball-thingy and take it back to the capture point (think of it like Capture the Flag mode, where you have to capture and take the flag to a capture point, except in this case, the flag is a ball).  The game primarily relies on following rhythm to jump and/or avoid obstacles. The soundtrack is pretty awesome, I wish I could get it outside the game. All the puzzles have rhythm which once you get a hang of is a breeze to complete. Fortunately, the game does not end there. With in each level, the rhythm and obstacles change often enought to give you some challenge.\nIn all there are actually 6 levels, (3 main, 3 repeated excepted tougher levels). The difference is that the three main levels have checkpoints spanned over levels to give you a chance to resume if you screwed up. The 3 repeated levels do not have checkpoints so you have to finish them without making a mistake or you will have to start over. As I said, the 3 main levels took me like an hour and a half tops, so its a very short game in that sense.\nAlso warning, this game has colours flashing like crazy so if you are prone to having seizures or headaches, I would recommend avoiding this game. I had occasions where my head would suddenly hurt from all the bright colours flashing on screen.\nAll in all, its a decent pick if you get it on sale. Its definitely worth the hour or two you spend on it.","November 28, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a very interesting premise, but the execution is poor. The result is infuriating and tedious trial and error that saps all life from the game.

Platforms will appear, grow, shrink, move, blink out of existence, or become deadly to touch at the beat. Walls and hazards will rhythmically turn on and off. It's really very cool. You are an entrepid little monochromatic shape braving the dangers of the three levels and overcoming the bosses at the end of each. If you manage to beat them all, you will be granted an even more challenging adventure (and seriously, the last boss is a huge jerk. Like, really really mean.) I just beat the entire game (and unlocked all achievements, which was nice), and it took me about 6 hours, which is impressive considering if done perfectly, you could probably do the whole game in less than 15 minutes. I think it was worth the money spent.\n\nI love the simplicity of the game's graphics, controls, and objectives, I love the precision and timing involved, and I love the music for this game!

People have different tastes, of course, but for lovers of puzzles and those who don't mind a bit--only a bit because this game isn't THAT difficult--of mental workout, 140 is a winner. Screens are simple, colorful--you might even wanna snap a couple of them and use them as wallpapers on your HD LCDs (I did)--and reverberate with pulsating beat music. Game's beat music is the key to way forward, because you will need to time your moves in rhythm with these beats. Puzzles are intelligently crafted and made me laugh in amazement when  I figured them out. There are, in total, three levels, and at the end of each level, you are challenged with a boss screen. The third level, however, has two boss screens, the last one of which is a disappointment since it is solvable with a fixed sequence of key presses however many times you play it. I like this game in particular above many other puzzlers as it doesn't test you on how fast you are at your keyboard, but instead challenges your patience and alertness by offering you unlimited time for each puzzle piece. 9/10.","September 14, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right now. Do it.\n\n140 is a rhythm-based platformer with very light puzzle elements. Everything moves in time with the music, and you too will eventually find yourself doing the same. From timing when platforms appear or disapper to taking down "bosses" by timing their patterns, the entire game is flawlessly built around it's IGF award-winning sound design. It's not a long game, but it provides a finely tuned challenge and a genuinely well-executed experience. A must-play for any platformer fans looking for something a little different.\n\nAlso, the music is just damn catchy...","January 10, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Three levels all based around platforming and timing. Interesting first boss battle. The remaining two boss battles are boarderline dreadful, repetitive and overly difficult.\n\nThere was not much thought or effort placed in this game. If it's on sale and you really want to spend that one dollar to test this game out.

It took me a little over an hour to beat the three levels (no doing them again in mirror mode with 1 life only does not count as adding extra levels) but the boss fights were quite interesting. Art style is both pretty and pretty basic, gameplay is very simple and the difficulty is not too bad. A few parts of the game are irritating such as the final form of the final boss but you should be able to beat it in one sitting.\n\nWould buy for $0.33 and 1/3rd of a cent\n\n\nPS: Their is no pause button or ingame menu, hold ESC to close the game.","July 4, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
