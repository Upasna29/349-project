"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaguarfury/recommended/205190/","Jaguarfury","Jaguar_Fury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaguarfury/","135 products in account","I used to play Guitar Hero with friends, got pretty decent at it, until I realised it was stupid spending that much time learning to play a piece of plastic. Soon after i got bored of it and stopped playing while thinking "it's sad you can't do the same but with an actual guitar so you'll learn to play it".\n\nSo when I found out about Rocksmith, it sounded pretty much like what I had always hoped for a rythm game and I had to give it a shot, bought a boxed game version with the original cable (30€ on Ebay) and a (very crappy) 50€ second hand guitar from a brand even google never even heard of. Thing is, I'm freaking poor and couldn't afford spending 200€ on a decent guitar just to "give a shot" at Rocksmith and risk wasting it all if disapointed.\n\nSo what do i think after a few weeks of trying? Well in short: HELL YEAH! If you're hesitating just go for it, you won't be disapointed. After years of unsuccessfull attempts to learn bass guitar, i can tell for sure i made a LOT more progress in only one week of Rocksmith than in 5 years of solo learning, and that's in both Bass and guitar (since a friend brought his bass to my place to play with me).\n\nI would'nt say for sure that Rocksmith will make you a guitarist/bassist, I think you'd still have to get a teacher at some point if that's really what you want, but if you want to learn the basics, improve your skills and check out how guitar work for you, Rocksmith will give you full satisfaction. You just skip the annoying, long, repetitive hard work part to go straight to "now I enjoy practicing" part. I only wish I had something better than that crappy guitar as it's becoming an obtacle to my progress, I'm currently trying to save up for that.\n\nMy only advice: If you're buying a guitar for this game, don't go too cheap, you'll have nothing decent under about 200€ and it'll ruin a lot of the experience.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent concept\n-Very entertaining\n-Very well done overall\n-Absolutely suitable to learn\n-Handle either guitar/ emulated bass (on guitar) / actual bass guitar\n-Allow 2 players to play together\n-Impressive real time adaptation to your skills and progress\n-Tyranics Mini-games to force you progress faster on a specific technique\n\nCons:\n-Menu is a little hard to navigate at first\n-The cable have some misses, I have to unplug/replug it every now and then, not dramatic but could be improved.\n-I miss a function to alternate players quickly, instead of changing profile after every songs.\n-We can't skip the noobish tutorial when creating a new profil, why would you do that? Just... why? Some player know how to press a string, they don't need an unskippable 15min lesson on it.\n-The songs database is a little short and not very diversed (pretty much only classic rock), and the songs to buy in the shop are quite f***ing expensive, 3€ each, not allowing poor players like me to enjoy many songs they really like.\n\nConclusion:\n\nVery good game, such learning, much buy, wow.","November 3, 2014","true","50.2"," 113 of 115 people (98%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","98","113","115","13","4"

Much better. Preparing Rocksmith 2014 review too*\nAs I was looking ways to learn guitar because I bought a Les Paul recently made me look into Rocksmith, a blend of a learning software and a game that in a sort of way reminds of a Rockband or Guitar Hero but complex and versatile at the time.\nI plugged my guitar as I started the game, and it said to me after reaching the main screen I needed a Real Tone Cable as it specified in the store page. It wasn't a problem, as you CAN USE OTHER SOFTWARE to emulate the Real Tone effect so the game can recognise your guitar and then, let you play the game. You have to search the software in the internet and it makes you play outside Steam (that's why I have 5 min played, but I have played several hours) and if you want to be inside Steam while playing, you have to add the shortcut to your Library. Without the Real Tone Cable there is NO WAY to play inside Steam.\nI still recommend buying the Real Tone Cable if you have the money to, because the other software can sometimes crash in a middle of a song or event and that ruins the experience of it. If you get the latest patch of the software, it will crash once in a while.\n\nTalking about the music, the game offers a big catalog of songs (including a lot of genres like metal,classic rock, rock, alternative,etc) that grow smaller as you learn them all (but that will take quite a while though!) and a really extense one of DLC that is, in my opinion, somewhat better than the original because you buy the songs depending on your taste of music. I often buy my DLC during a sale since each song cost 1.49$ then and you can buy a lot more.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. The different modes that a song has include Practice,Perform,Riff Repeater and Techniques Used (and the great Master Mode unlocked after 100.000 points achieved in a song) The most valuable for me was the Riff Repeater, as you have 3 other options inside of it called Free Speed, Leveler and Accelerator (You can also manipulate the speed and level of the section) Those 3 help you to practice different sections of a song without trouble letting you do a first test to know your current level of playing the section, and then giving you 30 attempt to play the section at perfection. Losing lives after lives make you really try to play the section correctly!\n\nAt the end, play Rocksmith and you will have a great time as you learn the instrument you love with tons of hours of gameplay. Highly recommended for pros or starters.","December 28, 2013","true","35.0"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","59","67","0","4"

Rocksmith solves that issue by rather than starting you off playing little riffs, you go straight into full songs and it plays most of the notes for you. As you start to improve, you get asked to play more and more of the song, leading into you playing the full song yourself so from step one, it sounds musical and for someone like me, that was the incentive that I needed to play more.\n\nI'm only a week in and already I feel like I can call myself a guitar player wheras the last 15 years I've really been "a bloke who owns a guitar" Granted, I'm a BAD guitar player, but with the variety of songs and mini games keeping me motivated to play, then I genuinely feel I will become a decent one for the first time in my life.","October 30, 2014","true","22.5"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","29","29","0","0"

Rocksmith is for you. It can genuinly teach you how to play either instrument. When I first got the game I had been playing Bass guitar for 3-4 years (self taught, I've never had lessons), and was great just to play along to the songs as well as teaching me more advanced techniques like tremolo picking and slap bass. Since then I picked up a guitar and within a couple of weeks of playing guitar on rocksmith I'm confident enough to call myself a guitarist. As for graphics in this game, its plain and simple but its forgivable since your playing an instrument and not looking at the scenery. However there are a few annoying bugs in the game which can stress you f*** out and make you rage, but they are usually few and are between.\n8/10\nRecomended for anyone that can play or wants to play Guitar/Bass guitar.","July 17, 2013","true","92.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

It has something for everyone that likes to or wants to play Guitar. I have read many reviews and it seems like the thing people complain about most is what I call instant Gratifcation. This Game is a FUN way to learn or even just a Fun way to practice. But you still must practice, Playing Guitar or any other insturment for that matter will take practice. There is no such game or course that will have you playing as good as the guy in your favorite band in a matter of only a few hours. It does not exist. No Matter how you learn you gotta practice.\nThe best part about Rocksmith is that it takes that chore of practice and makes it something fun to do. I'm a 58 year old Rocker that decided to start playing again and using Rocksmith I am having a great time and learning a ton of stuff at the same time.","March 9, 2015","true","30.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CousinIt/recommended/205190/","CousinIt","\m/ Metal Head \m/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CousinIt/","179 products in account","Here's how the game mostly works.  The game requires a special cable that allows you to plug your guitar into your computer.  So just downloading the game won't allow you to play it unless you have that special interface cable.  Once you plug in and tweak your options, the basic campaign will give you the simple "Rocksmith" experience.  When you first start, all of the songs are not yet "leveled up," so you only need to play just a few notes of the melody, and probably no chords at all.  But as you play each song again and again, the game figures out which sections of the song you're getting good at, and increases the difficulty, add more of the melody's original notes.  This goes on continually, for every song you play, making the game increasingly more challenging the more you play it.  After you have played each song and "leveled them up" to maximum, you'll basically be playing the song as it was recorded.\n\nAs a "guitar instruction" method, I really think this has potential.  The early part of the game is simple enough that really ANYONE could play it, and the more you play, the more the game challenges you as a guitar player.  Each song as a few different arrangements, some focusing on lead, some on rhythm and chords.  The game is a harsh judge, so make sure you hit EVERY note, not just the ones that are easy to play!\n\nAs some who already plays guitar, I found the game was most rewarding when I was selecting individual songs to play from the game's catalogue, without bothering with the campaign at all.  I sort of knew how to play Outshined already, but learning how to REALLY play it without cheating was a treat.  I pick a song I like, and practice all the parts of it individually until I can play them all, then I try to put them all together by playing the complete song on the maximum level.  Sometimes I can pull it off, depends on the song.\n\nSo if you're already a guitar player, or you are really interested in learning to play, this game is definitely for you!  Tons of new songs to play as downloadable content.  But if you're a "gamer" who's not really much of a musician, even if you really liked Guitar Hero, I'd say this game is probably not your cup of tea.  It's more of a "musician's thing" than a game.\n\nThe game also features support for basses, and an entire campaign just for bass players.

Even when I'm frustrated with a few lines, can't quite hit the notes/chords, not fast enough to swith, the game is still fun. I assume in an effort to be nice, the game offered to let me lower the quality needed to play an event, but when I refused, I was able to play more and beat the trouble area of the song.\n\nPro's: Very engaging, learning and remembering parts of songs, challenging but varies to meet my skill by song and by area of the song. Huge amount of fun, want to play more often than I really can.\n\nCon's: Song selection - Not bad at all, but wish I could get more of the music I love in the game. Would love a tool that allowed users to add music to the game. Instructions are ok for useage of the playing features but not very good for tones and pedals/amps from what I've seen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LogicalFrank/recommended/205190/","LogicalFrank","LogicalFrank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LogicalFrank/","228 products in account","I have played guitar for many years and got this as a way to keep my chops up while not currently playing in a band. The verdict: it works! I recorded the same guitar part before and after about a dozen hours of playing the game's career mode and there was clearly an improvement in both my timing and phrasing--also the number of tries it took me to get a decent take when from like fifteen to one or two. I maybe would have seen the same result practicing along w/ a metronome but this seemed like more fun.\n\nThe one major caveat for experienced players--esp. ones like myself who have never played anything like\nGuitar Hero--is that this is entirely unlike how most people typically learn to play songs. Normally, you learn part A, B, C and D or whatever and then the solos if you want and piece them together. This just throws sort of a fake book simplified version of the entire song at you all at once. As  you get better, it starts to fill in the notes until you are playing the actual guitar part. It's strange and sometimes frustrating but if you keep plugging away you will get through and eventually you learn to read the game's kinda 3D, color-coded tablature quite well and the process becomes quicker.\n\nMy other complaints would be it can be a bit too lenient on timing and sometimes it lets you fudge chords. If you let the game's scoring dictate how you play, that can lead to bad habits. You need to show discipline on your own and play the parts correctly even if you can cheat a little and get a better score. Also, even using a relatively high end pro-sumer type soundcard (Focusrite Scarlett), there is a slight delay to the audio which you get used to but is enough to be annoying. It reminds me of playing on a digital guitar amp circa-2000, more of a feel thing but that matters.\n\nOverall though, this is a fun way to practice and I've found myself playing guitar more both with and without the game. I am just letting the game pick what songs to learn and am finding even the songs I don't like are actually fun to play. Also, like most people, practicing on my own, I tend to just practice the things I am good at and letting the game pick songs forces me out of my comfort zone. Definitely check this out if you are looking to improve your existing guitar skills.","March 24","true","32.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It is a Guitar Hero esque game you play with a real guitar, with the express intent of being a teaching aid to teach you how to play one. I picked it up for that express reason.\n\nLet me be blunt for a second, playing an actual guitar is a fairly hard thing to do, so it does take a lot of perserverance to try and play this game for long stretches. It has a nice song selection and more available via DLC. There's also multiplayer to see who can get more points, or if you want another player to be the bassist.\n\nBare in mind that Rocksmith requires an additional cable that came bundled with the retail game, so if you have any old 1/4" jack it won't cut it. You have to buy their specific cable, which usually comes with the game itself. So if you see Rocksmith on sale on the Steam store try and avoid it, unless you have the cable.","October 24, 2012","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm 52 and grew up on the likes of the Stones, Punk Rock, 80's, and even 90's tunage. Getting to play No Satisfaction by the Stones for my first song was a treat. The tutorials and videos for guitar newbs like myself are outstanding. In no time I will have the riff for Satisfaction down. I would highly recommend both Rocksmith versions for any beginner to moderately skilled guitar player. Great tool! After all these years my 4 guitars may actually see use instead of collecting dust!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lastninja/recommended/205190/","lastninja","Ninja Gaijin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lastninja/","1247 products in account","I'd always laughed at THOSE games. You know the ones. Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Triangle Hero, Tamborine Hero, Kazoo Quest, etc etc. However a year ago I finally got up to date on the Donkey Kong rhythm platform game on the Gamecube. In this, you use bongos to control attacks, movement and jumping.. you really feel like a monkey, bashing away at those bongos.But anyway, that got me thinking how cool ACTUAL music is as a control/input/interface method for gaming. Then, I found out about this.\n\nUnlike those lame Flute Quest Hero games, in this, you don't have a plastic flute or french horn or scratch turntable, but rather the actual musical equivalent. For this game, it is focused so far on guitar and bass. I am using a 7 string guitar, in a different  tuning to the game. My guitar was set up for this drop F tuning, so I was worried at first it might not like my guitar.. well, it wasn't an issue. There are stickers provided in the box that allow you to set the numbers of your frets via stickers on your guitar, so for me that was perfect, moving the frets up 2 spaces and ignoring my 7th/lowest string, I can play the game fine. Harmonics are a little tricky tho, but can always tune up for those tracks/parts..\n\nIn its essence, this is the best way to learn guitar. The best way for guitarists of any skill level to play along with other people's tunes, as well as for experienced guitarists to have a program with which to assess and further develop your existing skills.\n\nThe DLCs are great, a little bit of metal is available - Pantera, Lamb Of God and some oldies like Megadeath.. some indie rock like Pixies, but mostly this is about rock, new and classic.\n\nThere is a multiplayer aspect, but it's only local and you need to get two cables for it.. wondering if latency would increase due to extra guitar or bass input..\n\nAlso if you want to practice bass on a guitar, it has an octave pedal to 'emulate' bass on guitar. It's a pity there is no online multiplayer, but there is leaderboard scoring.\n\nNot to mention there is an updated version RS2014 coming out in rOcktober, with support for different tunings (only found standard and drop D so far in the game).\n\nThere's a lot that could come to this game and a lot that is already in there so it's hard to describe everything. I dream of one day there being mod support for this title, or plugin/addon support by community producers. At the moment however there is a large range of DLC tunes you can purchase for $3.50 USD (in my region) each.. not a bad price to own a song, but also to have the tablature and a program to help you learn it :)\n\nThe latency is a bit of an issue at first, but once fiddling with the ini or game settings, you can get something reasonable.. seems to be somewhere around 30-200ms range depending on settings, but it can be worse if you don't follow the set up guides or have a cruddy PCI/PCI-E soundcard or a slow computer.\n\nThere's a lot to recommend about this game - support it and throw away any other music games you have that involve plastic. Why learn how to play a peace of plastic when you can play the real thing..\n\nWhile it is harder to get into it, if you don't have an electric guitar or bass (obviously this is required for the game, but it doesn't mention it on the system requirements on the back, LOL!) it might be a bit of cost to buy one to play this.. but still, I think I would have learnt A LOT quicker when I started playing guitar 15 years ago, if I had've had this tool at my disposal then. The marketing is true - it IS the quickest and easiest way to learn guitar, I fully endorse that.\n\nHowever if you are not sure guitar is for you, also if you are younger or have softer hands/skin, it might be worth starting out on a cheap nylon string acoustic before moving to steel string electric..\n\n","June 23, 2013","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

There is a "suggested path", which takes you trough various venues; kinda mimicking what Rockband does: get a certain score in these events and you move on to different ones; but there is not a real career mode; everything is left to the player's will.\n\nI am not guitarist; I play guitar regularly for fun ,but far from being a person that can take a sheet and read it and play; I can do that with a keyboard, but I am not able to do so with a guitar; so I considered myself a good user which is part of the large portion of the audience for this game: from beginners to mildly good with guitar.\n\nWhen I started, I was immediately startled by the lack of whatsoever training; from what I read, this game teach you how to play...well, it doesn't. It is not different from getting a chord book and some sheet paper and start to try to play songs...there is no real teaching behind this product, as they want to market it.\n\nAs a piano student for more than 15 years (I had to stop, no time, no space no will to continue, but I still play sometimes the elec keyboard); I was expecting to start from the easy things: like a good teacher would do: teach you the various notes, start with some exercises to familiarize, and then play simple songs as rhythm or second guitar. Nothing of this is happening here...if you start to follow what the game suggest, you will start to play real songs, which if you don't know the song too well, means you just go around looking at the fret, looking at the screen, back and forth, missing most of it. IF you do well for few phrases, the game increase the difficulty, which means that throw at you some hard part to play, making you feel frustrated (after the joy of being able to finally play something), and the game scale down again to a simplier structure.\n\nWhat is missing here is the basics; you should learn how to pluck each string; once that you do it on one chord, the game should challenge you to pluck more strings, so you get the green, purple, orange colors, besides the initial red and yellow strings that seems to be used at easy level most of the time.\nThen the game should teach you how to move your hand to play clean notes with one finger; and once you are good at that, should teach you the various scale, so you can play notes without even move your hand from a specific position. Done that, the game should teach you chords, and how to transpose them on the fretboard, doing variations.\n\nI mean, that's boring stuff, and I am aware of that; but this gives you the skills and muscle memory to then learn what to play when you play a real song! I had to exercise on my own doing these things, before I was able to enjoy this program...if they market it as learning game; they may want to use it as real learning tool, and not simply force you to have to do a bunch of stuff for the sake of it, until you finally did it so many times, that your brain learned it.\n\nThis is not how you learn; at least not as most people do. You learn with practice, but you need the basics first.\n\nI bring as example, Rockband and how it teach the drum: in that case it works because you have limited variations (you have just 6 pads plus the pedal), and in the beginning, the song are arranged in a very simple way, making you feel that you got it, before you move to the next difficulty level; while here I felt totally lost when I started to play few songs, right after buying the game. It may be me, but I really dislike this "method" used with this software: is not making me play the same song over  and over again that you teach me.\n\nIf they were planning to teach each song, they would start with some exercises on the specific chords of each song; specific riff and such (which seems to be present in Rocksmith 2, I have that game too and it is leaps and bounds better than the first one); while here you have to go in the library, learn some chords; then go to the lessons and follow them, then back to some challenges to increase your flexibility and speed and then you go back to the song....all is left to the player, which is the best and worst feature of this software.\n\nSong-wise; I basically dislike 80% of them; ironically the best songs are the small ones that you play while performing the various skill challenges, written by the developers. Maybe is just my taste, but I see a lack of 80% of what made rock popular....they saved these songs for the DLC and the second game probably.\n\nOVerall; the game to me is a solid 6 out of 10; entertaining once you know the songs, and the various lessons and skill challenge are a good way to keep you entertained and trained; but for a total newbie that start today with a guitar, it feels more like a chore than a fun thing (unless he/she is totally determined to learn guitar and love and know most of the songs).\n\nThe majority seems to like it, guess you can't make everyone happy. As suggestion, skip this and buy directly Rocksmith 2 (or wait for the 3rd, which hopefully resolve the last issues of this product).","March 10, 2014","false","5.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

And If you think there is not enough song, you can still download some user-made content, which makes the game more complete. As the steam store say, you should not digitaly buy the game, because a cable is required to plug your guitar to the computer.

I wasn't planning on getting it, but my grandmother bought me the 360 version and I thought it was pretty great. There is a small latency from the time you play a note to the time it outputs the sound which was expected. The only bad thing that I noticed was when playing with a guitar that has a passive pickup, the game has a hard time recognizing some of the notes. This was fixed when I started using a guitar with active pickups though. Overall, I enjoyed playing along with some of my favorite rock/alternative bands. Whether you are an excellent guitar player or a beginner, this game is worth buying, especially when it is on sale.\n\nPros:\n-Play the geetar on the MTV\n-Good selection of rock/alt bands\n-Levels increase/decrease depending on how well you play\n\nCons:\n-Slight sound latency\n-Sometimes misses notes you played","October 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(And possibly even if RS2014 never came out but I'll get into that). So if you're thinking which version to get buy and Rocksmith 2014 and stop reading right now,\n\nPros:\n+You can import the tracklist to Rocksmith 2014 (for a fee but you should as it's a good list)!\n+There's a few minigames that are sort of fun to play and should have been ported to RS2014\n\nCons:\n- Many, many load times.\n- It is unclear whether or not you're playing lead or rhythm guitar when you make selections.\n- Purple notes blend in with the note highway\n- Missing guitar techniques like vibrato\n- The "career" mode is boring\n- The note highway itself is very ugly and confusing at times.\n- No more DLC (this is a reason to get RS2014).\n- Lessons are very basic no where near as good as RS2014\n- Sometimes single notes are just recognized (I don't have this issue in RS2014).\n- The unlockables are pretty lame.\n- The tone designer is lacking.\n\nNow I paid $7.50 for this and with the Clapton/Cream song not included in RS2014 topped on with achivements, some new mini games and being able to see one of my favorite games (RS2014) roots it was well worth the $7.50 but I just cannot in ANYWAY reccommend this game over 2014, it excels at everything and makes this game look like complete trash (which isn't too far off). Wait for it to go on sale $30 is too much for a not so grea game...\n\nLastly Buy Rocksmith 2014!!\n\nEdit: fixed a grammatical error","January 13, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a nice way to work up a song that in the library of Rocksmith. But there are some problems I've encountered with the game.\n\nFirst the timing is a little off. If I wait to pluck the indicated string on my guitar when the note bar hits the string shown on the screen then the timing will be late. I had to pluck the string a little before the bar reaches the string just so the note will be in time with the song.\n\nI think that there is a problem with Rocksmith hearing that a note has been played. When I play "Scale Racer" in the arcade section Rocksmith, for some reason, doesn't recognize that a note has been played.  I will pluck the string in plenty of time, & the finger is on the correct string at the correct fret, but the car still crashes.\n\nThere have been several times in Riff Repeater where I play the section with 0 misses, but there have been no increases in the difficulty. It will start the passage around 75% speed, & with each success the speed will increase but the difficulty stays the same. I'll go through this 5 times, & then get bored playing the same very simple passage over & over with no changes in the difficulty. It would be nice if it would increase the difficulty, closing in on how the song is actually played. Also there have been times Riff Repeater has given me only 1 note to play, there is no lead in or clicks for timing so as I mentioned earlier with the poor timing of the bar hitting the string shown on the screen & playing the note makes this difficult.\n\nThere also have been times when I don't play everything correctly, & Riff Repeater will slow the passage down. Unfortunately many times the voice over will talk right into the start of the passage making it difficult to start playing when the passage starts.\n\nMany of the lessons don't sound like there are for Rock, but designed for a Country & Western app.\n\nThe tuner isn't that accurate. It will lock in tune even before the pitch of the string is exactly where it should be. Then when I check this Rocksmith tuning to my Snark, &  Belcat tuners I find that my guitar is tuned flat. If I tune my guitar to one of the tuners, then the other one agrees that it is in tune. But when I check the Rocksmith tuner, it tells me the strings are sharp.\n\nWhen I go to "Learn a Song" unfortunately it always loads at the same song, & I really don't like that song so it's annoying to have to hear this each time I start this feature to learn a song. It's too bad that I can't change the song that "Learn a Song" loads with. It's too bad that Rocksmith doesn't have a tab sheet for the song in "Learn a Song" that could be used for practice. Speaking of reading tabs, the layout of the strings in Rocksmith is opposite of how the strings are shown in written Tabs.\n\nI've demo'ed playing Rocksmith 2012, & found it to be very confusing. The 2014 version is a noticeable improvement from 2012. So all in all, even with all of the problems, it's not a bad game. And as I mentioned earlier it is a helpful learning tool. If someone asks me about Rocksmith, & if I would recommend it I would have to first let them know about the problems Rocksmith has before I recommend it.","February 9, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously, any budding guitarists or bassists need to get this. Music videogames are often mocked by professionals but this game is the bridge you need between aspiring to learn and becoming a pro. You still need to put the time in but like going to guitar lessons you have a helping hand. I recommend putting in 30-90 mins in daily to progressively build up your skills. Play along with the great selection of built in songs, maybe pick up some of the growing number of DLC songs or search around online for you favourite songs added in by modders!\n\nThe minigames are superb for building basic guitar skills, from moving your fingers around the fretboard to learning your basic scales. With the added leaderboard system to encourage practicing and competing with your friends (looking forward to seeing some of you on there). The initial purchase cost might be a put off but how long ago was it that we were slashing out some heavy cash for Rock Band or Guitar Hero. As a long-time music game lover I highly recommend this.\n\nSadly you won't be learning the Drums here but Rock Band already does a pretty nice job of emulating that so fear not drummers. Guitarists and Bassists need to pick this up though.","January 23, 2013","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In contrast to many of the comments in game magazines I never had any guitar lessons, but nevertheless, that's no problem.\n\nI started like many music-gamers with the guitar hero series - nice, but not satisfactory in any way. One year ago I bought my first guitar - a Fender from America - and made my first steps alone until now. So I had a little presentiment of doing it, but no lessons at all.\n\nThe start of Rocksmith is hard, challenging but always fair. And if you bite through the first 3 or 4 hours, then the "game" opens you a new sight and many possibilities of managing your peronal guitar-skills. Sure there are still some bugs and nasty events  in the game, but nothing that a patch could not fix. Actually it is already quite more accurate that any of the guitar-hero games.\n\nThe negative point is, if you don't have any E-guitar at this time, it is getting expensive. The guitar in the bundle sold by Ubisoft is not much more than a toy; nobody will be happy with that - if you can't get out a straight sound, 'cause your sound pick-ups are cheapest of the cheap, you will stop immediately. So invest your money wisely, but a good guitar should be avaliable for about 500$ already.\nOn the other side, the software-aplifier makes a very good impression; so there's no need for an exra amplifier (if you have the right speakers with a phat sound connected).\n\nSo, my state is clear - if you're looking for a guitar-training, to improve your skills and be prepared for cramping hands, then I can recommend for 100% sure. It is just making fun, to see youself improving from song to song. But if you are looking for a game - then should get on your console for a guitar-hero session.","December 1, 2012","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after reading most of the posts about not recommending this game made me change my mind. A lot of the bad reviews seem to be made after Rocksmith 2014's release. Of course RS 2014 is better. However; the content from the first one is worth the price in my opinion. (I own both Rocksmiths for the Playstation from their respective release dates.) I bought a PS4 and loaned my PS3 to my cousin. I missed the game and repurchased RS14 for my PC. That satified me for a while; but I started to miss playing songs from the original. And that is the point for my recommendation. Sure the game play needed to be improved and Ubisoft made those improvements with RS14. I would give this a 5 out of 5 however $10 to port all the originals to RS14 kind of irritates me so I am only giving this 4 stars. It still is an outstanding game if for nothing else than the content that can be ported to RS14.","July 27, 2014","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive.\n\nI've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge.\n\nIt's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately.\n\nHowever, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs.

In contrast to many of the comments in game magazines I never had any guitar lessons, but nevertheless, that's no problem.\n\nI started like many music-gamers with the guitar hero series - nice, but not satisfactory in any way. One year ago I bought my first guitar - a Fender from America - and made my first steps alone until now. So I had a little presentiment of doing it, but no lessons at all.\n\nThe start of Rocksmith is hard, challenging but always fair. And if you bite through the first 3 or 4 hours, then the "game" opens you a new sight and many possibilities of managing your peronal guitar-skills. Sure there are still some bugs and nasty events  in the game, but nothing that a patch could not fix. Actually it is already quite more accurate that any of the guitar-hero games.\n\nThe negative point is, if you don't have any E-guitar at this time, it is getting expensive. The guitar in the bundle sold by Ubisoft is not much more than a toy; nobody will be happy with that - if you can't get out a straight sound, 'cause your sound pick-ups are cheapest of the cheap, you will stop immediately. So invest your money wisely, but a good guitar should be avaliable for about 500$ already.\nOn the other side, the software-aplifier makes a very good impression; so there's no need for an exra amplifier (if you have the right speakers with a phat sound connected).\n\nSo, my state is clear - if you're looking for a guitar-training, to improve your skills and be prepared for cramping hands, then I can recommend for 100% sure. It is just making fun, to see youself improving from song to song. But if you are looking for a game - then should get on your console for a guitar-hero session.","December 1, 2012","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Note bending is not accurately registered either.

Well, maybe not literally, but Rocksmith can help you really learn songs. No more mashing colored buttons rhythmically on cheap toy controllers, because Rocksmith lets you use REAL GUITARS and BASSES to play along and learn songs. It reads the output of your instrument, so it knows if your playing the right notes or not at the right timing (provided you adjusted your latency properly).\n\nThis is incredible for noobs -- beginners just starting out who want to learn a few popular songs, because Rocksmith is less of a game and more of a gamified teaching tool. It tracks your progress, adapting to your apparent skill level mid song, so you'll see a few note fly on the screen at first, but if you play more notes, Rocksmith doesn't punish you, but instead decides to display more and more notes until the "real" guitar/bassline is finally revealed. Essentially, the game rewards you for being a better musician, the way it should be.\n\nThere are plenty of modes that teach techniques like string bending, double stops, hammer ons/pull offs, muting -- mainly through tutorials and games. These techniques are also used in songs, so they become as practical as they are entertaining.\n\nOverall I'd have to say that Rocksmith is the best thing for beginners to learn songs beyond crappy online tabs, paying for lessons, books, "hot licks" DVDs or investing in software like Transcribe (which is excellent and I recommend to anybody remotely serious about learning music) to slow down tunes and learn piece by piece.\n\n\n\n","April 29, 2013","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played guitar for more than a decade, and despite my bias against the whole idea of a videogame as a learning tool, this manages to be a fun game and a decent learning tool. I would not reccomend it for somebody who has just bought a guitar and is just now learning simple because one could become entirely dependent—for learning—upon the mechanisms in the game instead of learning to read sheet music or tab. Anybody who has played for more than a month would most likely benefit from it assuming he/she had sufficient knowledge on basic chords and a elementary understanding of scales. The game will teach quite well, and will introduce a varied array of topics such as vibrato and harmonics with mini-lessons. Because of this, one must ensure that the styles and genres represented by the songs that come with the game are appealing and represent where he/she would like to be musically in the future. Even if the songs are unappealing, they serve to encompass a variety of technical skills; as long as one ensures that he/she is utilizing proper form, technique, and rythym, his/her use of the game should yield a well rounded guitar player. The songs are also fairly easy; learning from rock music is much easier than learning from a more demanding style, so use it as a launching pad to get started—even if rock isn't the first choice. Just don't expect the game to provide motivation—it's only going to roughly assess the player and provide the next step, which can be extremely difficult when one is teaching himself or herself.","January 16, 2014","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have owned Rocksmith now for over a month. I have owned my guitar for over 6 months, I done the YouTube thing. I done the Guitar bots Thing, I downloaded Amp sims, I did not learn any thing about the guitar. I played on my own in my house just strumming the strings and trying to understand how it works With no luck on my own. I was looking for a less expensive way to learn and to understand the guitar. Then i found Rocksmith - The first week I done all the Practice options that this software had to offer the 2nd week i done 2 songs in practice option and week 2 and 3 done more Techniques and opened up more options for my skill level and at this point I began to understand the guitar. ""MY FINGER GOT A BLISTER I PLAYED SO MUCH"" I would say this to any one that’s going to get this program. Get blank Music sheets and copy the music down and plug your guitar into the AMP not the PC/ MAC and practice with out Rocksmith on. Ones you think you know a song. There is a Human Connection Problem to the software.\nI know i have had a problem connecting because of the way the interface works. It has a vary bad way of telling you how you did on a song. Keep In mind i don’t think this is a game at all. It a tool for you to learn the guitar not music. Learn music on your own and i would even say wright your own and play it The same day you start understanding the way the guitar works.\nThis is a Must for anyone that is looking to learn the Guitar Not music.\nPhazma out\n\nAnd you don't need the cable","December 6, 2013","true","227.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally learned how to play with Tabs, They were expensive before the web. This game is pretty much set up to teach you how to play the same way I learned. A kind of interactive Visual tab with color coded strings and numbered frets. Latency is just a hair off so sometimes you just can't get the notes in perfect time with the game which is generally frustrating. If you already play, you will have to go through the beginner levels anyway but it works out because you need to learn the UI. The early levels just have you playing a note every 4 or 5 notes while it teaches you timing and that's pretty much how I learned all those years ago when I started. In my opinion this is a little expensive for new content and there aren't many song's included with the thing. It's a money pit and limited to just a few hours before you exhaust the included content. I figure a true beginner would maybe get 40 hours of play before it wouldn't be interesting anymore. It's a good concept but ruined by the need to buy DLC to continue. The included mini games are useful tools for creating skill. They absoluly redeem the game which would have been shallow without them. The Real Tone Cable is no garantee of good latency. The no cable patch (google it) will work just as well. When tuning, always reach proper tuning while tightning and not loosening. Tuner cannot hear harmonics and it is a "ballpark" tuner. You will find yourself tuning before you atart the game because it sound a bit flat by the built in tuner.","December 7, 2013","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive.\n\nI've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge.\n\nIt's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately.\n\nHowever, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs. Really something I would recommend to rock enthusiasts and wannabe musicians alike.","June 20, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Video Game Controller'!, yup, with every note, every fret, every string and every technique to just represent a button in that video game controller, and then you take that controller and you play the game and then you master this controller just the same way you mastered every controller you've held in your hands before but this time the controller you are holding in your hands is actually a real guitar...

Though I wanted to jump to the hardest difficulty to get a 100% accurate tab instead of every other note in a song, the game insists on taking it easy and adding difficulty as you play along and presumably get better.\n\nI'm a bit stubborn so I was a little unsure about this at first- but this is how improvements are made. You PRACTICE. So as I played, I noticed songs gradually start adding more notes as opposed to the simple starting fragments. This system works great. There's also tons of little games to sharpen certain skills.\n\nThe best feature in my book, strangely enough, became the settings for all the amps. As the owner of an amp with just-alright sound settings, having a ton of new sounds and effects to work with was awesome. I have actually found myself: plugging the guitar into my computer to fire up the game, selecting an in-game amp setting, then plugging my headphone jack into the aux. on my amp, and using Rocksmith as my new amp at the volume of my real amp.\n\nRocksmith is a valuable asset for someone who already plays guitar as well as those interested in giving it a go.

Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive.\n\nI've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge.\n\nIt's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately.\n\nHowever, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs. Really something I would recommend to rock enthusiasts and wannabe musicians alike.","June 20, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The song selection is fantastic, there will be songs that are not only fun to practice - but are actually really damn fun to listen to as well. Rocksmith is not some magical solution to learning guitar, you will have to work for it. You will put hours into this game to get the techniques correct and get all the songs down, but at the end of the day you realize all the struggle was worth it.

Rocksmith is very good with teaching newcomers to guitar on how to actually play the guitar with it's very interactive User Interface, and it records how you are doing on each song you play. If you are doing good, it bumps you up a few notes, all the way until you reach 100% and you are playing note for note, chord per chord. It also has instructional videos on how to do certain techniques and then it has you doing that technique and it makes sure that you are doing the techniques properly.\n\nNot only is this good for newcomers or beginners, but it is also useful for experienced and/or intermediate players! Especially when you are really busy and you don't have the time to practice as much, this game really brings you the motivation to want to practice as much as you used to before your busy schedual.\n\nThe Amp mode is very well thought out, and it very useful for people who want to create their own unique sound with different amps and pedals, without having to buy amps and a lot of different pedals.\n\nIf you are into guitar and you want a good way to learn guitar without having to pay a lot of money a week for lessons or you are looking for a good fun way to practice different styles of music, then I would say this is the game for you; and before I forget, you can also play bass guitars as well, and you can use ANY electric guitar and electric bass guitar.\n\n9/10 - A great game.","January 26, 2013","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is only worth getting for the songs that you can import into RS2014, and there is the ADDITIONAL COST of getting the import-tool to do so on top of purchasing this game.\nIt requires an official Rocksmith Realtone Cable (and an electric guitar / bass) to play.  Unofficial cables can be used in conjunction with a patch, but this can cause problems.\n\nWithin 6 months of casual play I went from having absolutely no experience to mastering my first song; and I enjoyed pretty much every step along the way as the levelling system incrementally increased the difficulty to suit my level of ability.\n\nIt made practising a pleasure, which is crucial to developing your skills – more so than learning the numerous techniques that game teaches you and helps you to master.\n\nThe selection of songs is solid, and the vast amounts of DLC allow you to pick out some favourites to play.  This does, however, add to the cost a fair bit – and the fact that RS2014 charges to import the original game's songs to that version is pretty much charging you for the same content twice.  Thankfully that doesn't apply to the DLC songs.\n\nThe game does, unofficially, support custom (community made) songs; although these are of varying quality.\n\nThe game is an amazing technical achievement, and Ubisoft's usual nickel-and-diming doesn't detract from that.","April 30, 2013","true","131.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a nice way to work up a song that in the library of Rocksmith. But there are some problems I've encountered with the game.\n\nFirst the timing is a little off. If I wait to pluck the indicated string on my guitar when the note bar hits the string shown on the screen then the timing will be late. I had to pluck the string a little before the bar reaches the string just so the note will be in time with the song.\n\nI think that there is a problem with Rocksmith hearing that a note has been played. When I play "Scale Racer" in the arcade section Rocksmith, for some reason, doesn't recognize that a note has been played.  I will pluck the string in plenty of time, & the finger is on the correct string at the correct fret, but the car still crashes.\n\nThere have been several times in Riff Repeater where I play the section with 0 misses, but there have been no increases in the difficulty. It will start the passage around 75% speed, & with each success the speed will increase but the difficulty stays the same. I'll go through this 5 times, & then get bored playing the same very simple passage over & over with no changes in the difficulty. It would be nice if it would increase the difficulty, closing in on how the song is actually played. Also there have been times Riff Repeater has given me only 1 note to play, there is no lead in or clicks for timing so as I mentioned earlier with the poor timing of the bar hitting the string shown on the screen & playing the note makes this difficult.\n\nThere also have been times when I don't play everything correctly, & Riff Repeater will slow the passage down. Unfortunately many times the voice over will talk right into the start of the passage making it difficult to start playing when the passage starts.\n\nMany of the lessons don't sound like there are for Rock, but designed for a Country & Western app.\n\nThe tuner isn't that accurate. It will lock in tune even before the pitch of the string is exactly where it should be. Then when I check this Rocksmith tuning to my Snark, &  Belcat tuners I find that my guitar is tuned flat. If I tune my guitar to one of the tuners, then the other one agrees that it is in tune. But when I check the Rocksmith tuner, it tells me the strings are sharp.\n\nWhen I go to "Learn a Song" unfortunately it always loads at the same song, & I really don't like that song so it's annoying to have to hear this each time I start this feature to learn a song. It's too bad that I can't change the song that "Learn a Song" loads with. It's too bad that Rocksmith doesn't have a tab sheet for the song in "Learn a Song" that could be used for practice. Speaking of reading tabs, the layout of the strings in Rocksmith is opposite of how the strings are shown in written Tabs.\n\nI've demo'ed playing Rocksmith 2012, & found it to be very confusing. The 2014 version is a noticeable improvement from 2012. So all in all, even with all of the problems, it's not a bad game. And as I mentioned earlier it is a helpful learning tool. If someone asks me about Rocksmith, & if I would recommend it I would have to first let them know about the problems Rocksmith has before I recommend it.","February 9, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will need to get the real tone cable to play, though I've heard there are workarounds, so research that before you buy it to make sure you can start playing. Some people have noted that the difficulty of songs starts out on easy and gradually increases based on how you play. As a beginner I've found this to be a good thing, though I can see how that would be frustrating for an experienced player.","December 26, 2013","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I wanted to jump to the hardest difficulty to get a 100% accurate tab instead of every other note in a song, the game insists on taking it easy and adding difficulty as you play along and presumably get better.\n\nI'm a bit stubborn so I was a little unsure about this at first- but this is how improvements are made. You PRACTICE. So as I played, I noticed songs gradually start adding more notes as opposed to the simple starting fragments. This system works great. There's also tons of little games to sharpen certain skills.\n\nThe best feature in my book, strangely enough, became the settings for all the amps. As the owner of an amp with just-alright sound settings, having a ton of new sounds and effects to work with was awesome. I have actually found myself: plugging the guitar into my computer to fire up the game, selecting an in-game amp setting, then plugging my headphone jack into the aux. on my amp, and using Rocksmith as my new amp at the volume of my real amp.\n\nRocksmith is a valuable asset for someone who already plays guitar as well as those interested in giving it a go. Give it a try!\n\n","August 19, 2013","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

It is a teaching tool that also allows you to play some of your favorite songs at whatever skill level you personally are at rather than waiting to play your favorite song until you learn more.  The difficulty is adaptive, which is good for those learning- I could see how it would be annoying to those that already know how to play as you can't tell it not to adapt.  I definitely like the fretway better than Rock Band pro guitar, and the progression is a bit more varied.  All in all, if you're looking for a tool to help learn, this is a good one.  The only downside I've found is that the Real Tone cable seems to disconnect at times, and you have to exit and go to the audio properties before it will work again.","January 4, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/recommended/205190/","YicklePigeon","YicklePigeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/","180 products in account","The following is my review in pseudo FAQ format. Enjoy! :)\n\nWhy did I buy Rocksmith?\n\nI bought this as a way to learn to play an electric guitar - something that I (and I suspect many others) have wanted to do since childhood but never really had the right tuition or couldn't quite follow along with a book/video. Mainly because you can't necessarily trust an instructor to be able to tell if you're hitting the right notes/chords and a book/video may assume a skill level or familiarity that you, as the learner, just do not possess.\n\nAlso, as per usual, it was in a sale and it's taken me at least a year to get around to buying a Real Tone cable once the price had come down in price to £20 on Amazon.\n\nDo you actually learn how to play a guitar?\n\nYes. Yes you do.  You start with simple single note arrangements of songs, leading to complex single note arrangements and then on to a combination of single notes and chords before going to full chords.  The speed at which you do this depends on what Rocksmith thinks is best for you in terms of your actual ability, with arrangements being made simpler or harder (or truer to the actual song being played if you prefer).  You can also practice specific chords of a chosen song, any part of a song, different arrangements, or change songs in your "setlist" to ones you're more familiar with and/or genres you prefer.\n\nStarting with single notes, you are also memorising your guitar's fretboard and how far to move your fingers without even counting the frets as you go.  As you progress further, Rocksmith will introduce new elements such as sliding from one fret to another - both as part of the song you're playing and to further cement fret positions in your mind.  Even after a few days to the end of your first week of playing, you'll find yourself being able to play songs with far fewer mistakes (perhaps even perfectly, as of course everyone learns at different speeds).  Certainly, you would have started developing those all important calluses!\n\nOkay, I get that Rocksmith is a learning tool - but what's Rocksmith like as a game?\n\nAs a game, Rocksmith is far more entertaining than say Guitar Hero/Rock Band in that you're genuinely playing along with a real guitar (that needn't cost the same as a Guitar Hero/Rock Band accessory), and is always just challenging enough in difficulty and the side games provide a welcome relief to learning songs and using a real guitar as an alternative controller whilst still being educational.  The Rocksmith Points that you get for completing songs and side games all add up to your resulting score and is a good objective metric of your progress/ability.\n\nSpeaking of side games, these are unlocked as you progress so that you're never in a position where you are in way over your head.  For example, the first game unlocked is the Duck Shoot where you play single notes on the 6th string in particular fret positions to shoot the ducks, simple enough. But from there as you progress, you'll unlock the scales mini game and so on, providing an incentive to carry on and is yet another way of letting you know how far you've come from starting out.\n\nAdditionally, there is a multiplayer mode and it's up to you and those you're playing with if you want to be competitive or use it to encourage as a group to all learn a skill.\n\nWhat's the song selection like?\n\nLike a higher priced budget collection in that all the songs are well known and like all budget collections, you'll be a fan of some more than others (perhaps by a great margin).  For example: if you want popular 50s rock artists like Chuck Berry and Bill Haley? You're out of luck. There aren't any TV/Film themes either (which are almost traditional to learn) or rock instrumentals such as FBI by The Shadows.\n\nIf you like Nirvana, Snow Patrol, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and the like (generally popular rock from the late 80s onwards) then you'll be escstatic and perhaps disappointed your favourite song wasn't included, which is small beer when compared to those of us who prefer 1950s-1970s rock given that we get 8 songs (three of these being by The Rolling Stones - with none of them being Paint It Black! Have to upgrade to Rocksmith 2014 to get that one) out of a total 57 that come with the base game (6 are unlocked as you play, all of which are from 2011).  For the sake of completion, two of the songs from 1988 onwards are Run Back To Your Side by Eric Clapton (2010) and Jarvis Cocker (formerly of Pulp fame) represented with one of his solo efforts "Angela" (2009).  For Clapton and Pulp fans (of which I'm neither), this is something of a raw deal given the  respective back catalogues.\n\nWell what about the DLC are my/your tastes catered to there?\n\nYes and no. If you live in the US? You'll be fine, all the DLC is available to you. In the EU, not so much. I'd like to be able to buy "Roadhouse Blues" by The Doors along with packs only available in the US region (the orchestral/classical selections should be royalty free by now the world over, so why only a US release Ubisoft?).\n\nMy conclusion\n\nRocksmith is a good learning tool to practice to your preferred songs (where available) and if you prefer mid-80s onwards, you're very much catered for.  I'd also recommend Rocksmith as a solid stepping stone to give you a head start when it comes to training DVDs and books, given that you'll have at least a working knowledge of playing a guitar.\n\nI'd also advise going in with the mentality of treating songs by artists you're not fond of (or even heard of depending on your tastes) as a level to be mastered.  It works, but songs you actually enjoy may help you better - each to their own in that regard!\n\nHave fun though, learn, and impress yourself if no one else that you've learned a new skill!","August 6, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a huge leap toward really being able to play lead guitar for me, and made me feel like a real rock star rather than a cartoon one (as I did when I used to play Guitar Hero).\n\nThere were a few annoying aspects that I did not like: 1) having to retune EVERY FRICKIN TIME I wanted to replay a song or game; 2) having to escape into a special mode to practice sections; and 3) learning new songs seemed more game-like rather than realistically achieving artistry (wanting to get applause and WIN the level rather than learning to play the song without errors).\n\nAll these flaws were more than eliminated by Rocksmith 2014, which I love! Session mode: the band that never goes home or gets tired of hearing you riff.\n\nI do like the Gamecade games better in this game than the 2014.

Almost 100 hours played in RS, and over 300 hours in RS2014.\nBasically, I still recommend the hell out of both this games. RS has a few songs that I wish were in the new one, but 2014 is overall a much more polished version of the system, removing the GuitarHero like style of playing. That being you have to play the notes slightly before they say to on screen or you'll miss them, so in that regard you can't play to the timing of the song very well, which is instrumental in a band, pun intended.\n\nNot gonna give pros and cons.\n\nBuy 2014 if you want to learn easier. Buy this if you want a slightly better choice of songs IMO.","March 6, 2014","true","95.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is amazing to see how well the interface between your electric guitar/bass works with the game. Because of this, novice guitarists can more easily aquire a basic set of skills. Its too bad some advanced (shredding) techniques are not available (hopefully there's gonna be an expansion for intermediate guitarists) and this is reflected by the setlist, not a lot of really fast metal, you're gonna have to get that from the DLCs. Even though there are some songs in the setlist I could care less for (they're there mainly to appeal to more pop-oriented people), all in all there's a solid collection of tracks.\nBecause the techniques in the game are nothing new to me, I mainly use it to practice my skills on bass, since my fingerpicking can be a little more tight :)\nThe game does not really support multiplayer as much as Guitar Hero. You can play gigs with your friends of course, switching the guitar every song, provided they have some guitar skills of their own. The learning curve of playing real guitar is still steaper than playing Guitar Hero, although the game supports a dynamic difficulty system, making it a little more accessible (but annoying if you want to really learn the proper way of playing a song, you're gonna have to unlock a master mode first). The game has some mini (arcade) games that do not require much skill and I guess those can provide for some multiplayer.\nThe best thing about it, is that it makes you want to keep on playing and practicing and this is a vital aspect of trying to learn to play any instrument really, so its really more recommendable to novice guitarists, who want to learn to play, but so far really can't seem to put the time and effort in.\nThe game comes with a cable for plugging your guitar into your PC, so its better to get a physical copy from a story with a cable included than just a digital download, because you can't play this game without that cable (and a guitar to plug in to it).","December 21, 2012","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So with the uninstall bug with Audials and the sound device bug in Rocksmith, you have an unfortunate pairing of bugs. I found this quite by accident and I hope Rocksmith fixes this fault.\n\nThis piece of software is really good actually, it will let you:\n\n-> Tune your guitar\n-> Use the computer instead of an amplifier\n-> Teach you techniques\n-> It can test your ability in different techniques\n-> It's smart and it adjusts to your skill level like if you fluff up it'll reduce the amount of notes for you to play so you can find your fingering again, then increase the number of notes as you pick up technique\n-> It has a number of videos, and suggestions for how to improve playing\n-> It will suggest tracks that match your level\n-> It will even f*** off and just let you play the guitar as you want without having to conform to any gameplay rules, which is nice.\n\nThere's loads of features I like about this "game". I don't know if it should really be called a game, because it's more like a virtual tutor. I think it's rather clever actually to make you watch the screen, because by watching the screen, you will learn correct finger placement on the guitar instinctively, just as you can learn to touch type on a keyboard. I think that's a very good skill.\n\nMy guitar playing is poor, but it's improving. It's amazing how many bad habits you pick up when teaching yourself. This software is undoing those bad habits.\n\nCan't recommend this software highly enough!\n\nSuggestions to developers:\n-> It can be really difficult to see the notes on the screen with the background - it would be good if you could turn the background graphics off, then it would be easier to see what we are trying to play.\n-> Also i'd like a black and white version, as the string colours don't help me at all (I am colour blind) and people work it out from the position of the string being played anyway.","March 4","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
