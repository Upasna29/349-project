Let me explain.\n\nFor fans of the show, it should be no secret that Nickelodeon hasn't exactly funded this show to its fullest potential - especially in the last couple of seasons. It therefore follows that the same was true for this game - when they approached Platinum Games (perhaps most famous for the recent Bayonetta titles) to make a Korra game, the intention was always to create a cheap, yet faithful, action game adaptation of the Avatar universe.\n\nThat is where we find this game - that is what it is. It is not, unfortunately, an open-world, Batman Arkham City-style adventure through Republic City. It is not an amazing story that fits perfectly into Korra's adventures on the show, adding to the narrative as a whole. In fact, it isn't even fully star studded with many characters - Mako and Bolin make brief appearances, Tenzin, Beifong, and Asami are nowhere to be seen... the game is mostly just Korra, with the occasional pop-in from spirit-Jenora.\n\nThis may sound like a lot of negative for a game I'm supposedly recommending - and that's because, for the most part, this game succeeds in what it intends to be. It is a fun action game - albeit one that struggles early on, as it chooses to slowly feed you your bending powers rather than give them out right away. By the later levels, though, mixing the different elements and taking on enemies with sick combos becomes satisfying. Add to that an art style that complements the animation of the source material and music straight from the show, and the package feels pretty good. Replaying the game is made worthwhile, thanks to the Extreme difficulty (for action veterans) and numerous unlockables.\n\nThe game is far from perfect; at times it's frustratingly difficult, and the story is nearly non-existant - a shame, too, because the cutscenes are animated by the same team from the show. But the greatest downfall of this game is that it is probably the only Avatar game we will ever see, and it isn't as much as it could be. I cannot fault the game for that, especially at a bargain starting price; it simply wasn't in the cards.\n\nAt the end of the game, while Mako, Bolin, and Korra exchanged banter as the credits rolled, I cracked a big grin, captivated by these excellent characters. It's a shame this game couldn't capture more of them, but it just wasn't able to happen. Maybe one day, this franchise will get the love it deserves in the video game department.\n\nUntil then, this is all we've got.","January 13, 2015","true","17.9"," 492 of 522 people (94%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","94","492","522","23","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/281690/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","Legend of Korra is a fast-paced action beat em up game from PlatinumGames. The game has some nice graphics/music and game play and is sincerely decent for hardcore fans of the show.\n\nStoryThe story takes place between book 2 and 3 but doesn't fit anywhere to the show itself and seems out of place place a bit but it is decent.. If you are not a follower of the show, the game focuses on Korra, who is the AVATAR (The one who can master all the element's Air, Fire, Water, Earth). Korra is going down the streets after a probending match who sees an old man being attacked and tries to help only to be attacked by needles and have her powers blocked off.. Now she is on a quest to regain her powers and find out the identity of the old man who tricked her.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics and art of the game itself really complimented the game well to the show though isn't extremely detailed it has the arts down well. There aren't many options to configure its cell shading type, but it looks absolutely fine. The game runs at a constant 60 fps and feels well optimized, which gives it a very fast paced game play.  Along with that the maps, the environments are decently detailed with limited destructable items throughout. Although beating up cars doesn't really make sense but is fun to do so nevertheless. There are show like cut scenes throughout each chapter that complements a completion of a chapter.\n\nControlsThe game controls are a bit complex on the keyboard but are playable. The game tells players that the best way to play it is with a game pad for a better experience which feels right for this type of action game.\n\nSound and musicThe sound and music to the games feel as if it comes straight from the show and is well implemented. Though the music often repeats itself many times throughout the game, The game uses the same voice actors of course to compliment the show, and the music is fantastic.\n\nGameplayThe game play consists of Korra being able to do light/heavy attacks  complete with charging, Dodges, Parry counters, jumps, and  switching between four elements. Earth is slow but does decent damage against enemies that block along with adding a little defense, water best for its range attack, Fire for quick combos, and air, which is great for groups of enemies. The combo system is not too complex and there isn't a combo tree to invest points in but rather a leveling system that unlocks new addition to the combos as the element is being used. Chi build up is from charging which powers up attacks and is needed to deal with harder enemies. When defeating enemies a finish button will pop up for players to finish off opponents with an extra button press which can link additional enemies as well to defeat them. Counters are very important to deal massive blow to enemies and very much needed in extreme difficulty and require timing. The gameplay is not horrible yet could had been improved/extended further but overall it is fast and fun.\n\nOther gameplayThe gameplay offers 3 difficulty, Casual Normal and Extreme which is unlocked after beating the game. The difficulty in the game spikes at certain places such as the triad fights and Naga final run minigame.\nPlayers are rated on their performance through each stage of the game. The game has eight total stages that players must fight through along with three stages that are an on-rail platforming requiring Korra to navigate with Naga with jumping, sliding and such to navigate through a maze of turns, twists, and jumps, which can get really intense in some section with its fast pace. There is also one part where one gets to play probending events and also a mode for pro bending itself which is quite decent and could had been a multiplayer game itself. The naga riding felt completely out of place and just wasn't needed but was added as a way to change pace from the usual beat the crap outta everything.\n\nEnemiesEnemies in the game consisted of chi blockers, triads, robots, and spirits. Each with their own type of moves and abilities and you'll understand thier patterns as you play. They can block, stun, blind, and hit Korra with unblockables. The real gem in the game is truly the last boss who definitely feels like a PlatinumGames boss fight and is completely epic to fight. Extreme mode makes these enemies much harder to fight and requires more thought put in.\n\nAfterwards and ReplayabilityAfter finishing the game players will unlock the final difficulty mode for  storymode which is EXTREME or play through the pro bending levels as replay value and search for hidden chest items throughout the game which only offers you higher scores and rank you during stages. Along with that, additional costumes will be unlocked for Korra. It will take 3-4 hours to complete the story mode itself. **WARNING** EXTREME MODE IS EXTREME WITH MORE MOBS and EXTREME! I died many times and took 10 hours to beat. Truly a Platinum challenge. Be warned and prepare to rage.\n\nOpinionOverall my opinion for 15 dollars I had some fun out of the game and was very amusing. It is a decently made game that was fun to play and had a really fast and intense game play. The combat system, however, was lacking and felt like a shaved down version of Bayonetta or many other PG games, Think of this as Bayonetta LITE and at best, the game felt medicore at times with the naga rail minigame, but nevertheless, It is deserving of playing if one is a fan of AVATAR and just getting a decent game for the show  is worth it.  Avatar, Which I knew nothing about until two days prior when i watched the entire thing to research for this specific game. If you have 15 dollars to spend for some quick avatar action fun or a huge fan/supporter of the show/PlatinumGames go for it, otherwise wait for the sale. If only this was a full budget title with more time given in making it. Perhaps we'll see one in the future but overall they priced the game for 15 dollars honestly sold the price for what they thought the game was worth instead of throwing it out 30 dollars which they could had probabaly done. Decide this one for yourself and think hard. Decent gameplay vs high production.\n\n\nPros\n+ The art and graphic is fitting for this type of game\n+ The action is fast-paced and fun.\n+ The bending elements are fun\n+ Probending has its own mode\n+ The Last boss was really well done, truly a Platinum Games boss battle EPIC\n+ The music and voice acting along with the cut scenes does a really good job implemented from the show.\n+Various items to unlock and goodies found in the game\n+Extreme mode is amazing and challenging adds 5+ hours more\n\nCons\n- Have to beat the game to unlock extreme mode\n- Short game 3.5 hours long to complete on normal.\n- Replay value, You can only play the game again to search for items, play extreme mode or play the pro bending. No online of any sort.\n- The combo system wasn't complex or extensive\n- The on rail Naga platforming levels is a wierd change of pace.\n- It is a pretty straightforward game each maps has small pouch areas leading to hidden items and such, pretty linear\n- It is low budget game for such a good show and I've only discovered it 2 days prior for review of this game.\n\nSteamCurator Streaminggroup\nTwitch/Yt Kenuty","October 21, 2014","true","13.0"," 529 of 605 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","529","605","2","35"

It's not.\nIt's 15 bucks and it's damn well worth every penny.\n\nI beat the game three times, plus all the pro-bending stages. The first time on Normal, then on Expert and I just finished a livestream on Normal where everyone loved watching this game.\nI have all the achievements, and even the more grindy ones were still a lot of fun to get.\n\nThis game, for it's price and incredibly short dev cycle, is really, really fun. There's a pretty decent story which I'm glad they added. I feel like they could've just not done it if they wanted, but there are full motion cutscenes that aren't from the show and have been especially animated for the game. Also, the pro-bending game, despite wishing there was an online versus option, was incredibly fun and well done.\n\nBut where the game really shines is the combat.\nThe combat is so incredibly fun, it's almost impossible to get old. Chaining attacks from one element to the next and figuring out combos, a great dodge and a really spot on counter system, all of that makes every fight incredibly fun. And that's the most important to me in a videogame. At no point in this game did I ever get bored. I was worried that it would get repetitive, but all I can say is that it just doesn't.\n\nIt almost, if all, doesn't deserve any of the negative comments it gets. This game is fun, and that's what's important.","October 25, 2014","true","26.0"," 261 of 293 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","261","293","3","11"

For what it is. The Game is actually pretty good in my opinion, it was made by fans of the show, the creators had active input and a alot of the voice cast from the show came back for mostly minor roles. That being said, the cast is very small which is probably its biggest downside.\nBeing set between books 2 and 3 you only control Korra. Which is alright. The only other characters from the show that appear in any capacity is Jenora for pretty much the 'guide' telling you when and where you can unlock abilities and all that even then its via her spirit projection ability. Mako and Bolin only appear during the Pro-Bending segment and minigame. Those are the only 'major' characters seen in the game.\n\nI will say my favorite part about this game is so far the Pro-Bending minigame. and my least favorite is the Naga Running sequences.\n\nNote once you beat the game and unlocked access to all 4 elements and the avatar state. Boss battles on reruns (atleast on casual and normal) become much easier if you take advantage of the avatar state.\n\nOverall it falls in line with the usual 'game based on a TV Series/Movie' line but its easily in the upper half as the developers clearly gave a damn in this case. If you are a fan of the entire Last Airbender franchise and especially Legend of Korra. Pick it up for a spin.","December 19, 2014","true","23.6"," 219 of 241 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","219","241","10","0"

I doubt you’ll actually enjoy the game even it does let you control an Avatar that can bend all the elements. The story happens between the events of Season 2 and Season 3. Even though it is just a filler for the whole show, I still highly recommend that you watch it atleast until through Season 2 so that you can have a better understanding of the game. The game introduces a new antagonist named Hudun, an ancient enemy of the Avatar. And like any other cliché enemies, he wants to unleash chaos to the world and have his vengeance.\n\nThe main selling point of this game, is ofcourse, the ability to bend 4 different elements; Water, Earth, Fire and Air. And as an additional to that, you also gain experience points and eventually level up each elements which gives you additional move sets and more options to unlock from the shop. And the combat system isn’t as fluid as I thought it would be, at most times it does feel clunky.\n\nPROS\nPlay as the Avatar – I may not be the biggest fan out there, but being able to bend all different elements is just so satisfying.\nMini-games – One of the mini-games is the pro-bending match. If you’ve been watching the series, you’ll know exciting this is already. And then there is the endless runner-like game when riding Naga, you’re trusty companion.\nGraphics – It is almost the same in the series and I love it.\nVoice Acting – Whenever you’re doing a video game for a series, you should always hire the original voice actors. I seriously don’t think it’ll be the same if it was a different woman voicing as Korra.\nChallenging Enough – I for one, died more than 10 times just trying to figure out how to kill a boss. The game surely punishes when you such, but it’s rewarding if you manage to get by ofcourse.\nCONS\nA Very Short Game – To be honest, I’m not sure if my hours played is correct. But I can say that this game was way too short. The game made me raised my eyebrows when I didn’t realized I was already on the last chapter.\nLacks Design – No matter how much I tried to like the way the world is designed, it really feels bland and rushed. The environment looks and feels empty.\nNo Enemy Variation – Felt like they just gave up on brainstorming ideas on how the enemies should look. You’ll be seeing the exact same models of the enemies all throughout the game only with different costume colors and abilities.\nCONCLUSION / TL;DR\n\nIf you’re a fan of the show, you’ll definitely have fun with this game. Given that the game is short in terms of its storyline, I think it is for the best that you get this game on the cheapest way possible. And if you’re not a fan, you’ll most likely exit the game and not finish it at all. So you’re probably better off trying other beat ‘em up games.","December 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 161 of 169 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","161","169","6","0"

The game itself is beautiful and the cutscenes are well animated.   The character's voices sound pretty similar to the show, which is also a plus.  The combat shines once you get the hang of it(especially once you unlock moves and understand how the combos work), but even on easy mode the game can be tough.  Also, alot of the music is borrowed from the show, which is pretty cool to.  The Naga sections are a bit "meh", but they provide a challenge which is good enough for me.  Also, they aren't too long.  Just a little break in the action, which can be repetitive at times, especially in the beginning.\n\nOn the other side of things, the story is interesting, but its obvious that Platinum wanted to focus on the gameplay rather than the narrative.  It's missing alot of the things that makes the show amazing, especially because barely any characters besides Korra show up.  However, this makes sense if you consider the fact that it takes place in between the 2nd and 3rd seasons, so they had to do something that would have no lasting impact on the characters and could go unnoticed in the context of the tv show.\n\nUpdate: Having finished the game, everything that I said above stands.  However, I will say that the story is VERY short and isn't exactly what I would call an amazing one, but I feel like Platinum most likely focused on the gameplay mechanics rather than the story itself.  On top of that, the game is meant to be played 2 or 3 times in order to complete everything, so there's definitely more than a few hours of content.  Also, the additional costumes are pretty cool.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a game that's worth $15.  It's not a masterpiece by any means, but for any Last Airbender or Korra fans that have always wanted to "bend" themselves rather than watching cartoon characters do it, it's most definitly enjoyable.  It's good for what it is and it's price for sure.  Just don't expect a full-fledged, full-length Platinum game here.  If you want that, Bayonetta 2 is also out this week.","October 21, 2014","true","14.2"," 314 of 373 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","314","373","0","24"

Check.\n\nHordes of enemies? Check.\n\nBrutal bad ♥♥♥ finishing moves? Check.\n\nLinear level design? Check.\n\nSlightly wonky lock on and camera system? Check and Check.\n\nThe Legend of Korra offers everything that Platinum Games has come to be known for. The game plays out very well and the combat is where the game shines. The difficulty levels vary greatly ranging from the super simple grunts that you can easily button mash to death to the complete other end of the spectrum where you encounter enemies who will put up quite the challenge and you may even have to restart multiple times to defeat them. The game plays and feels like an E rated version of Bayonetta without quite the same level of pristine and polish, which is by no means a bad thing but it is certainly not a game that will knock your socks off; however at the low asking price of $15, this is a must have for anyone who loves the action genre.\n\nThe games combat system is spot on and certainly hits its peak whenever you pull off a brutal finishing move to eliminate an enemy but the awkward targeting system and camera placement will become the cause of most of your frustrations with the game.  Another complaint is that the game does get repetitive fairly quickly as the game lacks a variety of enemies and also features a somewhat lackluster and generic level design.  The cell shaded art style used in the game are absolutely beautiful, however the cut scenes are the true visual show stealer of this game as they are both visually impressive as well as offering impressive voice acting. This game is the perfect buy for both fans of the series as well as fans of Platinum Games. As far as both Television licensed games as well as budget titles go the game is phenomenal and among one of the best of both categories.\n\nOverall the game offers a very enjoyable combat system that is sadly held back and contained due to the somewhat wonky camera system, limited pool of enemies and lackluster level design.\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","December 20, 2014","true","1.2"," 208 of 247 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","208","247","16","2"

Bayonetta, Madworld, Vanquish, and especially Metal Gear Rising are all amazing games in my opinion.\n\nSo when I heard they were adapting the spin-off to the fantastic Last Airbender show, The Legend of Korra, I was excited, needless to say. Now I haven't seen an episode of Korra yet(though I plan to) but even so, I had to get my hands on this because Platinum.\n\nSo how is it?\n\nPretty awesome actually, especially for a budget game.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story, like many others have mentioned, is a bit light, but what's there is fine.\n\nOur story follows Korra(NAH REALLY?) as she goes on a quest to stop an evil old man who she thought was in trouble only for him to take her powers because...reasons I guess.\n\nNo seriously, he just shoots a few arrows into her back and poof she's down and without powers. Now I've only played up to the end of chapter 4 so far so maybe his motivation for stealing your powers is explained later? I dunno. Anyway, now it's up to you to help Korra get her powers back and beat up the evil old man.\n\nOne thing the game does that's a bit strange is that it throws you right into a dream sequence at the beginning with no context or info. It's kinda weird and takes you out of the experience a little bit, but it's only 2 minutes long anyway.\n\nThe story gets the job done, but it's not up to the standard of what you'd expect considering the team from the show wrote the story for this. Granted, as I stated previously, I haven't seen the show myself but I've heard some really good things and many fans are quite disappointed with how the story turned out in this game as well, so I know I'm not alone in thinking this.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND CONTROLS:\n\nWhen it comes to controls, they work well. I highly recommend playing this game with an actual controller though, it's not unplayable with a keyboard but I wouldn't suggest it, as playing this with a controller is much easier and makes combat a hell of a lot easier(still decently challenging mind).\n\nOK, so how's the gameplay? Well, it's sorta like Bayonetta except there's not as many combos or moves to perform. Countering enemies lets you perform some very cool looking moves and you can do some neat looking finishers as well when you have an enemy on their last legs. It's a lot of fun performing all the various bending techniques, and these are waterbending, earthbending, firebending and airbending. The fact you can switch between the four of these on the fly makes combat fluid, letting you score high combos, and just generally letting you feel like a badass.\n\nThe four elements are all a lot of fun to use, but I will say that the airbending is really overpowered. Found the game quite easy after getting it and that includes the final boss. As I said previously however, you can perform some devastating combos once you have all four elements at your disposal so it can be quite rewarding when you finally have all of them.\n\nEnemy variety is...not great. You mostly be fighting three goons colour-coded red, green and blue throughout most of the game, with three guys that use fire, earth and water bending showing up from time to time as well. Throw in a few robots and the spirit world creatures and there's your roster. It's very...meh and I think Platinum easily could have thrown a few more enemy types into the mix for more variety but, I suppose it could have been worse?\n\nI will say that the camera is a bit of an issue, as it's sometimes hard to make out enemies on screen when the camera awkwardly positions itself somewhere you didn't want it to. It's the one thing Platinum really needs to work on in their games as it's been a problem in games such as MGR and Bayonetta as well. It doesn't break the game for me but it can be an annoyance.\n\nYou can go into the Avatar state too on the final level and it's absolutely awesome. Seriously, it's ridiculously fun to decimate everything in your way with it! The final boss is definitely up to Platinum's standards, it's long, ridiculous, and an absolute blast to go through.\n\nThere are sections were you can ride Naga, your trusty steed, through a series of endless runner minigames. I quite like these actually, they're nice for breaking up the combat and they can get very hectic as well with you needing quick reflexes to succeed. They're enjoyable in my opinion, if a bit derivative.\n\nThere's also a pro-bending mode, where you have to push opponents off the other side of an arena. I haven't tried this mode out yet, but the little pro-bending minigames in the story were fun, so I'm looking forward to trying this mode out.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe graphics are purdy, looking very like the show and giving an authentic feel to the look of the game.  The bending is especially good looking, Platinum did an excellent job to make it look like how it does on the show. The cel shading is very well done as well and the frame-rate runs at a silky smooth 60. Shame there aren't many graphic options but eh, the game runs well and looks good, and that's all I need.\n\nSOUND:\n\nVoice acting is good, they're the voice actors from the show, and the music is very nicely orchestrated, even if it's not incredibly memorable.\n\nREPLAY VALUE:\n\nThe game took me about 5 hours on my first playthrough, and in my opinion that is a perfectly serviceable length for a game at this price in my opinion. Yeah, it could be a LITTLE longer, but besides, there's a good amount of replay value in here, what with the extreme mode and pro-bending mode to unlock as well.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nOverall, I can recommend The Legend Of Korra to fans of Platinum's other work, fans of the show and to a person who just wants a damn good action game. It's a very entertaining game for a cheap price, and as I said before, ignore IGNorant and GameSpoo, and give this game a try. It has a number of flaws but they're easily overlooked considering the price and how enjoyable the game can be. I can recommend it at full price, and at the very least, check it out when it's 50% off.\n\nWhat they did right:\n-Game looks fantastic, very pretty animations and the bending looks absolutely outstanding.\n-Music and voice acting are both authentic and sound good.\n-Combat is very enjoyable,with tons of cool moves,counters and combos to perform.\n-Naga sections,while a little unoriginal,are enjoyable and fun and they're good for breaking up the pace.\n-Offers a decent challenge, though it does get much easier later on.\n-Extreme and Pro Bending unlocked after beating the game add replay value.\n-Final boss is...just freaking awesome.\n-The price is right.\n\nWhat they screwed up:\n-Camera is poop.\n-Mediocre story.\n-Absolutely no lip-syncing during in-game cutscenes which is odd.\n-It's a bit short.\n-Enemy variety is weak.\n-Airbending is really overpowered and makes the game pretty easy during the last few chapters.\n\n\nThis is Frank West, and I give this game a final score of an 8/10.","October 23, 2014","true","6.1"," 154 of 183 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","154","183","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/281690/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Legend of Korra is a third person beat'em up, developed by PlatiumGames, based on the animated TV show, The Legend of Korra (oh rly?). It was released in fall of 2014, on all platforms.  I was playing this game having no prior knowledge of the TV show and no idea what any of the backplot or characters were about - you may want to keep that in mind whilst reading.\n\nYou play as Korra, who is the series' heroine, and you have the ability to bend arts, magically and physically, these consist of air bending, water bending, fire bending and earth bending.  All of these different forms have their own positives and negatives to them, for instance the earth form, whilst being really slow, has mega powerful attack damage.  You can also create combos of different attacks by switching forms in the midst of your brawls.  All of the fight scenes are well well balanced; you start off with some basic enemies, and you soon work your way up to hoards or bad guys to work your way through. I really enjoyed the fact that some of your attacks also deal splash damage to other enemies close by.\n\nAs well as the beat'em up style combo system, there is another slightly different gameplay element included in The Legend of Korra, and that is an endless runner sort of mode, similar to that of the likes of Temple Run on the iOS and Bit.Trip.Runner, you ride your pet polar bear Naga through various different tunnels, corridors and roads. This mode came as quite a nice addition, as it allowed you to take a break from the sometimes repetitive combat scenes.\n\nThe graphics in this game are very nice. looking at the images I have seen of the TV show, they look almost identical, so the developers have done a good job in mimicking it into the game. The cut scenes are also very well rendered and set out, these are definitely made by the same people who make the TV show as they are identical.\n\nAs I was playing this game as someone who had no idea what the plot of the TV series was, I still found the story to be compelling and interesting, having seen other reviews of this game, it actually seems like it was a bit of a blessing that I had not seen the TV show, as that is where most reviewers seem to come down hard on Legend of Korra. For me though, I really liked the story and it didn't put me at a disadvantage having not seen the show either.\n\nThis game is not a difficult game to complete; there were a number of times on a couple of bosses where I had to retry a few times, but was able to overcome them quite easily after a bit of perseverance. If you watch my playthrough, you'll actually see the hardest part in the game I found, was when you have to fight two bosses at once. The end boss is also quite challenging too. Where the game does offer some slight advantages to the player, is that you can spend the spirits you have found through out the game, in the shop in between levels, this gives you the chance to purchase potions, revives, new abilities and passive bonus' to Korra. Some of the prices of some of the items are very steep, so if you want to get the best items, you really need to farm spirits by replaying previous levels to get them.\n\nWhilst The Legend of Korra is extremely linear, the game still has a very nice level design, the early levels more so than the later ones. The early levels have a number of different allyways, and different paths to follow with the reward of treasure chests or some sort of bonus amount of spirits at the end of it. The later levels not so much, they seem to be more coned into one path in order to progress the story.\n\nA full playthrough of this game took me just over six hours. I was very happy with the amount of content in the game, the shorter length of the game was counteracted by the really nice gameplay and story. I would of maybe liked to have seen a couple more hours added given that this is a big release published by Activision, but it is what it is. The Legend of Korra does have a "New Game+" mode upon completing the game which may push out another five or six hours out of the title, but honestly, I was satisfied with the amount of enjoyment and time I got out of it. There is also no multiplayer element to this game, some people may see that as a negative, but to me it's a null point, the game is still a fleshed out single player game.\n\nTo conclude, I really recommend this game, especially to people who have not seen or heard of the TV show before. I went into this completely blind and had an awesome time playing. Fans of the series may want to watch out, as I have read some respectful reviews of people who watch the series, and they say the plot lets this game down. For me, this is a nicely put together single player experience with a good amount of content and some interesting game play elements that should not be missed by any beat'em up fan. I would say that £11,99 is a fair price for the game; so definitely pick this up if you can get it cheaper whilst on sale!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oA3iGYFFuE\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Overall I enjoyed the fighting because its somewhat diversified with all the different bending types, blocking and stuff. But I also have a few things which I would be happy about to be added to game (those aren't con arguments, just my own improvement suggestions) we're some more Combos, Scrolls, etc so you are actually able to keep spending your spirit energy. Also Firebending is super strong with especially with some talismans... and it just looks relatively weak comparing to other bending types. I know that you will be able to get all archievements within 10 hours... but the final medals gave me some sort of motivation to really finish the game...\nOne thing I really miss about The Legend of Korra is: Trading Cards - it would be so much more beautiful to have those!\nso here my conclusion:\nIf you are an Avatar fan and you have a few bucks left, make sure to\npurchase the game and give it a try!\nFor me it was worth it every single cent\nI hope I was able to help you :)\n","January 5, 2015","true","178.9"," 84 of 92 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","84","92","4","3"

Their experience with the action genre shows and manifests itself by proven ingredients: fast-paced combat, counters, unlockable moves and, of course, the dreaded quick time events. Without them, however, some of Korra's flashier moves simply wouldn't be possible. If you have played games like Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising, you will feel right at home.\n\nAs engaging as kicking around hordes of faceless henchmen is, not even the game's cel-shading look can hide its low production values. Both environments and characters are severely lacking in details and the level structure is rather plain. Like the visuals, the story is barebone as well and hardly uses setting or characters from the series. Depending on your expectations, this could be a real downer.\nThe low budget is also reflected in the game's playtime. You can easily beat it within three to four hours, maybe even less if you're playing on the easiest difficulty. However, this doesn't have to be a negative.\n\nThe Legend of Korra is a small game that jumps right into the action and stays there until the end - straight up fisticuffs with little fluff. It's a nice breather, an ideal snack after one exceedingly long game or in-between two. Nothing wrong with that. However, if you expect strong tie-ins with the TV series or insist on stunning visuals, you may be setting yourself up for a disappointment.","October 24, 2014","true","13.1"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","93","106","0","2"

Cause.. this is a super rare thing that I am about to say..\n\nSomething made after a series actually got it right.\n\nLegend of Korra is third person and was designed for various consoles, so be sure to keep a controller handy, unlike formerly flopped Avatar game adaptations, Legend of Korra was released by Activision. It was finally released on steam October 2014 and was adapted for keyboard configuration. In saying so though, I do not recommend playing it with keyboard and mouse, because it just feels way too clunky.\n\nBasic breakdown of the storyline: obviously, you play as Avatar Korra in an 8 chapter set starting off in the midst of an all out gang war with the Triple Threat Triads within Republic city. The game then goes on to follow a new story that I believe takes place between books two and three after leaving spirit portals open in her world. An old enemy named Hundun returns to take advantage of Korra's mistake and threatens to tilt the balance of the world by using said portals and spirits within it to make his move.\n\nGraphics wise, Legend of Korra is utterly gorgeous. Now putting my bias aside for this kind of art, the game does a spectacular job of carrying the identical style from the series and in doing so makes it an almost movie-like experience at times as it ends up making seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscenes.\n\nGameplay; at the beginning you start playing with all your bending abilities blocked, but are able to flick between the elements for hand-to-hand combat. Now delving into that a little further, rather than just having each one be the same combat animation, the developers took the time to put each bending style in it. Leaving you with the feel that your bending is actually somehow blocked, because you're still doing the same mojo with no outcome. (Quite like Zuko when he lost the drive for his fire bending in The Last Airbender.)\n\nYou are able to unlock each element as time goes by and quickly establish which element is best suited to you, but also how handy and powerful it is to flick between the four of them.\nCounter attacks are also pretty smooth but leave a bit to be desired after a while within boss fights as it's generally the same action and outcome each time leaving that satisfied feeling in the dust at times. Also in that same breath, bosses only really have three or four different attacks, so the fights just become tedious after a brief period of time. That being said in the final boss fight, the last strikes leave you feeling so satisfied and happy with the outcome, finishing the chapter on quite a high note.\n\nThe Naga running sequences have to be one of my most disliked parts of this game as they are the stereotypical -run with very little control and try not to die every time- kind of thing. After the initial one or two running sets, you have the ability to earth bend to help you jump and also fire bend to blast obstacles out of the way which does add a little bit more to it, but for me personally, these couldn't have been over soon enough.\n\nThe game also offers a tonne of fan service which for hardcore fans like myself, is a huge thing in of itself. -Insert cabbage joke here-\n\nMoving onto the sountrack.. For the most part, it stays true to what is in the Legend of Korra series but it mainly reuses the same 3 background tracks for pre-fights, fights and Naga running sequences. Though it uses it in specific spots like in The Last Airbender series where each character had a unique piece of music playing to serve as their intro, this however, was horribly done and drove me utterly insane. For me personally I found this to be something that left a huge hole in the game, not to mention an annoying little thing I couldn't help but remember when watching the cartoon. Had they put a more diverse list of tracks, that would have been fantastic.\n\nConclusion: Now, here is where my opinion is off with the fairies in two different directions -  even though I loved the gameplay and a lot of the storyline, the game as a whole was a little bit too linear, flat and controlled.\n\nYes, the ending was amazing and left you with a satisfied feeling, but the game as a whole did not. It was a lot of "go here, defeat this, go there, defeat that," with a bit of dribbled plot in between each of these. It just feels as though it doesn't have a core drive to the storyline, other than being an excuse to make an arcade beat 'em up. That being said, it does all come together well and I did enjoy playing it. The ending really did a lot for the whole game in all honesty, especially after watching the Korra series, the fan service is fantastic and it offers a great send off.\n\nAll in all, it was a win as a whole and I really would recommend giving it a go, especially if you are a new or old fan of the Avatar series.","July 8, 2015","true","42.0"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","65","73","4","0"

If you are unfamiliar with Korra you will get nothing out of this game.\n\nStory:\nThe story is pretty weak. Only 3 characters involved with no depth to the plot. It's mostly "THIS IS BAD GUY. HE IS BAD. GO DEFEAT AND BEAT UP EVERYONE IN YOUR PATH." Only 8 missions which you can beat in 3-4 hours. You can replay levels with your current upgrades on different difficulties but thats about it. There's a pro-bending mode but there's not much there either.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is pretty fun but tends to get repetitive (especially the final boss). There's very few enemy types and you fight just reskins of the Triads quite a few times. There is some platforming sprinkled between combat. Platforming is just ok. A bit floaty and forgiving and no challenge at all. After some missions there is a Naga running minigame which is just your average endless runner clone. Overall the gameplay does make it worth playing but not for the $15 price.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game does a good job at emulating the art style of the show. While it may not be the best looking game out there, it still is very pretty at times with good textures and AA that actually works.\nThe graphics options are very poor. You have fullscreen on or off, resolution, and 2 graphics presets: normal or smooth. There is very little difference between normal and smooth. There are no advanced graphics options at all. The game runs fantastic though. I can't see this game running bad on any system.\n\nOther:\nNo rebindable keys\n\nI do recommend this game only if you are a fan of Korra.

Sadly, this game is one of my least favorites of all time.  Here's why.\n\nFEATURES\n\nGame is really short.  8 Chapters each beatable in about 20 minutes or so.  Most of the game is about going back and earning the best medals through each chapter, which is hard because the medal is an average score overall medals earned in the chapter.\n\nThe game is comprised of 2 modes.  Standard beat'em up levels and Temple Runner races.  There's also a "Pro-Bending" mode after you beat the game once but after beating the game twice I didn't really feel like playing it.  There are segments in the main game mode that give you a gist of what it is and it's not really all that fun.  There are Naga races inbetween missions that are like something you would find in a Mobile App Runner game.  You run straight, and hit left/right/jump.  It's really feels like it's just there to fill space. I was really hoping for more than just a linear beat-em-up with short Naga races inbetween as filler content.\n\nThere is a shop where you spend Spirit Tokens on equipables/consumables and moves for each style of bending.  The shop is small, though.  About 10 talismans total, with 2-3 moves per bending style and a handful of consumables.  There's also Korra's Room, which is just a menu screen to change outfits.  Most outfits are just reskins of the same outfit.  2 of the 5 outfits you have to unlock via a secret code.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nThe combat is "Press X/Left-Click 'X' amount of times then Y/Right-Click 'X' amount of times."  Charging X/Y builds your Spirit which allow for more powerful attacks.  You also can time blocks for quick counter attacks that use QTE segments.  Stronger enemies can also counter, which brings up another QTE for you to counter their counter.  Overall the gameplay feels smooth and the animations are pretty sweet.  If you're expecting something high grade you'll be sadly disappointed as the combat in this game is really bare bones button mashing with well timed blocks/dodges.  While dodging all attacks go through you as well, so you don't even really need to move out of the way when you dodge.\n\nYou attack with Fire, Earth, Wind and Water.  Fire is the worst out of the 4 and is poorly represented in this game.  Mostly close ranged attacks, and nearly every attack somehow never wants to hit your target.  Water is the first one you get, and is mostly long ranged quick attacks with medium range heavy attacks.  Earth is slow burst damage and is easily the hardest hitting element at your disposal, but it's slowness makes it a double edged sword leaving you open to attacks during your combos.  Air is the most powerful element as it has mostly AOE attacks with a crap ton of crowd control.  Simply put, as soon as you get air everything dies.\n\nAt the very end of the game you unlock the Avatar state which slowly charges (very slowly) over time.  Once you activate it you become unkillable and deal massive damage to everything.  It lasts for about 20 seconds but that's more than enough time to destroy everything except for the final boss which seems to be resistant to everything you throw at it.\n\nEvery other boss in the game is a Mecha-Tank.  They're more like minibosses actually.  There's one segment where you fight a big spirit instead of a tank, but it's pretty much the same thing.  The only real boss is the last boss and he is a giant HP pool with unblockable attacks and AoE's.  You don't really learn anything about him other than that The Avatar destroyed his body in a past life and he wants revenge.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story is really lackluster as well.  It's basically Korra, and Ginora as Navi, then the Main Villain. It's really disappointing that they didn't feel the need to have more of the characters from the show in the game.  Makko and Bolin make a short appearance at the beginning and have 2 or 3 lines of dialog but that's about it.  You don't see any other characters from the show besides Korra and Ginora through 99% of the game.  Sadly, Ginora isn't played by the same actor from the show either, although she does a decent job at trying to imitate her.\n\nThe animated cutscenes are colorful, but they are choppy.  Sometimes it looks like a short slideshow.  It's not bad but it doesn't compare to the Animated Series at all.  Voice acting is good at least.  The only one who talks through nearly all the cutscenes is Korra so don't expect much dialog.   I think some sound clips are actually from the show itself, I could be wrong though.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics feel like they are a PS2 or GCN game from the 1st generation of games.   The textures are really bland and the level design is linear as you can get.  Some textures even look so poor it seems like they are from a PSX game.  The levels are nearly all a straight line with some offshoots that lead to chests with nothing useful in them.  They just give you more experience/cash.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverall I was disappointed in the end but the ride was pretty fun. The whole game kind of felt like one big tutorial.  Once you get the 4 elements to bend it's pretty much over about an hour later.\n\nI'll probably get a few more hours out of it.  If you're a fan of the show or you just want a quick beat-em-up game to kill a few hours then it's worth the fifteen clams. You'd probably be better off waiting for it to go on a sale, though.  It's a budget title and the end result really shows that Activision/Nick didn't want to spend any real money to produce this game.","October 23, 2014","false","5.7"," 89 of 127 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","89","127","2","2"

Definitely recommend if you're an Avatar fan and want to beat up some baddies. *NOTE: If you're gonna buy this game, I really recommend a controller. This just doesn't seem like it would be very fun at all with a keyboard.\n\nPros:\n-Beating up baddies as the Avatar is fun and it feels great.\n-Art style and animation fits in well with the show.\n-Uses the opening credits and end credits of the show. Very simple. I like simple.\n-Cutscenes use the animation style from the show. They're nice and short.\n-Pro-bending mode is fun.\n-Bending is done well. Looks nice, feels good.\n-Gameplay is simple and quite enjoyable.\n-As you play, you get used to the combo system. It's deep enough to have fun with, especially with the bending styles that you can play through the game in different ways.\n-Bending elements are actually useful in various situations.\n-You feel super strong by the end of the game. Like super strong. That's all I wanted, you know? I want a short game where I suck at the beginning but I'm OP by the end. That's what you get.\n-They got the voice actors! And they do a good job.\n-Story is fine. Pretty standard, but pretty much all you need to fight some bad guys.\n-When you get the speed upgrade, you kind of feel like a ninja. Feels good.\n-Air sphere. Cute.\n-At first I thought that having an Avatar-based temple-run game at the end of some levels was stupid, but then I realized that I enjoy Temple run.\n-Game is only $15, which isn't bad.\n-New Game Plus mode. Yes. I love New Game Plus. I want all games to have a New Game Plus mode.\n\nCons:\n-story is pretty short. Takes only like 3 hours or something to clear it on normal.\n-difficulty curve isn't perfectly balanced. It starts off kinda hard! Like I got killed many many many times! But then as you level up your bending and unlock power-ups, the game balances out.\n-Level design is simplistic.\n-Falling off platforms is lame and I think it takes away from the flow a little bit.\n- Sometimes the camera can be a little awkward. At times there will be a bunch of crap on the screen obstructing your character.","December 19, 2014","true","11.4"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/281690/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Let’s get one thing out of the way first: If you’re a fan of the show looking to immerse yourself in a new story set in the Avatar universe, this is not your game. The story simply serves as a method to move the action from one location to the next and the main conflict in the story, which involves the equalists returning for some reason and robbing Korra of her bending abilities, serves as a way to make Korra powerless at the beginning of the game so the player can regain her powers as they progress through the game.\nYou won’t find any familiar faces outside of Jinora, who serves as your magical plot fairy that reminds Korra of how to use her bending whenever she’s far enough along in the game. Mako and Bolin make a brief cameo at the beginning and end of the game, but for the most part, this is a one woman show. It’s a big shame too because the chemistry between the characters is one of the best aspects of The Legend of Korra. Without it, the dialogue is lifeless and mostly just consists of Korra talking to herself or the nameless thugs she’s beating up.\nAll of the voices from the show return, but seem to lack the quality of direction found in the actual show. Jinora in particular sounds completely different from how she normally sounds, to the point where I actually had to check the credits to make sure she wasn’t a voice match. Even Janet Varney, who typically is fantastic as Korra, has a couple of moments in the game where it feels like she isn’t giving her best reads.\nThe Legend of Korra utilizes a two button combat system that is heavily reliant on counters, very similar to the combat system found in Metal Gear Rising. Lelf mouse button is for quick light attacks, which can be punctuated with a press of right mouse button for a slower heavy attack. Enemies will flash red just before they attack to let the player know when to counter, but the timing window is very strict and enemies have multiple attacks. Some even have attacks that cannot be countered and instead must be dodged, and all of these attacks have different timing windows.\nKorra eventually gains access to all four of her bending powers, each one with its own particular use. Water bending is great for attacking enemies from a far distance, earth bending is ideal for dealing with large enemies with tons of health, air bending is the best at dealing with massive amounts of enemies all at once, and fire bending is there for those who like to show off with fancy air combos.\nThe more you use a particular bending discipline, the more you level it up, and the more powerful it becomes. It’s entirely possible, and probably even advisable, to get through the game by sticking with one type of bending and maxing it out, as the game’s enemies show no sort of elemental weakness whatsoever. It’s too bad that the game makes no effort to get the player to switch up their powers mid fight, because that’s where the combat system truly shines. It does a great job of making Korra feel like the powerful badass she is when you manage to stomp the ground and summon a pillar to send an enemy flying, then follow them up with a firebending air combo to send them back down to the ground, where you crash into them like a rocket powered by airbending.\nThe levels however, are not so fantastic. Environments are repetitive, lack detail, and level design is as basic as you can get. Korra gets led from one corridor to the next, beating up enemies, breaking pots and barrels for extra spirit energy, and occasionally finding a chest down the one path that doesn’t lead to the next enemy encounter.\nUltimately, The Legend of Korra: The Game is not much different from your typical licensed game cash in. It feels cheap, it feels rushed, and it is also very short. If you’re like me — an action game nut — and you jump at the opportunity to become absorbed in a great new combat system set in the world of one of your favorite cartoons, then give Legend of Korra a try. Otherwise stay away. Overall 6/10.","July 10, 2015","true","11.8"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","0"

You buy it, thinking you can handle it. "How bad could it be," you ask, "That child over there has it, how bad could it be?" Your face turns red, and you go into a coughing fit.\nThat, is Legend of Korra.\nAt heart, this game is a normal fighter. It can be a bit repetitive, but for me the story makes up for it. The cutscenes are "eeeeh," as most of the time the people talk, but yet their mouths don't move. This is the case for the "in-game cutscenes" as I like to consider them. The actual cutscenes are okay, given a look of the show, but with lower quality animation. Speaking of the show...\nJust in case you were not aware, this game is based on a show on Nickelodeon (I know, shocker!) with the same name, which is the spinoff of Avatar: The Last Airbender. There is a lot of storyline in those 2 shows that lead up to this game, so I suggest watching before playing.\n\nLong Review\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 9\nStory/Lore: 10\nControls (Keyboard) 2\nControls (Controller) 7.5\nBONUS: Bending: 10\nBONUS: Spirit Shop: 10\nTotal: 8.14\n\nGraphics: Although the game has graphics expected from this type of game, being cell shading, it's pretty lame when it comes to the graphic options. You have 2 choices for graphics; Normal and Smooth, the latter being a faster running version for not as good computers. "But hey," you, the possible buyer asks, "At least you have SOME options." Haha, that's funny... You're serious? No, there is no subtitles, no fps changing, you can change brightness, resolutions, fullscreen, and, like before, 2 graphic options.  The resolution, however, goes up to 1920x1080, which is pretty good.\n\nGameplay: Now, the game gets a bit repetitive from time to time, especially on the mini-bosses, and the Temple Run Naga runs, which to me are the worst part about the game, more on that later. However, this game, as stated before, is very difficult. Now, not like "solving a complicated puzzle on your own" kind difficult, like a "The enemies are 10x stronger then me" kind of difficult. However, killing your first giant robot really makes you feel like a badass. This gives you a sense of completion once you beat that one level you've been trying to beat for an hour, and you finally beat it. The Naga "Minigame," where you have to navigate your way to the end, with multiple obstacles along the way, which to me is just something to increase the playtime. This game also has a gametype unlocked after you beat the game, called Pro-Bending, which is this:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=334343122\nBasically, it's a 3v3, where you and your team, the Fire Ferrets, fight 5 enemies per difficulty It's kinda hard for me to explain, so read about it here.[avatar.wikia.com]. Yeah. Now let me tell you, it isn't that hard on the first 2 difficulties, but the last fight on Ace is hell.\n\nStory/Lore: Now, having 2 series, spanning over a whopping SIX years, it gives you quite a bit to work with, and... Well, they didn't use what they were given. I haven't been caught up on LoK, only watching Season One, so I don't know much about the story, but it seems like a little non-canon story, like the extras you find on the DVD Releases. The game story itself is pretty basic, although the lore of the main antagonist I found interesting. Above all else, it has a major  "Oh my goooooood!" Trolls 2-esque scream, on the final level, no spoilers though.\n\nControls (Keyboard): Now, I actually had to go and try the game with a keyboard when I got here, as I always played with a controller.\nIt's bad. Like, really bad.\nThe camera controls are awful on keyboard, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to block. I'm making this short, because there isn't much to say about it, excecpt about how terrible it is. It was an experience that I never want to try again, and now I know that there is a solid reason for them suggesting a controller at the start of the game. I physically HURT when I play with a keyboard, it is that bad.\n\nControls (Controller): Played with a wireless Xbox 360 controller.\nThis game rocks with a controller. It plays very smoothly, and everything feels in place. The camera is easier to control, but still not "good." You can easily maneuver, wether it be around the map or out of your foe's way, you will have no issue. Still, with the only control option being "Vibrate," invert-Axis for X and Y, and camera sensitivity, it's pretty lacklustered. so I took 2 points off of both control ratings.\n\nBending: The bending in this game is something amazing. Each element is played how they should be, and how they are in the series. Fire is super fast combos, Earth is slow and clunky, but super powerful, and Air is a powerful AoE. Water is the element you start off with, and is sorta inbetween Fire and Earth. It is also good when you lock on, as the water bolts will travel all the way and attack them, making it the element with the best range. You unnlock  these 4 elements over time, respectively. This may be because of what happens in the game, and not because learning it the first time, but you go water, earth, fire, wind, which most Avatar nerds know isn't right, only slightly off, being that air bending is supposed to be the easiest to learn. However, this may have been done on purpose, to signify the order in which she unlocked them in the series.\n\nSpirit Shop: The Spirit Shop is like any other vendor/merchant in other games, they sell you consumables and whatnot. In this game, you have 3 options to pick from:\nConsumables\nScrolls/Elemental Books\nTalismansConsumables is self explanitory, Scrolls and Elemental Books give you powers, which you can unlock as you scale your bending powers. Talismans are equipables that gives you certain buffs and debuffs. Example: Get double health, but half the power. This allows for more interesting gameplay, as you can change up your play style. You can be a tank with little damage, or a glass cannon that destroys everything, but dies in 2 hits.\n\nTotal: Overall, this game is very much worth the $15, and I have no regrets buying it.\nThanks to Paranoia for helping me out!","October 31, 2014","true","19.8"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","37","44","0","0"

I've seen some from Avatar: The Last Airbender and check sometimes the wiki. I must say that I've come late in the fandom but well...\n\nYet, I've bought the game. In this game, the story is set after Season 2 and before Season 3. Korra is defied by an ancient evil and looses her bending. She will regain it back but piece after piece. Will you survive an attack with Dark Spirits, Equalists and Triads?\n\nKorra is the main protagonist but Jinora is making an appearance through spiritual projection, Naga is present during her own running sequences, Mako and Bolin are still your teammates for the pro-bending tournament, which is set apart the main story and well, you'll give more work to Asami Sato given the fact that you're destroying many Satomobiles. Iroh is also making an appearance because you can buy stuff from his shop.\n\nHowever, Korra is really all alone and I'm kinda sad not to see the rest of the team.\n\nThe gameplay is more a beat'em up/rpg style though you're seeing a lot of actions. Every step you're taking will be met by enemies (benders and non-benders). Each time you're using one of your elements, you'll level it, so that you can unlock new combos. You can also use items to heal yourself or to enhance your powers. Notice that you'll use also the Avatar State.\n\nAlso, what is cool is that you can play levels after beating it, mainly because you have chests behind an element plate: if you didn't unlock it, you can't open them. Besides, these chests are often containing collectibles. And breaking elements are also healing you or helping you to get your spirit high.\n\nThere are Naga running sequences, where your goal is to arrive somewhere by avoiding any obstacles. With elements you'll unlock, you can use them for jumping higher, going faster, protecting yourself, etc.. Besides, be sure to master that because you'll need it in the higher difficulty of the game as you're also fighting mecha-tanks.\n\nThe pro-bending tournament is a nice feature too apart that as Korra, when you're knockdown, it's an automatic lost match. There are three difficulties and the last one is really a challenge. The Wolfbats are present and so is Tahno. He's the only opponent that will speak to you during a match.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good. Given the fact that The Legend of Korra is a cartoon, it's normal that the game stays in that style. The soundtrack is good and the voice acting is great.\n\nI loved the game, the controller is really useful in that case. The challenges are nice, though I've kinda found some battles a little hard when you're in the easy difficulty, the little platform in 2D view has made fall a lot of time and I may have cursed some Naga sequences in the higher difficulty. However, the game is well-balanced, fun enough and with varied places (Air Temple Island, Republic City, South Pole, Spirit World).\n\nI'm recommending that game. 15 euros is a proper price for it. PS: Korrasami shippers, there is no Asami/Korra interaction in it (but well, Season 3 and 4 are there anyway, Turtleduck Date Night was also a nice picture and we'll probably have more with the comics arriving).","December 9, 2015","true","24.9"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","41","51","6","0"

It's not a masterpiece, but it's done a very good job of making you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ element bender. The combat is very smooth and well done. Move sequences are actually memorable and you strategically pick what element and combo to use based on your situation. True, many enemies are simply recolored, but most are given additional abilities or a completely different skill set. For a budget game, I have to respect the methods of cost reduction they use. Recoloring already made assets and changing the skills is quite fine in my books. Far better than grinding currency to obtain an item required for the next area. Looking at you castlevania... The game is not pointlessly elongated with such cheap tactics. The game will take around 4 - 7 hours and then you're given pro bending mode, which is hella fun. The AI's are quite balanced and it's not that easy to dominate every match. I got round 1 knock outs for 4/5 matches on the captain difficult and then on the 5th match, I was the first of my team to be knocked into the water! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging.\n\nWhat is lacking to the game is an interesting and detailed story. We know very little about the background of the villian and that just makes us.... not care, but really 90% of my excitment was bending elements and 10% the story when I went into the game. So it doesn't bother me that much. For the game budget, it was made extremely well. Definitely recommend. Considering I'm so dissapointed with CS:GO that I want my $3.75 (sale purchase) refunded and yet I'm totally happy with me being $10 for LoK, that's saying something.","December 5, 2014","true","13.2"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","38","50","0","0"

And it's by Platinum!\n\nThis game is not the best. But it's a very solid 8/10. It's relatively short(I beat it completely on the highest difficulty in a little under 6 hours, with 90% of the achievements), and you can tell they didn't have a huge budget, but the game itself just feels very good to play.\n\nThe story is incredibly lackluster, explained only in a few cutscenes and in-game dialogue, but it was written by the creators. Most of the voices are from the voice actors of the show, which is a nice touch.\n\nGameplay is very solid, with the different elements feeling the way they should. Earth is heavy and ponderous but does high damage, fire is quick but agile, air has lots of sweeping hits, water is your at-range fighting stance, etc.\n\nThe enemies are pretty underwhelming in terms of variability, but the devs work around having only about ten different models by swapping colors and abilities, size changes, etc. You'll roll your eyes a bit towards the end of the game at how quickly they ruse models, but it's still satisfying to fight all of them.\n\nEach level is interspersed by infinite-runner like stages on Naga(Korra's pet polar-bear-dog thing). These I think are actually the weakest part of the game, since I found myself just rushing through them and hoping to finish them quick as possible(and one of them on the highest difficulty is absolutely annoying).\n\nSounds are good, with voice actors where appropriate, and music themed to the show, but nothing amazing.\n\nThe camera actually works very well(excepting a few issues when in a boss arena and close to a wall, but that's the same issue in every game of this genre), and thecontrols are incredibly tight. There's no double jump(which is a shame), but you get used to it.\n\nThere's an optional component called 'Pro-bending', based off a sport from the show. This is actually very fun! The later challenges has the computer cheating a bit I think, but it's doable and feels like a worthy challenge. Honestly my biggest complaint here is that there's no vs. or co-op or online play. I'd pay fifteen bucks just for an online version of the probending game!","December 14, 2014","true","17.6"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","39","53","0","0"

I know this game has gotten a lot of mixed reviews, but despite my love of avatar, I'm not gonna sit here and defend the hell outta this game. To me personally, I'd say overall I enjoyed the game. It's not the best game by any means, and there were a lot of things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about it, but it was still fun for me. I liked the story, and how it seems to tie in to book 3 nicely, but there's a lot of cons. I dodn't like how empty republic city was. You've got this huge vibrant city from the shoe, with NOTHING but enemies, and the occasional moving satomobile in the distance. Literally no characters from the show appear aside from Korra, spirit Jinora, and mako & bolin for like 5 seconds. The combat was the other thing that bothered me. It got insanely repetitive. Having only 2 buttons for combat was really a turn off for me. I also disliked the lack of different moves, and not being able to combine all the elements. I also hated how easy the game got once you unlocked the avatar state. LIke, my strategy was just airbend, avatar state, repeat. It was even more op when i grinded and got the item that keeps chi fully charged. I also didn't care for the counter system, as it rarely worked for me. Other than that, the only other things that bugged me were the random glitches, and the lack of thought in relation to bending. Like being able to earthbend anywhere bugged me. Last i checked, earthbenders can't earthbend on wood standing over a bottomless pit. Overall though, I'd say I recommend the game if you have the patience, or like these kinds of games. I had higher expectations for the game, but for $15, it was a decent game.","October 25, 2014","true","9.5"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helloiamali/recommended/281690/","helloiamali","Ali of Uckfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helloiamali/","114 products in account","I can think of three reasons you may want this game:\n\n1.	You are a big fan of Avatar/Korra.\n2.	Arkham Knight is not out yet.\n3.	You are a big fan of Avatar/Korra, and Arkham Knight is not out yet.\n\nI think the best thing I can say about The Legend of Korra is that it’s priced perfectly.\n\nNow, the reason I say this is because it definitely feels like a budget game; the cell-shaded graphics, while definitely good-looking, capturing the hand-painted look and feel of the Avatar universe, are certainly not quite up to scratch with other recent cell-shaded titles, such as the upcoming Dragon Ball: Xenoverse or Naruto Shipuden: Ultimate Ninja Generations Super Ultimate Whatever Fighting Storm Revolution 3 or whatever the hell that game is called. The lack of an anti-aliasing option, I feel, is a major contributor to this, as is the lack of a fancy lighting system. But, like I say, it’s a budget game; there’s only so much you can expect, and it does well with what it has, overall.\n\nOn top of this, the in-game animations look a touch clunky at times, and enemy variety is a commodity; they’re not fooling anyone by recoloring the triads every 20 minutes. The camera also left a little to be desired; it often leaves you having to assume the claw-position with your controller to adjust it mid-combat. With this said, the cutscene animations are fabulous, and could have been ripped straight from the show itself.\n\nThe combat system is, overall, well made; the game does a good job at introducing you to the four bending styles, and giving you a feel for the weight and timing required for each one very quickly thanks to the games intro sequence. A flaw with it, however, is that it does inadvertently encourage you to power level with one, and leave the rest behind.\n\nThe blocking/countering system works whenever the hell it feels like it, and the way it warns you of an incoming attack bears only a vague relationship as to when the attack it’s warning you about will take place. On top of this, the red glow which warns you of an incoming attack tends to blend in with the environment or large crowds, which at many points caused me to abandon any kind of real tactics and spam X vaguely in the direction of fools that needed defeating; you likely won’t need to buy any extra combos or attacks to pass through tricky sections, with perhaps the exception of the final boss.\n\nI’m coming off way more cynically than I intended. I like the game, just to bring you up to speed.\n\nThe voice talent from the show is a welcome addition, lending the game a sense of authenticity. The games plot slips conveniently between seasons 2 and 3, true, not without a few raised eyebrows and excuses, but nonetheless it fits well. The games story is serviceable, with enough intrigue and mystery to make you want to know what will happen next and who the villain is, and what his beef with the Avatar is, even though it rarely rises above “Punch the bad guys!”\n\nThe Naga sections are a blatant, albeit well-made clone of Temple Run; you catch the gems by dodging, ducking, jumping and turning as you gradually pick up speed. Overall, they feel a little thrown in, and I would have preferred a Naga-cuddling minigame, but with the exception of the hair-pulling final Naga section, they’re not too bad. They bulk out the games run-time, if nothing else.\n\nThe games run time is what you’d expect for the price; I blasted through to story end in 5 hours, (in fact, I write this immediately after beating it; perhaps a re-review will be warranted after a second, more analytical and relaxed-paced playthrough) but beating the game brings a pro-bending mode and a new difficulty setting (I’ve always thought it a little cheap when the hardest difficulty mode is an unlockable, but whatever), plus there are numerous outfits and smirk-worthy vanity items to unlock throughout the game. So, overall, a decent amount of replayability. On a side note, I would totally buy a stand-alone Pro-Bending game if it had online multiplayer.\n\nDespite coming off far more negatively than I intended, I really enjoyed this game for what it was. Assuming Arkham Knight is not out yet, give this game a go!\n","October 23, 2014","true","5.0"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","35","47","0","0"

Story is kinda meh, fit in after the events in Book 2. And it's very short, I can finished within 3 hours. Only 4 characters from the series make appearance; Mako and Bolin (only in pro-bending), Jinora (in spirit form) and Iroh (in spirit shop). I wish I could see more characters like Tenzin and Zuko (although he only appears in Book 3). Enemies are mostly chi blockers and Triple Triad gang, and color swapped. Spirits also appear as enemies to fight. Big enemies only mech and giant spirits. Soundtrack are bland and hardly noticeable other than the ones from the series.\n\nThe best part is the combat. Some kind of trademark from Platinum Games. Simple enough for button mashing casuals and deep enough for those combo-centric players. You can string between light attack and heavy attack into combos and you can string between different elements. You can charge the chi meter to increase the strength of the elements and use special moves like teleport attack for firebending. You can also buy combos using the spirit energy at the shop. Some of the moves are taken from the series like the airball. You can also equip talisman to improve your stats before playing.\n\nPro-bending mode which is unlocked after you finished the game is good mini game. It's the same one from the series, including the rules. It's a good game to practise your counter attack as this game heavily rely on it. Too bad no multiplayer for this. Could be fun sparring against other player.\n\nIf you're looking for games with good story, this one is probably not for you, especially if you're not a fan of the Avatar series. But if you're Korra's fan and loves this kind of game, then you should buy it.","October 23, 2014","true","14.0"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","28","35","2","0"

Yes, it is a Platinum game. It's short, but priced appropriately. There's not much variety in enemy design, but they're challenging and different enough to not be samey. If you're a fan of the show, you'll certainly like the game more than someone who doesn't, but the core gameplay is great as always with Platinum, with lots of hidden depth, and just like Metal Gear Rising, the PC version is excellent: it doesn't need to install DirectX redistributables or whatnot, it just opens, and it opens in a window, which I prefer. I also like how when you change resolutions, it does so on the fly, without having to hit "apply". There aren't a huge amount of PC specific options, which would probably be annoying if it wasn't so silky smooth and optimized.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/281690/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:The Legend of Korra is a third-person brawler game based on TV series of the same title. Since I haven't seen Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, I don't know anything about the series but it doesn't matter much since the game itself doesn't have any complex plot - your bending skills are stolen by a bad guy, so you must restore your powers and then kick his butt.\n\nIt started pretty good, with faster paced combat and movement, but after I got to the second half of the game, I just got enough. The combat is repetitive because of constant recycling of all enemies, incuding bosses. Having one boss three times in two levels is just disappointing. I understand the game didn't have a big budget but this ruins the whole impression.\n\nYou might be surprised that the game actually offers a good challenge even in normal difficulty, only smashing buttons won't save you - you'll have to correctly time your blocking or dodging. When I found the boss' unblocked attack cost me half of my health (on normal difficulty), it reminded me Dark Souls (for kids). But don't worry, it's not that hard, you just have to find the optimal strategy for your playthrough.\n\nThe visual style reminded me of Naruto games, which are ok, with cutscenes that look like they were cut directly from TV series. There's nothing to reproach there as the environment and atmosphere are fitting great to the game.\n\nOverall, I don't think this game is worth recommending as there are definitely better games in the similar genre you can spend your money on. I wanted to give it a try, ignore some lacks there and there, but in the end the enemy recycling made me realize I wasn't having fun at all.\n\nPros:- Difficulty settings. There's a difficulty for newbies and for those who want to have at least some small challenge (you'll have to block and dodge, and also probably buy and use healing potions and other buffs). Also, if you finish the game, you unlock even harder difficulty.\n- Runner-style interludes. I've read more hateful people in discussions about that but I actually liked to get a pause from some action to just keep dodging obstacles.\n- Nice visual style.\n- Cool cutscenes.\n- Controller support.\n\nCons:- Gets repetitive pretty fast. So fast that you may not even finish the game. (And it's not that long, at least like others and Howlongtobeat say.)\n- Enemy recycling. As I already mentioned - having to fight one boss three times during two levels, meanwhile dealing with same small enemies anywhere, is disappointing. It's just a lower fun for every same enemy beaten.\n- Problematic camera. Though that's a problem in most third-person games that you play with a controller, so... it depends on your demands and expects.\n- You can't skip boss introduction cutscenes, so if you get stuck somewhere, you might get annoyed by those, taking every second of your (at the moment) frustrated life.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 11","false","2.7"," 87 of 142 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","87","142","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterliev/recommended/281690/","misterliev","Insert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterliev/","281 products in account","Well well well. I legitimately don't understand why this game got such terrible scores from some big-name review sites. Overall this game delivered a pretty damn enjoyable experience, despite some minor bugs here and there.\n\nStory's pretty meh, but it serves as a decent backdrop for all of the bending ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you'll be engaged in. Graphics are alright, with a pretty (at least, in my opinion) cel-shaded look to it. Combat, however, is the part that shines about this game.\n\nYou start with no bending available to you, eventually regaining each element one by one and leveling them up. There's a decent amount of depth in the fighting mechanics, with a block/counter and dodge available to you, and each bending type having its own style. Waterbending with ranged attacks, earthbending with slow, heavy attacks that break blocks, firebending for rushing down enemies and lots of stun with its speed, and airbending for area of effect crowd control attacks, all of which you can switch between mid-combo.\n\nYou can purchase new combos and items (including some passive ones, that give effects such as doubling your damage and halving your health, or vice versa) through a shop in between missions. Currency is earned via destructable objects, pro-bending, opening chests and defeating enemies. Completing different scenarios earns you medals (bronze, silver, gold, platinum) that reward you depending on how well you do.\n\nLoK is a pretty short game, the main story lasting around 3-4 hours. Some segments are a bit annoying, most notably the buggy Naga runs, but luckily they don't last long. Beating the game unlocks Extreme difficulty and Pro-Bending Mode, the former of which being a really fun challenge to play through, with all of your bending unlocked from the start and added difficulty, it can get pretty crazy. Pro-bending is a fun little distraction, but your A.I. teammates are crappy, even with all of your bending at max level in the main game (which apparently makes them more effective).\n\nOverall, I've had some great fun with the game. Decent challenge and replayability with some fun combat mechanics. It's not amazing or anything, but it was everything I expected from a low-budget game developed by Platinum.\n\njk it's fuggin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥","October 24, 2014","true","9.0"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

Now, I actually know nothing about the show and how good or bad the transition from animation to game is - but I am kinda interested to see what the show is all about now, because Korra is pretty cool and whoever is doing the voice work did a great job at making her really likeable (also, there is one particular line in the showdown that is downright badass!). Heck, the game doesn't even have a storyline worth mentioning (bad guy steals your powers, you get your powers back, kick ♥♥♥ showdown)  and the character is still pretty cool - so, the writers certainly knew what they were doing.\n\nIt is a good thing that the game holds up as well. But who expected anything less considering this is done by Platinum Games, right? Of course this ain't no Vanquish or Bayonetta - but considering the low-low price, the likely target audience for this game and the source material, I think they done a good job of making a game that can still be taken serious as a game on its own instead of just being fanservice that is only relevant if you are in this fandom.\n\nGameplay is mostly comparable to other PG games as well as Devil May Cry, God of War and some such. Meaning you punch, kick, element-bend, counter and dodge your way through an army of goons, robots and Ghibli movie dropouts. It's linear and to the point, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Thanks to the high speed and the massive powers that Korra will sooner or later wield the game managed to stay fresh and entertaining. Most enemies have a sort of popcorn-quality to them, they tend to hit hard (especially if you play on a higher difficulty) but they yield to your elemental onslaught in no time. In fact, that is the best aspect about the entire game - you will feel incredibly good zipping over the screen and unleashing fire, water, earth and wind on hordes of clone troopers. There is a real sense of might and everything is just so fast and frantic - it is just plain old fun. You know, like a proper videogame!\n\nEven though there are level-ups (unlocking extended combos) and some super-light RPG-elements in form of various talismans you can equip - none of this is keeping the game from being all about wrecking face. You will not sit down and grind XP to do cool ♥♥♥♥. Cool ♥♥♥♥ is build in right from the start, and all you ever do by playing more is making that ♥♥♥♥ become even cooler. It is just so straightforward, I am loving it!\n\nNow, this wouldn't be a PG game if it didn't have some quirks and issues - especially the camera can be a right pain at times. The Naga sequences (you running along an obstacle course, riding a polarbear-dog-hybrid), while breaking up the brawling, didn't do much for me. Many times the game isn't quite clear about what can be countered (for example, some enemies flash red when they are about to attack others do not - but their attacks can still be countered). And by the gods, new and old ones alike, I hate the inconsistent ranking system (basically, each fight rewards things like hits taken, time taken or counter-attacks differently - a silver medal and a platinum medal can often times just be one counter-attack apart). So, yeah - this game ain't perfect.\n\nBUT, doing that Chi-Level 3 hurricane kick and seeing that hit counter go way beyond the 100hits still rocks so much, that I will recommend this to anyone who wants a short and flashy brawler that doesn't have a mile high skill ceiling and can be completed in a day or two.

I consider myself a part of the PC Master Race, and buy PC versions whenever possible.\n\nBottom-line:\nThis is a Platinum-LITE game. You can finish the main content in about 3-5 hours. It does not have the sophistication of a game like Bayonetta, but it's still solid mechanically. Keep in mind that the fan base of this series are young children. If you are a fan of The Legend of Korra animated series anyway though, you will find enjoyment from this title. If you don't know or care for  The Legend of Korra series and are looking for a mature core title then avoid it.\n\nStory:\nIt's like any other episode of The Legend of Korra. It isn't remarkable in any way, but it's not horrible either. Just mediocre.\n\nMechanics:\nThe combat consists of the following inputs: (L) attack, (H) attack, Block/Counter, and 2 buttons that rotate between 4 elements which progressively unlock through the story. If you time your block correctly you enter a slow-mo QTE, and by pressing the button prompted you can do additional damage. Each elemental style has 3 predetermined combos that are unlocked as you level up a specific element and by buying books/scrolls in the shop.\n\nCombos: screenshot\n\nThere are a couple runner stages where Korra rides her trusty Polar bear dog Naga in a mini-game. These stages are quite similar in structure to BIT TRIP Runner mechanically, but follow a corridor instead of side-scrolling.\n\nThere is also a shop where you can buy combo upgrades, passive equipable items, as well as usable health potions and such.\n\nSpecial Notes:\nThe audience for this title is quite obvious: The Legend of Korra is a series intended for children,\nand the majority of the fan base is of course, children. So it's logical then that this game was designed with its fan base's age group in mind. If you're looking for a core title designed for a mature audience then this may lack the sophistication you are looking for. If you consider yourself a part of the mature audience but are still a fan of the series, then you will find enjoyment from this title as I have.\n\nPC Master Race Issues:\nGraphics options: Graphics Options ...yeah -_-\nBinding options: Key Binding Options ...yeah -_-\n\nEven though I am unhappy about the port, I can give it a pass because it's a $15 budget title with animated cutscenes and voice acting.  If you are extremely port sensitive however, DO NOT purchase this game.\n","October 23, 2014","true","8.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","4"

The show is currently on its fourth and last season , and it becomes more awesome after each episode.\nNow that the main characters are not kids anymore, the show appeals to older audiences.\nThis game is made by Platinum games, makers of Bayonetta 1/2, Vanquish , Metal gear rising: REVENGEANCE and others.\nI looked up the reviews on metacritic when the game came out, and i saw sites like ign or gamespot giving this game a 5 and 4.5 out of 10, and the problem with those reviews is that they are treating this game like a full price title, wich is not, its 15 euros ( or the corresponding in your respective country ). And if you look at some full priced games like Cod or Bf, you get a 2 to 3 hours campaingn and then you have multiplayer, but for people like me, who are not big fans os multiplayer, only get that short campaign out of the money you spent.\nThe legend of Korra delivers a 5-6 campaign depending on your skills and the difficulty you're playing.\nThe story focus around the fact that Korra has to deal with the mistakes and enemies of her previous lives.\n+ The art and animation of the game is pretty good\n+ the combat system is great. The bending animations look awoesome. Everything is fluid and responssive.\n+ the musical score is amazing\n- the game throws the same boss fights over and over again. Some take a lot of time to kill and it becomes really frustrating at times.\n- There are only four enemy types: triads, equalists, mecha tanks and spirits. Of course there are slightly difrent version of each enemie, but still they could at least put some variation.\n- That annoying minigame with Korra's polar bear dog Naga, where you're you need to dodge obstacles, but if you hit an obstacle, you die and go back to the last checkpoint.\n- weak story compared to the show\nOverall, i enjoyed playing this game. It's not great but still it's not bad as some reviews claim. I would only reccomend it for fans of both Korra and platinum.\nIf you want to get introduced into the Avatar universe, this game is not a great start.","October 26, 2014","true","12.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyprotector/recommended/281690/","bootyprotector","Cockblockatiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bootyprotector/","147 products in account","For fans of Avatar universe, who have had to tolerate shovelware on previous-gen consoles and handhelds, the announcement of The Legend of Korra was a shock and godsend. An adaptation featuring Korra, and spearheaded by a dream team of Platinum Games, Tim Hendrick as the writer, and a sizeable amount of input from Bryke themselves, was more than many could have asked for. Some were cautiously optimistic, since licensed titles in general fall short of expectations; in addition, Platinum was engrossed in finishing up work on its major Wii-U exclusive, Bayonetta 2. After spending time with the game, I believe these trepidations are well justified. This game is far from perfect, and it is apparent that Platinum's "B-Team" were tasked with quickly putting together a licensed title. However, for all its flaws, The Legend of Korra manages to provide a challenging and fun spectacle fighter experience, despite the lack of polish.\n\nThe story is bare-bones, and, were it an episode, would easily round out the bottom of the ranks. During the interim between Books 2 and 3, Korra is stripped of her bending (the poor girl, she's been de-bent twice among suffering other ordeals; no wonder she's such a mess at the end of Book 3) and embarks on an extremely linear quest to regain all of her abilities and defeat the old man responsible. Exposition comes through monologues by our protagonist and decently animated cutscenes by Titmouse, responsible for the openings of both the Last Airbender and Legend of Korra. Don't expect any character development; Mako and Bolin are literally thrown out of the story: they are knocked out during the first chapter's pro-bending match and never seen again. Tenzin and his family are conveniently "on vacation," while Asami and others are nowhere to be found. The exception is extra-corporeal floating Jinora, who appears every so often to spout a few platitudes about the schools of bending that lead in to the tasks Korra performs to regain her powers. To be quite honest, I am not particularly bothered by this. The more I play this game, I more I tend to view it as a shooting gallery; targets pop up, and I kick their asses. Story is irrelevant.\n\nWhat does matter is the gameplay, and thankfully this is one facet where the game excels. The fighting system is well-designed; with all four elements having their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal applications. Water is particularly useful for attacking enemies at range, precise strikes, and stunning foes by freezing or grappling them with spouts of water. Earth is slow-moving, but integral to defeating larger enemies, such as bosses, and inflicting tremendous amounts of AOE damage on crowds and disorienting them. Fire finds its niche in head-to-head brawling and racking up combos, while air combines the area-of-effect attacks found in Earthbending with targetted dashes and attacks reminiscient  of Waterbending. Combos are easy to understand and execute, and amount to a sequence of light and heavy attacks. Finishing strikes are activated by a third button, and counters by a simple block, sometimes followed by a series of QTE dodges and counterattacks. All of these work qute well and are satisfying to see. Easily the lowest points of the combat system are the first half-hour of gameplay before Korra gains the use of her first element, and the somewhat wonky camera that occasionally clips through walls and large enemies, or doesn't center on locked-on enemies. There is paltry enemy variety; the main foes you will face are Equalists, dark spirits, Triple Threat Triad members, and mecha-tanks. Aside from brawling, there are several "endless" running sequences where the player dodges obstacles (and later, fights enemies) while riding Naga. They are a nice change of pace, but aren't special when compared to other such games. Finally, a pro-bending mode is unlocked after completing the story mode, which retains most of the bending controls and fuses them with an adapted ruleset of Pro-Bending. It's very engaging, and the matches can get pretty intense.\n\nThe Story mode seems to reward exploration by including collectible items that add to Spirit Energy (the game's currency) and additional encounters. Spirit Energy is also acquired by defeating enemies and destroying scenery objects, which led to an amusing situation where Korra commented on how nice it was to see Republic City rebuilding just after I had her obliterate a Satomobile for spirit monies. It is used to buy items at Iroh's Store, which stocks consumables such as those that restore health, scrolls that unlock new bending moves, and talismans that provide stat buffs.\n\nI've spent about 6 hours on Story mode at normal difficulty. Some acquaintances have managed to beat it in 4. There is some replay value; you can play the story again on Extreme difficulty, attempt to collect treasure, achieve higher scores, and replay the entire campaign with all elements unlocked. For 15 bucks, you're getting at least 5 hours of story play at least, plus whatever you wish to spend on replays and Pro-Bending mode. The vast majority of that time is genuinely entertaining and challenging. I find myself wishing that this game had spent more time in development, because at its core is a simple, yet functional and rewarding combat mechanic; the non-existent "plot" and several technical flaws serve only to detract from what is a decent licensed title. As a fan of the universe and the characters and settings within it, I am grudgingly satisifed. It's a shame that there wasn't an opportunity to add another story to this vibrant world, but in the end, I get to beat up lots of dudes with Korra, and that's all that matters.","October 25, 2014","true","12.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","2"

The game is somewhat "basic" by Platinum Games standards of depth, which in turn makes it a lot more approachable for fans of the show, without being insulting to the Platinum fanbase. This in and of itself is quite the achievement.\n\nThis is a port, and as a member of the "PC Master Race" (tm) I found the lack of customization to be rather apparent, but it runs very well from what I can see.\n\nNow, while the depth might not be as mindcrushing as some other Platinum games, the variation and the flow is VERY well executed, and tickled the side of me that enjoys Lv1 runs in Dark Souls. There is a ton of challenge to be had, and even more options to really whet your appetite as a Platinum fan. And like always, they do not fail to provide a  great Risk/Reward combat system. I have died a few times, but every time I knew exactly why, and how to improve from it.\n\nOh, and for the love of Aang, use a controller.","October 21, 2014","true","36.5"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","30","45","0","0"

It was created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino as a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, which aired from 2005 to 2008. Drawn in a style strongly influenced by Japanese animation, the series is set in a fictional universe in which some people can manipulate, or "bend", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the "Avatar", can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar Korra, the reincarnation of Aang from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\n\nShort, but a really good game. I have seen Avatar: The Last Airbender animation and it was not bad. I didn't see the new episodes, but after playing this game I'm really looking forward to watch it. This game is an action fighting game with a few running missions and pro-bending matches. What is pro-bending you ask? Well it's a sport for benders. It looks very interesting.

It's not an amazing story, there's no innovative gameplay, it's not revolutionary design, but what it is, is an enjoyable beat-'em-up set in the Avatar universe. For the $15 price of admission, you're getting your money's worth. It's a perfect example of why I believe people should never blindly follow internet critics. If you go into this expecting a lengthy RPG with deep elements, you'll be sorely disappointed. But it does provide a few hours of engaging gameplay.

The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they look good enough and are smooth enough that it's more of a happy medium.\n\nBasically, if you want a short but entertaining ride, this game's worth a look.

That's it. Otherwise, you'll just grumble about something. Wait for it to go on sale and then buy it because then you won't complain. Also, what other game can say that they have a My Cabbages!! Achievement? Bottom line, the Activision and Platinum team really worked hard to make a heartfelt Korra game and it shows.\n\nAt the Korra release party by Activision, I got to talk to the devs and producer and although it's not Bayonetta (which took several years), Korra was still made earnestly in a few years. The team watched and really loved Avatar and Korra and got to talk to the creators, Bryke, about every detail in this game. The story telling, the characters, the relationships, and even about the sky in the spirit world depending on the circumstances. They really pay homage to the original Avatar series and make sure that even the pro-bending games follow Bryke's rules (yo the face offs!). Korra's bending is very expansive if you take in the combos and she performs memorable moves that you'll immediately recognize from the show. If you really love the series, you'll enjoy living through this world through Korra.\n\nGameplay wise:\n-It's polished, the graphics are amazing, textures great, idle feature is cute, you'll marvel at it all\n-fighting is intense if you play on normal or extreme, casual is if you're starting or you want to play it easy\n-the dodging and countering systems are enjoyable and quick.

The villain isn't going to pull your heartstrings, but it's food for thought I suppose. The story line isn't going to make you cry unless you remember that Avatar and Korra are now over and this game is all you have other than rewatching both series. Yeah.

There also is not that much background knoledge needed but it helps anyway.\nThe story takes place between the end of season two and season three of the show. So basically, an old strange man attacks you and you fall asleep.When you wake up again all your bending is gone and suddenly there are Chi-Blockers everywhere in the city. You begin to get your bending back element by element starting with water. You begin to try to find out what the old man is trying to do and hunt him down by going to the south pole. I will not tell the story further to avoid spoilers.\n\nGameplayYou attack using the X and Y buttons (I only played it with a controller so I can't really tell you about the KB/M controlls)\nand like other games of the genre these mean heavy and light attack. You can do combos like you would expect but it doesn't get to complicated or detailed with that, you also unlock new combos by leveling up an element and buying them from the shop (with Iroh as the shopkeeper). There also is a block/ counter button (LT) which can be really usefull and needed for the higher difficulty. You can also avoid attacks with RT.\nThe combat is divided into the four elements (which you unlock one by one). Each element is usefull for something else so you have a reason to change you fighting style if the situation demands it (you can change your current element whenever you want). You can also level up an element by defeating enemies to make that element more powerfull and unlocking new combos.\nThe game can also be rather hard at some boss battles so if you are new to the genre i would suggest to train with the "Casual" difficulty a bit.\n\nGraphicsThe game looks nice. Nothing outstanding but it does it job well to keep "The Legend of Korra" art-style. During the game are also a few cutscenes which look just like from the show. The PC port sadly doesn't have many graphics options (actually nothing but the resolution and some details) but that didn't really bother me. The game also runs great.\n\nCollectables and Replay AbilityThere are collectables hidden in chests in the levels which are objects from the show(s) and also features items from Avatar: The Last Airbender. There aren't that many collectables but they are nice to have anyway. There are also items you can buy from the store that can be used as items (activ and passiv items) during gameplay. You can also unlock new costumes for Korra which don't have an effect on the gameplay. The game also features a hard made which can really be a nice challenge after you beat the game. You also unlock the Pro-Bending mode where you can also spend some time at. The Achievments are also good goals and can extend your playtime a little but further.\n\nConclusionI recommend the game and it is nice to play it. While the game is not that long (I got 100% of the Achievments in about 12h of playtime) it still felt like time well spent (well,for a video game at least).","June 25, 2015","true","13.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","1"

I had heard middling things regarding this title but there was no way I was going to let that get me down.\n\nLegend of Korra is a character action game based on the Nickelodeon show with the same name. Coming from Platinum games with things like Bayonetta under their belt I couldn't have been more excited about this game.\n\nSo I started in on it and was really enjoying the combat. It felt good, it felt fluid. The counters were a bit odd at first but easily attainable. However the game becomes a little tedious almost immediately. Almost every other enemy attempts to trap Korra and the only way to escape is to violently shake the left analog stick which is extremely tiring. There is also not a large amount of variety in the enemies. This holds true for boss battle as well. But even more so. The boss battles are not … difficult. Its more that they require an absurd amount of patience and repetition. Its just too much. They ask too much for too long. There are also sequences in which you ride Naga. A polar bear dog of sorts. However these sequences are filled with instant death and rare checkpointing which leads to even more reasons for needless frustration. It essentially is just a endless runner.. that does indeed end. Just that it takes way longer than you want it to.\n\nThere are also vague and sparse cut scenes that are fairly representative of the show which is nice.\n\nI wanted so much more for this game and I sincerely hope that Platinum gives it another go. Something more open world perhaps with proper character leveling and less tedium in the tasks provided to you. I'm not happy about giving this a thumbs down because I want an avatar/korra game that meets what the shows content can do. However this is not that product.\n\nThe one glaring exception to this tedium is the Pro-bending mini game. That is by far the nicest thing about this game.\n\nTHE GIST\n2 flying air bison out of 5. Dear Platinum games. Please try again. I really want you to. I NEED you to.","April 23","false","1.6"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","1"

Pro-Bending matches is where 3v3 players (water,earth and fire- there's no air players until sesaon 3 when whole Air nation is re-build) fighting.

This is incredible!!! If it had an multiplayer mode and some customization options like more arenas and tournaments, it would be perfect!!!\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good (you may miss one or two jumps, but that was ok for me) and on some stages you get Naga and it was good, at first, nice but after a few more screens it became a little boring.\n\nThe enemies are the most generic thing, they all look the same. It could be a lot better the anime has tons of interesting characters, but the bending skills will make you have fun in every moment.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy the anime, buy it now.

Earthbending being slow but extremely powerful for example.\n-Proper difficulty, playing on normal is enough of a challenge for me at least. Not to mention there's an extreme mode after that.\n-Story isn't that amazing but it's fun how it ties into the show and has tons of references to the show. If you love the show you'll at least find it enjoyable.\n-Collectibles(items randomly rewarded from chests) are all linked to the show with both references to Aang and Korra. Which is kinda cool.\n-Can be played just fine with keyboard and mouse. I can imagine that a controller plays smoother though as this is generally the case with melee combat oriented games(in my experience).\n-Had no problems running this game. Not a single crash, bug or other problem I encountered.\n-Enjoyable map layout. Has some nice hidden areas to it, which decreases the linearity somewhat.\n-The final boss battle is absolutely insane... in a good way.\n-The ending credits are hilarious\n\nCons:\n-Graphics options were pretty much absent, choice between normal or smooth graphics, but the game runs fine and looks fine anyway... Guess I don't even need those options.\n-Key binding options are absent which can be an annoyance. I myself do not have any trouble with the key bindings though.\n-Not that many different enemies, but those that are there are solid and enough variation in my opinion.\n-Would have loved to see some more of the other characters of the show. But I can understand that having the full cast would be a bit over the top for a budget game.\n-Had camera issues in one fight where you have to battle two very large enemies in a very small area. Camera couldn't decide between a top down view or the normal view.\n\nOther:\n-If you were planning on watching the show I recommend doing this before playing the game, as the game obviously contains some spoilers. If you weren't planning on watching the show, you should still watch it.\n-The game doesn't take that long but the price/playtime ratio is just fine.\n-Some people seem to dislike the platforming in the game and although it's nothing that exciting, it's not bad either. It works fine and allows for some nice hidden chests/small areas.\n\nRecommendation:\nFor a 15€ price tag this is an excellent game and a mustbuy for all fans of the series. It certainly exceeded my expectations and is perhaps the best licensed game I've ever played.\nIf you are not a fan of the series it is still very much worth it as the game is a lot of fun and not that expensive. Especially if this game is on sale you have to buy it.","October 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Greedsin21/recommended/281690/","Greedsin21","Greedsin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Greedsin21/","623 products in account","So after playing this game from beginning to end finally I can say this finally, the 'User review: Very Positive part blows my mind away.\n\nThis game could have been great and it shows, I mean for gods sake look who they got to develop the game. PlatinumGames, the same people behind Metal Gear Rising, Vanquish and Bayonetta, all of them great games except for this one and it's clear why that is.\n\nThe combat is not the weakest part of this game, if anything it shows that the combat could have evolved into something WAY more then whats shown here since it gives you the idea of the speed and strength of each element but I will admit fire water bending and air bending are the only two you really need to use since water bending gives you greater distance of attacks and air bending will murder everything on screen for you, I can't even joke about that.\n\nStory makes no sense and with the animating team behind the show doing scenes for the game you would think they would give us something awesome to look. Instead the cut scenes look cheap and lacking, sometimes even repeating a few scenes just to make it long enough to fit the scene. On top of that the voice acting feels forced out, most of the main voice actors, or those who actually show up in the game anyway, don't sound like they really want to do it at all. Side note here tho, I feel like the older daughter of the air bender was replaced by someone else for some odd reason cause she sounds like she's more of a adult then a kid.\n\nLastly the biggest problem it has is just how boring everything is. The combat is not bad like I said before but when you go up against the same enemies over and over and over and over and over again you feel like you could guess who's next each times which I done a few times. The amount of times they reused bosses in fights is sickening.\n\nThe one part of the game I do oddly like is the pro bending game mode. It's minor but man it's pretty fun. The basic idea of it is to either knock your enemies out of the ring or have as much control of the ring before times runs out. It's very basic but if they had the time to make a full version of this game with multiplayer it would have been awesome.\n\nIf you don't already know why this game failed in the end I'll gladly explain. The game was officially announced back in June 2014 which was then released officially on October 21 2014. That game the developers 4-5 months to develop the game which honestly was not enough time to do and it shows. If the developers were given more time to develop this game instead of trying to release it before season three's release date we would have received an amazing game but instead what we got was what they could scrap up as fast as they could.\n\nIn the end I do not recommend this game even to Legend Of Korra fans like myself, it's just not worth it.","December 30, 2015","false","3.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

The combat felt really fluid and I really had a sense of power when fighting, especially with earth (my favourite element). The graphics are flawless. Pretty much exactly how the show looks.\n\nOn the down side:\n- I was pretty let down by the simplicity of the pro bending matches and overall replayability.\n- Pro bending has two attacks, a dodge and a counter. Animations were very samey and it got repetitive quickly.\n- The top-down view, while good for seeing what is happening, did not feel very immersive at all. Fighting like in-game i.e. 3rd person would have brought much more excitement to gameplay.\n- As far as replaying goes, going through the same scenes of enemies and having to choose a chapter to replay was not appealing to me. I would have liked some endless survival mode where you can fight continuous waves of enemies or something.\n- There could have been more variety of combos. While you can string different elements together, it doesn't produce different animations.\n\nOverall it is a good game, but not deep and immersive enough to warrant a replay for me.

I was a afraid at first that it was going to be like any other video game where the main character has "super powers" or any other type of ability where the game was 2D and faiely boring. Well, this is a beatuifully created 3D world (not open) where you play as Avatar Korra. **POTENTIAL SPOILERS** Your bending has been taken and for some reason it wont come back. Well, that's the 1st half of the game. You must work your way through to regain your bending powers. Let me tell you this, it's not easy at all. I was playing on normal and it took me 5.3 hours.  This is a fun, though, and challenging game that most gamers would love. And for all those hardcore avatar fans out there, there are even some people from The Last Airbender.\n\n**To the developers/writers** This is such a great game. I (and many others) are looking forward to hope for another game / some DLC's. Maybe multiplayer in the pro-bending arena. Or build the game as if we were playing the books (1,2,3,and finally 4). Lastly, i would like to point out that the only thing i really wish personally is for an open world where from book 1, you start out as Korra and make your way through the game with missions and side mission and random acts. Something along the lines of GTA V. Every decision you make changes the game ever so slightly. I dont care if it takes a really long time, but that is what i would like to see. Even thouogh my opinion is irrelevant, 10/10 game. I have already bought more than 1 copy to share with my steam friend.

So the combat is fun & simplistic, you just beat people to a pulp and move to the next segment. They make it feel really good to counter and throw back punches. Naga running segments is essentially like a runner-mode where you slip and slide through obstacles to get to the next segment, and though it's fun it feels a bit contrived. However, the enemies get stale after awhile there's like 10 models and 3 different palette swaps for each one. However, I do keep in mind that kind of budget the developers were probably working with and can empathize the constriction on the lack of diverse enemies/help from an AI.

Fans of the show can feel disappointment by the simplicity of storyline, but I assure you - give it a chance. The team of Platinum Games did what they could and this manifests itself in several specific moments - a phenomenal fight with the last boss, a spectacular form of Avatar, etc. Wait for the promotion and then toss few cents for the Japanese.

There isnt a lot of enemy variety, some animations aren't good (chacaters mouths don't move in-game), there isn't much of a story, and the environments aren't too much to look at. But there are also a number of good things. The combat is very fun, and also easy to use. there is a weak attack, a strong attack, dodging, and countering. Each bending form has a few of their own simple combos, and their own strength and weaknesses. You can switch between elements at will, and Korra's animation is really nice. I definitely didn't mind the lack of enemy variety as much since the combat was so much fun. There's also a leveling system to strengthen Korra, and you can buy more combos and some special ablities. It's also a pretty tough game, despite the simplicity, there isn't much of a window to counter-attack.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you are a fan of the series. They keep the same voice actors, and the soundtrack, graphics, and cutscenes (if much too short) stay true to the show.

It didnt really needed much to make puzzles  using that engine, but kinda feels they got a lil lazy there.\n\nExaustive Hack Slash They made a 100% Hack Slash game, but  it can be a lil exastive after awhile, because you only face like 3-5 types of enemies the whole game, dosnt feels like you are reallly getting anywhere. Its always the same type of enemys, but thankfully in the near end they changed the color of the enemys (but yet is the same), another thing is that you basicly have  to destroy the entire city (boxes / jars / cars) to get currency  spirit , which can get a lil tiressome after awhile\n\n* I find the game really short, but well the price its low, so i guess its even (but still pretty short)\n* The game could have  multiplayer mode, and it would be amazing and really cative  Pro-Bending\n\nYET I def commend this game, pretty worth it!!!

They mananged to hit that point where the game can be fun for everyone, and challanging for those who are looking to push the difficulty to extreme (literally) with this easy to learn, hard (more like, takes practice) to master method.\n\nAs a game that should be presenting the faschinating universe of AVATAR, it is a complete failure. The spiritual values, the character progression and drama are completely left out. There are literally no other characters in the game than Korra, and Ginora appearing for a half minute four times. The level design is blank, empty, it hurts the eye even after those 2000's Shrek etc. movie adaptation games. It is a good thing that this is only a problem in Republic City and Air Temple Island, where the missing people / life / objects / anything feels really awkward, but the other areas justify the emptiness (North Pole, the wastelands of the Spirit World).\n\nThe story is non existent, the villain is instantly forgettable without any creativity, personality, motivation, but more evil laughs than any team rocket scene from a full pokemon season.\n\nOn the other side, the voice actors are the same as in the animated series, there are quite a few one liners in combat that make the fans smile for a second, collectable items are all relics from the series (airbender wing-staff etc... including a cabbage!), and the gameplay is really fantastic. It promised me 4 hours, and delivered it, not a minute less. If you are into  games like this (especially MGR:R) the Extreme difficulty, unlocking alternative costumes will double this playtime, and then you have the pro-bending sport arena accessible anytime from the main menu.\n\nDefinitly recommended for the fans if you are also a huge fan of this genre, and I forgive all it's emptiness for the fact that is a very low budget game for a very low price. Still waiting on a triple A quality open world game I guess, but since the series is over... oh I can dream can't I?

An Experience that is Entirely Inconsequential.Genre: Fantasy 3rd person Beat-Em-Up Fighting TV-Tie-In.\nDeveloped and Published by: Platinum Games & Activision.\nPlatform: Windows and Consoles.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nLegend of Korra is a tie-in game to the animated series of the same name. It follows Korra, the Avatar who controls and manipulates the four elements of the world: fire, earth, water and air to keep the world in balance, as she sets out to stop a new big bad guy from destroying the world...or throwing the world into chaos…or cooking cookies for all the other bad guys. I can’t remember because it's so generic and cliche a plot that it quickly fades into the background. It's a short campaign of beating everything up that moves into the ground. The entire experience of this videogame is inconsequential.\n\nStory Thoughts\nOriginally posted by LoK Store page:An ancient evil force has emerged from the portals and threatens the balance of both worlds! Only the Avatar stands a chance in defeating this new threat!It doesn’t get much more generic a plotline than this I’m afraid. While the Avatar series has used this formula in the past, what Legend of Korra the videogame seemingly forgets is what happens between the start and stop of this plot. There’s character interactions, drama, choices that need to be made and often an underlying moral either being taught or challenged in the TV show. In the videogame, none of that is present. It’s just Korra and Jinora (who has very little to actually say) VS the evil force. It even reintroduces the Korra loses her bending abilities because of a mcguffin again because we didn’t get enough of that plot in season one apparently. (/sarcasm) Most of the story is just Korra fighting her way through waves of enemies in linear corridors while trying to recover her bending and figure out what’s going on. All to defeat a generic badguy. While it says that the events take place between book two and three, you can barely tell that it did. Even worse, she essentially recovers her bending powers by remembering how she used them in the first place. It’s an extremely weak payoff that begs the question why she couldn’t just remember how to bend all of them at the same time if she could suddenly remember how she did them.\n\nOf course she wins the day after fighting a boss that is so bullet spongy the bosses from Borderlands II feel ashamed. Leading to a weak payoff and the aforementioned lack of impact on the universe and character of Korra. The story most definitely took a back seat to the combat but even the combat system has some problems.\n\nCombat Thoughts\nCombat is pretty straightforward. Korra has light and heavy attacks that can be comboed for devastating moves. She also has dodging and a counter attack that requires precision timing to pull off. After Korra relearns how to control the elements, she’ll have four different ways of fighting but they all lead to the same result. Water and fire play and feel generally the same though I suppose fire feels like it does more damage. It's kind of hard to tell if it actually does. Earth bending on the other hand is slower and supposed to do more damage. More often than not though, you’ll end up getting hit by the fast moving enemies or projectiles before able to use any of it. Air bending on the other hand gave me the impression that it’s potentially overpowered. It might be doing less damage (there’s no real easy way to tell in-game) but its wide area-of-effect in every attack makes it strong. Especially in the later stages of the game as there’s vast swarms of enemies trying to attack Korra. Plus, airbending allows her able to float in the air which lets her to avoid most attacks.\n\nWhile the combat system is certainly competent, it’s repetitive as hell. With its small pool of enemies, many of which have stunning abilities that require QTEs to get out, it can get far too old to beat the same people or benders over and over again. The QTEs are especially annoying and not enjoyable to repeat. It doesn’t help that the camera is often in the way and unhelpful, with enemies attacking off-screen all of the time. Worse, there’s only one moment when I felt as powerful as the Avatar from the show and that’s towards the end of the game. By the time I got there though I was so worn down that it felt lame and half-hearted. Especially since the Avatar state only lasts a short time, far too short a time.\n\nThere's mini-games interspersed to break up the monotony of the combat. One is an “endless runner” section that you might have played on mobile devices. However, its controls aren’t the most responsive and the entire experience is just so boring. The other mini-game is the pro-bending games which feel authentic to the show, but you generally win by spamming attacks at the enemies and hoping your AI partners aren’t completely idiotic enough to get knocked out early on. Both have the feeling of being tacked on or not thought out that well.\n\nPC Settings\nThe menu options are incredibly limited for Legend of Korra, probably owed to its console roots. The choices you have are: Brightness, Resolutions (restricted to a maximum of 1920x1080p), fullscreen on/off and graphic quality. Graphic quality switches between smooth and normal, which I’m assuming smooth is for people trying to run this on a toaster because it’s not a demanding game. That’s mostly due to a sheer lack of detail to be found compared to other AAA title. So, in that sense a limited graphics menu is due to the fact that there’s really nothing to control. Still, there’s a lot missing here including V-Sync, Field of View, keyboard or controller remapping capability and more. Additionally, there’s no mouse support for the menus. There are audio sliders for music, SFX + Dialogue and “Movie”. So at least they give you that much control. Other than that, it’s a cheap port. At least it runs at 60FPS.\n\nLoK has a cel-shaded graphic style that is very close to the show’s original animated look though it often feels watered down. Music is largely copied from the show as well and is fine I suppose.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nLegend of Korra is a decent TV-tie-in game, at the best of times. However, it's ultimately mediocre and inconsequential on too many levels to be worth playing. It's not worth buying if you’re a fan of the show, fan of the developers or even of this genre. The combat system is competent but it suffers from repetition, a small pool of enemies and that spark to set it apart from the crowd. The story doesn’t hold up at all, which is perhaps the worst sin it could commit considering how much the show depends upon that. Look, PlatinumGames was a pretty good choice of developer for this game. They’ve got the capability to make a good fighting title and they’ve done so multiple times in the past. However, it's clear that either their budget or hearts wasn’t in it. The results of which is this mediocre game that could’ve been so much more. It’s far from the worse but there’s nothing redeeming about it that hasn’t been done better elsewhere.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","October 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Developers of Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, Bayonetta, Transformers: Devastation, and so on. If you’re familiar with any of those, you’ll know that Platinum generally delivers on gameplay.\n\nLegend of Korra doesn’t disappoint, mostly. There are definitely some things that I felt were half-implemented, like the attack telegraphs. Some enemy types will flash red before their attack, some don’t. Overall, still enjoyable, use bending, do counters, execute combos, whatever. The combat system does have some potential depth if you wish to use it, but you can also just go with simple classic mashing playstyles and get through fine. A playthrough will generally take around five hours or so, and there is also New Game Plus, and a little Pro-Bending gamemode. It has a very nice Playstation 2 feel to it.\n\nThe story is nothing to be excited about, at all, in fact. The game is meant to take place between Seasons 2 and 3 of the show. Throughout the entire game, only Korra really exists, with the three other characters getting perhaps seconds of screentime. None of it worthwhile. The villain has such a weak buildup, although the design was mildly interesting, I guess? There are a few cutscenes that try to emulate the show’s art style, but obviously it’s a bit off. Korra seems like she's in character, but it's not like the story really allows for anything complex or substantial.\n\nOverall, worth a try for the gameplay. The story is just there to push you along through the game.","May 1","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The pro-bending minigame (which warrants it's own spot on the main menu) is also fun enough to keep you trying to hit the top level.\n\nOn the downside, the plot is very light, as it's supposed to be a side-story from between seasons Two and Three, only a few characters from the show appear for more than a few scenes, and the customization settings (Video, controls) aren't very customizable.\n\nStill, all in all it's a fun and enjoyable game set in a 'verse I'm fond of.

Beat the game on extreme, collected all the items, maxed out my bending, unlocked all the achievements, everything. In my opinion, this game is awesome. I love The Legend of Korra and this game is fun to play if you're a fan of the series. If you're a fan, you'll love this game. If you didn't watch the show, you might think this game is boring. I beat this game on the PS4 and on the PC with an Xbox One controller so I don't know if using the keyboard is very fun, it definitely doesn't look like it would be.\n\nI recommend buying this game only if it goes on sale, $15 may be too much. $10 is fine.\n\nPros:\n- You're playing as the avatar and you can beat people up with all four elements\n- Avatar state\n- They use the intro to the show when you start up the game for the first time so it feels like you're really apart of it\n- Pro bending with Mako and Bolin\n- Enemies in the game are the same as the ones in the show (except for Hundun, of course)\n- Same voice actors as the ones in the show\n- Air scooter !!!!!!!!\n- Various talismans\n- Temple Run styled Naga levels\n- The levels are well done. You get to go to air temple island, the spirit world, and other places you've probably seen in the show.\n- You get to play as the giant Spirit Korra!\n\nCons:\n- Bad story, honestly.\n- Short, takes just a couple hours to beat it.\n- Button smashing 24/7 (especially during the fight with Hundun)\n- You get your firebending back by focusing on your anger and rage. This really made me mad because the true way of mastering firebending is through the power of the sun but Korra and Jinora may not know that.\n- Should have online pro bending matches\n\nNow we need a new Avatar: The Last Airbender game that covers all the events that happened in Books 1 - 3. Someone needs to start working on a time machine so we can go back to 2005 and record all the voice work from the original voice actors.","January 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You have to scroll through the bending styles though, which is a little dissapointing. A radial selection would be nice so I could go straight from Firebending to Waterbending, but its easy enough to get enough breathing room to have time to switch. Your dodge and block/counter move can interrupt your basic moves and combos, but you have to abandon them and any energy you charged up. Still, ducking out of a charge move and then charging again while your enemy throws their attacks at nothing is simple and satisfying. Counter's aren't that varied but are still satisfying to pull off, if a little frustrating during a few battles that require you to counter before attacking outright.\n\nCombo listings are kidna off to the side and hard to understand, but clear enough to figure out. You can even taunt enemies into attacking you, which is a feature that should be in every brawling game by now but few games have figured it out. Overall the movement during combat is incredible and the lock mechanic is useful without getting in the way when you are fighting a large group of guys.\n\nThere are some platforming segments, nothing too difficult but they are hampered by the fact that the controls were clearly focused on combat. The closest thing you get to a second jump is using your dodge roll in mid-air and in at least one case I found that previously safe ground was now a bottomless pit after a loading screen. Combine this with enemies attacking you during the platforming makes it a tad frustrating, but still managable.\n\nStory sort of sits by the wayside, Korra always narrates why shes doing what she's doing but its few and far between. Cutscenes are shockingly short but the narration and other charcter dialogue gets the story told just fine. Has music from the show that matches well with the action on screen.\n\nThere ARE spoilers if you haven't watched past season 1 of the show, like I had (because cable TV is expensive and they haven't put the show up on Netflix for some reason). They give away what I'm guessing was the ending to one of the recent seasons, but even without seeing it, I like the fact that the afteraffects of that event are still present in the story.\n\nThat's about all I can say without getting spoilery myself, so if you care about that sort of thing, look out. If you just want to play as the AVATAR, get this game. Seriously.\n\nNow.\n\nOh, but get ready to hate those three Triad guys from the first episode, who are EVERY miniboss I've encountered thus far. And more often than not you fight all three of them at once.\n\nFinished the game on basic and extreme, which is okay, but it makes the flaws more obvious. Fortunately, theres a few flaws that work in your favor that make up for the parts where it seems like its cheating. You just have to get lucky. The Pro-Bending league does a thourough explanation of the rules and is fun and challenging. Honestly I wish it was multiplayer, with a bit of control tightening and a secure connnection the Pro-Bending game alone would make a nice downloadable title for $5.\n\nStory is okay, didn't go as long or in depth as I thought it might and basically left out all the other characters until the end (and Cave Johnso- J.K. Simmons doesn't show up at all!...). Good start. Hoping they make another game and improve on the forumla they have going.\n\nAnd add multiplayer.","November 9, 2014","true","16.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

I see alot of hate for it, but I think most of those are from expectations that were waaaay too high for something that's not a AAA game. I went into this game having only seeing the first season of Korra and all of The Last Airbender. And I was really, really impressed.\n\nPlatinum Games, of Bayonetta fame, which is one of my favorite hack 'n 'slashes out there, and it really feels like Bayonetta - Stripperiffic + Bending. The story isn't great, but it's not bad. The cutscenes are animated in the style of the show which is pretty cool.\n\nThe combat is where this game shines. It's fun and engaging, counterattacks are rewarding, and each element brings its own fun to the table. Earth (my fav.) is all about slow powerhouse moves that deal alot of damage and can stun enemies. Firebending provides alot of fast comboes and multiple hits. Airbending has some straightforward projectiles and pretty great area of effect attacks (plus air scooter, woo!), and waterbending gives you homing projectile attacks and some cool ice moves that can freeze enemies. You're pretty much free to play your way, and you never hit anything dumb like "well you have to beat that enemy with firebending".\n\nOverall, my expecations were definately exceeded for a cartoon tie-in. I definitely say buy this game. It's great fun and it's at a great price. Plus, it's a great start for something better, so by showing your support now, we can get an even more awesome Avatar game in the future.","October 30, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But to me, this game is awesome and to get it on sale for $3+, it's dam worth the price. I dont play much 3rd person action games, so I have limited references for comparison, but it slightly reminds me of Shadow Of Mordor in terms of the fighting action, you will need timing and decide which combos to use. In Legend of Korra, you also unlock your combos bit by bit, and it does have some RPG elements in it, like you can decide which of the 4 elements you want to train/level up more, and a shop to spend your "score" points.\n\nOne thing for sure it does way better than Shadow Of Mordor though, is the final boss fight. When you finally beat the last boss, you will feel deeply satisfied for this memorable experience. If you have a kid, I highly recommend this game to teach him/her the virtue of Tenacity because it is not easy peazy(on normal mode) and you will encounter some battles that your need to try over and over again. On the other hand, you dont get punished much for dying as the last checkpoint will always be close by.

Although fights at the start of the game are quite difficult, by the time you get towards the end of the game, you'll have worked out methods to deal with all the enemies, and the new moves you gain along the way are both useful, and fun to execute.

As a Avatar and LOK fan, I of course was looking forward to play it. Purchasing this game is one of my best decision ever. not only you get to experience the power of being an avatar, unleashing all four elements, you get to fight a range of enemies. I absolutely love the graphics and storyline as it really brings me back to the show. And you know what's the best?, YOU GET TO DESTROY CARS!!! WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?!

I've tried playing it with both keyboard and controller and let me tell you, playing on keyboard it hella hard.

SCREW YOU GAME CRITICS because they gave this game such a poor review when it was a pretty good game considering how much it is worth. For a $15 game this pretty damn good if it cost any more than that then i would have somewhat mixed opinions but i dont so everyone who is hating on this game u can suck it. anyway on to the real review. The story in the game takes place between the 2nd and 3rd season of the show and you are living through the story which in my opinion was well thought out. Yes it was kind of short even after you beat it on the hardest difficulty but the game will keep you wanting more. Controls are really easy to learn and when you learn you can do some pretty kick ♥♥♥ combos. It is really fun i promise i will never get tired of seeing the combos. Besides the regular story mode there is the pro bending game mode which is actually really fun it feels almost as realistic as the real show. Fans of Last Airbender and Legend of Korra will really enjoy this game.

If you loved the Avatar series i totally recomend this game for you, otherwise don't buy it. Because this game is very cheap and you can tell for several details, several scenarios, textures, the enemies IA, etc. This game is not easy to learn and play if you want to buy it for your children i would recommend to set it in easy mode, so they can play having fun and without frustration.\n\nStory 6/10\nThe story is not very good to my test, if there was more reference to some previous incarnation of the avatar or more explaination about the final enemy i could feel it like an 8.\n\nGameplay 7/10\nThe game is action type, each element has several combos that you will unlock when you use each bending type, and a few combos that you can learn buying bending scrolls from the shop.\nAlso there is the "Pro bending" mode, that is a tournament of pro bending, very hard to beat the final team in extreme mode.\nThere are some scenarios with Naga, are basically a Temple Run, but with several kinds of obstacles, bosses fight during the run, and Korra using bending while is riding Naga, to be honest in this parts you feel that the game need improvements, but to be fair the game only cost U$S 15, not 50 i mean, is not a 3A Game.\nThe camera following is very bad... several times you will have to move the camara arround in order to see what's happening...\nThe collectibles are related to the story of both Avatar series, the voice acting is descent, and has several treats for fans that i ensure you that you will love, like the locutor during the Pro bendings and the Ending when you finish the game.\nIt took me 24 Hours to beat the game in all the dificulties, getting all the achievements and playing around to improve some scores. But if you wanna play the game in normal mode and the Pro bending normal mode too, probably will take around 6 hours.\n\nGraphics 8/10\nThe element bendings effects and combos and the characters are great. This cel shading stlye matches great with the Avatar Series\n\nSound & Music 7/8\nThe music is the same from the show, the start screen tutorial and ending makes you feel that you are watching the series again, some voice acting are great, others need some work, unfortanly the game is very short the story only shows very few characters of the series amost none of them...\n\nTotal 7/10\nAs i said if you love Avatar series, i totally recomend it keep in mind that this game is very cheap, so you should not spect a "Shadow of Mordor" Quality game, also is very short, if you are hardcored gamer, the achievements are very funny and is not impossible to get the 100% achievements.","December 26, 2014","true","24.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The game runs fluently on PC, even using a keyboard and mouse (I don't have a controller). Again I was very pleased with the progression through the story.\n\n-WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS-\nYou start in republic city and then you get your chi blocked by an old man. You then have to get out and get to air temple island with just your fists as your bending is blocked. As you go through the missions too you collect various items along the way. As you get to air temple island jinora comes via the spirit world t guide you, as the air benders are away at the time you get there. Anyway you then go on to get your waterbending back (not spoiling it too much), and continue onwards back to replublic city to find out where to go. Once there you unlock your earth bending and then head onto the south pole, again not spoiling too much, then unlock your fire bending and right at the end of the chapter your air bending (my peronal favourite, it's super OP, in some cases). After entering the spirit world you go and find the old man from the begining to find out you have met him before and then eventually you have to fight him, which is hard if you have no idea what your doing. After beating him the game ends after a little cutscene, with the creadits rolling you do a pro bending match like at the beginning of the game which I forgot to mention.\n-SPOILERS HAVE ENDED-\n\nSo overall the story is great and is related to stuff that happens in the main anime series and the game is actually a lot of fun, especially when you level up your bending. There is alo a pro bending tournament mode which I haven't tried much but it looks similar to what you do in story mode. The only few cons I found are ocasionally the camera was a bit hard to control, mainly the beginning of the story, and ocasionally some combos didn't work as they should have.\n\nSo I give this a a good 8.5/10 factoring in the awesome gameplay and graphics with a good story that even relates to the anime, however I felt that it could have been a bit longer, it took about 3.5 hours to complete.","October 28, 2014","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The difficulty of enemies and such changes gradualy through the game, allowing you to get your ♥♥♥ kicked at the beginning but as you learn the controls and strategies better, along with leveling up your moves and bending, you get a satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you're taking down those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bullies that used to beat you up in the alleys. The music and sounds are very well done and emmersing, the soundtrack is taken straight from the show so everything feels in its place. The story is okay, it is written by one of the writers for the original show, Tim Hedrick, though he only helped write nine of the episodes. The story is supposed to take place between Book One and Book Two mixing some chi-blockers and dark spirits but you have to hold the game as its own seperate thing because it doesn't really fit right with the show. The ending of the game is a bit more outlandish and more anime-ish than the show is used to so that also feels a bit unfitting. The dialog is great with most of the original cast lending in some new voicelines, Korra's voice actor, Janet Varney, is of course present for the entirety of the game lending full dialog to well animated cut scenes.\n\nOverall the combat is solid, combos and counters rewarding, and sound design is excellent, I definitely reccomend if you're a fan of the show that want's a bit more story after it's ended or are a fan of these types of combo beat-em-up games.

Then you will probably enjoy this as well.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable and fun to play especially if you have been missing the show since it ended. It’s hard to tell where exactly this picks up or falls in to the show if it does at all. It does make small reference to Unalaq here and there and some of the city is still destroyed from the fight they had so this could fall after that but I’m not sure. But never the less the story is somewhat entering but the most enjoyable part was the actual game play.\n\nYou can easily change from earth to water to air back to water then fire and so on all in the middle of the fight which makes for a great ♥♥♥ kicking. The game dose however get quite repetitive but this is basically a button mashing game so it’s to be expected. You can also play in pro - bending matches after you finish the story one time.\n\nThe Graphics are okay they fit the style of the show in my opinion. So it’s very colorful.\n\nNormal mode was fun I am currently playing it over in the more advance mode and find it just a little bit more challenging but I am enjoying it just as much as the first play through.\n\nOverall the only thing I didn’t like was that the fact I wanted more story but then again that’s just me missing the show.\nI bought this one sale when it was around $7 and I say it was well worth it overall it’s a great game that will help you kill some time.\n\n9/10 will play again\n","May 6, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, if you are not bothered by the lack of a multidimensional story, then this game may appeal to you. This "punch-em-up" game, consisted mainly of challenging fights, to eventually regain Korra's ability to bend all the elements. I personally enjoyed the combat, there was a fair amount of different moves associated with each element. However, the process in which the player uses the combat, is quite repetitive. The game consists of fight after fight, with similar enemies, the battles were increasingly difficult, but became quite tedious after fighting several bosses that were carbon copies (or similar to) of previous enemies. The opponents that you face also sometimes have moves that are somewhat buggy, the recovery between such attacks like lightning, is quite slow, so they can hit you multiple times, allowing you to essentially die, or come close to, with a single attack. The game also had minimal voice acting, which made it feel distance from the television show, although the two have their similarities, I did not feel like I was necessarily inside the show. Although, the pro-bending tournaments, a mode implemented into the story, as well as a mini-game after you complete the story, is very true to the show. As for the price, I would wait until it is on sale, I purchased the game 75% off, for that price it was worth the $3.74 I paid; However, I would not purchase this at the full value, the game does not have enough content for it to be merited that price (I would value it between $5 and $7.50). If you can catch the game on a sale, it is a definite buy if you enjoy mindless fighting games.","April 16","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game's design is very old school.\n\nYou will not win If you button mash and do not learn how to parry and dodge effectively. I loved the combat system in this game. I have not enjoyed a beat em up like this since the last console generation. There are plenty of unlockable attacks, upgrades, and items included in the game. The extreme difficulty mode adds to the replay value.\n\nI will admit that the only problems I had with the game were that enemies are able to attack Korra off screen and there is a boss fight where you fight 2 bosses at the same time that make it hard to parry/dodge because you are unable to see Korra when they constantly huddle up on you to attack you.  You are also surrounded by dark spirit holes in the ground that damage Korra while another enemy can attack you off of the screen during this boss fight. This was on the normal difficulty setting.\n\nThe camera is not terrible but it has it's moments in this game.\n\nI've never watched any of the Avatar cartoons but I absolutely loved this game due to a friend's recommendation of it.

I was suprise that The Legend of Korra didn't suck balls as much as I think it would, cause most Cartoon/Movie licenses games mostly tend to suck badly.\n\nThe good stuffs first. The games starts out slow (not too slow) since you have to regain all your bending abilities but once you have all your bending abilities back and got her Avatar State as well (tho her Avatar State came very last minute into the game), that's when the game starts to shine. Plus it has awesome soundtracks from the cartoon and I think they got the same voice actress too. As for the graphics, well, just don't expect a Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor or Metro Redux kind of graphics here.\n\nNow the bad stuffs. The map is too simple, I'm not asking for a Portal map design here. Just a little bit of detail to the map design should be enough, like adding npc's that reacts to you when you're fighting or something. Instead of just you (Korra) and the enemie, that's it. Now the enemies are abit sad. Lack of enemie model designs. I counted there's 5 types enemies in the game, a foot trooper, gangsters, evil purple spirits includes the flying ones too, giant robots and an old men who refuses to die, all just different colours and different attacks really except for the old guy (the final boss). You have 3 foot troopers red, blue and green then 2 giant robots grey and red then the 3 gangsters same thing red, blue, green and....black (which is an earth bender)? and then you have the evil purple spirits and as for the final boss his ok, tho kind of a b!tch to fight (I don't know what their call and I forgot the old guys name in the game. I haven't watched the cartoon yet. I've only watched the first one The Last Airbender.).\n\nBut overall it's a not bad game. It's fun and simple and most importantly it stays true to the art design from the cartoon. And it's cheap too.","November 1, 2014","true","10.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm loving how the game is being put together so far. The Story and Pro-Bending are very sweet. The controls are actually very fluidly set-up. Looking around and doing attacks is all from the mouse and moving and switching between Elements is all nicely laid out by WASD.\n\nThe only downsides to the game that I've seen so far is that to lock-on to a target is great, but it seems there's no way to switch between targets other than what you are looking at. For Pro-Bending this is a bit difficult since the Camera angle is locked so the lock-on moves to who your directly in-front of. Have yet to try it in actual story-mode and will update afterwords. There's not much to adjust graphics other than resolution and "Quality" as well. It doesn't seem to be that challenging of a game for right now. Running 60 FPS no problem with an i7 and 560Ti.\n\nOverall, I'm having a blast with the game from start-up. I'm looking forward to playing more through the game and progressing.","October 21, 2014","true","5.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Platinum really didn't put much towards making this a good game. Even hardcore Korra fans probably aren't going to enjoy this.\n\nThis game is honestly kind of insulting to its source material. They put absolutely no effort into crafting an enticing and well balanced story. The extent of the narrative is pretty much "bad guy takes your bending, go fight through his thugs to get it back".There's pretty much no entertainment value in seeing what happens next, which is an extremely stark contrast to the wonderful writing that went into The Legend of Korra by Mike and Bryan. The only major character from the show is Korra herself, with everyone else mysteriously absent without any real explanation as to why. If you came here looking for show quality material, you're going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nEverything else kinda follows suit. The combat is barebones, but passable I suppose. It really isn't enough fun to not get old after going through the first couple of movesets a dozen or so times. There are really only like six different types of enemies, and this gets repetitive very quickly. You can only fight the same three bosses so many times before it starts to get bland. The level design is sparse and uninteresting. The cell-shading art style that works so well for so many other games just doesn't have any life here. Janet Varney even sounds sort of flat in her performance, like they called her in over the weekend for a few hours to voice her lines, which again, when juxtaposed to the show make this game look severely lacking.\n\nI was so excited for this game when it was announced, and when I heard it was being made by Platinum I was even more excited, but in the end they didn't give the series the amazing game that it could have had. Whether it was a lack of time, money, or resources that resulted in this doesn't really matter. This is a sorry excuse for a final product. It honestly feels more like a pre-alpha than anything, with literally everything being so barebones I'm not sure what they were thinking releasing it in this state.\n\nWhether you're a hardcore Korra fan or just a fan of platinum games and want another beat-em-up, I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. You'd be much better off looking elsewhere for your fix. This game only leads to disappointment and boredom. Even someone like me who watched the series at least five times through and bought this game looking for more couldn't even finish it. It's just so mind-numbingly bland. I actually had to force myself just to push through a few more levels. I honestly just can't think of a single enticing thing about this other than maybe the source material.\n\nIf you ask me, I don't think Platinum deserves to get anything from this. This game is as far away from doing the series justice as you can get. Go support the source material instead.","August 10, 2015","false","3.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

You probably would have not the slighest clue whats going on if you didn't watch the series. It's an arcade game with a lot of jumping and button mashing involved, but considering it's a game about a kids' movie it actually did a very good job. The story is rather short and seems to have a timeline between book 2 and 3.\n\nMy overall score is 7.5/10, here is the breakdown:\n\nPros:\n- Nice cellshaded graphics, the drawing style is the same as the one in the series\n- Cutscene animations were (what looks like) made by the creators of the cartoon and are not just a copy paste of parts of the animated series\n- Controls are very convinient most of the time. The game tells you that a gamepad is desired but playing on Mouse+Keyboard is not going to hinder your game experience at all\n- Very good combat system with combo strings, blocking, parrying, dash-dodging, etc\n- Level up system for your bending styles that lets you open up new combos and make the older ones stronger\n- Artifact system with a healthy amount of passive and useable items, although some of them are clearly overpowered (i'm looking at you Talisman of Healing)\n- A couple of costumes to choose from, in case you get bored of water tribe dress code\n- Helpful, but not annoying text tooltips to give you an idea of the controls and the game in general\n- Higher difficulty levels present an actual challenge\n- AI is pretty good and the enemy skill set will force you to remember which skills to dodge, to parry or look out for\n- Good balance between elements, although some of them feel stronger than others to me\n- Overall professionally made\n\nCons:\n- Some cutscenes cannot be skipped, which gets annoying if you're restarting a boss battle over and over\n- Very small variety of enemies to fight. And i mean VERY small. Enemy types: chi blockers, spirits, triad leaders, mech tank boss and the final boss. Some of them have swapped color palletes with different skills, but aside from that, that's all you'll ever see all game\n- Naga runing missions are pretty boring imo\n- You start the game with bending disabled and work your way to getting them back. Because of that, your water bending will most likely be way higher level than others and you'll probably end up using it most of the time\n- No multiplayer, in case you hopped for it\n- No Earth Kingdom costume from Book4\n\nIMO, the game is good because of a really good fighting system that keeps itself close to original animated series. The rest is meh at best.","June 18, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Afterwards you get thrown through boring city streets and the same enemy + boss fights over and over again, and you get a sinking feeling that the game is bad. However, being introduced to the new elements over time and being able to experiment with the abilities at your own pace you will probably learn how the mechanics work - and then you can start to have fun.\n\nThe pacing seems to be a bit of a problem elsewhere: there were some boss fights were the only reliable means of inflicting damage upon your target comes from countering one of their melee attacks, but in some boss fights the melee attacks are spread minutes apart which is really annoying, especially if you miss the counter!\n\ntl;dr - I do like the style, the cutscenes were great, the music was good as you would expect, the combat has pacing issues, the boss fights seem to have pacing issues in a different way.

Kinda wish Steam would implement a sort of _/5 rating system rather than "Yes or No".\nMy biggest gripe is the length of the game and the lack of enemies types and variations. For example, I was unaware the Triple Threat Triad from the show was only made up of 3 people. Every time you have to fight the Triple Threats, it's the same 3 people. The Fire Bender, Earth Bender, and Water Bender from the very first episode of Korra. They appear multiple times, sometimes consecutively and it's always the same 3 dudes with the same tactics. I'm aware that this takes place after Book 3 (or 4, I dunno, really, it could fit anywhere) so there's spirite enemies, but there's only 3 types compared to the hundreds of variations in the shows. It's also lacking a lot in boss battles. With so many interesting enemies/allies from the show, you'd think some of them would make an appearance. Almost none of them do. The only allies that appear in the game is Naga for the Temple Run-esque minigames, Bolin and Mako for the begining and ending Pro-Bending minigames and Jinora makes a few appearances as a Navi type character, and Iroh is a shop keeper. Other characters like Lin Beifong, Asami, Tenzin, etc are all left out.\n\nAt this time I have 4.4 hours on record. That's how long it took me to beat the game, and that was also me restarting again 1/4 of the way into the game. It is VERY short.\n\nNow the good parts. If you enjoyed Bayonetta you might enjoy this. It's made by the same people and generally plays just like it minus the long legs and innuendo out the endo. The story is original and apparently are voiced by the original voice actors from the animated series so at least there's that. Many of the locations are taken right out of the series so if you've watched the show you'll recognize a lot of the locations. If you havent watched Avatar Korra or played Bayonetta this game is probably not for you.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this game is VERY unforgiving and that you can end up getting stunlocked and killed in a matter of hits, or blindsided by an enemy and insta-killed","July 7, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each type of bending is different and feels completely different. They all have a different purpose in the game. I'm not telling what, or how, better to discover for yourself ;).\n- The cutscenes and voiceacting are very good!\n- Runner scenes with Naga, are a nice diversion and allows for scenery switches.\n- You feel powerful, like the avatar. And bending woohoo :)\n\nThe bad:\n- The logic of the story and using these opponents together and does not make sense to me, at all.\n- Sometimes feels like a drag, especially on the higher difficulties, it requires you to do some rage inducing tricks sometimes, feels that it's made hard, just to keep you longer in the game.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Level design, feels cheap, not too bad, but sometimes is too easy for my idea. It all fits the story and aligns with the series.\n- Pro Bending league: It is a nice addition, but feels a bit of a drag, all the matches seem the same, with in the end of Ace difficulty, there seems only one way to win.\n- Use of Bending: I think they could use a bit more of the bending types too be used in fights, only the last boss fight forces you to switch in different types.\n\nConclusion:\nThe gameplay is fun, but sometimes a bit boring. A nice extra story to explore.\nI recommend this game to be played when bought in a discount.","July 18, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty ramps up ridiculously in some fights. I had to go to the shop a billion times to buy items so I wouldn't die. I still died. And this was on normal.\n\n2.) You will get combo'd unfairly by the enemy at some points. Some of the more difficult enemies team up and feel blatantly broken when you have to 2 or 3 vs 1 them. (Airbending is the best one for this when you get it) I've even dodged out of the way of attacks and still have been hit. It can get immensely frustrating.\n\n3.) There's really not a whole lot of replayability to this game- unless you really, really like LoK and beat-em-ups.\n\n4.) No Mako, Bolin, Asami, Tenzin, etc. The world feels a bit barren sometimes.\n\nBut there are pros!\n\n1.) if you've played Bayonetta, then you'll be much more adept at picking this game up. The combat is extremely similar. Two buttons for light and heavy attacks (like bayonettas punches and kicks respectively), Right trigger for dodging attacks, air combos and air dodges. The combos have been toned down a bit though- that and you have to unlock them by either leveling up your bending or buying them.\n\n2.) The bending looks and feels pretty good. Especially when you unlock all of the combos and abilities. It take s a bit to get all your powers back, but other than that it's pretty fun.\n\n-Water is generally the ranged style. You're gonna use this one a lot. Kind of weak later on, but still useful. sometimes you'll freeze your enemies.\n\n-Earth is slow, but definitely powerful. I didn't use this one a whole lot, mostly because I preferred the other styles. This one is best with large, more static groups. Sometimes you'll stun enemies and it'll give you the chance to defeat them quickly.\n\n-Fire is close combat, and super fast strikes. It's not super powerful but it gets the job done against small groups. Sometimes enemies get set on fire.\n\n-Airbending... Well, it's like a medium range combat style? I don't really know how to put it. Regardless, this honestly feels like the most powerful style in the game, especially if you charge up the attacks. It's literally just tornadoes everywhere. One of korra's strongest moves is simply charging up her heavy attack and mashing it while in a group. It's almost overpowered, but not quite.\n\n3.) Graphics are solid. Doesn't even take much to run them on a high setting either. The visuals are like a slightly cel-shaded version of the show itself. The music is also pretty much what you'd expect from the show too. Very well done.\n\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the series, I'd say pick it up. If you aren't, then only get it if you like beat-em-ups or are interested in the show (although I'd recommend watching it first, some things won't be quite clear without that).\n","December 26, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an avatar game, which unfortunately not much can be done with, it takes place between the events of Books 2 and 3, though actually knowing the lore isn't really required it would probably help you not to be lost. It's a platinum game and has the usual fun that comes with them, but it does suffer from one bad thing. Pro-bending is abysmally terrible, which unfortunately the first mission starts you out on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omorty/recommended/281690/","omorty","OMorty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omorty/","525 products in account","I just beat this game on Casual mode, and I have a decent chunk of Normal mode completed. My impressions:\n\nPROS (Game)\n+Fast, fluid combat\n+Smooth, responsive gamepad controls\n+Great difficulty curve\n+Short, sweet, and to-the-point\n\nPROS (Port)\n+Light system requirements*\n\nMIXED (Game)\n?Naga sections**\n\nCONS (Game)\n-Asset recycling limits enemy and environment variety\n-Gameplay and story often conflict with each other***\n-Limited replay value ****\n-Music is forgettable\n\nCONS (Port)\n-Limited graphical options*****\n-No option to rebind keys\n-Mouse and keyboard controls weak overall\n\nOVERALL, it's a fun, decent beat 'em up with an inconsequential story and problems typical of games with limited budgets (and a possibly short dev cycle). Fun for what it is. It CERTAINLY doesn't deserve all the hate it's gotten, since there are far worse games set in the Avatar universe. It does feel like the groundwork for something greater though, which is unfortunate considering there most likely won't be a sequel. :/\n\nNOTES\n*My PC was built in late-2011 with lower-end parts (i3-2120, GTX-550ti) and the game still ran at a near-constant 60 FPS.\n\n**Naga sections are fun in bursts. However, since they're static endless runner-esque stages, they rely HEAVILY on trial-and-error. Sure, they're fun in bursts, but the Naga missions only get more frustrating as time goes on. Oh, and they introduce combat for these sections, BUT IT ONLY APPEARS IN ONE MISSION.\n\n***The story in a nutshell: Korra's on a quest to regain her bending abilities so she can defeat an evil old man who blocked her chi so he could unleash an army of evil spirits to take over the world. While it's pretty barebones (and not much to write home about), the game lets you replay levels while retaining the bending abilities you already regained. Because of that you end up having to hear dialogue, watch cutscenes, and do things to regain bending abilities you already have! It makes things very incoherent, which can be pretty jarring.\n\n****All you can really unlock after beating the game are more combos (which, in some ways, are Dyntasy Warriors levels of simple), a harder difficulty, a Pro Bending arena mode (which can be blasted through pretty quickly), and some extra costumes. Not much considering there are indie games that go for the same price that offer much more content.\n\n*****The only options you can adjust in-game are the resolution (which maxes out at 1080p) and if graphics will be "smooth" or "normal." I'm assuming the latter refers to some anti-aliasing, but I have no idea given how vague that setting is worded in-game. I had to mess with the graphical settings in the nVidia control tab to apply some extra graphical effects.","July 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/recommended/281690/","RunningShovel","Shovel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/","231 products in account","This is the Korra-est game I could have asked for, and that's saying something. If you're familiar with the financial tribulations of the show, you'll know what to expect. If not, the outline goes like this: The didn't get a lot of funding, but they did the best they could, and it turned out pretty good. Thus, I won't deny that it's a low-budget game, but I think it's a good game too. I find it quite fitting, and at a low price tag, I really thought it was worth it.\n\nThe game is set between Seasons 2 and 3 of the series, which is quite a nice point to put it. There's so much Avatar Stuff in this game, and they really tried to cram it in at the seams. The fanservice is on point here, if that's what you're after. Basically everything from the first two seasons makes it in here in some fashion. You get to play as Korra, of course, and that's cool. But you also get to run around in a bunch of important locations. Republic City, Air Temple Island, you even pop into the Spirit World for a bit.\n\nYou get to ride Naga. Sure, it's a minigame, but that's another Avatar experience they managed to squish in and it's pretty fun I guess. There's also a Pro-bending minigame, which was completely unnecessary. But again, more Avatar Stuff and it's pretty fun too. The collectables are all items of interest from the series, and so are all the shop items. Hell, the shop itself made me giggle a little with joy. Many of the Achievements are quotes from the show, and a couple also made me giggle. The more you progress, the more stuff you come across from the show, and there's lots of it to find. It's cel-shading looks nice and quite like the show. Hell, the cutscenes ARE the show. It's super nice.\n\nThe Combat: Oh lawdy, does it feel good. This is where a lot of the love went, and it really shows. If you know Platinum Games, you'll know the tight combat they're reputed for, and this is no exception. Each element has it's own characteristics, moveset and stance. Between the four elements, there's an okay number of moves, but each one is something cool, and only a few strikes double up exactly in effects. You can switch element with impunity, and flitting between them during a fight feels really good. You're the Avatar, of course you can change it up. Also Avatar State is a thing, it's alright, but elemental storms are more fun to do.\n\nThe combat system is smart, easy to understand, but there's a lot of nuance. Getting the best out of your moves in a fight requires flow and timing, which is a nice analogue to the martial arts bending is based on. You can combo into special moves while staying in an element or switch and execute them outright with some stick trickery, which makes for some interesting possibilities once you've unlocked the entire moveset. The block/parry system is also sound, and you can defend almost everything. You can even knock back projectiles with some timing! Needless to say, mastering it makes you feel untouchable. Another plus is the Talisman system, in which you can pick 'n' mix four items with various effects. Healing, damage, stun resistance, money generation, run speed, the list goes on. It's a nice little touch to add some extra depth.\n\nDid I mention you keep your unlocks per-save? It's neat to go back and trash enemies you had trouble with as a full-fledged Avatar. Each fight is also medalled, with a chapter medal being an average of that playthrough. Each difficulty gets it's own average medal once you finish every chapter, so if you're into score attack type stuff this could be fun. Personally I enjoyed trying to Gold everything a lot, and it's an encouragement to get better at bending to score better medals. Given it's a Platinum work, Extreme difficulty is HARD. Not cheap by any means though, just challenging as hell and a real nice second wind for the game.\n\nLet's get down to everything bad I can think of about the game, then I'll counter those, then I'll wrap up.\n\n- It's short:\nIf you're good, you'll burn through it in 4-5 hours on Normal. You won't unlock half the stuff or find half the secrets, but if you wanna pump 'n' dump this is not for you. If you'd like to unlock everything and wring it for what it's worth, I played through every difficulty, unlocked everything and got all the Achievements in about 21 hours, and I enjoyed all of it. I still pop it in occasionally to let loose on some bad guys.\n\n- It's a bad episode:\nThe antagonist and plot both feel a little thin, and it's more an excuse to string in all the Avatar Stuff in the game. I don't mind, as I'm more interested in doing Avatar Stuff anyway, but if it's literature you want, you're in the wrong place.\n\n- Low variety of enemies:\nWhile the combat is good, there's a basic handful of recycled enemy types for each of the three factions. They wear a little thin after a while, even if they start mixing up the combinations. One playthrough is fine, but after a couple you find yourself wishing for even two or three more variants.\n\nEnding on a positive note:\n\n+\nBending feels great and is really fun\nFanservice out the wazoo\nBasically a long, interactive episode of Korra with lots of fights\nLow asking price makes no bones about contents\n\nIn closing, it's cheap and cheerful, and very like the series it's based on. Considering the financial disdain that seems to be shown for the property, we can't expect AAA greatness, as much as that pains me. But, I am quite happy if this is the shot they gave it. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it a real fun gamification of the series I enjoyed so much already. Despite money problems, it's got a lot of love poured into it, and I can appreciate that much.","August 7, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of korra's strongest moves is simply charging up her heavy attack and mashing it while in a group. It's almost overpowered, but not quite.\n\n3.) Graphics are solid. Doesn't even take much to run them on a high setting either. The visuals are like a slightly cel-shaded version of the show itself. The music is also pretty much what you'd expect from the show too. Very well done.\n\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the series, I'd say pick it up. If you aren't, then only get it if you like beat-em-ups or are interested in the show (although I'd recommend watching it first, some things won't be quite clear without that).\n","December 26, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat, even with its wonky balance, is responsive, fast and satisfying as is to be expected of anything by Platinum. You'll finish the game in an afternoon, but there's some replay value in there too. Presentation is quite obviously done on a budget but it still manages to look good, plus the cutscene animation is almost shoulder-to-shoulder with the show.\n\nUnfortunately what really made the Korra TV series so great is its story, themes and characters, and this game basically has no real plot to speak of. Its place in the continuity of the show means that the writers could only either a) Tell a good, meaningful and significant story that clashed with the main series, b) Tell a meaningful story that sat far too separate to the series to be relatable for fans of the show, or c) Pinch some characters from the show and stick them in a side adventure with low stakes, no arcs and no consequence.\n\nOption C is what was chosen here and the game suffers for it. It's a shame. I can still recommend it as a way to waste away an evening or two on its combat alone, but wait for a sale.","September 14, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My impressions:\n\nPROS (Game)\n+Fast, fluid combat\n+Smooth, responsive gamepad controls\n+Great difficulty curve\n+Short, sweet, and to-the-point\n\nPROS (Port)\n+Light system requirements*\n\nMIXED (Game)\n?Naga sections**\n\nCONS (Game)\n-Asset recycling limits enemy and environment variety\n-Gameplay and story often conflict with each other***\n-Limited replay value ****\n-Music is forgettable\n\nCONS (Port)\n-Limited graphical options*****\n-No option to rebind keys\n-Mouse and keyboard controls weak overall\n\nOVERALL, it's a fun, decent beat 'em up with an inconsequential story and problems typical of games with limited budgets (and a possibly short dev cycle). Fun for what it is. It CERTAINLY doesn't deserve all the hate it's gotten, since there are far worse games set in the Avatar universe. It does feel like the groundwork for something greater though, which is unfortunate considering there most likely won't be a sequel. :/\n\nNOTES\n*My PC was built in late-2011 with lower-end parts (i3-2120, GTX-550ti) and the game still ran at a near-constant 60 FPS.\n\n**Naga sections are fun in bursts. However, since they're static endless runner-esque stages, they rely HEAVILY on trial-and-error. Sure, they're fun in bursts, but the Naga missions only get more frustrating as time goes on. Oh, and they introduce combat for these sections, BUT IT ONLY APPEARS IN ONE MISSION.\n\n***The story in a nutshell: Korra's on a quest to regain her bending abilities so she can defeat an evil old man who blocked her chi so he could unleash an army of evil spirits to take over the world. While it's pretty barebones (and not much to write home about), the game lets you replay levels while retaining the bending abilities you already regained. Because of that you end up having to hear dialogue, watch cutscenes, and do things to regain bending abilities you already have! It makes things very incoherent, which can be pretty jarring.\n\n****All you can really unlock after beating the game are more combos (which, in some ways, are Dyntasy Warriors levels of simple), a harder difficulty, a Pro Bending arena mode (which can be blasted through pretty quickly), and some extra costumes. Not much considering there are indie games that go for the same price that offer much more content.\n\n*****The only options you can adjust in-game are the resolution (which maxes out at 1080p) and if graphics will be "smooth" or "normal." I'm assuming the latter refers to some anti-aliasing, but I have no idea given how vague that setting is worded in-game. I had to mess with the graphical settings in the nVidia control tab to apply some extra graphical effects.","July 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's just see if the game can be worthy of something or not, though.\nThe main beef of the title has an action game is the four bending styles you have at your disposal: you can cycle between them and level up each to unlock more moves. Every style has its advantages and disadvantages (airbending dishes out less damage but can stagger entire crowds of enemies, while firebending has a poor range but hurts a lot). The Legend of Korra may also be short, but it's legitimately difficult, even on normal difficulty: it's of vital importance to learn to dodge unblockable attacks and counter your enemies move (taking advantage of QTEs to dispatch them quickly). During the levels you can collect spiritual energy that can be used in a shop between chapters to unlock powerups and other goodies to make your life easier. The game has a single final boss in the very end but a lot of mini-bosses in-between.\nThe gameplay features some riding sequences with Korra's pet, Naga, which are about dodging obstacles till you reach the end of the level: they are not entertaining as you'd expect them to be and can become frustrating quickly.\nAfter you beat the main story, the only things you can do at this point are either to return to the various chapters for the collectable you missed, try to beat the game on the new extreme difficulty and take part in the pro-bending minigame.\nIf you are a fan of the cartoon series, the game will definitely have a certain appeal to you, but don't expect much: there are no appearences to speak of from most of the characters and the locations you visit (Republic City, the Air Temple, the Pole and the Spirit World) aren't fleshed out that much.\nWe can safely consider the Legend of Korra a missed opportunity as a licensed game but, to be fair, there is some little fun one may have in those short four hours","December 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each type of bending is different and feels completely different. They all have a different purpose in the game. I'm not telling what, or how, better to discover for yourself ;).\n- The cutscenes and voiceacting are very good!\n- Runner scenes with Naga, are a nice diversion and allows for scenery switches.\n- You feel powerful, like the avatar. And bending woohoo :)\n\nThe bad:\n- The logic of the story and using these opponents together and does not make sense to me, at all.\n- Sometimes feels like a drag, especially on the higher difficulties, it requires you to do some rage inducing tricks sometimes, feels that it's made hard, just to keep you longer in the game.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Level design, feels cheap, not too bad, but sometimes is too easy for my idea. It all fits the story and aligns with the series.\n- Pro Bending league: It is a nice addition, but feels a bit of a drag, all the matches seem the same, with in the end of Ace difficulty, there seems only one way to win.\n- Use of Bending: I think they could use a bit more of the bending types too be used in fights, only the last boss fight forces you to switch in different types.\n\nConclusion:\nThe gameplay is fun, but sometimes a bit boring. A nice extra story to explore.\nI recommend this game to be played when bought in a discount.","July 18, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A new sequel for the serie using the same storyline! Ok, nice! It has animated cutscenes! Nice too! And the gameplay is good too. But the thing I like the most is that, as an enthusiastic of martial arts + avatar universe, there are fantastic moves that you realize you can do identical of the animation moves. By the way, I need to say: the fights in The Legend of Korra animation are far below in quality from The Last Airbender serie... but by this game, I think I can make Korra fight like Aang, and revenge this lack.","July 9, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fun combat, very challenging.\n2. Frequent cutscenes which look very much like the show.\n3. Meta games included which require fast reflexes.\n4. Pro bending meta game is fun and feels like it ties into the show well.\n5. Item shop offers some replayability and ways to reduce frustration.\n\nCons:\n1. AI does not do anything when not shown on-screen unless the AI was the last one you attacked.  Not a big deal when fighting a single character but makes fighting crowds a little unbelievable and unbalanced.\n2. Some of the cutscenes are entirely unnecessary, like the ones which show Korra unlocking an ability.  I would have preferred to see in-game animations.  Thankfully, I was able to skip cutscenes when I found them obnoxious.\n3. Meta games seem a little unnecessary and the game forces you to complete them to continue the story.\n4. Beating story mode unlocks pro bending mode for those who just want to play pro bending matches.\n5. Items go away when consumed and do not come back if you restart the level.\n\nGood game for Korra fans.","August 1, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippymagoo/recommended/281690/","zippymagoo","BurgerDaddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippymagoo/","171 products in account","PROS\n- Legit as ****.  The bending is spot on, it feels like it should, different elements play differently and hence there is a reason to think about when to use each - however, it's not set in stone, you can use what you want when you want.\n- Has enough reflex-dependent mechanics that it feels skillfull, and fast-paced enough that it really feels like a fight.\n- Everything looks and sounds great.\n- Pacing is good, and the game keeps it interesting by jumping back and forth between kung-fu fighting and riding around on your polar bear dog.\n\nCONS\n- SHORT.  I beat it on normal mode in about 3 hours.  I plan to replay it tho just cause of how fun it was, so the shortness is offset a bit.  But still, 3 hours is really short.\n- You can break the challenge super hard with talismans, at least on normal.  Granted, the talismans also cut your health in half with each one you use, but you can become a big enough powerhouse that it doesn't even matter after a certain point.  NOTE: I haven't played on Extreme difficulty yet, which may account for this.\n- Story is really basic and cliche.  I don't care about story though so this didn't matter to me but I'm mentioning it because I know some people care.\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If you like character action games, fighting games, or even action mmos, then you'll probably have a lot of fun with this.  I rarely play games again once I've beaten them, but I'm excited about going through this one on the higher difficulty again.","December 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you watched Korra then you really should play this game!\n2.) Is it a block buster title? No.\n3.) Is it worth its value? Hell yeah!\n\nKorra is a game that could have been more and really it should have. However with limited time and money Platinum games  have easily achieved more than what some AAA games achieved this year. With any decent computer this game will run perfectly smooth with crisp visuals that look just like the shows beautiful animation. The story really doesn't hit any high notes which is a bit disappointing considering the great writing for the TV show. But the game makes up for the story with its focus on the fighting. With the control of the 4 elements Korra can pull of some amazing combos. Unfortunately the game can become a bit repetitive and can be considered very difficult. If your not in the mood to play a game that can be so difficult then you can drop the difficulty down and enjoy the ride.","December 26, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love it, and you probably will too. Quick note on my for context- I have seen both "Avatar the Last Airbender" and "The Legend of Korra", and love the shows. I've also played many games similar to this one, have an XBOX 360 controller (highly recommended for full enjoyment), and before writing this review i acquired every achievement possible in the game.\n\nPros:\n+Be able to master all 4 different types of bending. I can't tell you how satisfying the combat is. Imagine God of War where you actually use all the other types of weapons besides your default Chains of Hades and The Blade of Olympus.\n\n+Original Story from the show. Some may see this as a negative thing, but i enjoyed the brief story arc. It fits well both with the timeline of the show, its cannon, and feel overall (NOTE: GAME'S STORY PLACE AFTER SEASON 3, BEFORE SEASON 4)\n\n+Pro-bending as well as a main story. Both are quite fun. Additionally your teamates scale based on your Fire/Earth bending mastery which is nice because they are quite capable allies as you level them higher.\n\n+The ability to go through the story again at full power. You have the abiliy (once you beat the game once) to go back with all your bending powers (including avatar state) and replay old missions. Right along with this, you can reset your full game at any time to relive the story. Having both of these as options is spectacular- and many other games should have this feature as well\n\n+The difficulty of the game is perfect. For both pro-bending and the story, casual is correctly adjusted to weaker players. Normal is no walk in the park, yet not frustratingly impossbile, and extreme, while difficult - can be managed if you invest into becoming the best avatar you can be (maxing your bending abilities, praciting combos, and using the correct talismans)\n\n+As far as i can tell, all the  Original Voice Actors from the show are here. I may be wrong, but most are and they make a big difference in enjoying the game\n\n+Female Protagonist. There aren't enough of them. She's a great femanist figure who is strong, independant, smart, capable, beautiful yet not oversexualized. This bullet point is very rare to find any almost any game\n\n+Family Friendly. This probably isn't a big deal for most of you reading this, but for people who do have kids/spouses (like my wife) who are sensative to needless violence - this is perfect.\n\n+Never get the same boss fight twice. Sometimes you fight more in different scenerios, but this keeps things changing and keeps things fun.\n\n+the game isn't too heavy for most computers. With some basic components this game should run just fine with no bugs.\n\n+Great for all types of gamers. Like speed-running? This has a lot of speedrunning potential. Want to grind for 100%? there is a good bit of that if you wish. Don't want to grind, but just play a quick fun game? This is also possible and you won't feel like you're missing anything! Like easter eggs and secrets? The Vanity Items as well as hidden areas with small rewards and fights are quite rewarding and numerous.\n\nCons:\n\n-Game isn't long enough. When you have such a great game, i just wish it was longer.\n\n-Along with the previous bullet point, there isn't enough stage variety.  There are so many places in this world we could have traveled to with people to meet and bosses to fight. IE: Anywhere in the Fire Nation, Old Airbending Temples, Metal Prisons, Airships, the North Pole, other locations in the earth Kingdom etc. Just thinking of these you can imagine how far they could have taken it. Sadly the game only features Capital City, The South Pole, and one location in the spirit world. However, don't let this bullet point keep you from buying the game. Yes, there are enough changes to make the game fun and different.\n\n-Combat can be a little repatative, but most other action-adventure games like this are bound to be. If anything this has more variety than other games of the same variety. Don't let this bullet point keep you from buying the game\n\n-If you haven't seen the show, you won't like it as much. Combat will still be fun but the story will fall flat without character and background development by the story provided (NOTE: GAME'S STORY PLACE AFTER SEASON 3, BEFORE SEASON 4)\n\n-No Trading Cards. I would pay real money for a full collection of these trading cards. But then again when even the Fallout games don't have trading cards, i can't complain too much.\n\nEnding Result:\nIf you have seen "Avatar the Last Airbender" and/or "The Legend of Korra", buy this game now. Easily worth $30-$35. $15 is a steal at a great price. Anything less and you will want to tip the creators when you're done because you didn't pay them enough.\n\nIf you haven't seen "Avatar the Last Airbender" and/or "The Legend of Korra", i would still buy this game, but to you it would be worth about $15-$20. Anything less should be a no-brainer and you'll have no regrets.\n\nTL;DR Buy this game. Just buy it faster if you're a fan of the show.","May 25","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using the Avatar universe's ability to bend elements, players are able to shift and change out movesets on the fly to rack up combos. It's a classic brawler not usually seen in the modern PC age, but it's extremely fun. The enemies, taken from a period between Seasons 2 and 3 of the show, can provide a fair challenge out of sheer numbers, though they do lack a bit of variety as the game continues.\n\nThink of this as Platinum-Lite. It's a solid actioner that is well worth a good sale price. However, it does lack the depth and time you would see in their other titles. Fans of Korra will likely get a kick out of the animated cutscenes and general gameplay, and players unfamiliar with the world should have fun killing a few hours if you can get it for $5.\n\nDon't expect a lot of replay, but it's hardly a disappointment for the price, either.","January 25, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I recommand a Xbox 360 controller.\nSecondly, you better be a fan of the series.\n\nAs in the series, you are the Avatar Korra and you can control the 4 elements (Earth, Fire, Air and Water).\nAll of them are nicely animated and are useful in different situations. Simple example : Water is good for long range attacks, Fire is all about close range, Earth deal huge damage but is slow and Air is really good against huge enemies waves...\n\nThe overall fighting system includes parrying (Counter attacks), dodging and davastating combos.\nThe game can felt a bit hard in normal difficulty.\n\nYou also have 2 specific mods that includes Naga runs and Pro-Bending. Naga runs are quite fun, especially once you have all of your elements but Pro-Bending is somehow boring.\n\nConcerning the series, you'll fight against season 1 and season 2 enemies such as Chi-Blockers but it takes place between season 2 and season 3.\n\nI blame the extreme difficulty level that felt a bit easy with all the maxed bendings (NG+) and the little longevity (around 6/7h).","June 21, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game pulls no punches. At first glance, it appears to be a kids game, but don't let the cartoon style fool you. This game is hard. I managed to beat it on normal difficulty in about 4-5 hours, which was hard enough at it was. But then I tried it on hard and was completely slaughtered on the third level. It is an extremely fast paced game that requires insane reflexes. Then there is the pro bending side game. It is also hard as hell, but quite fun. My only real complaint about the pro bending is that when you are fighting your way through a particular class and exit for some reason, you have to start that class over. I imagine that was to add time to clock. The story is minimal, as the focus of this game is clearly fast paced action. When you beat the game, you can carry over all of your unlockables and powers to the next playthrough, which adds replay value. I recommend this game to anyone who likes a difficult, fast paced action game. It's a plus if you are also a fan of the Avatar show.","December 30, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As soon as I heard The Legend of Korra is getting a video game, I rolled my eye immediately at how most video game adaptations of shows end up being mediocre to just plain bad... Until I found out it was platinum games that was developing it. It's a beautiful game as well as challenging, which is not surprising at all. Its only drawvack is ironically its length. When I beat it, I felt I wanted to play more. I didn't feel I have invested enough time in it, since the campaign on normal is fairly short (5 hours max). This is a must buy for any of the show fans but I would not recommend it to non fans of the show.

No water, earth, fire or air bending so you fight at start with the traditional punching and kicking combo.

The bending is fun and the combat is great. Those familiar with platinum games will be somewhat quickly acclimated to the combat style. It feels closely similar to Bayonetta but isnt as polished or in depth. This doesnt deter from the games combat, which is its focus as theres still fun to be had. That said, this feels like a 15 dollar demo than anything else. The enemies are all practically the sam with little variations and the few benders that you encounter early on are all the same. (If you know the triple threat, prepare to fight them and their recolors). Being a platinum game, i expected...abit more, to say the least in terms of content, but i guess thats why the game is 15 dollars. If you're a fan of the legend of korra series, i say pick this up.

A lackluster story, no supporting caracters (aside from spirit Jinora) and the god awful Naga sections drags the overall impression down a bit, however the combat is solid and weaving the elements together in a free flowing way (or just sticking to your favorite) makes for a entertaining few hours of gameplay.\n\nThe game is a bit on the short side however (4,6hrs to clear normal mode including repeating a few levels for score and bending levels) and it can be a tad on the easy side once you start leveling up your various bending arts and get the dodge/counters down (the health regen talisman also severly decreases difficulty), but you can also increase the challange by equipping the health decreasing talismans for boosts.\n\nOverall this game is in my opinion well worth the asking price if you like platinum brawlers, and while it might not hold a candle to games like MGR:Revengeance and (hopefully) Bayonetta 2 it's still a decent game in it's own right, especially if you enjoy the avatar universe.","October 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Not worthy of the avatar name, a series known for its masterful storytelling. It's your basic Villain does bad thing cause evil storyline with no character development, nothing but exposition and boring locations to boot.\n\nPlus if you haven't seen Korra, say goodbye to understanding anything about this game's world.  It explains nothing, no past events, no world building, Korra mentions multiple times characters from seasons 1 and 2 but never are they explained and to anyone who is new this Avatar's world will just be confused.\n\nThe game’s enemy variety is horrible also.  There are Chi blockers and Spirits for your basic enemy types which are pretty much just reskins of each other.  They all hit the same just with more or less health.  They do have multiple different shi blockers though, but only 3 different types.\n\nThey also repeat mini boss and boss battles multiple times.  You will fight the same water bender, fire bender and earth bender at least 5 times.  Probably more, I lost count (Also, they feel like the same enemy with different visuals).  And there are a total of three different bosses in the game, a giant robot which you fight 4 times or more (Sometimes two at once), a giant spirit and the final boss villain.\n\nAlso this may seem to be just my experience but there was a huge difficulty curve near the end with the final boss, with him having near unblockable attacks and a huge amount of armour and health.\n\nThe combat however is very responsive and enjoyable as said before. Welding the four elements and switching them up at will is fun and the game feels like a platinum games spectacle fighter with nice flashy visuals.  However it is a rather basic system so don’t go in expecting DMC levels of complexity.\n\nNow I must talk about the two mini game sections that are in this as well.  The first is a pro bending mini game that is pretty accurate to the shows.  Its very fun to play this one and you can play in leagues of difficulty only playing this mini game once you have beaten the main story.  I really enjoyed this part of the game and wish that they had expanded this further.\n\nHowever, the sections with Naga are awful.  Imagine paying temple run with a controller.  Its that and it's unnecessary and is only there to pad this game out.\n\nWhat's more, this game is only 3 hours long if you play the main story on normal, which for 20 bucks is debatable in my opinion.\n\nOverall, good combat but everything else besides the probending mini game really don’t hold up.  Only buy if on sale.","April 9","false","6.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Some elements of the game do not dissapoint, such as the voice acting, are well done. The pro-bending section is the highlight of the game, although that in itself should tell you something.\n\nEverything else is a let-down. The combat is cited as a positive aspect of the game in most reviews. but I'm not sure why this is; when there are more than a couple of enemies, you have to resort to endless dodging whilst using the occasional bit of bending. Combined with the few different types of enemies, this means the gameplay gets VERY boring very quickly. This is made worse by the genuinely awful camera, the less said about which the better.\n\nMost dissapointing of all is the lack of detail in the locations. I appreciate that it is an action game, and the studio were probably on a tight budget, but it's very dull walking through a Republic City where every street, wall and door look identical. Even on a tight budget, I feel this could be better.\n\nFinally, a less significant problem, but still worth mentioning: often the camera will zoom in on a point of interest when you enter a new area. Obviously this is something many games do. However, these sections take an unusually long amount of time in this game; you can end up staring at a pair of chi-blockers for 20 seconds. Why?\n\nAs a huge Avatar fan, I am very, very dissapointed. If you're desparate to play the game, make sure you get it heavily discounted.","June 18, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

It is a license game think of that what you want.\n\nFirst of: I think the storyline is okay, nothing special. You have the basic cast and a new villain. I do however think that the extra mode, Pro-bending, is the strongest and the weakest aspect of the game.\n\nThe good: It feels cool when you dodge, counter and absolutly crush your opponent. Water (which is the only element you bend) feels very balance and powerful. The design of the ring and how the rules work, is amazing.\n\nThe bad: The AI is way too cheap; on ace they block and dodge for an eternity. Building up at powerful projecttil looses it's awesomeness when the opponent can just dodge it. Im pretty sure the very last team on ace has a combustion bender, and having an attack you can't react to is damn near cheating, in a sport where only three elements apply. Neither can you pick your element, you are stuck with Korra who can only use water. Picking between the three members of the Fire Ferrets would have been cool.\nAnd sadly there is no multiplayer, it would fit right in with Pro-bending, hell just co-op would have been nice.\n\nIf you enjoy short, cheap games: this one is gold, however I would not recommend any child to play the game, it is just too unforgiving.","November 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/recommended/281690/","rabcor","Easter Bunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/","382 products in account","The Legend of Korra developed by Platinum games and published by Activision. This game is awesome, especially if you don't mind a little bit of difficulty (although if you do, just play on casual) the only shortcoming of this game (besides lack of cross platform support), and the reason for it's surprisingly cheap price tag is that it's a bit short, your first playthrough of it will range anywhere between 2-4 hours. So do take your time with it.\n\nBut to make up for it's short play time, it is very replayable, you aren't going to explore all the game's content in just 2-4 hours, for example there is an extreme difficulty setting and a pro-bending minigame that isn't unlocked until after you complete the game once, and there are also fun items that can be played with that you won't be able to afford with just one playthrough, and unlockable costumes. And since the game is just so bloody fun, and challenging to boot, it's not hard to want to play more of it after you finish it once.\n\nOverall I'd say that this is a very top quality buttonmashing game, and if an expansion or game #2 will be made by the same developers, I would buy it on the spot. It's also quite rare to see big publishers like Activision sell games at a more than fair price, so I feel that they deserve my money for this one.\n\nThe only problem in terms of content you may run into is the lwo quality of cinematics between levels, their sound volume is inconsistent with the volume of the game, and it seems to be quite low res (720p) with a bad upscaling algorithm in place (naturally as a game engine it's not exactly designed around video playback), and of course since this is a buttonmashing game, a controller is recommended (Preferably an X360 emulating controller)\n\nI recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Japanese buttonmashers like Bayonetta, Okami and Devil May Cry, and also of course for anyone who is a fan of The Legend of Korra tv series. The game's storyline is a sidestory between Season 2 and Season 3 (so you only need to have seen as much of the series as the first two seasons to understand the story)","November 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Regardless of how far off that first moment of parental smack down was, the simple paradox of our desire to preserve and smash fighting is somehow intrinsic to our nature. While conflict is often a result of various parties failing to see each other's subjectivities, we do usually head straight to fistcuffs before higher functions take us down from the animal world. It is perhaps our movement away from violence that betters us, but hot damn do I love a good fighting game. Why is Korra fighting these folks? I don't know! I've never seen the anime or the movie or the trailer for this game, but what I am trying to get down to is that like Platinum's other maligned brawler (Madworld... which IMHO is their best brawler) Korra manages to get that instinctual desire to conflict down pact, it throws in a few light rpg like elements in the form of items, talismans, and consumables, it has combo challenges in the form of chests, it in other other words takes the formula of beat 'm and runs with it. Does it carry ideas as far as Bayonetta? ♥♥♥♥ no. This is a parred down brawler, but if cheesy sombrero wearing cyborgs fail to entice you, or a well mannered protoganist with a lovely assortment of friends might seem like your thing, this game rules. The combat builts into satisfying dodge and parry mechanics while the minor leveling system is easily gamed, In other words, yes mr. pro-gamer might thing this game sucks, but if you're a noob to the genre by all means dive in,","October 25, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Not counting the time I spent playing pro bending after I beat story mode and a few afk's here and there, I completed this game in about 4 to 4 and a half hours. So given that, only catch this on sale. I got it for about $3.75 and at that price it is well worth it for a once-through. For a game based on a Nickelodeon show, which I didn't know until after I bought it, it sure as hell is difficult. Some fights are insanely difficult akin to the likes of some fights in Metal Gear Revengeance. The last boss was ridiculously hard at first and completely crushed me a few times until I realized that you just have to constantly dodge around and strike with earth and fire for more dmg otherwise you will never make his life drop fast enough with air or water. I don't know who they were marketing this game to besides people with built up action game skill because anyone else will most likely put easily twice as much time into this as normal and some people may even get stuck on some of the ridiculously hard fights.\n\nThe art style is great and is the game's best aspect. The fighting is solid and a lot of fun and the levels are well made and fun to fight through. The music is fitting and the sounds are really good. The parts where you ride on your giant dog through levels is a lot of fun too and a great part of the game. Aside from at time besides frustrating, I enjoyed the entire game very much. Its main problem though is its very short length.\n\n8/10 great for one playthrough","July 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But thats about it. Once i maxed meself out, completed all the levels and pro bending tournements...There really wasn't much to do. I didn't feel like playing anymore...I LOVE the Legend of Korra! I WANT to play more...But there just isn't much else to do...\n\nPros:\n-Awesome fight sequences\n-Animations true to the show\n-Decent range of abilities to use and defend against.\n-Pro-Bending\n\nCons:\n-The enemies become rather repetetive and are obviously copied...The only elemental benders you can fight are Two-Toed Ping or whatshisname, Shady Shin and some other crony, all in different colours, its like Korra's first meeting where she beat up some mafia crooks every time they want a bending battle...\n-Animations, compared to the show, are extremely bare bones.\n-The range of abilities for both you and your enemies don't feel very balanced, where you can both feel like a Super Saiyan one moment and be beaten to death by a rope the next. This is especially true in max difficulty. Which usually i wouldn't mind, but considering max difficulty is the only thing that keeps you going after 10 or so hours...Its kind of a big thing.\n-Pro-Bending gets repetitive and boring real fast.\n-8 levels?! Seriously?! You explore hardly anthing in this amazing world!\n-Controls on the keyboard feel clunky and use detailed and unnesessary patern of bottons without interuption for the more ellaborate abilities...Hard to do in this game, with the amount of CC the enemies use.\n-Considering max difficulty is the only thing to go on after 10 or so hours in, it is HARD! Almost impossable...In fact, i wouldn't even be selling this to kids, they just couldn't compete witht he difficulty of end game. On max difficulty, i have yet to complete the final Naga run (Oh, yeah, those are just annoying, its like Temple Run where you have to reach the end to complete) with ONLY one lfe! The robots three mecha suits need destroying. one is hard enough, but they keep throwing everything at me in an unpredictable cycle...The other hard level is the final boss, fair play, but its still not as unfair as the Naga run.","February 16","false","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

You wake up finding all your dance moves gone and stolen by the old lemon because he be jelly.

You can swap between bending styles (types of combos) easily. While enemy vareity is very limited, bosses seem to be damage sponges with counter attacks being the only real weakness of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jowy/recommended/281690/","jowy","tentacleTherapist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jowy/","83 products in account","This game was released on multiple platforms (PC, Xbox One/360 and PS3/PS4) on 21/22 October 2014 and it was developed by Platinum Games, the same people behind Bayonetta.\nEveryone assumed that since Bayonetta peeps were working on this it was going to be a masterpiece. But instead, all we got was a terrible rip off of others games with some petty graphics filled with bugs and approximate textures.\n\nSo, what’s really wrong in this game? You start fighting Dark Spirits where the Tree of Time is, using all elements because you’re…duh, the Avatar. I admit it’s fun here, even know you have totally no clue of your doings and you just keep smashing buttons randomly.\n\nLegend of KorraThen stuff happens and you get ripped off all your elements, AGAIN. Equalists. And this is where the tedious part begins.\nYou start fighting the same enemies and bosses over and over in places that look the same.\nThe formula is: Equalists, some kind of Big Daddy machina dude, and the Triple Threat Triad.  And that was four hours into the game, after that I couldn’t bear any second longer.\n\nOkay. Enemies are boring but at least fighting is exciting? No.\nYou need get back your elements, starting with water. And once you get a bending back, you can level them up and buying up more combos in the shop. It does sound cool but there are no complex moves and you will most likely use the same element and skills repeatedly. You have two attacks, plus one button to dodge and one to defend and one to switch elements.\n\nPro-Bending tournament is there, and it’s nicely done. You can unlock it after beating the game, and unfortunately I can’t say much about it, since I only got to complete a match during the storyline.\n\nLegend of KorraExploration is basically zero and everything is almost a corridor that looks the same. There are few treasures to discover in order to gain spirits points (I’ll explain their use after).\nSometimes you need to travel for “long” distances and… which is the best way? Riding Naga of course! Too bad it’s a hideous Temple Run rip off. Literally.\nAnd it suffers the lack of your average phone sensors, so you need further inputs to move your character from left-center-right.\n\nYou will eventually run into Iroh spirit in-game who will give you access to the shop.\nYou can buy health and raise potions, power ups and new skills using spirit points you earn when killing off enemies, finding out secret items and destroying random cars or others objects around.\n\nMusic wise, you can hear the same tunes over and over during fights. Nothing special here.There are also nice animated clips which are probably the only good thing of this game.\n\nI don’t like giving scores. But I suggest you to save up those 15 bucks and get a Pizza instead. I am both a gamer and a huge fan of this show, but it’s not enough force myself to finish it.","November 26, 2014","false","4.9"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/281690/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","It is time to do maths!\n\nAvatar: the Last Airbender/the Legend of Korra is pretty much the best animated show on the air at this time...if not ever. Platinum Games is, hands down, the best game developer at this time. You can deny or agrue, but when it comes to sheer gameplay and content, Platinum Games will deliver in spades, and then some. So, put these two together and you should get the greatest cartoon game ever right? No. It's a hyperbolic equasion; it tapers to the perfect point, but never reaches it.\n\nIt is easy to start comparing Korra to Platinum's action magnum opus: Bayonetta. They're both action games. Focus on building combos. Your performance is graded with medals, etc. However, when all is said and done, Korra doesn't even come close to Bayonetta, but you will still feel hints of it's sublime combat system. Korra then is more of a gateway to Platinum's more prolific works, rather than a full blown Cuhrayzee brawler.\n\nFor reasons, the game starts out with Korra losing her bending powers to a group of familliar assailants, led by a mysterious old man. You then beat your way through various battles to get your bending abilities back, as well as figuring out what this old man is up to. The short story is laid out like a few episodes in the series. It even starts with the actual opening and credits, complete with voice cast and soundtrack. Nickelodeon gave Platinum full access to the show's resources, and the result is an awkwardly accurately licensed game. It will remind you of the time when Capcom made all the cool cartoon games for the SNES.\n\nThe gameplay itself does lack a bit of the polish you have come to expect from Platinum. The combat (which is basically what the game consists of) allows you to use all four bending styles to overcome your foes. Waterbending has the best range, but is slow and lacks punch. Earthbending is extremely strong, but slow and cannot be blocked. Firebending is fast and direct and will allow your built massive combos fast in exchange for range. And finally, Airbending has a wide range and allows you to hit a lot of enemies at the same time, in echange for power. All powers can be swapped at any time to extend your combo. Allowing to freely flow from fire, into air and onto water, to finally finish with a big rock to the face. The downside is that the management of the camera and the interpreting of your opponents has become an afterthought for the developers. You just wail on them until they die. If you messed up your positioning when you began the combo, they will beat you mercilessly. You can block, counter or dodge them with a single button press, but it does not create an opening through Witch Time like in Bayonetta. The result culminates in some very frustrating encounters down the line.\n\nHowever, this is a Platinum game. These guys want you to replay their work. You finish the game in a few hours, granted that you get past some hairy battles. The game then invites you to replay to unlock your full powers and unleash all hell on the enemies that mocked you before. The game instantly becomes more fun than your first time throught and you'll even come back again on the higher difficulties just to get that one locked costume.\n\nFor a change of pace, the game lets you play some elaborate "Temple Run" adaptation. You race around town on the back of your polarbeardog (deal with it), Naga. You can use bending to protect yourself, shoot obstacles, do faster or catch more air. It's a well done part and it doesn't feel like it was tacked on. People worked on this to make it work and it shows.\n\nFinally, the game offers a mode where you engage in the show's main sporting event: Pro Bending. A hectic game, kind of like dodgeball, where you use quick bending jabs to get your opponents off the field. It is difficult to master yet somewhat fun. It's a nice afterthought from Platinum to even include it.\n\nAll in all, you get more than you expect with this Korra game. Platinum surely did not deliver it's more distinguished effort, but when measured against other cartoon based games, you will surely buy into precious metal with this game.","December 7, 2014","true","7.4"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","0"

Copy+Paste from the Xbox version I'm sure.\nNo 1440p (and up) Display support, sorry but you'll just have to play in 1080p or lower.\nLiterally ONE graphics option: Normal or Smooth (with absolutely no indication of what either does.)\n\nLet's move on to the gameplay:\nBy the second part of the "1st chapter", the Pro Bending Match, I was already done with this game as both a fan of the show, and a lifelong gamer:\nThe developers didn't care about the actual rules of Pro Bending as Korra seems to have no issue parrying and returning elements that she is penalized in the show for using.\nWorse still is that the controls are so clunky. Just spam attack button and block when an attack comes at you. Don't bother moving or dodging, you'll just get hit. Awful...\nFrom the start of the match they conveniently make you have to fight 3 opponents alone, and the only way to win at all is by triple knockout. In my "x" attempt I finally managed to get two knocked out and a third pushed into his final zone, but the timer ran out and it was declared as a loss, even though by the actual game rules, I should have won.\nSo, as a fan, they totally disregard the rules of the original game, and as a gamer, it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in both it's performance and it's controls.\n\nI am a HUGE Avatar fan. I REALLY wanted to like this game.\nBut I knew what I was getting into. I got in on a sale because I knew it wasn't going to be that good.\nWhat I did not expect was it to be so bad from just shear laziness. There's no valid excuses for the flaws in this game other than "We wanted to crank out a title as fast as possible to capitalize on the franchise before we cancelled it."\n\nThe developers should be ashamed of this one. Putting something this half-♥♥♥♥♥ in today's game market is just what I'd expect from Platinum Games and CrAptivision.","December 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the show and credit where it's due, this game looks and sounds like the source material.  There aren't many enemy types, the levels are kind of bland and the combat does get a little old.  However, it reminded me pretty quickly of Streets of Rage, what with the motorcycle enemies coming at you, and that counts for something in my book.  It's an all right little beat 'em up.  The difficulty tends to spike at odd times (first mechatank fight especially) and some of the segments aren't that great.  All that said, it satisfied my desire to be a badass avatar and beat up a lot of dudes.  I played with a Xbox 360 controller and you probably should too.

Ability to switch elements and continue combos rather than restart them.\n\nCons: Subpar graphics and variety/amount of content (including enemy types). Enemies, encounters, and equippable items could be balanced better. Sometimes over-reliance on counters. Naga running game and pro-bending are not interesting mechanically.\n\nConclusion: Because it is inevitable to make huge tradeoffs for a $15 game, I am glad to see prioritizing gameplay mechanics over graphics and amount of content. However, I would have liked to see better variety of enemies and encounters. Getting rid of Naga running game and pro-bending would have given more time to spend on encounter/enemy variety.\n\nI would faceiously state it's 1/4 the quality of Bayonetta.

This game is amazing platinum has hit one out of the park again. So I'm going to do this in sections to keep it simple.\nScore at the bottom if that’s all you care about, it’s ok I’m not judging you.\ncombat:\nThis is why many of us bought the game and it's easily the best part by far. Easy to pick up on casual difficulty. but brutal and demanding on normal and extreme. The game's combos are broken up into four styles each of which can be accessed right from the start but they lack the flashy powers to back them up till you unlock them in the story. Still each has their uses even when locked. Each is as simple as the old XXXY or YY you get the idea, bayonetta lite. The complexity comes from how each style has its own unique traits. Water is long ranged; earth is the slowest but powerful, fire is the fastest and auto tracks to rain down blows on weak enemies and air allows for wide area attacks for crowd control. each can be accessed instantly allowing you to adapt to whatever the game throws at you and each also has different effects in the air(earth has a ground pound for example). And then there are the parries and dodges. Players of bayonetta will understand the dodge right away, works exactly the same but without witch time. The parry on the other hand is new and is where things get really fun, by holding the button you block for a moment but time it right and you will perform a unique counter attack against the attacking enemy. This also works on their projectiles sending them straight back at them. All of this combines to make one of the most satisfying combat systems I've ever seen. Bayonetta’s is better but I want that godlike parry too.\n\nStory:\nMay as well tackle this, it sucks. it's not offensive in anyway just boring, the villain is boring, the reason for why it's happening isn't important, the whole game seems to take place in a single day as if this just another day at the office for Korra. You likely won't care either way. If you came for story the only thing you'll find is that getting to play as Korra is awesome and I'm glad they got the voice actress to reprise her role from the show. It’s a power fantasy, you get to be the avatar and not suffer though a terrible game (looking at you the burning earth) so passable.\n\nGraphic\nLooks like the show, cut scenes are low quality but what can you expect from a budget title. In game it looks fine. I'm a big believer in the idea that if you can't make your game look realistic enough, just cell shade it. It’s a copout but a good one. This game will still look decent 10 years down the line that way. The environments are a little bland however. Lots of single color walls. Which leads right into..\n\nLevel design:\nPlatinum basic, mostly linear levels with a few side paths and secrets but not a lot. Kinda dull but that's what I had expected coming into this so I'm not bothered by this.\n\nEnemy variety:\n\nHmmmmm, 1,2,3....6...about 10 enemies types, mostly variations. Not great but as copy and paste as some of them are they each at least serve a different purpose in combat which is nice. (watch out for those red ones).\n\nAnd lastly length/replay value:\n\nnow this one is important, as you can see from my hours ( 7.4 as of writing this review, not a huge amount but longer than a lot of singleplayer campaigns these days.(you know the ones). there are 8 chapters and overall I think it's took me about 6 hours to complete the main campaign, going back at one point to collect stuff once all my powers were unlocked and after that I topped off all my skill levels, bought all the items in the shop and completed the pro-bending mini-game which got really tough towards the end but was great fun. considering what I paid which was full price, I think I got a steal, I got really worried by some of the reviews out there but having played it now I can safely say this is definitely a godhand situation ( look it up) I'm not even done with this game, I played a bit of extreme which already has me fighting late game enemies in the first level so I'm likely to get another 4 hours out of this.\n\nOverall:\nThis is THE best budget title I'm ever played, a title once held by bionic commando rearmed so consider that. There’s is so much attention to detail in the animations and combat however the other parts due suffer a little because of this. But being a gameplay first kind of guy I don't let that bother me much at all. I got what I wanted from this and in some areas it even exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the following: platinum games, actions games, hard games, fun short titles, major Korra fans, and crazy people always looking for the next challenge.\n\nScore: 9/10","November 15, 2014","true","16.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cappiesarcasm/recommended/281690/","Cappiesarcasm","SpeederTGS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cappiesarcasm/","142 products in account","To all of you thinking about buying this game, here's my opinion on it.\n\nIt's a beat'em up game sure, but more like a bullet hell beat'em up. Literally on the third level it gives you a new enemy then you have to fight like 15 in the next area. Fair enough I like a challenge. Then next you get a boss who does way too much damage but after a few tried you can beat em. Then the next area another like him, but with a new element. Then again... Alright boss time is over right? NOPE. Lets take those three bosses you just fought and put them ALL in the SAME ARENA so they can all attack you faster than you can get a decent attack in. Literally the only way I won in these fights was in a knockout glitch. (And since they love reusing fights you see the exact same trio back again the next level with more grunts and a tighter area, SERIOUSLY WHERE'S THE LEARNING CURVE?)\n\nOh the city is destroyed. Got it. That explains why theres vines everywhere and holes from her fight with that dude from the spirit world. Makes sense...Hmm...I guess it wouldn't be annoying if EVERY LEVEL THEY MENTIONED IT. Seriously after hearing Korra talk about something not being there for the 40th time you start to question why you are actually playing this.\n\nAlright alright I know I've been kinda negative so far. But the Pro-bending arena was actually pretty fun. Add a leaderboard to that and some meaningful story to it and sell that as a game Activision. Seriously the Bending arena is better than the whole story mode itself. (Which by the way, you have to beat to unlock the Pro-Bending Arena)\n\nThe game was advertised as "Wirld the power of all 4 elements-Water, Earth, Fire, and Air as only the Avatar can!" Sure for the first level. Then it gets taken away and you're stuck with no bending just a button mash of a normal attack and a power attack for the next level and a half. Then you get your bending back right? NOPE. JUST WATER. And yep you guessed it, It's just normal attack and power attack. So good luck using your water bending to destroy a waaaay to OP Mecha tank from Season 4. Oh and you can only use water in the Pro-Bending arena too. At least that one makes sense though. (If you don't understand, they said the Avatar can do Pro-Bending but she can only bend one element)\n\nThis game has the voice actors it must be pretty good if they're willing to go that far for fan service. Ha..ha...ha...I loved the show and the fact that this takes place between Season 2 and Season 3 makes it feel much better than starting in Season 1 like I thought it would. But in this world, apparently Bolin, Mako, and Asami are never with Korra. They appeared in one of the cutscenes but do they help you? NOPE. Do you go to them or the poliece for help? NOPE. Does Tenzin help? He's on some trip apparently so NOPE. Three strikes, You're out!\n\nSo you can ride Naga, cool right?! Oh it's just a temple run knock off? You can atleast go alternate paths and get different looking scenery right? Oh it's all resused? Well dang then..\n\nThe shop. Her room. Customization. These are three things that should be in a "DENIED IDEAS" Pile for this game. The shop is alright, but the design is all weird. Her room/customization area looks like something you'd find on the NES. Oh and theres two secret codes too! You get a chi blocker costume (2 of four, 1 Is your default, the other two are by beating Normal and Extreme) and a talisman! WOO!\n\n"What's a way we can increase play time in our game?" the creators thought to themselves. "What if we made them replay the missions to get more stuff because they need the game currency SO BADLY to beat our bosses. Oh yeah we make our bosses like a crappy unfair version of Dark Souls. Oh and not to mention more "bullet hell" than a Sans Genocide run." Then the Activision head said "That's a GREAT idea! If we start today when can it be finished?" The creator replied with, "With our two man staff, exactly three days." "Perfect". I know that's exaggerated a little bit but still this made the game tedius to me and no longer worth my time.\n\nVerdict for me: Would not buy it again. I bought it on the Winter Steam Sale 2015 For around 4$. I would have been fine with it if it was 1$, I played the game for an hour trying it out. (Any good game code is 1$ = 1 Hour) This game could not entertain me for 4 hours. I began to get bored around the 45 minute mark, and the only reason I lasted that long was because I was making fun of the game in my head. In the end however, the desicion to buy this is your choice. You've come to read this for a reason, and if you still considering buying this go ahead and do it. If this won't convince you to change your mind nothing will. You'd just better hope that Steam allows you a quick refund.","January 9","false","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I was very excited to see it on sale and I think the graphics are perfect. Unfortunately, the combat is very boring as you're fighting the same things over and over again. I can't speak for people who use controllers but for someone using a mouse, the camera control feels like I'm moving around a polygonal view as opposed to a circle, which can be frustrating in combat as, if you aren't auto-targeting, your commands can occasionally be screwed up. Another probably that I'm assuming is keyboard only is when you have to counter enemies by pressing directions. The game tells you to press either "A," "W," or "D" as if people associate those keys with those letters as opposed to their directional equivalents. Unless you have that memorized, I suggest only looking at where the enemies attack from, not what the game tells you to press, and you should have no problem after that. I find that I have to force myself to continue with the game to beat it when I know I'm going to have a boring and bad time.

This high action beat 'em up game should easily satisify any fan of the show and those who are sceptical on the game should seriously invest some proper research into it before simply panning it.\n\nThe game takes place in many familiar places throughout the Avatar universe, including: Republic City, the Southern Water Tribe (South Pole) and the Spirit World. As a fan, I was thrilled to see that Platinum Games had kept these areas  to a very similar standard as the show and did not misrepresent  in any way. For those wondering, the storyline in the game takes place between Book 2: Spirits and Book 3: Change. So the events of the game take place in the three or four week period after Korra left the Spirit Portals open following her victory over Vaatu and Unalaq during Harmonic Convergence. I will admit, I did find the story a little hard to swallow in terms of its continuity, however, it is still enjoyable and the main antagonist is pretty badass.\n\nSo, what about the gameplay? I must first admit that I have not yet played this game with a controller. I have also not attempted the game on the extreme difficulty. The game's controls for me were simple enough, however if you have a controller, you should probably use that. I say that because sometimes on the keyboard things are a bit cramped so to speak. For example, to counter is to press 'C' and to lock onto an enemy is 'R', I often found myself accidently hitting 'X' and 'E' at times of heated battle. Is that really an issue? No, but still I didn't enjoy accidently swapping elements instead of locking onto those damn chi blockers or mecha tanks. If I have any criticism of the game play it is this: the camera is the hardest villain of all in this game. If you're in a battle with giant Dark Spirits and you need to see what's going on to stay alive, but your camera is focused on a random rock or the back of a monster instead of yourself, then it is easy to get annoyed. I guess I can overlook it though because damn, controlling those elements is fun.\n\nTL;DR/Summary: All in all I enjoyed this game and found myself immersed straight away. If you are a fan of the show then I think you wouldn't be disappointed, however the game is not perfect either (as no game really is). I'd probably give this game a solid 7-8/10 and the only reasons I've dropped marks is because of annoying cameras and sometimes bare scenary.","November 13, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If your a fan of the show for it's story telling, this isn't your game, if you like a challenging spectical fighter where you can beat stuff up then you might find this fun. One last thing, if you buy this on steam, use a controler of some description because the keyboard controls are painfull and frustrating, the game will even recomend you to use a controller so please do.","October 26, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I know thats what new game + technically is , but here you don't really feel the need other than to unlock that 1 final constume you can only get by beating story mode on extreme difficulty .\n\nThe 1st play through however has it's ups and downs . 1st up you can switch between elements at any point in the game , which is pretty neat , and although the combos for each elements are relatively short , by switching elements you can keep it going for about a minute if you're good . BUT ! during your 1st plathrough you lose all your powers . WHAT ! I know right ?! Then you have to go through the entire story just to get them back 1 by 1 . Of course you dont have to if you've already beaten the game once . The combat does look awesome with 4 charge levels of each attack that gets stronger and more epic looking as you charge up each attack .\n\nThe Naga parts are a pain in the ♥♥♥ . You basically get placed on a Temple Run mode . and that's it\n\nBUT the diamond in the rough for this would be the Pro-bending mode . You could have spent 3 hours in the story mode , but probending mode , especially Ace mode will easily double or even triple the amount of time in terms of replayability .  You may have to slug through story mode just to complete it once to unlock pro-bending mode but boy does it feel worth it .\nSure the attacks are limited and there's that longing for more types of attacks that could be done but you barely feel it sometimes .\n\nThe price you see right now is not for the story mode . No it's for the pro-bending mode . Story mode feels like a mini game compared to this . It's like Devil within for Tekken 5 .\n\nWhen you pay , you are paying for pro-bending mode , not story mode .","October 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The previous avatar game was just awful so I was slightly sceptical. It turns out that I wasn't dissapointed this time (very much).\n\nHaving played this through I can say It doesn't look amazing and it doesn't have many of the original characters from the series. I won't spoil it by telling who make an apperance but there aren't that many of them (because unlike in the series you run around alone saving the world). Needless to say I was dissapointed in that aspect. The story isn't very creative either and it is almost all combat.\n\nThe combat is actually quite fun. I can finally bend the elements to my will and in my opinion they are all well balanced and are enjoyable to use. I do sometimes get the feeling that the countering isn't working perfectly but maybe it's just me. The camera is once in a while a pain in the ♥♥♥ when the enemies are so big that they cover the whole screen and you have to fight blind at times.\n\nI wish they would've added some jokes but it is mainly just fighting as the avatar the same enemies several times. I guess they are busy writing jokes for the actual series.\n\nThe pro bending side game is quite fun aswell but it isn't that ling either. I did find it challenging on the hardest level and it felt awesome to kick ♥♥♥ with Korras team mates.\n\nIn short: This game is a good time for those who have always wanted to bend the elements and fight bad guys. I enjoyed it immensly even without a controller and I will play it again. This game is definitely worth the money.","October 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You lost yours superpowers and run around the city kicking butts to gain your power back... I have no idea about the backstory so i'm not the right person to judge it as a whole universe/setting.\n\nCombat is boring. Unfortunately. Spam buttons to win. I played only on normal, didn't enjoy the game this much to try it on next difficulty level which i had to unlock.\nEnemies are punch-spoongy. Not a challenge, just time consuming repetitive spamming the same combo over and over.\nFor every enemy is the same tactic and you apply it in every situation. Not rewarding chore.\nWhen you learn new power game forces you to use it - enemies become resistant to your previous skills so instead of variety of attacks you play whole next stage with different 'weapon'. Maybe at the end of the game enemies will start to appear in varieties and make you have to switch powers during the fight.\n\nYou can't rebind controls.\nCharacter sometimes loses targeting and hardcoded controls forces you to use movement joystick to target enemies istead redirect everything to rotation joystick. Weird and disrupts movement. Another flaw of targeting is that game lets me target only on enemies in front of me and during targeting rotation is disabled and is used to switch between targets. So even if i know that enemy is behind me and tilt joystick to retarget at him i can't do this. I have to disable targeting, rotate at him, and hope that it will lock at him and not again at some other one in cone of vision.\n\nTerrible camera that cannot show you the battle even while fighting in empty city square - camera will try to squeeze itself between you and the nearest wall.\nEspecially with platformer scenes when you run on narrow catwalks and camera runs on predefined path - and because your movement direction is relative to camera position you can fall of the straight path because camera turned around.\n\nAnd you can die while trying to look for secrets as invisible walls will kill you and cause restart and losing progress. Which is weird as the game really liberally uses all sort of visible walls and obstacles to limit your freedom so bumping into forcefield is unexpected.\n\nI couldn't endure whole game, got tired of it after the first half and wasn't curious how will it end. If game becomes better after the first half then it should start after the first half :P. As for now i cannot recommend it and i won't be playing more to check if i was wrong.\n","February 19","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This doesn't become a significant issue until Chapter Four. On casual setting -- the easiest one -- I thought I was managing okay. I followed all the cues and played it correctly. I bought upgrades. Then, near the end of Chapter Four the difficulty spikes and I was given a series of bosses that were amazingly hard in comparison to the rest of the game so far. And everything I learned up to this point seemed irrelevant: Blocking enemies triggered the fasted quick time events I've ever seen. And in the case of one boss, having it come back for another round it surprised me because the previous techniques I learned to defeat the first one were useless on the second one. This just isn't right. If you're going to kick my ♥♥♥, do it on an appropriate difficulty level. On casual, this is frustrating and makes beating the game seem unachievable. And it's not unreasonable to play the game on casual; I believe even the developers think that normal is too hard on the first playthrough. See, for each playthrough you get stronger and acquire more stuff, so subsequent playthroughs should be relatively easier.\n","October 4, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The fighting sequences get boring during the first five minutes as there are countless bad guys who all look the same and it's just button mashing all the time. Then there's a sequence in which you ride Naga - the problem is: this is merely some sort of "Temple Run" with a Korra skin slapped on it.\n\nDidn't even have the patience to play any longer than that, to be honest. Maybe the story is nice (it sure does begin kind of interesting), but gameplay-wise this one's a boring clickfest. If you've REALLY got nothing else to play and this game is on a discount (I got it for 50% off and I guess it's okay for that amount), go for it.\n\nProvided you are a Korra fan, that is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuckles22/recommended/281690/","Kuckles22","[!?] Kuckles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuckles22/","350 products in account","There is a lot of negative thoughts that usually get associated with a movie/show/book licensed game, even worse a game made by Activision. But then this game also holds the name of another, the developer of the game is Platinum studios. the makers of such games like Bayonetta, Vanquished, Metal Gear: Rising Revengeance, Mad World, and The Wonderful 101. While those games are not huge box office successes they are solid good games and now they have been tasked to work on a budget licensed game for The Legend of Korra TV show. So did they hit it out of the park or is this another to be ignored.\n\nThe first thing to note here is this is 100% an authentic Korra experience. Every character who appears in the game from the show is voiced by their respective voice actor. That includes Korra, Mako, Bolin, Tenzin, and Jinora all make appearances in this game. The story of the game is also written by some writers from the show and considered cannon in the shows story. As the game starts it is just after the end of Season 2 and before Season 3, the entire game takes place in about a week story wise. So it fits into that timeline just fine.\n\nWhich leads to the first negative about the game and that is the story. The tale being told is not the most earth shattering of tales, as Korra once again is found stripped of here bending powers by a mysterious old man after winning a Pro-Bending match. Korra then starts her mini quest to regain her powers and find out who the old man is and what he wants. I wont spoil to much about how that turns out, but I am gonna nit-pick the main villain for a bit. Personally I never fully understood what his deal was, he wants to destroy the Avatar, Duh like most villains do, but his beef was with a past Avatar who defeated him over a thousand years ago and you never really figure out why, how or even which Avatar defeated him. It could have used a flash back or more exposition to explain why he was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nNow on to a positive and most of the reason to play this game, The Gameplay. This is where the game shines each of the bending styles feels unique and true to the element. Water bending is your go to for both Ranged and general damage. Earth bending is slow but powerful and it is super satisfying to see chunks of enemy heath bars fall with each rock that hits opponents. Fire bending is fast and furious, good for building up high combos and defeating people quickly. then there is Air bending, which is arguably the best for clearing rooms of enemies, sending out spinning tornadoes to do some serious crowd clearing. All of these styles can be switched to on the fly and even mid-combo to create some truly devastating strings of combos mixing all the elements together. Near the end of the game you unlock the ability to enter the avatar state and punish enemies with devastating super powered moves. Honestly this combat is solid and the reason to pick up this game and play over and over again.\n\nThe next negative has to do with the Level and Enemy design. While the level design is not completely terrible. there are a lot of secret areas and treasures to be found in each. they feel really generic and lifeless, as they serve their purpose as background to the combat, when you are done with that, there is really not much to look at with bland dull textures and repetitive sections. you know when a combat section is about to start because you just entered a wide open area, so be prepared to be blocked by a big purple wall and forced to fight several guys who just teleported in. And you would have sworn you beat these guys already as they are the same 3 or 4 guys you have been fighting all game. the default enemy for the game is Chi blockers aka Amons flunkies from season 1, they come in 3 colors, green default fist fodder, blue ranged ♥♥♥♥ bags, and Red unblock-able attack using ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But along with them are the 3 mini bosses or the triads that use Water, Earth, and Fire bending. then the Big mecha tanks. unfortunately these enemies are repeated over and over through out most of the game, until the dark spirits show up. But the spirits are such a non-enemy its kinda sad they mostly fill the same role as the Chi blockers but instead of just defeating them you can purify them when they get low health.\n\nThis can be a good or bad thing but this game is hard. On normal the first time through I was dying and redoing sections in the 3rd level. The game has a very weird difficulty curve, in that it actually gets slightly easier as the game goes on and you unlock the rest of your bending abilities. The bending styles level up and get more powerful as the game progresses which means that playing it longer and repetitively will make the game easier and a bit more fun to play as you buy more combos from the in game store run by uncle Iroh. He also sells boosters that give you more heath, or even special perks that you can use during levels to get better medals and score.\n\nOther then the main story which has three levels of difficulty casual, normal, and extreme. the game also offers a few mini game side distractions. The first one is the Naga running sections in which Korra rides Naga through the streets of Republic City and has to jump, dodge and collect spirit energy. as mini games go its not the worst thing in the world but it is filled with a lot of one hit fail states, which can ruin even the most experienced runners streak. The next one is the Pro-bending league, this one actually gets its own separate mode as Korra, Mako, and Bolin strive to be the champions. The goal is to dodge the attacks of the other team while hitting them with your own to push them off the edge of the stage. This is a really fun mode which is true to the show and surprisingly fun. this mode also has 3 teirs of difficulty.\n\nOverall I had way more then $15 worth of fun with this game. It is faithful to the show and really feels like you are the avatar. I would hope this could get turned into a more full game with better story and more enemies. For now I am gonna go back and try to unlock more items and beat the games hardest difficulty.\n\nThis game is Kuckles Recommended.\n\n*Bonus* here is the codes to unlock the secret items in the shop and Korra's room:\n\n\nChi-Blocker: up down up triangle square triangle\nSpirit Korra: up up down down square\nShadow fist item: right right left left square\n\n\nOn a 360 pad square is X and triangle is Y.\n\nMy play through of the first 3 levels:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbxUIky7FnQ","October 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Basically, as you charge your powers, you temporarily get bonus effects on them for a period of time afterwards (or you can buy the item for 300k that turns them on permanently which I highly recommend).  Once you've got the item that gives you infinite chi, firebending becomes stupidly powerful at 1v1s and airbending becomes amazing for juggling swarms of enemies.  Waterbending has its uses because it is the longest ranged and best for hitting enemies that are above or below you.  Earthbending is unblockable (but those with bending can counter it).\n\nBeaten it on normal and extreme as well as beaten pro bending on Ace.  Enjoyed the whole lot of it.  On Extreme, the hardest parts (because by this time, you should have maxed bending, health regen, constant chi, be staggerproof, and have shadow fists (if you want to know the code, you can look up guides for the game on Steam; some have it)) are the non-traditional fights.  Things like when you're jumbo-spirit Korra or when you're fighting the Mecha-Tanks from Naga's back.  Everything else is a piece of cake.

I am not sure if it is entirelly worth it for 15$, so if you are thinking about it, I would wait for a sale when it drops to 10 dollars.\n\nGraphics - It is a decent game graphics wise, and has mutliple resolution settings. The problem is, even with my computer having 8 Gigabytes of RAM, and only having TLoK open, the game has had 3 freezes and over 5 slowdowns. That was really frustrating, considering I had to do one of the longest chapters all over again because of it. There are 2 modes for graphics - Smooth and Fast. Fast is a better choice for slower computers, but it looks very pixelated.\n\nSound - The music is either remixed versions of the show, direct versions of the show, or new pieces that fit right in to the Avatar universe. It is good on the ears, but can be a little underwhelming, especially when they use the same 3 tracks  over and over again in the same chapter.\n\nThe enemy varietie is very lackluster. There are less than 10 models (not including colors): ChiBlockers (Green, Blue, Red), EarthBender Thugs, FireBender Thugs, WaterBender Thugs, MechaTanks (Gray, Red), and 3 varieties of Spirits (not including enlarged or final boss). Each enemy is essentially palette swaps, and it was pretty disappointed.\n\nThe game is still extremely fun, if you like mowing down enemies with big attacks. I like to classify the attacks into 2 categories: Crowd Controllers and Single Hits. Air and Earth are great for attacking large groups of weak enemies, and Water and Fire are good for specific enemies. Water and Air have long range, while Earth and Fire have high damage outputs. Each element has it's own levels, skills, purchaseable items, and more. You gradually unlock each element during the course of the game, and it is really fun to fight enemies in this game, because you can counter, dodge, stagger, block, etc. Depending on your difficulty will decide what strategies you need to use.\n\nThe story is lackluster, especially for Avatar quality. Avatar is known for it's quick action and deep story, and sadly, this game only delivers on the former. Essentially, Korra has to fight a new enemy that threatens both worlds due to the recent opening of the Spirit Portals. I wish I could say more.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 7.5/10. It is fun and quaint, while short and a bit on the repetitive side. If you are a diehard Action-RPG or Legend of Korra fan (in which I am both), then you should buy it whenever you want. If you just want to try it out, then wait for a price drop.","November 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They are really simple but that's not necessarily a bad thing. First of all , they bring the player closer to the series, since they are really cartoony. Additionally , they make the game much easier to run. In terms of performance , the game runs fine but it could run even better since it doesn't really seem demanding anyway. The 60 FPS cap lock which seems to be implemented didn't really affect my experience , since the game rarely dropped below that number. To sum up , the graphics of the game are simple and nice, the game runs properly   and I didnt' encounter any game-breaking issues or bugs at all.\n\nStory : Not much to be said here. The story is not interesting at all, It doesn't follow the sries storyline and it's just boring. It's a completely stand-alone chapter which follows its own story , written by Platinum Games. In a nutshell, you are trying to reacquire your bending since it was removed from you from some random guy which then invades the spirit wolrd and  you got to stop him,which is not even original at all .If you are looking for an intriguing or captivating storyline with suspense don't buy this game.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is the field where this game succeeds the most at but at the same time has its biggest flaws. The combat is really arcade and feels good because it really suits the game. The level design is well though but becomes repetitive after a while. Bending is fun and feels satisfying. The boss battles are incredibly difficult and unfair and you will most of the times need to try quite a bit to beat them. The developers apparently were to lazy to come up with new characters everytime , since after you clear the waves of enemies , you have to deal with the same 3 bosses almost everytime so you can get to the next level. The combat will also get extremely repetitive overtime. Moving on, there is a shop where you can buy upgrades and potions for Korra to use in battle which many times came in handy to me. There are some mini-games , like racing with naga in the story line which can be fun and there is also Pro-Bending scenes implemented in the story but also doable after you have completed the game , which are incredibly enjoyable,\n\ntl;dr : This game succeeds in the most of the gameplay aspects , but fails at presenting an interesting storyline. The visuals are fine and the performance good enough. If you are hardcore fan or you simply like the Legend Of Korra , you will most likely enjoy the game ,despite of how repetitive it can become.","July 8, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly.\nFirst: the animations of the characters are in no way near the films (i.e. some characters talk without moving their lips),\nSecond: it's a classic hack and slay gamestyle, while the Controller-input seems to be random (i.e. pressed buttons won't make sure the game reacts at all (while riding on Naga this effect made it impossible to dodge some of the obstacles)).\nAlso - in this Game Korra groans with literally every move. That sounds rather disturbing sometimes.\nThe Camera goes to close-proximity-circling Korra literally as soon as you stand still, which makes it impossible to just look at the world or get a quick orientation.\nAll in all this seems like a really loveless Console-port for a game that was in no way designed to be playable on a computer.\nAs a fan of the Avatar-series, I regret buying this game and hope there will be fixes soon.","September 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can switch between them to tacticly approch the fights .\n\nPeople compare it to games like ArhamKnight but this game is clearly ment to be morel like short arcade . Most movie/show based games are complete garbage and this game is no exception but I still got a kick out of it as Korra fun .\n\nIt reminds me the time when games were more simple and I enjoyed this game for the the short time it lasted .\n\nWhile playing the game you can unlock new moves and even buy items in shop which add some complexity but the effectivness of certain things are questinable .\n\nI think its a nice little tribute to the show but if you are looking for a game full of content that will keep your interest for more than 5 hours this isn't it .","October 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First the camera, moving your mouse turns the camera as it does in most mmos and 3rd person games how ever this camera has fixed angles it moves too its not smooth and you can't be percise. 2nd thing I didn't like no key configuring or key mapping ...anygame past 2005 should have keymapping.

The combat system is the only good part about it, except instead of starting with four elements for which you can learn new abilities, you gain them one at a time so you can't really enjoy the combat. Enemies are all the same, there's like two types of enemies. The pro-bending isn't fun at all. The Naga sequences are literally a Temple Run re-skin. The story just isn't good at all. The level design is bland and linear and its clear that little work was put into the landscapes. The story is completely throwaway, even though its a single player game.\n\nDo not buy this game. It was a quick cash out, just another Nickelodeon game. It's very clear that the game had the potential to be so much more, but Nickelodeon didn't give the studio enough time or resources, so they worked with what they had. Could've been a great game, especially from the studio that made Bayonetta.

It's pretty terrible, and most non-Steam review sites agree.\n\nIt looks good, and I enjoy watching the animated sequences. Her attack moves are pretty cool, too. Aaannd that's about it for positive notes. The battles are either repetive or stupidly difficult, you can access the item shop if you die BUT you can't actually equip the items to use them without restarting from your last save rather than retry your current fight/scene (so why is the item shop even an option after dying??), and it just got so annoying I've already decided to quit playing and let the game sit idle in my library.\n\nETA: the game also tells you to skip cutscenes or exit out of certain things you have to hit the spacebar, but it's actually the ESC key. I know it's optimalized for a controller rather than a keyboard, but JFC game get your own controls straight.\n\nIf you're jonesin' for more Korra after the series ends, I guess this isn't the worst option but it'll probably just kill your mood for it.

You will find yourself doing the same sorts of attacks over and over.  Until, that is, you realize how overpowered the countering system is.  This game becomes tremendously too easy once you learn the incredibly simply countering system which utterly destroys your enemies.  The game is not challenging, offers no story, no character substance, and looks incomplete (standing animations used in the air..?).  This is a huge let down and I was so excited for this game I had it booked on my calendar.  What a let down.  If you at all find the action in this game fun, it is a far better idea to go play Metal Gear Rising: Revengence.  You will get a significantly overall better experience with that game.","May 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Do you like Mako, Bolin, Azami, Chief Beifong, Tenzin and his family? Well they're not in this game. Jinora appears a few times in spirit form, mostly to offer tutorial style advice and objectives. Mako and Bolin make a cameo in the opening but are then conspiciously mission for the entire game.\n\nThe story makes no sense, and is basically a poorly strung-together excuse to have Korra run around video game stages based off of iconic locations on the show and beat up bad guys.\n\nThe actual fighting and bending is fun for a while, but the lack of variety in enemies is awful. There is altogether maybe eight different enemies total in the game, and you end up fighting them over and over. When you're beating up on the same group of Equalitists or Triad gang members from the Republic City all the way to the North Pole, it can get pretty tiresome.\n\nDie-hard Korra fans might enjoy this game, but even then only when it's on deep discount.","February 2, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unfrared/recommended/281690/","Unfrared","Cryomagma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unfrared/","141 products in account","The Legend of Korra is an extremely repetitive, simplistic game that offers almost no variety. There are very few enemy types, and they usually only differ visually in color. Frequently when a group of enemies appear, a long, intrusive cutscene is shown to introduce them. It's a jarring distraction from the repetitive combat that has few moves and animations. Even starting the game takes a long time due to the title screens and notices.\n\nWith a mouse and keyboard, controlling the characters is a frustrating, awful experience. Rapid key presses in the Naga segments are often unresponsive. Korra's continuous running and a slow camera makes fine movements impossible. Being accurate in combat comes down to locking onto enemies and hoping Korra's bending hits the desired target. There are no settings that can noticeably improve the controls. For a PC port, the overall number of options that can be changed is a joke.\n\nThe amount of customization in the game is very limited, from the game settings to Iroh's shop that can be accessed in between chapters. The chapters themselves are boringly linear and are tied together with a really simple plot, explained with a slight sprinkle of cinematic cutscenes. Although the cartoon has beautiful animation, none of it is found in the video game. What the game offers in terms of story and engagement is only an empty shell of the TV show.","May 30, 2015","false","8.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Mainly, the issue is this game REQUIRES a console controller, do NOT buy this for PC without one.  If you could remap the controls it might be playable, but that's not an option for some bizarre reason.  Even on easy this game is impossible at a point due to the control issues, and seeming failures of controls for some reason.  For example, you can block attacks against peons, but not bosses, for no apparent reason.  Several moves that seem like they should be impressive, are just asking for a beating, like jump attacks (they always fail and you always get knocked down trying to use them).  So, once you get to the point of fighting 3 bosses at once, which is rather early in the game, you're pretty much done.  Additionally, the game constantly stops combat or action at a critical point with a message about how to do something, which invaribly means you immediately screw up what's next because of having to hit enter and get your hands back to the main controls.  Again, NOT for PC unless you have a controller I guess, wish it had said this like some games do.","June 21, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

At first i was a bit shaky about buying a game based on a TV show due to past experiences... but this time around i was wrong, really wrong. It's really obvious that Platinum Games had more serious gamers in mind while developing the in-game fighting mechanics while at the same time, keeping it appealing to all the fans of the TV show. The story fits in well with the show's if you have been watching it, and if you havent, then you're probably gonna WANT to start watching it after playing through all the epic moments in this game.\n\nOn the other hand, the only thing i personally wish they had added is multi controller, LAN, and online multiplayer support. It would have made this game alot more enjoyable in the long run and would fit so well with the pro bending mode and even with the fighting mechanics from the main storyline in a mini arena of some sort.

Unfortunately, the rest of the game is pretty shallow. I still recommend this game to fans of platinum games or action fighting games in general because it is more good than bad but I wouldn't recomend it to people who are expecting a well written story or a beautiful game world, they are mearly just servicable. Which is a shame because the source material is incredibly rich, so as a fan it comes off as lost potential. The game is super fun when you get all 4 bending powers and you use them simultaneously, however, you unlock each bending style over time which kind of sucks. That being said, this is probably one of the best liscenced games ever made... but that really isn't saying much since liscenced games usually are abysmally terrible.\n\nJust for the record, I am a huge fan of LOK, a HUGE fan, but this little side story, doesn't really add anything interesting to the canon, which could be either a good or a bad thing depending on the perspective.\n\nFinal thoughts: It's a budget game and it feels like a budget game, a competent one. It is fun to play for it's short duration. Also, this is a fairly terrible PC port, I mean it ran at a solid framerate but there is practically no graphics options and there is no rebindable keys/key control menu.

The final boss fight took me about 20 tries, which I think was the sweet spot between frustration and a challenge.\n\nSometimes the game can get frustrating because the combat is a little unforgiving if you do not block/counterattack your opponents.

The large monsters tend to block your camera, especially near the end.\nThe pro-bending mini-game is nice for the few, short times you do it,\n\nStory\nThe story is cliche and not interesting. It feels like it was made so that it is definitely not canon. I really would have likely an actual story written like the TV episodes are, but it kind of matches the quality of the combat system. The cut-scenes are well-done, though everything feels rushed.\n\nAudio\nIt has the voice actors that I love, but there isn't enough dialog to make it a must-play for a fan of the show. It has good music, though I don't know if everything is from the show.\n\nConclusion\nI would only buy this game if I was a fan of the show. Muscle through the combat for the animations and voice overs, but once you are done that you will likely not touch the game again. Hopefully this is more of a proof-of-concept game so that a better one will be created in the future.","October 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Overall the gameplay is good, nothing special from a spectacle fighter, but overall good. The animations for the bending are fantastic, and the physics of the bending are beautiful. The game is 3 hours, but does offer collectables, a New Game+, and higher difficulties. The story itself isn't anything write home about, but then again Platinum Games isn't known for its story telling, but its fast paced action gameplay. The game is a bit flawed, targeting feels a bit off, and the voice acting isn't as good as the show. For 15 bucks, I can't really reccommend this game as there isn't enough content to merit such a price, but if it goes on sale, it's a good game to pick up, especially if you're a spectacle fighter and/or Legend of Korra fan.\n\nTLDR\n+Good bending animation\n+Makes you feel like the Avatar\n+Combat is fun\n\n-Voice Acting could be a bit better\n-Flawed targeting\n\n7.5/10","June 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeptinune/recommended/281690/","Zeptinune","Mugen ムゲン","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeptinune/","59 products in account","One of the hardest games I've played... seriously\nGod this game... seriously. It's finishable for the first time in about 6 hours. The whole premise is pretty cool. However the story and gameplay is incredibly linear and all chapters have only one path to the goal. There's really nothing to 'explore' here and it's impossible to get lost when the path is pretty much always in front of you.\n\nI really had a lot of disappointments with this game. Firstly, unlike in the first Avatar game (on original Xbox) with Aang, where you get to talk to people and do quests, this game is entirely absent of ANY people, what-so-ever - except Korra. There's no Mako, Bolin, Asami or any one else for that matter - it's just you, Korra killing equalists and the Triad. In fact, funnily enough Jenora is the only person who actually speaks to the avatar, apart from the game's antagonist. There are a few cutscenes between each chapter start and end, but overall the game's plot is even less than 'half-baked' and doesn't work at all in contrast to the main story and lore.\n\nBending the elements in new and awesome ways is cool and the graphics received a huge update obviously since the original Xbox Avatar Aang game. However the graphics still cannot be augmented in any way (with a good GPU and MSAA etc) and the game doesn't support resolutions over 1920x1080, at least I couldn't get it to play at 1440p or 4k.\n\nThe most important thing to note however is the game's difficulty. This game is hard, in fact it's one of the hardest I've ever played. Now I'm no noob, I've finished Ninja Gaiden on hardest with barely any items and money, and I beat the last 2 bosses in a row with no items and only 20% health, so I couldn't take a single hit for either fight. But this game... it really is something else.\n\nThis game is Ninja Gaiden on f_king steroids man. I selected Normal mode to start off with in order to unlock the achievements and because I figured that casual would be for kids who liked the show and that it would be too easy. But the game's difficulty scaling is absolutely insane. You start off and it's easy enough without too much trouble, but come Chapter 3, if you haven't bought the slow health regen item then you are completely screwed. You either have to sacrifice a slot for a passive upgrade (like extra damage or exp) for only 3 healing items (max). Or you permanently sacrifice one for the passive health regen and spend many fights just dodging around and jumping whilst you wait for your health to come back. The latter is a far better option but in fights where the 'arenas' are freaking tiny, and your enemies are HUGE or numberless, it can get pretty BS, pretty fast.\n\nI want to say it again, this game is hard. Like really hard. Sure it can be beaten in about 6 hours but it'll really frustrate you if you aren't used to playing games like this. It's been years since I even touched on a game that's even half as hard as "The Legend of Korra". Just when you think that the fight you just beat was unfair, they send in 3 more of the boss you just killed, PLUS 10 minions all who stop you from being able to charge you chi.\n\nSo in the end the disappointments are pretty big.\n\nThe game pretty much forces you to take certain upgrades to even have a CHANCE at winning.\nThere's only a single and really 'obvious' path to every 'goal' in each chapter and with the absense of characters like EVERYONE except for Korra.\nI found that the game is really hollow and that one really can't get much enjoyment out of it.\nIn addition to all this, the game is also probably 3 times shorter than the Avatar Aang, Xbox game and less enjoyable because there's no quests to do or anything.\nDon't buy this game if you cannot handle computer enemies doing ridiculous combos through your attacks, piling on top of you and killing you within mere moments. Don't buy this game if you expected to see any of the full Korra cast of characters. And finally don't buy this game if you haven't played and finished Ninja Gaiden or another similarly hard game after hundreds of attempts.\n\nFor $3 on sale, and using money I made from skins and cases from CS:GO. This was a worthy buy for a few hours of enjoyment. I wouldn't reccomend it though because I think that real Avatar fans will find the experience quite disappointing and shallow.","February 22","false","6.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is short, but it is to be expected of a 15 dollar game. The story I thought was really good but maybe could have had a little more depth added to it. I kind of wish that you could have played through the story with team Avatar. I think this would have been so much better to have Mako, Bolin, and even Asami fighting along side of Korra.\n\nThe bending looks great and switching between the different elements is easy and quick. After completing the story, you can select continue and play through the same story but you get to keep all of your elements levels and unlocks, so even though the game begins with you  not having any bending, you get to have all of the bending unlocked on you second play through. I don't know why everybody really says this game is bad, I mean sure you fight enough mecha tanks, but they aren't that bad and I feel like they add just enough challenge for the game that I can't just fly through it in 5 minutes. The parts with Naga are a little boring, but they aren't very long and I have played worse in other games.\n\nThe pro-bending arena is a good addition and is pretty fun. It really only offers so much though. You fight against the same teams in the same order on each difficulty and they all fight pertty similar to each other. All in all, it is a nice addition and fun to play if you just want a quick play and only be able to water bend, but it is pretty basic.\n\nIf you are a fan of the legend of korra, and go into buying this game know that it is a 15 dollar game and isn't going to offer the content that a 60 dollar game does, then you will love this game. If you are expecting some high quality produced game, then save your money or pick this up on a sale.\n\nI rate this a 9/10 simply for the lack of depth of the story telling.","December 19, 2014","true","8.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I played it through, liked parts of it and hated parts of it. Would I recommend it? Yes and no, but mostly no.\n\nCONS:\n-The most awful thing in this game are the subway-surf type levels with Naga. I don't know why this needed to be in the game, but it infuriates me and stops me from playing this game through again.\n\n-The enemy variety is pretty small, with 3 equalists, 3 benders, 2 robots and  a few spirits. That's barely ok for 8 chapters, but it's annoying that the 3 benders get recoloured and reused throughout the game (the bunny-spirits even make the bender's sounds).\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- The bending is diverse, you can pull off some pretty good combos and switching between bending styles works very well. Buying new scrolls in the shop feels rewarding.\n- The original voice actors are used (although it's only three with two cameos)\n- The items make a second playthrough very interesting.\n- Probending is a cute little minigame, although I don't know why it's used in the first level and then needs a playthrough to unlock the probending league.\n\nLike I said in the opening sentence: There were parts I liked, and maybe I would recommend it to a fan to support the show with all the crap that Nickelodeon is pulling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromeicon/recommended/281690/","chromeicon","ChromeIcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromeicon/","189 products in account","This game a pretty fun beat em up. You start out with no bending and as you progress you gradually get your bending back and some pretty cool combos to go with it. The story however is really light so the only person you ever see during the game is Jinora and mako and bolin in the very beginning and at the end when you're playing probending. Before i talk about that mode the majority of this game tests your reflexes a bit(This is my first beat em up game so i'm sure there are others out there that are better) by dodging, countering at the right time, and knowing when to charge your attacks to deal more damage and all that. The game does a great job of making me feel like the avatar overall but there were some parts that didn't.\n\nThe naga running sections seem like a fun little break in between the action and a chance to get some extra spirit energy to buy stuff later, but for me it was annoying running into a wall in the way and start from the last checkpoint. I did get a little better at avoiding that but there's a certain section of this game where you have to fight 3 giant robots while you're on naga and it's my least favorite part of the game. The probending mode you unlock after beating the game is pretty cool and i wish they would make a multiplayer game based on it. You're limited to waterbending and you make use of all the other stuff to knock the other team out.\n\nI would recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or if you just want to enjoy a simple beat em up. 8/10","December 15, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

If you are a mega fan, than you should pick this up,  but as a casual fan, it's just a bad game. Wait who made this game? Platinum Games? Okay, well this game is absolute crap for a Platinum Games game. There are some people who defend this game with the excuses that it is a licensed game and it is also a game on a tight budget. 1. License games don't mean anything. There are many hits and misses on licensed games, more recently with licensed video games such as Alien Isolation, Shadow of Mordor, etc. 2. Just because it's on a budget, doesn't mean they couldn't put a little more effort in their game. The laziness shows and I will explain to you the flaws of this game:\nStupid levels/tasks - I know this is supposed to be a kids game kind of, but there are some really dumb things in each level. There's basic parkouring where you jump from one platform to another. It's not hard. At all. And it's [2014]. I believe a few times you have to play a dumb "Naga run" minigame where it's essentially a Temple Run rip off. Enemies are copy and pasted, and bosses are too, although they might do at least one thing different. It makes me cringe everytime I see the same boss, and believe it or not it is sometimes hard. Which leads me to my next complaint.\nDifficulty spikes - I've played the first mecha tank boss level at least thirty times, and not to mention the other mecha tank levels. The bosses are extremely hard, but the henchmen you fight are easy and fun. The boss levels just get you frustrated and you have to start all the way over from the beginning and you will probably have to watch a really stupid cutscene prior to fighting the boss. So from fighting an enemy over and over to simple parkour, it doesn't match up. How are children who play this game able to beat those bosses if I (and I'm sure many other) can't?\nStory (gameplay-wise)- The story doesn't have to be good. I just wanna play as an avatar who can bend the four elements and fight weak benders. But instead you start off with (an intro where you can use your bending) no bending at all. Yeah. You have to use your fists and feet to fight enemies, and slowly work your way up to each element (starting with water>earth>fire>air). The cutscenes were supposed to look like the TV show but Korra looked very different and you can easily tell the flaws. No other characters other than Korra, Naga, Jinora, and the exception of Iroh in the store page. The story and characters were just there and honestly I don't think anyone cares. They just had to make a story line that wouldn't effect the show and a storyline to fit the cannon.\nGameplay - The element moves were alright, however it felt like some elements were way better than others. Earth was completely useless due to it's slowness and inablity to use while jumping. Fire was weak and it was only good to use against basic enemies so that you can land "cool" combos. The elements cannot be used all at once, which is major. You have to cycle through the elements, defeating the purpose of being the avatar. Essentially, you are a water bender for five seconds and then a air bender in the next six seconds.\n\nI don't entirely hate this game. It's a 'meh' beat em up, with four different elements. I kind of like the pro bending mode, which is a arena mode, but you have to finish the game in order to play it. The graphics are just OK and the game runs well. The price tag isn't to awful either, with $15 base price. However The story and characters are just bland. The gameplay is repetitive and cringeworthy; you can tell that the developers don't care. It is a shame to The Legend of Korra and a step down in licensed video games. This could've been a Platinum game, however it barely lives up to a bronze.","February 23, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It's obviously simply a port from console, which I wouldn't normally have a problem with, except that it was a really  bad one.\nThere's no keymap, so if you don't have a controller, it's effectively trial-and-error to figure out how to play. Luckily, I had a controller! Unluckily, it wasn't an Xbox 360 controller. No other controllers work properly. My PS3 controller wouldn't work at all.\nThere are no graphics options, so playing with high or low graphics isn't an option, and 'can I play?' is simply 'yes' or 'no'.\nGameplay would be passable on console, but then in comes another problem. You can't get past the first major boss (after unlocking Waterbending) without items. If you fail the fight the first time, hey, don't worry, you can visit the shop!

If you haven't watched it, you'll lose interest in the first level.\n\nLet me start by saying I love Korra. So far, my fanboy-ish-ness is the only thing that sucks me into this game. I don't love it, because it's tedious and kind of boring. But... I also don't hate it. I just can't tell who their target audience is... it seems way too hard for small children, but too boring for adults.\n\nThe art and visuals of this game are fantastic, definitely in the spirit of the show. You feel like you're actually in the cartoon and it's beautiful.\n\nThe gameplay, so far, is about as interesting as a bag of sand. I just beat level four and I was bored enough that I had to take a break. The other part of me is incredibly frustrated as the game is very inconsistent. It's either too easy or unfairly difficult.\n\nAlmost right at the start you're plunged into a pro-bending match and your teammates get knocked straight out into the water (why?). You then get to spend a half hour constantly mashing the shoot water and dodge buttons until, almost by chance, you win.  You can't skip it. You have to win in order to play the rest of the game. I found this part incredibly frustrating and it killed my excitement.\n\nThe first levels consist of running through the city from battle to battle, in which you are magically enclosed by invisible walls so you can't run away. Sometimes the enemies are incredibly weak and die after two smacks. Other times the exact same enemies are very strong for no apparent reason. Sometimes you feel like a totally badass Avatar. Other times you feel like a flimsy little rag doll. Either way it's quite repetitive and I'm not sure if I have it in me to finish.\n\nKorra's bending is gorgeous. It flows beautifully and is very well done. You don't have many options at the start but you can buy new moves with spirit juice that you collect for destroying stuff and killing enemies. Well, not killing. We all know there's never any killing in Avatar... the enemies just get punched far away and disappear.\n\nAs for the game, it's linear, to be sure. There are some collectibles you can find, but even in game they tell you that they're worthless, unless you care about your high score. Like, it literally says "these items can't be used and don't benefit you in battle at all, but give you a higher score at the end".\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend it, but I don't hate it because I love the IP. Which is really the problem with TV/movie games. They always rely far too heavily on the IP fanbase and never really put much thought into building a quality gaming experience. I thought Korra would be different, given that it was made by Platinum Games, but it doesn't live up to their reputation. And something tells me it's not their fault. I think if they had a higher budget and more time, without any bigshot producers breathing down their necks saying "make us more moneeeeyy", this review would read quite differently.\n\nI SORT OF enjoy it, but even if my friend was an Avatar fanatic, I wouldn't be able to say to them "Hey, you should play the game! It's great!". It would probably be more like "Well then you should get this game when it's heavily discounted, cause it'll entertain you for a solid hour or two.\n\nI think I'll probably turn the difficulty down to easy so I can get through the rest without throwing my controller at the screen.\n\n","October 21, 2014","false","1.5"," 169 of 365 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","169","365","0","0"

The only way to sum this game up in one word is "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t." I've always adored Platinum Games' combat system, and this one works well too. A good combat system only works well if the enemies are made to match it and this game isn't fortunate enough to combine the two. Almost every combo I try to pull off is interuptted by attacks that immobilize or stun you by an enemy on the other side of the medium-sized cage that you're stuck in. A few enemies that do this are fine, but the problem is that almost every regular enemy is replaced by these types in large numbers.\n\nI may as well point out that your bending abilities are taken away for a near 40% of the game, making it increasingly frustrating. There are three enemies which I will consider "mini bosses" because they appear in all of the chapters I've played since I got the Water-bending ability. They have Fire, Water, and Earth-bending abilities and they don't follow a consistent pattern so you'll most likely just end up getting beaten down within the first moment of fighting them. It also helps to note that there is a block/counter move which I found OP as ♥♥♥♥ in the beginning of the game.\n\nThis move is nearly rendered useless against later enemy types and is problematic when using it against the "mini-bosses." There are sometimes additional inputs to do a certain move while countering, and to me it always seems like it's at random. I counter and hold the analog stick/key toward the enemy to continue attacking after I counter only to have the game immediately negate my counter in the enemy's favor.\n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this game than just the combat, but playing other PG games such as Metal Gear Rising or Bayonetta which had phenominal combat, this game falls incredibly short. I will edit this review once I complete it and can articulate my thoughts.","November 15, 2014","false","3.0"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"

And, honestly, for the first two levels or so it is. It offers the great gameplay you'd come to expect out of a game made by Platinum. I was having a lot of fun kicking ♥♥♥ even without the bending abilities. I could even tolerate the stupid little Temple Run-esqe mini-game with Naga.\n\nThen I got to the third level.\n\nThat's where the game sadly forgot all the elements that make a Platinum game fun and memorable and devolves into merely a husk of what could be.\n\nEven though I wasn't expecting a storyline on par with the show or with any of Platinum's other works, I was actually pretty surprised how bad the cobbled together story managed to be. The transitions between stages is jarring, and although the voice acting is passable, the story is so generic and badly presented even the animated cutscenes can't save it. The music and graphical style is authentic to the series, but are still extremely forgettable without the actual world of Korra really shining through.\n\nOn the gameplay side of the downsides, I was fine with them taking Korra's powers away until I realized that the game couldn't back that decision up. Naturally, the traditional beat-an-epic-boss-get-a-new-toy (or bending form. in this case) style of gameplay returns, but the bosses are not epic. You literally fight the same boss TWICE within the same stage, and other bosses make repeat appearances as well. This is unacceptable. I don't feel rewarded for fighting Generic McRobot and Generic McThug over and over again -- I feel rewarded for going up against someone like Monsoon from Metal Gear Rising and FINALLY knowing how to block well enough to beat him. I'm fine with the usual repetition of enemy types that can be found in Platinum games, but this breaks any ability for me to have any prolonged enjoyment with the game.\n\nI did have fun with the game initially and do believe that a game based in the Avatar or Korra Universe of this type could be really great, but sadly I just can't recommend this game knowing how much it falls short of my expections for a Platinum game (or even an action game, for that matter) and just by how cobbled together it feels. That being said, the professional scores for this game seem harsher than necessary -- I'd go somewhere around the 5 to 6 out of 10 range -- and I really don't believe this game was the result of blunder on Platinum's part. The core mechanics and promise are obviously there, it just that the small scope and scale of this game doesn't allow proper justice to be done.\n\nAs for games I would recommend over this, I'd go with Metal Gear Rising (also made by Platinum) as well as Killer is Dead. Both really excel in all the areas that TLOK falls short in -- if you can stand having your mind ♥♥♥♥ed on occasion (Killer is Dead IS a Suda 51 game after all).\n","October 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 21 of 53 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","21","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/recommended/281690/","fleathedjinn","Baby-Legs O'Houlihan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/","383 products in account","And so we are granted another disappointing, and secretly expected, piece of evidence that shows that the Avatar universe is not held up by the merit of fancy fighting alone - it needs story, characters, and heart, three elements that are sadly lacking from monkey's-paw-wish-created Platinum character action game.\n\nThe Legend of Korra, the game, would probably not draw in too many buyers who weren't already a fan of the show, unless said buyer was a huge fan of Platinum but hadn't really tried out the Avatar series. With that understood, this game was only going to survive based on the show it's inspired by and the diligent and talented work of those fine folks at Platinum. Unfortunately, this game falls short from both barrels, but does that mean it's a game that must be rejected on that alone?\n\nStory\nTo those not in the know, Avatar: The Legend of Korra is a cartoon on Nickelodeon centering around the exploits of the mighty and reverred avatar, Korra. Korra is gifted with the power to "bend" (see: control) the elements of air, water, earth, and fire - while others are only so lucky if they can control only one. She harnasses the elements through fighting techniques based on actual martial art styles. The blend of "magic" and martial arts create a truly awe-inspiring experience that has brought in many of the show's fans. What keeps them there is the fantastic writing, animation, characters, complex stories, and captivating environment and culture the show has cultivated.\n\nThe game, however, fails to deliver on much of what makes the show so great, the writing (to put it so generally). The story is very barebones (a term you could use to describe this entire game, really), and what bones are there are very few since the game can be completed in under three hours. This could almost be excused if the story was well written and succint, free of filler and shipping bait. However, the player is given a token cackling bad guy, with unclear motives and a legion of minions that are simply based on those that have already appeared in the show and are reused over and over again with different color pallete swaps for different techniques they may use. Those who have watched just season one of the show will be able to immediately tell that the minions Baron von Nogood employs have no business even being around.\n\nKorra's motivations to pursue the ne'er-do-well are understandable, but played out. Nothing original exists within the story of this game. No visuals, no characters (save for the bad guy), no settings - nothing. As such, this plays out like a piece of fanfiction (minus all the non-canon hook ups and kinky sex, unfortunately).\n\nGameplay\nSo how does the game play? Well, at the very least, it feels good to bend (the elements). Switching between elements is easy and quick, and doing so allows you to carry on combos for longer than if you were just to stick to one style only. Sadly, almost all baddies are beaten by a simple combo, and those that take more tend to require you to dodge before you can really continue the combo beyond the third or forth hit, so extending combos isn't a vital issue.\n\nEach element is different in how it delivers, though only margainly so. Water is good for taking out enemies from afar, air is ideal for taking out groups with its wide hit radius, earth is slow but very strong, and fire is fast and...well I guess just fast. See the problem is the differences are almost moot, since there are not enough different kinds of battles to find a niche for each style. You can level up each style through repeated use, which unlocks more health, more comboes, and more Chi (the energy you can charge to help you be faster and stronger). Other comboes are bought with "spirit energy" harvested from defeated foes and random pottery and cabbage stands.\n\nAn important part of combat is dodging and blocking. Dodging will completely negate any damage taken, assuming you actually dodged the hit. Blocking can be more risky, as the best way to block is to do so just before you get hit, so you can counter the attack for massive damage. If any of this sounds familiar, that's because you've played any other Platinum character-action game, which is where some of the problems start to surface.\n\nPlatinum makes amazing character-action games like Wonderful 101 and Bayonetta, but they've fallen into the developer trap where they establish themselves as being amazing at a genre, but then never stray from it and never do much to rewrite their formula. This can be fine, to a degree, but in this case the game feels like you're playing Bayonetta, but less exciting, large scale, and fast-paced (and sexualized). In the end, you're playing a much worse version of Bayonetta.\n\n[h]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThe Legend of Korra show is a breathtakingly beautiful show, with rich backgrounds and extremely well animated characters. In the game, settings are ripped straight from the show and toned way way down to fit into its small scale and less than ideal graphical quality. Most of the time Korra will be moving too fast for you to see this, but if you happen to spy her when she's still, her character model looks like something from the PS1 era.\n\nMusic is servicable, and the voice acting is bland and unmotivated by anything other than a paycheck.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, any fan of Platinum, Korra, or both can easily skip this game and feel no guilt for having done so. With a base price of $15, this was never meant to be a full budget game like Bayonetta, but looking at other games that go for the same, if not less, money, The Legend of Korra just feels lazy, rushed, or possibly both.\n\nStill, this is not a bad game, just a very average one, which is why it's so disappointing. Platinum is not an average developer that makes average games, and the Avatar universe is not average and does not produce average stories. So for this game to play things so by the book is well beneath the credit of both Platinum and Avatar.\n\nWhen this game goes on sale, I would say it would be acceptable at $5 +/- some dollars based on whether you love/hate Platinum and/or Korra.","October 25, 2014","false","4.1"," 36 of 86 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","36","86","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/recommended/281690/","twist3dlogic","TwistedLogic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/","325 products in account","Legend of Korra reminds me of the Playstation 2 era of gaming. Closed, linear levels, repetitive enemy encounters, random 'mount' levels where you have to dodge objects before your character mindlessly ploughs into them and really limited options in just about everything.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad. I can't dislike it, but that may be because of the universe it is set in. Element bending is awesome and while the game doesn't quite hit the level I would have liked with the combat, I think it does a good enough job to pass on the lore side of things at least, as the game is faithful to the Avatar universe if nothing else.\n\nUnfortunately, that seems to be pretty much all it is. Despite the developers assurances that the game is 'difficult', I found that it tended to be more obnoxious than challenging and more button-mash happy than thought-provoking for solving particular episodes.\n\nEnemies soon start to hit like runaway trucks regardless of what they are, smaller human enemies packing about the same punch as getting run over by an armored robot-thing sometimes and the abitrary healing items soon become a boring neccessity to get past some sections of the game where the sheer amount of enemies, abilities and dodgy combat you face are not so much difficult as an exercise in frustration. The final boss is a good example of this. Beat him to a pulp for a bit and he changes tactics, fair enough, beat him a bit more and he combines both previously failed tactics.. again fair enough, but a little unimaginative. It's hard to pin down exactly what makes the combat so obnoxious-feeling rather than challenging. It may be the repetitive 'boss' battles with the same three giant robots, the endless hordes of the same five or so basic foot soldiers and the same three 'Triad' bosses. Combat gets old fast and combat is pretty much the only thing the game almost does well. Exploration is not bad, some areas need certain bending to access, but these are incredibly short and are basically just a case of "use key on door" in what feels like an effort to pad the areas out a bit.\n\nThe Pro-bending tournament, which I imagine most people playing would be interested in, needs to be unlocked by completing the story mode... why is a mystery, maybe so people actually get to the end of the story mode. Unfortunately, not much work has been put into this either. You face the same 5 pallet-swapped teams who do the same things, have no distinguishing features or abilities and no personalities. After playing through story mode to get here, I was disappointed.\n\nOverall, I can't give this a recommendation, despite not disliking the game, because though I had some fun with Legend of Korra, I had to focus on my goal of unlocking the pro-bending mode, which turned out to be much less than expected or deserved after going through the story mode.","October 24, 2014","false","4.6"," 14 of 39 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","14","39","0","0"

I'm surprised how bad it is. The controls are bad (doesn't auto-focus, you need to controll the camera all the time), the animations are a little stiff, the enviroment is very empty. It feels pretty carelessly made most of the time. I played many games in my life (around 250 maybe?) and this counts to one of the worst, sadly. Compared to other Beat 'em up games like for example Dynasty Warriors or Bayonetta it's really on a low level.\n\nBut I guess if you love Korra (and for example didn't recognize the animation quality loss in season 2) you might enjoy this for especially it bonus animation cutscenes and story.\n\nAnother pro is how you change the elements and that you really can fight in every single one of them + normal martial arts.\n\nBut other than that... I have really no idea why this game has such a good rating on steam.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBuy it when you are a big Korra Fan and don't know much about Beat 'em Ups\n\nDon't buy it if you're used to great games like Dynasy Warriors / Bayonetta / Devil May Cry.","November 19, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

The 3D models feel rushed and incomplete. The story is very slow to pick up (if it picks up at all, I still have yet to see to get any kind of good) and most of the time has very little tie in with what you're actually doing in the game. It feels like the developers watched 3-4 episodes of Books 1 and 2 and called it a day for researching the world. I left the game on pause for a bit, and it switched my control scheme from controller to keyboard + mouse. The engine rendered cutscenes are incredibly slow, far slower than necessary, are completely UNSKIPPABLE (seriously, guys? have you never made a game where people don't clear something on the first try before?) and usually add little or nothing to the experience since it's always just another generic enemy you've slaughtered a bajillion times beforehand. Not to mention that this hang will sometimes result in the enemy attacking you and you being unable to move (it's happened to me at least twice). In fact, the entire pacing of the game is all over the place, zipping over important moments and stalling out mind numbingly dull points. But I could write an entire review ripping into that, so I'll move on.\n\nDespite all these incredibly frustrating issues, I could still play the game if not for this final nail in the coffin. The entire game design is BAD. It feels like there was no playtesting whatsoever for this game before it was shoved out the door. I'm going to break it down piece by piece, and you be the judge of whether it sounds good or not. Okay? Okay.\n\n1) Teaching Through Pop-Ups: Does anyone actually ever want this? As a student of Game Development at WPI, my professors have harped time and again that teaching through design is much better than teaching by explicit direction. This game takes the latter approach rather than the former, and I can see that my professors are absolutely right. The gameplay pauses completely to deliver some tactic or technique (sometimes one that is already inherently obvious just through gameplay). You then have to manually close the menu, at which point, the game immediately resumes, giving you next to no time to prepare yourself. Does that sound "fun" to you? Having your game forcibly paused to be spoon fed some piece of information you probably already were aware of or would have figured out by yourself anyway? It wastes your time, it breaks your suspension of disbelief, and it completely kills the flow of action you were just in. Terrible.\n\n2) Breakable Barriers and Vanity Chests Should Feel Breakable: I have encountered a few vanity chests and bending walls now and I have to say that both take way too many hits to destroy for it to feel natural. That would be bearable if the models actually updated to reflect the barrier or chest taking damage and progressing from a "Closed" state to an "Open" state, but they never do. When you hit them, there is a visual feedback of the hit connecting, which is good. But there's no way of knowing whether the hit was effective or not since there's no change in the feedback given for hitting gold vanity chests with different bending. I actually left a chest behind once because I wasn't sure if I could open it yet. A gamer's mentality is generally test hit something, if there's feedback of some kind keep attacking, if nothing happens after a few more test hits, determine you're missing something for now and move on. This is where having capable playtesters would be extremely useful, because you could determine where on this scale your breakable objects are.\n\n3) Terrible Difficulty Curve: This may just be my own personal skill, but it feels like the curve followed isn't even or gradual at all. Some points will be mind numbingly simple to complete, while others will randomly be incredibly difficult out of nowhere. This is a terrible choice as it stunts the player's skill growth by throwing her challenges that she is probably not ready for yet, then giving her false confidence in her talent by making something afterward that is much easier than what she has faced previously. It only sets her up for a greater fall when the next random difficulty spike comes along.\n\n4) Naga Mini Game: I've only encountered one of these weird random levels, but I get the feeling that there will be more so I'm going to talk about why this is bad. First and foremost, the mini game is a shameless Temple Run rip off. No debating that. Is Temple Run a fun game? Sure. Does it belong in a 3D combo brawler game? I don't think so. Why would you have your players master a skill that doesn't play into any part of the rest of your game as a requirement for completing your game? Doesn't that seem counter intuitive to you? Why not replace that isolated distraction with another full length mission or improve a boss battle or IMPROVE THIS FLIPPING GAME? I just have no idea what they were thinking with this level.\n\n5) The Game Doesn't Emphasize You Using The Combat System Based Around Switching Styles Properly: I get their attempt at teaching you the elements one by one by giving you the elements one by one. Normally, that would make a lot of sense. It's the same design that worked well for modern Zelda games (modern meaning post Link To The Past, after the "Zelda Formula" was implemented) and it really lends itself well to the player connecting to the character since the player is "getting stronger" by becoming more experience and the character is literally getting stronger. HOWEVER, this is not good for this game as the entire combat system is designed to force players to switch your bending styles mid-battle to effectively fight. This would be okay, if the level design accounted for you not having all your bending yet and appropriately challeneged you based on the player's assumed skill level as well as the characters guaranteed strength. But lo and behold, the level design does NOT assume this and sends you enemies that are much too difficult to defeat fighting with one bending style. Especially with a bending style that you can't fully utilize yet (since you just got it). Can you see the reason why this is bad design?\n\nThe list definitely goes on, but I'm going to cut it here.\n\nBasically, this game is a lazily designed cash grab. I feel really bad for the artists and programmers who no doubt worked 80 hour weeks towards the end of development in order to get this shoddy sad excuse for a game out the door. The saddest part is that I can see that a lot of thought went into the combat system and making it look and feel fluid and awesome. Frankly, it does feel really cool to switch through the different styles and string together combos that way. But that's literally the only thing that I think was carefully designed in this game. Everything else just feels so thrown together and half-♥♥♥♥♥. As a huge fan of the Avatar world and lore, I am supremely disappointed with the lackluster story draw and tie ins. As a massive fan of video games, I am incredibly upset with the lazy design that went into making this game.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone unless you can get it for free and need something stupid to get drunk and laugh at with your friends.","October 24, 2014","false","6.5"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","13","39","0","0"

As the avatar, Korra can summon the four elements and as in the the show Korra can switch between earth, water, fire and air to fight the multiple enemies she will face. Each style has a different strengths and purposes. Air is great for crowd control and dispatching groups of enemies, water is good for ranged enemies, earth is short range but very powerful and fire is fast and high in damage.\n\nEach element has different combination attacks that can be unlocked and learned as you level the style up through using it in fights. Unlike the show however you cannot switch styles mid combo, you can only switch styles in-between attacks. In terms of combo's I was heavily disappointed with the lack of depth especially from the creators of Bayonetta. Each style only has three or four unlockable combo's and this just severely limits the combat and makes the game very repetitive very quickly.\n\nIt's actually quite sad that while the game does have a solid foundation to become a good fighter it feels as if the developers put the ground work in and then didn't have the budget or go ahead to make something with any depth. The combat consists of two button attacks being a normal attack and heavy attack. You also have dodging, blocking and on the rare occasion countering at the right time. Now I say on the rare occasion because the input system feels so sluggish its horrible, its as if your playing an mmo with a poor connection. Buttons don't respond right away and feel spongy which can make it appear as if the guard button works when it wants. This is a huge oversight in any game, in a fighter where timing is everything, its unforgivable. The game even says right at the start that a 360 controller for windows is required for the optimal experience but both controller and keyboard are spongy and unresponsive.\n\nAside from the lack luster response time of the controls, combat is pretty fun. Avatar fans have longed for a time where they can bend the elements in video game form and it is relatively satisfying to hurl chunks of rocks at enemies. The issue is that while the novelty remains for a good amount of time, the lack of depth and the sheer lack of length of the game negates any true satisfaction to be had. Simply button bashing in most cases has the same effect as actually learning the combo's which takes away any skill involved.\n\nThe enemy AI is pretty much non existent as all have a set number of moves depending on the type of enemy. Enemy variety in itself is lacking as barring a few variations you'll be sticking with the same bunch throughout the game. It's feels so lazy, it's like the dev's instead of creating well thought out enemies and attacks just said to each other how to we do battle with the avatar? Oh lets just give most enemies unblockable electric moves. There's no creativity, no flair with enemies, even boss battles are unremarkable with annoyingly long health bars and the same set moves over and over.\n\nIn terms of progression there's little to be had. Most moves must be unlocked via the shop you can visit either inbetween levels or when you die. The store also contains health items and talismans you can equip which hold various effects. You can purchase items using spirit energy which Korra collects from defeating enemies or smashing objects. Once you've purchased items you have to equip them which is done by visiting korras home which is essentially a basic character sheet screen. This can be accessed any time and from here you can assign items to buttons as well as look at your available combo's.\n\nThe game is surprisingly difficult but I remain unsure if its actually intentional. The reason I say that is because nine times out of ten I died because the block button doesn't respond and the enemies hit unfairly hard or because to make things difficult they just throw more enemies at me. The balance of the game is off with enemies often in just one hit taking half your health bar off. Instead of coming up with intricate exciting fights, every level becomes rinse and repeat with different backdrops.\n\nSpeaking of level design levels are linear, short and disappointing. While an array of familiar locations are available including republic city and all the backdrops are faithfully representative of the tv show. The actual parts of the level you can travel in are bland and uninspired. Some sections contain hidden areas that are blocked off by color coded walls and only once you have the appropriate style of bending can they be broken.\n\nOccasionally between levels you'll have a temple run style mission with Korra's trusty polar bear dog Naga. It's all about moving between three or four lanes to avoid objects with some jumping and ducking along the way. The whole thing feels a cheap way to tack on some game time and in my opinion a less than appropriate way to implement Korra's trusty companion. These levels are filed with annoying deaths and become a test in patience rather than a fun side track.\n\nThe story of the game follows suit with its other aspects, that being, disappointing. Instead of a gripping narrative that the franchise if renowned for. We are instead served up a B movie quality story that in my opinion isn't even good enough for a filler episode of the tv series. At the start of the game Korra loses all her bending thanks to chi blockers and a mysterious old man. You spend the majority of the game slowly gaining your bending back element by element. Whats even more infuriating is that by the time you have all your bending powers back the game is almost over so you have very little time to actually feel like a complete avatar.\n\nIn terms of length, you can get through the story mode in around four to five hours. Once you've completed the story you unlock the pro bending league mode and you can play through the story again with all your bending powers available at the start.\n\nThe voice acting is good in the game with all the actors from the series coming to play their roles however like I said the story is bad and thus so is the scripting. What little cut-scenes there are look ok but don't hold any real value to the narrative, many due to the fact there isn't really any. Along side the voice acting is the music and sound effects which are all fantastically true to the franchise and something I was pleased to see.\n\nOverall the game is a disappointment in almost every aspect. It's not the game the franchise deserves, nor is it representative of what platinum can actually produce. What it does provide is a glimmer of hope for the future of the franchise in video game form. Yes this game lacks depth, length and story but its a solid foundation to build upon. It gives me hope that a fantastic Avatar game can be produced with the right budget, skill and time.","November 6, 2014","false","4.4"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","11","37","0","0"

And an even bigger crime than that is that they made us believe that this could be great - in a time, when a Batman game is one of the most awaited titles and with Platinum developing it, what could possibly go wrong?\nWhelp, they gave it a tiny budget and everything that could potentially be good about this game has been flushed down the toilet. All the enemies are taken straight from the show, which gets ridiculous with the palette-swapped triad, their AI is underwritten, so they stand around and do nothing a lot. The amount of Korra's attacks is little, the whole battle system is a safe play: just keep charged, dodge and block in time and you'll do great. You can actually start having some fun only halfway through, since, as you probably know, your elements are blocked from the beginning and are unlocked one at a time, so get ready to run through two entire levels with just water at your disposal, which is extremely limiting, while the game keeps throwing enemies at you at every step. Want to go look or some items while you're at it? Too bad, here are some MORE SAME ENEMIES.\nAnd when you actually get more elements and start having some fun, the game just gives up. It's poor camera is bearable most the time, but as you encounter giant spirits, it gets just plain stupid - they obstruct the view, so you can't see crap and your only option is to block and counter, as trying to make a combo will get you killed. Same is kinda true with the final boss, as he can do a couple of dodges and get out of your view, the attack you from offscreen (and some of his attacks are unblockable). And just as I bought some items and beat him, the game decided to make me play in pro-bending. I quit and GUESS WHAT - I have to fight the final boss all over again!\nDespite all this mess, if you want to see a good Avatar game with an adequate budget and developement cicle, there's no escape - you have to buy this. Activision, the cowards they are, just dipped their toe into the water to see if it's worth trying.

It's one of my favorite franchise and I will hold it dear until my death. So when I hear that a beat'em all would be developped on The legend of Korra, by Platinum Games nonetheless, I was really excited, knowing that the guys made great beat'em all games. But the result is... Disappointing.\nNow is it the most awful game out there? No. Is it a bad Avatar game? Actually, it's better that the Avatar games I played before. But knowing hose games, that's not really a praise...\nIt's not an awful game, but it's not a good game, it's still a bad one. And to the question "Would you recommand this game?", my answer would be no. I would say that if you're a fan of the franchise, try a demo first, or maybe wait for a sale, but if you're not a fan, I would not recommend it.\n\nHere is for some pro and cons:\n+The fighting. In itself, the fighting parts work well. Switching between different elements is quick and it feels satisfying. Counter and dodge systems are functionnal too.\n+The game looks nice. It's not breathtakingly beautiful, but it'still nice to see. The animation in the fightings is good too. However, the animated sequences are not really great, and that's a surprise.\n\n-The story. However, I'm not sure if I can say that it's a con because I think nearly everybody knew that this would be a weak point, so not a surpise here. Still disappointing, but it was expected.\n-The replayability and the length of the game. I completed the game in 4 hours, and even for a 15$ games, I feel that it's ridiculous. There's no real replayability, unless you really want to play the game again on Extreme difficulty.\n-The Naga parts. Those temple run sections are not really fun in themselves, but what's worse is that they could have been used to do something different. Why not make other sections where you interract with other characters of the show, like Asami, Tenzin or Bolin? Because except Jinora and Naga, Korra won't encounter anybody from the show.\n-No Options. You want to change the keys if you're playing with a keyboard? ♥♥♥♥ you no options. Want to change the graphics options? ♥♥♥♥ you not a single one.\n-The boss fights. They are ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive, always against the same ♥♥♥♥ing group of benders or a mechatank again and again and again.

It's a game that promises all of the quality of an episode of the show it's based off of. That promises in-depth gameplay with tons of abilities, and that promises you the full experience of actually being in the universe it pulls from. Many Avatar games, heck, many tie-in games in general promise this, and most if not all fail to deliver.\n\nThe Avatar universe is just too well developed for a game to be able to emulate it. Bending as a style of fighting is too free-form and original to be stuck to pre-animated movements and attacks. The story that's fit into the franchise so far is extremely big, and while you might see some little nods here and there, ultimately you don't get the same sense of awe or intrigue.\n\nMany highlighted items from the first series appear in your "treasures" area, a collection of about sixteen different momentos from both Korra and Last Airbender. You can collect things like Katara's necklace or the Blue Spirit mask, but being featured alongside things like "Mr. Chung's Gramophone" or a stuffed Flying Byson in a little group of items that don't actually do anything makes the inclusion seem unecessary, if not kind of disrespecting by pinning descriptions onto said items that only hold spoilers for people who may have yet to watch the Last Airbender.\n\nBut I digress; let's break this down.\n\nStory\nThe story in the Legend of Korra video game is supposedly written by the show's creators, but if it is, I'm not seeing it. Nothing is added to the universe, nothing is significantly important. We don't learn anything and nothing is eye nor ear-catching.\n\nThe equalists from the first season of the TV series are back on the prowl and have grouped up with the Triple Threat Triads and some mysterious old guy who has no character beyond laughing at you and appearing for about 5% of the game (could you guess that the guy appearing the least is the bad guy?). With these foes seeking only the death of the Avatar, and Korra's bending crippled thanks to "Chi Blockers", it's up to the her to regain her elements and put a stop to... Well... It's never clear exactly what is on the line or what will happen if the enemies succeed. But, they're evil, so we know it's really bad! That's motivation enough, right?\n\nThe story doesn't even nearly match the quality of the show's writing. The villain isn't named until the end of the game, where he then introduces himself. Before the final battle, he says that what drives him to kill the Avatar is revenge (of course) for something an unnamed Avatar did a thousand years ago (of course) and now the logical thing to do is destroy an entirely different Avatar because he had to meditate into the Spirit World to discover immortality. (Of co--) what? What? Now, I'm no expert on things that have never "officially" been clarified by the creative team behind Avatar, but it's generally accepted that if you go into the Spirit World via meditation, you can't leave, because you don't have a physical presence. Without this rule, this headcannon if you will, there are dozens of plot holes. I suppose I can't argue with it, as the issue doesn't technically go against any cannon, but it just raises a ton of questions.\n\nThe Style\nAvatar the Legend of Korra boasts some pretty impressive animation. Does the game live up to that? Well, it runs a decent 60fps, but even with it's cel shading, you can tell instantly that this isn't the TV show, and the quality of the textures or character details don't come close to show standards, either. Even the animated cutscenes (which prove only to be short bookends to levels and not an episode within the game) look a little bit off. The cutscenes also re-use some animations too, when characters have been speaking longer than the amount of animation that's been made.\n\nWe don't go anywhere interesting or new that the series has never taken us. You'll have a few Republic City missions, a few North Pole missions and a few Spirit World missions. The environments for each level are linear and predictable. You'll know exactly when you'll be fighting enemies, you know exactly where you need to go, and you'll know exactly where secrets are. There are a few smashable objects in each environment that give you spirit power to spend in Iroh's shop, and sometimes you'll find some health in them, too. The textures for buildings in Republic City are decent enough, but you can tell that it was quite a rushed job in terms of finishing the levels. All in all, it's sometimes sloppy, but decent, and it definitely doesn't feel like you're watching Avatar or exploring it's world.\n\nGameplay\nPlatinum Games undoubtedly leave their mark here. You've got your basic attack, your heavy attack, both can be charged, you've got your dodge, and you've got your counter. However, from games like Metal Gear Rising, the combat is a step down. The system lacks depth and all types of bending, even using regular attacks, feel slow. Even airbending. There isn't any clear-cut superiority amongst the elements, either. This is a good thing if you like a partiuclar element, but it just means that even though they look different, they essentially play the same. The only differences are that airbending and waterbending are more range oriented, and that earthbending is slower. But that doesn't mean there isn't a superior move. Once you unlock airbending and learn of it's heavy attack, you won't be defeating normal enemies any other way unless you actually care about variation in your battles. Even if you do care about variation, Korra isn't a spectacle fighter like Devil May Cry. You don't get bonuses for keeping up a constant combo, so there's no motivation to switch your elements regularly.\n\nIn the game you'll fight three types of equalists (close, ranged, and a hybrid of both), three types of Triple Threat Triad gang members (re-coloured galore), three types of mechs (which might as well all use same model), three types of spirits (who drop like flies by the time you get to them) and a big spirit. Pair that with the final boss and you've got an amazing... Err... 14 enemies... Yeah, the game doesn't have much enemy variation. The mechs, even though there's three types, attack in identical ways, you'll be sick of looking at equalists by the time you've finished and the Triads are used commonly to just add difficulty to random battles. Mechs and big spirits are just tanks, having an extra health bar and letting health go like Uncle Scrooge would let go of money (which is, to say, painfully slow). The last boss doesn't do anything impressive, either. With three health bars and unavoidable grab moves, it just comes off as lazy on Platinum's part.\n\nAt the end of each fight you get a medal, bronze, silver, gold or platinum depending on your performance. There's no way to tell how good you're doing in a battle, and there's no bonus you get from doing well other than extra spirit power to spend in Iroh's shop. Oh, didn't I say? Iroh has a shop. You'll find some combo moves in there, some consumables that go towards health, revives and filling gauges, and some items that change up the gameplay a bit, like a charm that gives you a constantly charged chi meter (allowing you to dole more damage) at the expense of cutting your health in half. You can access the shop any time between levels, or when you die. By finding those little collectibles I talked about earlier hidden in chests, you can nab a bit more spirit power to use when you finish a level. Other than that power, like I also said before, completely useless.\n\nThere's also Naga sections. They're essentially just a Korra mobile game.\n\nConclusion\nDon't get the Korra game. It adds nothing to the show and it won't make you a fan any time soon.\n\n4/10","October 24, 2014","false","50.0"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","10","37","0","0"

For those die hard korra fans good for you cause she's the only character you ever really see that was in the cartoon. The acting puts shame to the series with nuck tuk from the cartoon series (ment to be bad acting) doing a better job in some cases. the infinite runner with naga was cool and a nice break from combat but in the end i wish it wasn't acctually there as again repetitive with the same stuff going on.  I was looking forward to the game and am just glad it was only 15 bucks cause it was a dissapointment in all places. not for anyone really the combat is bad giving you split second counter options and to be honest it would have been better if they said hey lets make you a total BAD A were you beat the crap outa people.

For anyone not into the world of Avatar, the show takes place in a world where people can manipulate the elements (earth, fire, air, water). Only one person, however, can manipulate all the elements and that's the Avatar, who's tasked with bringing balance to the world. For everyone else, the game takes place immediately after the events of Book Two, when Korra (the Avatar) decided to leave open the portals that connect the Spirit World to our own. As a result, an ancient enemy of the Avatar is now free to sow chaos and destruction and, more importantly, destroy the Avatar once and for all.\n\nThe premise is intriguing, I'll give you that, especially seeing as we saw little of the repercussions of leaving the portals open at the beginning of Book Three before we were whisked away to Ba Sing Se. The game starts off promisingly enough with the intro from the show but instead of being followed by the voice of the 50s narrator that usually sets up the episodes we're dropped right into the action fighting against impossible odds in the Spirit World before switching to a pro-bending match. It was a disappointing beginning that was really a harbinger of things to come.\n\nSure enough, Mako and Bolin (important characters in the show) are quickly swept aside leaving Korra to fight alone. In fact, except for their brief appearance at the beginning and end of the game, together with Jinora's own from time to time, there is no interaction with any of the characters from the show. Tenzin and his family are conveniently visiting their grandmother; Lin is apparently doing a poor job ensuring the city's safety; and Asami is nowhere to be seen. It's a shame the creators of this game couldn't be bothered to feature at least a few characters from the show to give Korra someone to talk to other than Naga.\n\nGameplay-wise it really is a bit of a mixed bag. Each bending style is different in terms of power, speed, and range, but all of them feel authentic and useful in their own way. The story has you losing your powers early on so you will unlock each element as you progress through the game. While it's a bit underwhelming to fight with your fists for at least an entire level before unlocking your first element, in retrospect, the slow progression helped me understand the ins and outs of the different elements. Also, the Avatar State is powerful and I mean POWERFUL. Unfortunately, though, you can only access the Avatar State at the very end of the game and only for a few seconds (what's understandable seeing as you can easily beat the crap out of anything and everything).\n\nThroughout the game you'll be navigating a maze of corridors and smashing every crate, pot, box, or car, you encounter looking for currency (crystals) with which you can buy potions, new moves, or power-ups. Needless to say, my immersion suffered seeing as Republic City was only just recovering from Kaiju-Unalaq-Vaatu's attack and here I am destroying public property left and right. There is limited exploration to do within the maze and you'll be rewarded with items from the show, such as Katara's necklace or the Chi-blockers' electrified glove (none of which can be used might I add).\n\nAt certain points energy barriers will appear blocking your way until you defeat a certain number of enemies. Most of the time these enemies will be Chi-blockers (who don't really block your Chi in the game) although from time to time the game will introduce benders in the form of the Triple Threat Triads and mechs, and at the very end you'll be fighting spirits. During combat, however, the game suffers from bad camera angles that never show all of your enemies on the screen. Bosses can only really be taken down by blocking their attacks and counterattacking by following the on-screen cues. Bear in mind that they have some attacks that are unblockable.\n\nThe platforming part of the game can be infuriatingly difficult, not by design but because it suffers from the same issue with the camera which will be responsible for your plummeting to your death 99% of the time. There's nothing entertaining nor rewarding from outsmarting the camera having previously died twenty times to "get it right." There are also these mini-races where you ride Naga, your polar bear, through multiple corridors avoiding obstacles and gathering crystals. They help break the flow but are nothing remarkable.\n\nI also noticed sync issues throughout the entire game and most of the time I would have to wait several seconds when enemies showed up before I could regain control of my character. In other cases, characters speak to you much later than they're supposed to (e.g.: this was usually the case with Jinora who would show up and start speaking after ten seconds).\n\nStory-wise I have to say I was not impressed. Sure, the game uses the lore as if winking at fans of the show but the story itself is dreadfully poor. There's no real development of the villain's back story outside of "I'm an ancient enemy of the Avatar" and while Korra occasionally questions her decision to leave the portals open she never arrives at any sort of conclusion. Furthermore, and like I said before, the game suffers from a profound lack of characters that sometimes defies credibility. So Tenzin and his family are no longer on Air Temple Island, great, but where are the White Lotus guards? Did they up and vanish too? How about Republic City's police forces?\n\nI tolerated the more frustrating aspects of the game as well as its linearity because I'm a fan of the show and I always enjoy additions to the lore, however weak they may be. Bending the elements was also a high point of the game. However, I don't think I can currently recommend this game to anyone who isn't a fan of the show. Even if you can manage with the technical issues, you're literally dropped in a world with no setup, you're expected to be familiar with it beforehand. For what is worth, it took me about six hours to complete, but it's probably worth replaying once you unlock all your powers.","October 28, 2014","false","12.4"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","17","0","0"

So you first have to play through levels to unlock the different types of bending. It doesn't matter though because you really won't use it. You'll just stand in one spot and wait for your opponents to attack so you can counter them to do much more damage than any attacks do, unless they can't be countered. The only moderately useful bending type is fire bending. But it takes a while to unlock it. Once you do, you won't touch the other elements unless you need them to break open a door or a chest.\nThe grunt enemies are all just the same sprite with different skins. The battle against them are so easy and are just an annoyance. The boss battles, however, are a whole different story! Holy crap are some of these hard! They do massive damage, you barely do any, and on top of all that you'll still just be standing in one spot countering hoping you won't get hit twice because then you have to start the fight over. Also, a minor thing, every time you start over, it starts you right before the boss fight starts, so you have to watch the cut scene, every time!\nWhat about the story? There really is none. Also, one of the best parts of the avatar franchise, the characters, are essentially absent from this game. Korra's there, but that's really it. Jinora pops up every now and then and Iroh manages the shop, but there is no development.\nThere are a couple of mini games too. Pro bending is actually pretty fun. You're not just standing in one place countering the whole time. You actually have to use your combat skills (really just dodging and bending) to do well. The other one though. The Naga game. It's literally temple run, just a lot worse.\nThe music is good of course. It's taken straight from the show itself. The controls are pretty easy for the most part. The graphics were okay, I guess. Then there's the platforming. It's terrible. Mostly because of the camera angles. Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and hope there's a platform under you.\n\nCombat: 3/10\nStory: 3/10\nMechanics: 5/10\nMusic: 7/10\nOverall: 3.5/10\nIt's just bad. So save your money. If you want to play a good beat 'em up game, play Streets of Rage 2 or something. Just don't play this. Also there's taunting for some reason. Even though it's single player only.

I do expect some basic game design 101. Ie. TELL YOUR PLAYERS HOW TO PLAY YOUR GAME.\n\nCase in point. I started a Normal difficulty game. Normal right? Should be doable.\n\nI lost at the first freaking gameplay moment. The Probending Tournament? The game doesnt tell you ♥♥♥♥. Win the round.\n\nOkay...\n\nHow?\n\nGame: Nope not gonna tell you, here's how to attack. Here's how to dodge and block, And Lock on.\n\nMe: Okay... I locked on and knocked the guy back how do I switch to a new target?\n\nGame: Nope. Figure it out yourself.\n\nSo I spent about an hour or so trying to figure out exactly how am I supposed to win this. After about 5 times of seeing that You Lose screen the tip finally said "To win either Knock out all your opponents or win 2/3 bouts." Oh gee thanks game maybe you should have made that a little more obvious?!\n\nAnd then comes the best part of the game. Literally I love the Chi blocker fights. the different enemy types and then they start being combined with each other great! Even the "boss" fights though... when they're together its a bit... Well lets just come back to that shall we?\n\nBut back to the Lock on part for a second, in the next fighting part the game pops up and says something to the effect of "Did you know you can lock on with the left stick, switch targets by flicking the right stick left or right."\n\nReally? You're telling me this NOW? When you introduced the Lock on previously.\n\nNow if I could just elucidate for a moment. Basic game design 101 is that you introduce a new mechanic in a controlled environment. So. They could have introduced the lock on mechanic by pausing the game and saying that during the probending fight. instead it only gave me PART of the mechanic and didnt tell me the other part until later in the game.\nThat wouldnt be too bad had I been fighting ONE opponent when it was introduced. But I wasnt. I was fighting THREE opponents where target priority would have been very useful. But no they decided to introduce again later. Its as if this game was developed in parts and one hand didnt know what the other was doing. And then when they put it together they realized that oh crap there's overlap. Quick just lop some parts of it and ship it out of the door before we go overbudget!\n\nNaga Runs: Um... Well you know what I like this part too its nice change of pace and the fact that naga runs faster as you evade obstacles creates an interesting dynamic. Evade too much and suddenly the course is changing faster than you can react so you have to strategically run into things to slow yourself down. Once your water and earth bending are unlocked it really shows since the water sphere can tank a couple of hits yet you still slow down which is nice.\n\nAnd then comes the part where I rage quit and cemented my No Vote.\n\nThe First part was the same. Freaking. Bosses show up again slightly palette swapped. Okay Okay. 15 dollar game. Thats fine thats fine. I can get over that. What I cant get over is the Bull excrement this game pulls. Not only do they hit harder and have a higher defense than you do(so now you're taking even longer to kill them) and now they have a couple of new moves too.\n\nThe fire guy has this flame burst which entirely ignores your attacks so good luck staggering him, the Earth guy has a BULL EXCREMENT. Capital letters warranted. Attack in which he stomps the ground, which creates a pillar right where you're standing anyone on the field. Yes. ANYWHERE. You could be on the side of the field, he stomps and bam you get knocked in the air. And then he instantly teleports to you and smacks you into the ground.\n\nEventually I settled for running like a loon in a loop and focused fire them one at a time with Water bending. I really feel like the Avatar here guys. /s\n\nTurns out Earth Bending blows chunks. You're too slow and rooted in place(as per Earth Bending doctrine) which makes you an easy target for the other two bosses you're not attacking. Which is a problem because you are in fact NOT invincible while you're earth bending. So fat lot unlocking Earth bending did for me.\n\nBut I managed to win that fight by abusing the game's pathfinding. Managed to take out the water bender. And then started fighitng the fire bender.\n\nWhere was the earth bender? Stuck behind a breakable vase. Happy bug since I did NOT want to lose again.\n\nCool Naga Run.\n\nUh... Okay another boss battle? Thats... kind of quick.\n\nOh hey its the robot again. And it has an electrical arm. Oh good.\n\nWait, I dont have a chance to buy more items? What?!\n\nWhat about refilling spirit energy? I burnt so much buying skills and items.\n\nOh come on.\n\nAnd here comes the part that makes me rage quit.\n\nThere are in fact NO invincibilty cells in this game.\n\nYou know in fighitng games where for a second after you get hit you're invincible to any follow ups thus allowing you to catch your breath and get out of dodge.\n\nThis game?\n\nHAH. Invincibilty cells are for chumps. You're the Avatar. You get smacked down, you can recover instantly. Only... to be smacked again. Get up and smacked again. And on Normal difficulty that's just managed to kill you dead.\n\nYou lose.\n\nWould you like to try again?\n\nBasically once you get hit, unless you dodge correctly you're essentially screwed as the AI is relentless. You get bola'd so you're Crowd Controlled? Have fun, the robot AI is goin to ram, and fire off another bola as soon as you recover because screw you, how dare you have a chance.\n\nIts like the developers took the "arcade" description and LITERALLY made it an arcade like game. For those that dont remember, arcade games had notorious difficulty curves and rarely explained anything. So the only way you learn fights is to keep feeding quarters into the machine.\n\nHere at least I'm not feeding quarters into it. What I am doing is feeding it my patience of which I've run out.\n\nI'll switch to Easy or Casual as the game calls it(Which is weird since it called it Easy when it first asked me. Its as if one hand didnt know what the other was doi- Oh wait I said that already.)\n\nI HAVE TO START ALL OVER? OH GOD NO.\n\n\ntl;dr: At 15, obviously im not expecting triple A game play, but at 15 I'm gonna expect basic game design 101 guys. 10. Or even 5. At 15 you better really really like the series so that it overcomes the flaws.","October 28, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 25 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","4","25","0","1"

Yeah, it’s made by Platinum. Yeah, it’s based on a series that really does deserve a game that makes you feel like an all-powerful avatar. This isn’t it. It’s marred by repetitive bosses, unbalanced encounters, a heavy focus on waiting for chances to counter, an insistence on throwing you into entirely different styles of game at random points, and boring level design, to boot. It says it doesn’t want to be a game only for kids but it seems to make all sorts of design concessions, including a repetitive nature and the Temple Run-esque mini-game of sorts, that aren’t generally made in games not made for kids. At the same time, it focuses on countering and more complex fighting mechanics while only letting you make use of so many. But worst of all,  you don’t even get to use all of your bending power until near the end of the game. So much for being an all-powerful avatar, right?","October 27, 2014","false","5.4"," 7 of 33 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","7","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iAmInf/recommended/281690/","iAmInf","iAmInf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iAmInf/","31 products in account","I've regretted this purchase a dozen times by the time I got to the Spirit World.  This is the most infuriatingly frustrating game I've ever had the displeasure of playing.  If I COULD get a refund, I'd sure as hell demand one.  Never have I played a game - and I've played PLENTY of F2P turned P2W titles! - with such poor balancing and unfair odds.  I'll elaborate here - in case someone wants to flame me for criticizing their favorite game.\n\nYou have a superior AI.  Seriously, it attacks you with the fluidity and perfect syncronization you only see in Kung Fu movies.  The precision and coordination is absolutely amazing!  To be honest, by comparison, a highly skilled Action player is reduced to a button mashing maniac.  Why do I say that?!  Because you actually HAVE to mash the buttons to get the stupid combo strings to actually complete.  Plus, you get flanked and interrupted ALL THE DAMN TIME!  This wouldn't be so rage inducing IF your guard or dodge ACTUALLY EFFING WORKED under these circumstances!!!  But they DON'T!  No, you have to hit each enemy only once at a time, agonizingly slowly chipping away damage until you finally clear the overpowered mob.\n\nI almost forgot to mention they're unfathomably aggressive as well.  Poor Korra can't even get half her jab out before the hyper active AI fires off another brutal combo at her.  Seriously, unless you have the most perfect offensive prowess ever, you just get juggled all the time.  You can't make a single mistake, or be the least bit off timing, or your punishment will cost you your life in a single combo.  This is only on the NORMAL difficulty!  BS you not, without a significant amount of luck, you're going down enough times to make you feed your TV your controller before you get halfway through the game.  Korra is CLEARLY the slowest character in the game thus far.  It's totally bogus.  Of all the moves in her set, they chose the broadest and slowest ones.  It's a wonder you can hit anyone with all these big attacks being constantly interrupted mid animation.\n\nFirst fight of the game, you're thrown into combat for no apparent reason, no actual objective, and no idea what you're doing.  You don't know how to play the game, you simply mash the buttons until you get pounded like a nail through wood, having never actually learned anything, until the AI picks up enough steam to volley you into an infinite combo.  Then you get thrown directly into ANOTHER fight at the Pro Bending tournament, and the super late tutorial waits until you're squarely losing before telling you how to actually play!  Before you can even move on screen, the other team is concentrating fire on you.  When you CAN finally move, you're already being hit.  You start the match at a disadvantage already, why punish the player even more?  Not only is it 3 on 1, but I have to be knocked back a zone before I can even move?!  Take what little health I have too?  When I'm supposed to be competing?!!!  ON TOP OF THAT there's a timer going, and you have to make a comeback and pull an upset to pass the stage!  I ACTUALLY LOST TWICE BEFORE I FIGURED OUT I NEEDED TO KNOCK ALL 3 OUT TO PASS!\n\nWho sets a game up to force the player to lose at the very start - the easiest levels of the game?!  WHO does that?!  Seriously.  What sadistic ***hat thinks this is actually fun?  It doesn't end there though, no.  They load the combat areas up with more enemies than the actual software can handle.  I've got a quad-core A8-7600 in this machine kicking out the funky, good stuff, playing HD video, streaming 3 webcam feeds, and rendering in Blender [with a Cycles Render going while I'm editing the main model] all at once with no lag - but I can't handle some basic HD sprites?  Nahhhhhh, that's not my computer - not when I can play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on it's extreme, nearly max, settings without even a frame drop.  Not when I just played Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning on extreme, nearly max, settings without a frame drop as well.  Nope!  That's not my system, THAT'S this butt-fudge game.  Anyway, guess what drops to bottom priority in the game?  The controller.  The controls literally stop responding frequently when the player is crowded, there are gigantic enemies on the screen flailing wildly at you, a combination of both, when fast projectile spam is headed your way, or when you try to parry a giant that's interrupting your combo.  I have been mowed down like teenagers in a Jason movie by juggernaugts that simply won't just die - ON TOP OF HAVING EXTRA TONS OF EXTRA HEALTH AND HIGHER DEFENSE!!!  They're not just the entire Rocky Mountain Range [yeah, it's that effing many of them], they have to be some odd fusion of Jackie-effing-Chan and the Incredible Hulk too??? O_o Is this dev team full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags, or what?!\n\nOh, and the transport stages - don't even get me started on those!  The obstacles are too close together to reach the speeds I've reached.  That freaking Beardog gets faster than a NASA rocket at escape velocity.  The controls can't keep up with her.  You end up having to restart from her starting speed at every checkpoint a million times before you can pass the level.  THEN they throw you into a fight with her, and those big polar bear paws do miniscule damage, while making sure you can't effectively dodge most of the attacks coming at you.  They give you the options, don't highlight the cockback of the attack to use each option for, then take away those options by making the maneuvers specific to the attack you're receiving.  Speaking of defense, back to that.  Did I mention the parry system fails 70% of the time?  You use perfect timing and you'll either catch a critical each time your guard is broken, or you'll simply block.  70% of the time is dedicated specifically to those 2 things.  And then, when your guard is broken, they play volleyball with the poor girl.  Don't get hit, you'll definitely regret it.\n\nAll the enemies hit hard too.  For characters that mostly don't have bending, they sure knock the daylights out of Korra, who seems to come up short on strength...for the freaking AVATAR!  I could have SWORN the Avatar was supposed to be stronger than everybody.  Maybe SOME benders can hold their own for a while, but even those without bending are kicking her around the map like a pinball.  Something that's indeed not true to the series, she's got a glass jaw too.  You've got to be Floyd Mayweather in this game.  You get hit, it's over for you.  You'll catch a volley and won't even survive it.  By the 10th hit, if you aren't dead, you'll wish you were.  You might as well put the controller down when a giant hits you.  And they go all the way across the arena and do it too.  You're a goner if the controls stop responding while you're getting your Aang on.   They'll turn Korra to ketchup in a New York minute.  Juggernauts aren't the only ones that have super armor either, by level 4 you'll encounter the most basic enemies with it.  They'll be attacking, you dash over and interrupt, they don't stop - no, they push right on through.  They just ease right on there, like a tank trying to park in your garage without tearing your house down.  Critical every single time.  You just want to cry after that.\n\nOh!  And a great deal of city maps have scaffolds you constantly fall from.  When I was getting my Earth bending, smdh, I couldn't run across this narrow beam that I was required to cross until 2/3 of my health was gone.  I just kept falling off.  This girl can't run a straight line.  She must be drunk.  If I were a cop, I'd be arresting her for public intoxication because -whew!- no way her dizzy behind can just go straight.  Even if the camera is directly behind her, this little jackrabbit runs zigzags.  Speaking of the camera, it's a derailed nightmare.  You'll find yourself ignoring it until you finally knock out enough that the focus stops switching.

However, the game mechs itself resembles  so much of the Naruto Shippuden game series.\n\nI have my pro's and cons on this,  Starting from the options, it lacks a great deal of instructions & controls which made it difficult to review the full set of keys/buttons, Using the controller is fine, since the NPC's are far too easy through-out the game, until you get to the camera angles which equal a huge pain in fighting.\n\nNext up is the graphics and animations, they show the characters with great accuracy, but low effort in detailing the rest of the game & trying to relate it to the actual series. Enemy NPC's falling out of the sky randomly is one example of laziness in positioning, along with their attack patterns, Well.. I wouldn't call it a pattern as it is the same attack repeating constantly.\n\nDifferent levels, you'll expereince quite a mixture of things, from a crash bandicoot style riding Naga just like the polar bear along the streets! all the way to side scrolling moments on small jumping puzzles.\n\nAll in all, I was very sceptical about buying this and would not recommend it if your expecting ful control in bending the elements.","October 21, 2014","false","3.6"," 41 of 144 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","41","144","0","0"

Whether you're a fan of the series, Platinum, or both, this game will impress you through it's gameplay. The gameplay will consist of some platforming, some "infinite" runner, and a whole mess of fantastic combat. The combat is really where the game shines. Now don't get me wrong, there are still some bad parts to this game as well.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series and hoping to get a rich-filled story from this, don't have your hopes up. The story won't please you, but I guess it won't really disappoint you (much). It's also a really short game, though has replayability. From what I heard from others is that this game was on a really tight budget and it shows.\n\nFrom the color palette to basically reusing everything they can, it shows the budget they were given. You will see subtle similarities throughout the entire game, but enough of a difference to let it slide. Though for them to use what they were given and create this, it really deserves a pat on the back.\n\nMy final thoughts are that there were very very little to no bugs and that is just something worthy of saying and praising. Most licensed games are usually not that great either through just generic, boring gameplay, and/or alot of other things that give the stereotype of a licensed game. The Legend of Korra however is a game that I hope ends up getting a sequel and gets a bigger budget to work with. Overall, I would reccomend this game to anyone interested in great gameplay. Also, this game has made me a fan of the studio and makes me wish that they do work on the sequel should it ever get one.

(e.g. water for long-range) Eventually, Korra can go into the "Avatar state" for a short period which makes her even more powerful.

Actually, the final battle is irritating even at max stats, because countering is the only way to do measurable damage, and even then it takes a LONG TIME.\n\nIf you have an old computer, don't even bother--mine had to drop down to the bare minimum of 640x480 and would STILL drop to about 3 FPS during fight sequences with the dark pools.\n\nOverall: Fun, but could use fewer QTEs, and the Naga sections have WAY too much going on","December 7, 2014","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Pick it up now while its on sale!\n\nThe Legend of Korra is my favorite TV show so of course I will defend anything related to it to death but I will try and add an unbaised opinion.\n\nFor those who watch the show(s):\n\nStory:\nTo start the game is set after Book 2 and leads up to Book 3 so if you want to avoid spoilers go watch Book 1 and 2.\nThe story isn't lenghty like the TV shows which is expected. The main Characters from the show appear little if at all. Korra, Jinora, Mako, Bolin and The Announcer appear with their voice actors/actresses from the TV show. Some characters are referenced such as Asami and Tenzin but do not appear. The bad guy Hundun doesn't interest me and is bland where as other bad guys in the TV show are interesting.\n\nBrief Summary of the Plot:  Korra is doing some things. Gets hurt. Loses her bending. Goes and does lots of other stuff. Gains all her bending. Goes into Avatar Star. Rekts Hundun.\n\nGameplay: I haven't played any other Platinum (A metal that can't be bent by Metal Benders) Games but I hear they are good. The beginning is extremely boring as you lose your bending and just punch and kick people. Once you get your first element the game starts to speed up. If you ever pretended to be a bender (still can't take that seriously) or the Avatar (don't lie) you are going to get a kick out of this. Using all the elements to beat down someone is the most satisfying thing. The highlight of bending (and in the game) is when you first enter the Avatar State. I will not lie. I squealed in joy.\nNaga Running: It's Temple Run but with a cute fluffy Polar Bear Dog.\n\nPro Bending: Featured in the TV show. I don't know how to explain it. It's ok.\n\n\nFor those who don't watch the show(s):\n\nStory: Treat like all other stories. If it vaugely interestes you go watch TLoK or TLA. Just do it. I will give you a cookie.\n\nGameplay: I would assume Platinum fans would enjoy the game. I like these type of games (not good at them though).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nMust buy if you are a TLoK fan.\n\nMust buy if on sale for non TLoK fans.","December 17, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a large focus on the last-second dodging and blocking, but it's not frustratingly difficult. The story is, like many have put it, not too great, but it's not terrible. There are a few lines so far that will not hold much meaning or simply be confusing if one has not watched the series (do yourself a favor and DO IT). The side-missions on Korra's pet are a bit annoying, but luckily short and with numerous checkpoints.\n\nThe game is short if you don't care about the extras. You probably could simply go straight through the missions in a couple or few hours. However, simply replaying them when I get new powers to unlock chests, and going for gold on each mission, has provided me with over 6.5 hours and I have only finished 5/8 levels on Normal. People spend $60 dollars for ~6-8 hour games all of the time, even without replayability.\n\nThere are also quite a lot of little trinkets in the store that can really alter your game style, which is why I will probably hit 10-12 hours on the story mode alone once I unlock the highest difficulty -- something I don't typically care about. Examples are a trinket that allows for permanently charged powered up attacks in exchange for half health, and a trinket that allows you to move faster.\n\nNo comment about the Pro-Bending, since I haven't finished normal.\n","January 9, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't overtly imaginative and it's a combat focused game for sure with the number of enemies often being your main obstacle but still a likeable game.\n\nI am a big fan of the LoK series and so simply had to get the game. I can see why some might see the combat as repetitive but anyone with the inclination to do so can make it more fun for themselves by using different moves/elements. And the combat is broken up by various 'mini games' to interrupt any repetitiveness. I think they handled it well. Another good thing about the combat is that you actually do need to utilise various styles if you're playing even normal, the block/counter button is certainly your friend in this case, so it's not just button mashing and some thought is needed.\n\nVisually it was better than I thought it was going to be, it's done in a cartoon style which considering it's based on a cartoon is what you'd expect.\n\nOverrall I think this should be played for the gameplay itself as opposed to the lacklustre story.","January 16, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought the game for that reason and I have to say its a VERY hard game in spots unless of cource you know what your doing. Sadly they dont teach you that well so you have to learn on your own mostly. I do wish they added more of the main characters from the show and where able to fight with them. The only time you get to fight with people is at the pro-bending arena. Which was the best part of the game for me. Sadly the story line was only okay. Im now done being mean and saying the game was still alot of fun. The combat was great, loved the pro-bending game, and you just gotta love Korra kicking some ♥♥♥.

After stewing on the purchase for about a month, I decided that even if the game wasn't that great, it would allow me to experience The Legend of Korra a bit more following the end of the series.\n\nTo start with, its awesome that they have used all the same actors for the voice acting. I think this should be a given for games of this type, however, often sadly it is not. The games style is similar to Bayonetta and though combos are not quite as plentiful or fantastic (in regards to eye candy), they are still rewarding. The ability to swap through the different elements makes for many different play styles which is welcome to me.\nControls are at times a bit on the poor side, especially noticeable for me when targeting. Also, the timing of counter attacks I find a bit odd and unpredictable after playing Bayonetta. Camera is usually ok...but at times is completely bonkers, though remedied quickly\n\nGraphics are wonderful and very in keeping to the animated series. Music is also commendable.\n\nIn terms of story, I have yet to finish the game but I am enjoying the general progression. Pro-bending, though I have had limited exposure to it, seems fun and quite challenging. I am looking forward to experiencing it more.\n\nWhen I bought this game, I expected it to be easier than Bayonetta; relaxing and allowing me to delve back into the world of Korra. Wow was I wrong. Playing the game on normal settings, I have more than once shook my head in disbelief at the difficulty, especially during some boss battles. In saying this, I am happy that it has given me a challenge to keep me playing and improve my bending skills ;)\n\nOverall, am I happy with my purchase? Yes 100%. Would buy again from the publishers. If you are a fan of The Legend of Korra, I would recommend this game. If you are a fan of beat-em-ups like Bayonetta, again, I would recommend, though possibly less if you have no connection to the TV series.\n","January 21, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a very interesting storyline and is very easy to follow with the new villain and new twists on familiar characters and locations. I have a couple positive things to say and one slightly negative, but not too negative thing about this game.\n\nPositives: I think this game has a GREAT way to play as the avatar. It makes switching between the elements fun and easy and it makes bending each element interesting and engaging. There are different moves you can learn for each element and is very very entertaining. (There's even an air scooter!) It's a very creative storyline and has a very fun and accurate to the show Pro-Bending mode you can play. Being able to customize Korra's outfits is nice as well.\n\nNegatives (kind of): This game is very very difficult to get used to. The first time I faced off against the three Triads I got my butt kicked so many times. At times it was frustrating and it was difficult to get any progress. However, I realize that this is just signifying a challenging game. But I do think that it was occasionally a tad excessive. For example, beating three bending dragonfly-bunny spirits was, in my opinion, more difficult than beating the final boss.\n\nAside from the fact that at times it can be grueling and frustrating and very difficult, I did enjoy this game a lot. I love the bending. You can breathe fire, ride an air scooter, create an earthquake, and do a water whip to name a few. Something that I will say for all those who are going to play this game is STRATEGY and COUNTERING. Those two things are extremely important in this game and honestly were the only reason I was able to proceed in some areas of the game. I would get beaten over and over and then would finally come up with a decent strategy using various styles of bending and whatnot and I would finally be able to proceed. It is not a game for the quick to quit if it provides a challenge.\n\nIf you like action games with an aspect of strategy and methodical fighting, then I would recommend this game. Also any fans of the Avatar world will love it just for the sake of being able to play as the avatar easily. For the price that it is, I think that it is a game well worth it and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Not fantastic, but very good.","January 25, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Platinum games was definitely the right people to make this game, with Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising in their resume of action games. This however, felt like either did the bare mininium or didn't have enough time to really flesh out the game. I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were pushed to release the game during the height of the show's popularity, seeing how Activision, who have been know to rush out games,  also had a hand in this game.\n\nThere are a lot to be liked about this game, mainly the combat itself. Each style of bending feels authentic and looks like something out of the show. Being able to dodge and weave then blow the enemies away with air bending, really ties the game to its source material. The controls are easy to use and players will not have any troubles mastering how to play the game. The graphics are cell-shading, while its not very detailed, a lot of games, especially licensed games have used cell-shading graphics, which seems to be the norm.\n\nStory for the game and the voice acting for it, was very much phoned in. None of Korra's friends really appear in the game other than at the start, which is a shame because I would have liked to have played as Mako, Bolin and Asami. The story takes place after the events of Book Two, Korra is dealing with the aftermath of what happened. She is attacked by an old wizard of somekind who had temporary removed her bending and she must deal with evil spirits from taking over. The story really doesn't make much sense as nothing is really ever explained. At the end of the game, I wasn't sure why I was beating up an old man. They reused a lot of things from the show, like Korra's bending being taken away and enemies are mainly what is left over of Amon's followers from Book One. The enemies themselves are suprisingly challenging but with the random difficulty spikes at certain parts of the game made it fustrating, but Platinium games have been know to be challenging and unforgiving at times.\n\nThe addition of a Pro-Bending mini-game was something I was happy to see. While it isn't very fleshed out, it was still fun and had me wishing they spend a lot more attention to this and maybe even make it as a spin-off. It was worth finishing the story to unlock, but should have been unlocked from the start.\n\nLegend of Korra was fairly priced at 15 dollars given at how short the story was. It is a very well put together game and definitely worth getting if you are a fan of the series. It is just a shame that it left me wanting a fully made Legend of Korra game, but for what its worth, it definitely gets an A for effort.","January 5, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was not a big fan of the latter since I'm not into teen drama as much as others might be.  At any rate, hopefully I will not come across as biased.\n\nThis game didn't cut it for me.  There is too much of a divide between gameplay and story.  I'll explain what this divide is and why I chose not to recommend this game.\n\nThe Legend of Korra consists of a series of chapters (stages).  Each stage starts you off with an animated cutscene (some from the TV show and what original animation I've seen is lower-quality), after which you run around as Korra in a 3D-rendered environment beating up enemies, sometimes with smaller cutscenes in-between, and concluding at the end with another brief animated cutscene.\n\nThe problem?  There is no overlap.  It's almost as if the game developers just contracted the animation studio after the game was already done.  Other than some dialog voice-overs (the in-game 3D-models do not lip-sync btw, nor even attempt to) the gameplay portions are just action.  Furthermore, the animated cutscenes are very brief.  Korra might say something, then all of a sudden she's ambushed by bad guys in the most unlikely situations.\n\nThe two goods thing I can say is the gameplay is at least challenging and fun to some degree, and I never encountered a single bug.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend this to anyone.  The quality is just not there.","December 16, 2014","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you're going to get this game and you have an Xbox One / PS4...get it on the console. The PC version is highly buggy. For example, everytime you enter a battlezone where a big fight will happen, the time it takes for the game to introduce the characters to when you actually start fighting takes ridiculous amounts of excess time that just makes the game feel slow (if you did not understand that: when the characters jump onto the screen for battle, they remain static after they have done their showoff moves for around 10-15 seconds. This does not happen in the console version). Also, on a side note, the main boss is almost impossible to beat. The game unforutanely has many bosses that are under the guise of being challenging, but it turns out that they're just really, really cheap. Did you struggle to fight that humongous spirit boss in the beginning of the level? Rest assured, there will be 2 of them that you need to fight at the same time and they'll eclipse your camera, and also there will be environmental hazards.\n\nHowever, on the bright side:\nThe combat system is one of the best systems I've ever had the pleasure of playing.\nThe transition between each of the four elements is very smooth and fluid, and it makes it feel like you're the actual Avatar.

Fans of the show will be heartened to know that this is a very accessible character action game.  Voices are provided by original cast members, and the bending looks and feels great, but the plot is bare bones and there isn't much of the world for us to explore.  Fans of Platinum games will likely be let down by the relatively shallow gameplay and limited replayability.  This game desperately needs online competitive pro bending, but that's more commitment than we could possibly expect from a licensed game, especially the way Nickelodeon has treated the LOK franchise thus far.  Bottom line: If you want a weekend of light action, or just want to support the show, get this while it's on sale.","December 2, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is short, which is its biggest downfall, but it totally makes up for it with its awesome graphics, fun gameplay, and unique attention to detail as well as bending. I love how you can switch between elements so fluidly. The pro-bending (yes you get to do pro-bending tournaments) stuff is fun too, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed that you couldn't do more customization there.\nIDEA: Upgrade the pro-bending in this game so you can create your OWN team and compete.

It's basically just an excuse for the game to happen. The game is attractive and pretty fun for what it is. It kinda fills the space that a Turtles in Time etc. did years ago. You go about brawling generic bad guys with mostly color to differentiate them, with a few "Boss" fights thrown in.\n\nThe combat and movement itself feels tight and the different types of bending feel useful and varied enough. I enjoyed the Naga running and Pro bending segments more than I thought I would. The platforming worked just fine with a Xbox controller, though criticism of the camera occasionally being wonky are legitimate. The game offers a decent challenge, Korra can not take too much punishment despite dishing it out and some of the enemies are pretty aggressive.\n\nBasically, the Gamespot reviews were absurdly lowballing, as are the reactionary sentiments that went with that. It's not a blatant cash grab and some obvious care was put into the mechanical side of the game. It's simply not a full title and if you're expecting that it's going to be disappointing. If you want to beat people up as Korra for 5 hours then it's a pretty decent game. Recommended for fans of the show, at least.","December 3, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard as balls and it always finds a way to make me throw my controller down in sheer rage, but I keep on coming back for me because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is so much fun. So fun and rewarding to take down every enemy using a wide variety of skills and a nice spectrum of different and unique enemies to face off against. It pretty much feels almost exactly like you're actually bending like an Avatar; every single skill has its own weight, strengths, weaknesses, power, speed, etc, and none of them feel copy-pasted. Story mode is pretty decent with a cool new story that manages to fit pretty well into the canon (in a sense) and the animated cutscenes look pretty faithful to the show, and the voice acting is pretty good, too. Very few things wrong with this game, other than maybe its length, the occasional spike in difficulty, some of the challenges that break up the regular gameplay are just crazy hard, the defense mechanics sometimes take a bit away from the immersion (could just be my pesky suspension of disbelief kicking in and out again) as well as the timing of defense stuff feeling a little bit too tight...mainly nit-picky things that don't really take much away from the experience. I'm sort of reminded of the gameplay and feel of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (if you thought that game was hard, OHHHHHHHHHHH MAN you ain't seen nothing yet) but scaled-down to a shorter story, a few less collectibles but more combos and more varying gameplay.\n\nFor $15, this game is almost a steal (a little short but well worth that price). If they plan to add more content in the future, you will find me frantically pushing my wallet through my computer screen. Highly recommended, especially to avid fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra as well as those who are looking for a bright and challenging game experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draikin/recommended/281690/","Draikin","Draikin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draikin/","108 products in account","I decided to write this review after getting all the achievements, given how some of the professional reviewers out there didn't seem to have put more than a few hours into the game before writing their review. In my opinion it's not a game that can be fully appreciated with just a single playthrough. It's only on the second playthrough that you'll max out the four elements that you can use in combat, and be able to purchase all of the combos available in the store. This changes the game substantially in terms of speed, damage and the visual spectacle displayed on-screen. Using the right Talisman upgrade, Korra becomes pretty much unstoppable even on Extreme difficulty. While still limited compared to games like Bayonetta, the combat system is certainly one of the best aspects of the game.\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the game isn't quite as good. It's clear that the developers had limited time and budget, and not just from the $15 price tag. The graphics lack in detail, the level design is limited, the enemies (including the bosses) aren't varied and the game can be completed in around 4-5 hours. While the combat is enjoyable, the running sections with Naga where you're basically on-rails and have to move/jump to avoid obstacles (much like the more recent 3D Sonic games) don't really add much to the game. The Pro-bending mode is a nice addition. While it doesn't have any real replay value once you complete it (an online multiplayer mode would have been great), it complements the rest of the game quite well.\n\nThat said, by far the most disappointing aspect of the game is the story, which is nowhere near the level of the series the game is based on. In fact, it's barely even there. It simply doesn't make much sense, and the villain is really only there for the last boss fight. It's a shame, because some of the final moments of the game would have been a lot more powerful with a stronger storyline. Now they just give us a glimpse of how good a LoK game could be when PlatinumGames was given a bigger budget.\n\nStill, I can forgive a lot of the game's flaws, especially given the price tag. It's not even close to being the game that the series deserves, but the combat is enjoyable enough to make it worth playing. Just don't expect too much from the storyline.","October 27, 2014","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Legend of Korra is a mechanically solid game that is fun and entertaining if you put in the effort to LEARN it.\n\nThis is a short game that can be completed in about 3-6 hours, depending on difficulty level and how many restarts you take. As expected from the creators of Bayonetta, combat is satisfying and rewarding if you take your time to learn the systems and combos (hint: countering is a skill that you must master quickly). You can also equip accessories to modify and enhance Korra's stats. With the right item combination, the game can become super easy, but it takes some time to earn all of the required cash to unlock everything.\n\nFans of the show might be disappointed that this game does not offer much in terms of exploration or character interaction. There are some brief dialogue sequences with Mako and Bolin, but apart from that this is a pure game about Korra and a pure game about fighting. The story itself, is also quite throwaway and doesn't really add much to the series. You won't miss anything about the lore by not playing this game.\n\nThere is some replayability in the form of Extreme difficulty, which is unlocked when you complete Normal for the first time, extending the overall playtime to around 15+ hours.\n\nBottom line: If you are a fan of the show and enjoy playing action fighters, then buy Legend of Korra.","November 18, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering it was a fairly low-budget game I think Platinum have done very well (but that could be me being a really big Korra fan xD). The storyline is pretty shallow, the enemies repetitive and the game short. But, for me, I was mainly looking for the bending and I must say, it's better than anything out there - I find it very fluid and I like the combat system - you also have a chance to level your bending up and unlock new moves, etc, which I liked. I will say that its connection to the Avatar world is very dry... Only Korra and Jinora *in spirit form* appear in actual gameplay, as well as the Triple Threat Triad who appear countless times... Iroh is there to man the shop where you can buy new bending moves and things to help you, and Mako and Bolin which are 'there' in Pro-bending which you unlock once you complete the game. There are some other features too but I won't list them. It is quite challenging (well for amateur gamers like myself). I think, for what the game is worth, if you like the series, I would recommend it. I would look at some of the walkthroughs online to get a feel for it before you buy (though I'd skip near the middle/end since the first bit has no bending)...","October 23, 2014","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shallow compared to the combat of Metal Gear Rising, but still leaves plenty of room to go crazy, juggle enemies and string together long combos.\nDumb story and repetitive enemies, but the game is just the right length for the content that it has.\nI found certain parts a fair bit frustrating on the Normal difficulty and while there is definitely some skill involved in playing the game well, it seems to lack a bit of polish. For example, as frantic as combat can get in MGR, you are pretty much always able to see what you need to see in order to react appropriately. I found this area a bit lacking in Korra since you might often be unable to see certain attacks coming at you, especially when fighting against benders, resulting in some cheap-feeling deaths.\nPro-bending matches that unlock after you beat the game are a nice addition, they feel like straight out of the show and are a lot of fun up until the final match on the highest difficulty, which is just bs.\nThe game could have definitely used some more time in development to expand on certain mechanics and the potential provided by both the world of LoK and the ridiculously competent devs at Platinum Games, but it should still be a steal in a sale for any Platinum/Korra fan.","January 3, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A must play for fans of the Avatar and Korra shows with an itch to experience bending for themselves. One interesting note: the action is very kinetic with no blood and no slicing and dicing you'd find in most other Platinum titles.

The auto lock on works most of the time, really only getting confused against enemies at range.\n\nVisually the game isn't very impressive. The cell shaded graphics are average.

While their game is indeed short, it feels like an "extras" episode that takes place in-between Book 2 and 3. At first, I was kind of skeptical that it would just end up being kind of a "meh" game, but after reading the reviews and watching a video of the gameplay, I needed it in my life. They make up for the shortness of the game by including a pro-bending mode which we don't see a lot of in the actual show, so it's quite comforting to see it being done in the game. The story introduced challenges the Avatar faced as well as a nice little mix-up of gameplay near the later chapters.\n\nOverall, if you love LOK and don't mind a very simple hack-away game scoring 1000s of combos, this game is for you.","December 27, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you're going to get this game and you have an Xbox One / PS4...get it on the console. The PC version is highly buggy. For example, everytime you enter a battlezone where a big fight will happen, the time it takes for the game to introduce the characters to when you actually start fighting takes ridiculous amounts of excess time that just makes the game feel slow (if you did not understand that: when the characters jump onto the screen for battle, they remain static after they have done their showoff moves for around 10-15 seconds. This does not happen in the console version). Also, on a side note, the main boss is almost impossible to beat. The game unforutanely has many bosses that are under the guise of being challenging, but it turns out that they're just really, really cheap. Did you struggle to fight that humongous spirit boss in the beginning of the level? Rest assured, there will be 2 of them that you need to fight at the same time and they'll eclipse your camera, and also there will be environmental hazards.\n\nHowever, on the bright side:\nThe combat system is one of the best systems I've ever had the pleasure of playing.\nThe transition between each of the four elements is very smooth and fluid, and it makes it feel like you're the actual Avatar. It's really great. Also, when you're kicking butt in this game, it feels so amazing. You just feel like you're wrecking everyone, and when you're in the Avatar State it's just chaos.\n\nAll in all, throughout the bugs and stuff, the game is good.\n\n7.2/10","December 2, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn’t think it was possible but Bending seamlessly made the transition from animation to game. Every element feel unique and viable and while you can lean on your favourite the game gently encourages you to tactfully pick a style that better suits your opponents.\n\nWhile the foes you recalled from the show are faithfully rendered it’s the variety of enemies that is lacking, the mooks come in different colours to designate which type of attack they’ll use but there’s only a handful of them. Don’t look for surprises (well, until the end…), this game is as straightforward as Korra herself; keep punching and kicking till you’re the only one left standing.\n\nWhat stands out however is the game’s “soul”, this could’ve easily been an episode of the show, perhaps spread out over a two-partner of dare I say an actual Book, it’s great to see more of Korra fulfilling her duty as the Avatar and excelling at keeping the peace. Every part of the game feels like it was sketched by animators, the music is just as nostalgic and little things like Iroh’s shop where you can buy items to enhance Korra’s abilities are truly endearing.\n\nThe cherry on the top has to be addition of a Pro Bending minigame; if you ever dreamed of seeing how you’d fare in command of the Fire Ferrets well, here’s your chance. Platinum Games are masters of flamboyant combat and they don’t disappoint here; you block, weave and counter as you Bend your way to the top of leagues, there’s even a chance to fight the Wolf Bats!\n\nAll in all; if you’re a fan of the series and a decent gamer you can scrape buy on casual but lovers of 3D action games will find a small gem with a healthy layer of sheen and heart.\n\nWait till you experience the Avatar State, oh my…","November 17, 2014","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagiwan/recommended/281690/","kagiwan","kagiwan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagiwan/","3349 products in account","This game is an action/beat 'em up based on the Nickelodeon cartoon series, The Legend of Korra. It is centered towards fans of Platinum Games and fans of The Legend of Korra. If you're a fan of either or both, I would recommend you buy this game. Otherwise, wait for a sale.\n\nGameplayControls are simple, however, it is best played with a controller. Movement with Korra is fairly fluid, and canceling between attacks/dodges/jumps/counters is effortless because the window is very lenient. Despite this, the game is difficult enough that you can't just mash the same button over and over and get through the game. You will need to employ the use of counters and dodges to be successful, not to mention utilizing the appropriate element for the given situation. Counter-ing is done in a similar vain to the Batman Arkham games where the enemy turning red is your cue to press the counter/block button. As you play through the game, you gain spirit points which you can spend in the spirit shop to buy items/talismans/consumables that either provide a new move or augment your abilities. Sprinkled throughout the game are "Temple Run" segments where you ride Naga from point A to point B, dodging obstacles and collecting more spirit points. These are a good break from the fighting, however they aren't my cup of tea. Once you beat the story mode once, you gain access to Pro Bending, where it's a 3 vs 3 knock the opponents off the platform game mode. It's fun in it's own right, but still feels like it was tacked on. Overall though, I feel the main gameplay was a very god translation of the cartoon into game form.\n\nContentMy first time playthrough on normal was pretty difficult and I had to restart several times throughout. But, like other games, the more you play through, the more your eyes can get accustomed to seeing attacks better in order to counter or dodge. To get through the main story mode on normal takes about 4 hours, less if you're good at not dying and are willing to skip cutscenes. It took me about 15 hours to gain 100% achievements, which is pretty short IMO. But for a budget title, I can give the game slack and say those are adequate amounts of time for a game in this catagory.\n\nStoryThe story is throw away, despite being written by one of the show writers. It takes place between seasons 2 and 3 of the show. It was fine and believable until the end where I though the game just went too "anime" or "Naruto" on you. If you play through, you'll understand. I think the story just suffers from having to balance gameplay design/pacing and the story at the same time. If you're looking for more additional content about the world of The Legend of Korra, this isn't it. It doesn't bring anything new and only introduces a forgettable villain.\n\nGraphicsThe game runs at a maximum 1080p @ 60fps and is completely fine for me, since that is my default preference. However, for those few asking for more, the game sadly lacks in the graphics options department and you cannot surpass those caps. The graphic style is cel-shading, which I believe is completely fine, especially for games based on cartoons/anime. There are also cutscenes which are animated like the cartoon series, however they look a little off. Either they were drawn by a different studio or maybe it's the framerate...\n\nSoundThe same voice actors from the show were used in the game. However, the majority of the game is JUST Korra. You rarely hear any of the other characters. The music is also from the cartoon series and fits well during fights.\n\nOverall Impressions\nThings I liked:\n- The DMC/Bayonetta LITE gameplay.\n- The fluidity of movement and attack animations.\n- Voice acting and music.\n\nThings I hated:\n- The elements aren't balanced, fire and water felt weaker/less useful than earth and wind.\n- The main villain was forgettable and generically anime (voiced by none other than Steven Blum [tired of this guy])\n- The "Jill of all Trades" Achievement can be gotten once (make sure to complete this achievement the first time or you will have to restart your game all over).\n- Could've been longer, have had more options to tweak, and maybe had multiplayer modes (could have been limited by budget).\n- Dying over and over my first time around (this is a good thing, IMO, means it was fairly difficult)\n\nConclusionThis is a decent game and I'd recommend to either Platinum Games fans or The Legend of Korra fans. If you don't fall into either of those, I'd say wait for a sale or invest in another Platinum Games title that I'm sure has had a better budget *cough* Bayonetta 2 *cough*. However, it is safe to say this is the best game based on the Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra cartoon series.\n\nsource: 15+ hours, 100% achievements, and a fan of both Platinum Games/The Legend of Korra.","October 27, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I was not disappointed.\n\nThanks to Deep Silver it plays like a AAA title. Leveling up elements, buying and unlocking new combos, blocking and counter attacking? Everything's in there! Including the thing you always wanted to do: Being the friggin' Avatar and bending all the elements!\n\nI was a rather avid action adventure / beat 'em up player, but Korra's difficulty surprised me. You really got to keep a cool head, block and counter, otherwise your going down... and that was only NORMAL... so I'll have some "fun" playing extreme. :)\n\nGraphics-wise you'll feel the somewhat low budget. Background textures and level design are not too great but they definitely work. Assuming they wanted to make the game feel as close as possible like the cartoon, they accomplished that. It looks and feels like you play an episode or two of the cartoon. Also adding animated sequences especially made for the game is a nice treat.\n\nLastly the Pro-Bending. It's kind of an artificial game-time-lengthener, but it plays well. It just feels as fierce as the matches in the cartoon looked and the difficulties above rookie definitely will show you no mercy. Max out your waterbending or you'll be crushed! ;) A online multiplayer would have been amazing but I guess the budget wasn't enough. Maybe if this one sells well, there'll be another one like this? A bigger more adventurous one? Who knows?\n\nI'm totally biased towards the show, but trying to give it an objective score I'd say 8/10.\nThere are definitely things that could have been made better (graphics- and gameplay-wise) and probably people who don't know the show or cartoons in general won't be too interested in this game. But maybe Korra will get a bunch of new fans through this? Let's hope so!","October 28, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, does it disappoint me that the story isn't longer? Yes, but despite everything else, for 15 dollars, whether you like Legend of Korra or not, this game will grab you and take hold of you. With the different combinations you can do and the four different types of bendings, this game is limitless. I will honestly never get tired of this game, and it was 15 bucks!!!! Now that's a great game.","April 30, 2015","true","46.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TL;DR, it's a competent, brawly platformer that's light on story but has a great visual style and challenging gameplay. Despite a fair few issues, it's worth the low price.\n\nThe longer version:\nThe story will make no sense whatsoever if you've not seen the first two seasons of the TV show. Even if you have seen it, you'll be left disappointed by how shallow and meaningless it is. Now that the cartoons have finished (sadly, it seems, indefinitely), this is a "one last fix" that will scratch the itch for more Avatar, but never fully satisfy the addiction.\n\nThe combat is where the game shines, but try it on casual difficulty first. On normal, it becomes punishing and frustrating when you just can't get that millisecond chance to counter an incoming attack. Over and over again. For a full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour.\n\nThe game takes frequent breaks from the scrapping to play a Temple Run-style minigame where you ride Naga (a giant Polar Bear/Dog hybrid) through the streets of Republic City. I hated these sections; your mileage may vary.\n\nTo conclude, the game's low price point reflects it's limitations. Worth a play if you've not quite got over the TV show yet, but safe to skip otherwise.","December 23, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, they might be very disappointed because their favorite characters might not be in the game (I don't know if that might of been a minor spoiler to some people or not). This is a low-budget game but I think that graphics fit well with the cartoon.\n\nLAYOUT OF GAME:\nThe enemies are pretty casual and I don't understand why some certain enemies would appear in certain places. In addition, some cutscenes are all that exiting or necessary. Sometimes, the game is a good way to deal with stress because of how many times you can beat up enemies in an awesome and rewarding way.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nWhat I like the best is that I get to be the bender in the Legend of Korra world and I find that very fun since I've watched the cartoon.

I'll discuss with the pros and cons of what brought me to this rating.\n\nPros: Graphics 8.5/10\nThe developers did a very good job and making the art of the game feel like it was the TV show's animation. It was very impressive and sort of nostalgic to see a beloved series/franchise brought to life. Granted this game was no graphics intensive piece of work, but the graphics to do not make the game.\nVoice Over 10/10\nThe Avatar franchise has done a very good job in casting their voice over team. However I feel like where they missed an opportunity for this game was by limiting the characters we all know and love in the series from being present in the story, however that's a point to be made in the story section of this review. Overall the voice actors did an amazing job at transferring their characters into this video game.\nAnimations 8/10\nCould I have put this in with graphics? Yeah I probably could, but it's the attention to detail that matters here. Being a martial artist of sorts, it was really cool to see each bending style be distincly different. All of the fighting stances were different and displayed the influence of the martial art that the particular bending style was using. The move sets played off of that as well which made it pretty cool to watch your combos as you switched between the elements.\n\nCons: Game Mechanics 5/10\nThis may just be me but I feel like the controls for this game weren't as smooth as they could have been. This can especially be said for the Pro-Bending mode, I felt like I struggled the most on the opening level with the Pro-Bending match than I did for the regular platforming levels. I am also going to account for the difficulty mode in this. When I first played this I set the difficulty to Normal, over the other choice which was Casual. The difficulty here was not what I expected and found myself being more frustrated at a "Normal" difficulty than I really shoul have been, and because of this I feel as if my enjoyment of the game was greatly hindered.\nStory 5/10\nFor both series, The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra, the story telling has been nothing short of amazing. The stories that were told were very well done, there were great themes, twists, and cliffhangers that kept the audience waiting for the next episode, and made us all sad when the a series had to eventually come to an end. That being said I feel like the story for this game was dry. It was short (8 chapters), which did not give them a lot of time to develop the story that took place between in between the seasons of the TV show. They had so many character they could have utilized and yet they left them out. The two characters that dominate the dialogue were Korra and Jinora. The rest of the usual cast either speak very briefly are never seen again, or remain absent from the story entirely. I feel like this was a huge missed opportunity.\n\nAll that being said, yes the game is not the best nor is will probably win any awards. However if you are a big fan of the Avater universe the game is pretty fun once you get the hang of it. The game is a pretty fun beat 'em up type of platformer and for the price, $14.99, I did not feel the least bit cheated. Could they have done better? For sure. Will they learn from this and develop more Avatar based games? I hope so. Overall I rate the game a 7/10 and reccomend to Avatar fans who have some left over money.\n","December 23, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To everyone else, I don't recommend this game. You really do get what you pay for. Metal Gear Rising is a much better game and chances are you can pick it up for just as cheap. Everything about this game screams budget title.\n\nMechanically the game is average. Combos are very simple and there are only a handful of command moves. The camera is alright most of the time but against larger enemies or up against tall walls, the camera will position itself poorly and it will often cost you. Targeting is ok. The auto lock on works most of the time, really only getting confused against enemies at range.\n\nVisually the game isn't very impressive. The cell shaded graphics are average. If you're familiar with the show you'll recognise some of the enemy designs. Compared to other games in the genre, the enemy designs are dull. Same can be said about the environments.\n\nThere's roughly 4-5 hours worth of content, 10 if you're willing to play again at the highest difficulty. Pro-bending mode is very shallow, and requires you to grind bending levels in the story mode to improve performance there. The story is a throw away. Nothing is developed.\n\nEverything about this game screams budget title. It's hard to look past the repetitive enemies, the bland levels, the bad plot, when the gameplay is mediocre.

The game mostly distances itself from the TV show plots with a completely new antagonist - which is welcome and good for newcomers of the series.\n\nThe game plays out as a fighter of sorts, although there is collecting and various minigames to be done as well. The game is also very replayable, with different difficulty levels and game modes unlocked after you progress through one round of the game.\n\nAs before I say the game isn't perfect, as there are some decidedly high difficulty spikes at times, but regardless I absolutely adore this game, and if you're interested in Platinum, the Korra series or just a good video game in general, you should definitely pick this up.

Don't go in expecting a 60 dollar AAA title and you will not be disappointed. The game is geared towards fans of the show and on that I believe it delivers. The story is mostly non-existent (what is there does not make a lot of sense), there aren't as many combos as there could be, the worlds occasionally feel a bit 'empty' aside from enemies. So there are flaws and it could be improved.\n\nAbove all though it's just... fun. You will be challenged. In fact I recommend playing with the 1/2 health 2x exp and 1/2 attack 2x exp items. They will increase the challenge and the reward. There may be fights you need to redo repeatedly as you figure out the best strategy to win. There is an extreme mode available once you beat the game as well. I have beaten extreme mode as well, it's mostly a fun challenge. Except for one section where you it takes hundreds of hits to kill the enemy but if they hit you once you will die. I spent a good 2-3 hours of my 15 hour play time just getting past that section in extreme mode (which is relatively easier in normal mode)\n\nThe pro-bending matches are also pretty fun. The matches do take skill, and Mako and Bolin are usually not as good as the enemy AI even at MAX bending levels (though occasionally they do save your butt).\n\nThere are quite a few unlockables in the game and the trophies are not ridiculous to get so if you've got 15 bucks and you like Avatar then I highly recommend this game.","October 29, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a nice game to play next to the main games you're playing, for a little break from the main one.\n\nEven though the story of the game is really short ( 8 chapters), the game offers some other modes post game. The controls of the game is quite good, it's not like a button smash game, you really do have to block/counter to get further into the game.\n\nSo if you like a fast paced and short game, then you should definitely get it.\n\n8/10","January 12, 2015","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not perfect, but given it's price, it's hardly a bad game - I'd definitely recommend if you catch it on sale.\n\nCombat is fairly decent, and quite fun against groups of standard enemies.  The difficulty curve however is quite high between standard fights and boss fights.  Bosses even on the 'middle' difficulty (hardest available at start) require lots of timed dodges, blocks and counters rather than all out attacks - non-human bosses are impossible to beat without countering, so if you hate the type of game that requires a lot of it, you're not going to have a fun time with this.  Fights against standard enemies are quite fun however, and once you unlock and upgrade the other elements, combat becomes quite enjoyable against hordes of enemies.\n\nNaga levels are well... meh\n\nVisually, the game does a great job of replecating the art style and some of the attacks from the show.\n\nStory wise, the beginning is a bit cliche - protagonist loses powers, has to relearn them, etc. etc. - however, endgame is rather satisfying and fits fairly well with the existing Avatar universe and lore.  Could have used a few occasional cameos from a few primary and tertiary characters (possibly as backup in fights like in the show) to spice up the story/gameplay/cutscenes a little.\n\nPro-bending mode is quite fun, and is fairly challenging on the highest difficulty.  However, it would have been nice if there was an included arcade fight mode, where you could fight relentless hordes of enemies and see how high you could chain your combos.\n\nOverall, not a perfect game, but a solid game that will be enjoyable for fans of the franchise.","January 11, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To everyone else, I don't recommend this game. You really do get what you pay for. Metal Gear Rising is a much better game and chances are you can pick it up for just as cheap. Everything about this game screams budget title.\n\nMechanically the game is average. Combos are very simple and there are only a handful of command moves. The camera is alright most of the time but against larger enemies or up against tall walls, the camera will position itself poorly and it will often cost you. Targeting is ok. The auto lock on works most of the time, really only getting confused against enemies at range.\n\nVisually the game isn't very impressive. The cell shaded graphics are average. If you're familiar with the show you'll recognise some of the enemy designs. Compared to other games in the genre, the enemy designs are dull. Same can be said about the environments.\n\nThere's roughly 4-5 hours worth of content, 10 if you're willing to play again at the highest difficulty. Pro-bending mode is very shallow, and requires you to grind bending levels in the story mode to improve performance there. The story is a throw away. Nothing is developed.\n\nEverything about this game screams budget title. It's hard to look past the repetitive enemies, the bland levels, the bad plot, when the gameplay is mediocre. Play Metal Gear Revengence or Devil May Cry instead.","December 24, 2014","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
