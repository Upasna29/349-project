I enjoyed my romp through the a panzer general-esque fantasy world.","May 21, 2015","true","16.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Not a game for anyone but excellent to those to want challenging battles and strategical planning of controlling many different units with vastly different abilities having to fullfil specific goals under limitations (number of turns).\nFactors from cover, ground type, unit type/abilities affect the outcome of the battles between unit pairs.\nLeveling heroes and units by adding skills and using artifacts add a light RPG element to the game.\n\nWith respect to difficulty it is quite easier than the original Elven Legacy, getting all missions with gold rating is not super difficult.\nI have to disagree with some reviewers, once you understand the strategic rules of the game it is not too difficult.\n\nDrawbacks: rather mediocre graphics and definitely not tailored to a casual player.","January 1","true","35.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Especially for the price.\n\nNote that this new campaign is clearly easier than Elven Legacy.","January 13","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd like to see someone pass a level without cheating. I'll bet it's impossible. Not sure why they made this game for Koreans only.","February 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 47 people (13%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","13","6","47","6","4"
