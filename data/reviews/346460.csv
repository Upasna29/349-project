This isn't your regular racer.  In this game, you'll fly instead of drive.  Hopefully.  If you're driving, you're doing it wrong.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 8/10\n\nIs this game worth your money?  Yes.  I rate my steam games by how often my heartrate rises above 100 beats per minute, because those are the games that are the most exciting.  This game's gameplay consists of you feeling like a pro while you race over the planes of Mars, and then feeling like an idiot as you narrowly (read: by a hair's breadth) miss a pile of rocks.  The latter occurs more the faster you try to fly.\n\nThe gameplay is a blend of traditional racers with realistic physics and the ability to trade alitude for airspeed and vice-versa.  Vector 36 FEELS like a traditional racer with just a little bit more depth to it.  It also runs slower than traditional racers, allowing you to savor the feeling of catching up to your foes.  This draws out the chase & pass sequences rather than leaving them down to some cheap pass-on-the-inside-of-the-corner ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is what you'd see in a traditional racer.\n\nThe graphics aren't Dices' Battlefront quality, but you don't notice that once you begin racing.  The gameplay is so good that it draws you in past its graphics and into the race.  Vector 36 is immersive WITHOUT lifelike graphics, and that's pretty damn admirable.  I should note that I'm playing on a GTX 650, so to be honest I haven't experienced Vector 36's true graphics quality.\n\nSound: nothing to report.  It's good.  Excellent, in fact.  Sounds realistic.  Adds to the immersion.\n\nLook, point is, it's good.  You'll enjoy it.  And it's only going to keep getting better.  So...\n\nARE YOU READY FOR A STRATEGIC RACER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS?\n\nDO YOU THIRST FOR SOME ♥♥♥-CLENCHINGLY TIGHT TURNS, SOME OF WHICH YOU DON'T ACTUALLY PULL OFF?\n\nIS IT YOUR DREAM TO BE TOO GREEDY AND DROP TO LAST AFTER CRASHING INTO A CHECKPOINT BECAUSE YOU TRIMMED YOUR SKIMMER TO FLY TOO LOW?\n\nARE YOU THE KIND OF PERSON WHO CONTINUES TO RACE EVEN AFTER YOUR ENGINES CATCH FIRE?\n\nDO YOU WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT WONDERING WHY ALINA LI'S SKIMMER IS SOMEHOW PERPETUALLY BETTER THAN YOURS?\n\nIS THE POPE CATHOLIC?!\n\nTHEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!","November 12, 2015","true","16.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","21","27","10","0"

Try it with steam VR or oculus if you get a chance, it's INSANE. Especially when you're going 1000kph, 10 feet off the ground, through clouds of flaming debris, and just barely clipping your wings(?) on the cliffs.\n\nI found myself spending more and more time customizing my skimmers once I realized I could make them look and fly pretty much however I want. For higher speed races, it becomes a whole challenge in itself to basically make the fastest manned rocket possible that can still be steered. The interplay of engineering and skill required is really unique, and even though it's only single player right now, the bots are surprisingly competitive. It definitely takes some mastering.\n\nOverall it's showing tons of promise... especially for a one-man development team. It's still in the early stages so hopefully we'll see more and more variety down the road.

I keep it short and focus only on points that make this game special to me:\n\nthe physics and the controls are great, the handling is nuanced, complex and, yeah, I assume: realistic. though it's all science fiction, it really is a simulation.\nthat makes the game hard and unforgiving at the beginning - the learning curve is really pretty steep. but once you get the hang of the controls and learn how to build a skimmer that's to your liking, racing it becomes just glorious.\n\nwhat does racing actually mean? compared to driving a car, the controls are sluggish and imprecise. once something is brought into motion, the momentum keeps it going to certain degree. unnecessary inputs spiral out of control fast, so you really need a light touch, a fluid way of conducting. also: foresight, patience and confidence. if this sounds like a stark contrast to moving through canyons with 1000+kph, that's because it is. that's the main attraction! elegantly turn in for a corner, rotate your nose in the new direction while going sideways at full speed, missing the cliff in front of you by only a hair. crazy on the screen, but try it with a VR set!\n\nchange in difficulty comes mostly with speed (five classes), but upgrading to a faster machine doesn't necessarily make slower racing less interesting, thanks to the great feeling of the game.\ntuning and modifying the machine is relatively intuitive and cause and effect seem mostly logical to me. I have spent hours over hours tinkering and tuning my racers, and I'm still a long way from grasping even half of what lies in the details.\nthe futuristic parts and their functionality aren't too far out, it's science fiction, but very close to present day real life.\n~\nI play this game on gnu/Linux (the reason why I found it in the first place), where it runs beautifully  - the performance looks to be better than on win 7 right now, for whatever reasons. playing with a DK2 is incredible, the game is made with VR in mind and it really shows, it's really a must have for VR owners.\n\nRed River Studious is easy to reach via the boards, bugfixes come quickly and with good success. a total pro show, that, and a good indication for future support and content.\n~\ncan compare elements of this game to: F-Zero, WipeOut, Slipstream 5000, Solar Jetman, SW pod racer, Richard Burns Rally\n~\nthat's it, thanks for reading.\nbest,\nMichael\n\n","May 11","true","96.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"

It features races across vast, open landspaces in 5 different speed tiers, kinda like the races in star wars.\n\nIn most racing games you can only steer left + right. In Vector 36 you can also stear up and down + vertically, which also makes the game really challenging and somewhat hard to learn (at first). All skippers also drift alot if you want to turn, which gives it a great feeling.\n\nThe lower you fly, the faster you are able to skip across the surface, but it is also more dangerous. This is also a great way to prevent people from just flying around freely.\n\nYou are able to manage your energy distribution in real time while you are racing. Energy is distributed between stabilizators (lift) and engine power. That means the more energy the engine gets, the more challenging it is to get a stable flight. For example, if you set the engine to 100%, you wont even able to jump above a small hill while setting the engines to 20%, you wont even notice the hill because it will auto adjust the height. This will also affect your turn radius.\n\nBecause of this, you are constantly adjusting your power management.\n\nBy doing races you get money and are able to buy new skippersl You can also customize your own vehicle, by buying different parts for your skipper. No multiplayer yet, but it is planned\n\nI can realy recommend it if you want a realistic star wars pod racer style game, but I cant realy recommend it for casual gamers, because the game is very hard to learn and first speed tier is realy slow.\n\ni give it 9 of 10 points.","March 18","true","22.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerake/recommended/346460/","kerake","Kerake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerake/","35 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you like racing games more oriented to the simulation side where you can adjust mostly every little aspect of your racing machine, then you should try this. Vector 36 sets you in a terraformed Mars, where pilots use their racing machines (called Skimmers) to compete on the circuits of the surface of Mars. These Skimmers are hover machines that you can adjust and fine tune to the millimeter. The game is fully physics driven and offers a very complete garage where you can modify your Skimmers, starting from the angles of every lift to configuring even the force and direction of each of them, all in an intuitive way. If you don’t want to wrap your head around all this, that’s fine too! The game has 3 basic Skimmers from different manufacturers that you can purchase and use them as is and they will work perfectly. You have 6 more customized ones in the shop too, so you have where to choose. The game has 6 circuits right now and an array of special races, like weight or engine power limitations, so definitely there is a nice amount of content from the start (and it will just keep growing!). On top of that, this game has support for the VR headsets, which will make your experience even more enjoyable!\n\nSo, in conclusion, this game is a little gem that deserves more attention and is a good example of how early access games should be done. From the start, it’s perfectly playable and has a nice amount of content for it’s price tag, not like others that aren’t even playable after months of being released on Steam. The game is constantly in development and have regular updates, so I totally recommend Vector 36!","March 7","true","60.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

My real playtime at this time should be somewhere around 8 hours.\n\n--------------\n\nI recommend this game first and foremost, because it is so incredibly unique: The flight model the developer came up with is just that different from everything I've tried before and it really works.\n\nIt's really hard to put in words how frustrating it is in the beginning ramming yourself into the ground and, even after a relatively short while, how satisfying it is to actually manage to improve your performance in small steps and actually manage to fly really fast.\n\nThe developer is responsive, and even though some of his forum posts replying to my bug reports or questions were a bit unsatisfying (sometimes sounding like: 'There is not much I can do about it.') he ultimately solved all problems I've had with the game.\n\nThe visuals don't look that special and the menues are actually pretty ugly. They DO work for getting into races, but IMHO there is still a lot of work to be done ... especially when trying to customize my vehicles while wearing a VR headset. This is definitely still early access.\n\nWhat actually is there however is the incredibly feeling of speed and the phenomenal feeling of control ... and the 'kick' when you try to improve your laptimes a bit, struggling against loosing said control in the process. The flight model is just THAT DAMN GOOD, that I just had to use caps, because, as I've said before: It's hard to put into words how incredibly satisfying this game feels when you are actually racing.\n\nIf you own a compatible VR headset: Buy this game!\n(It might or might not be worth a purchase without a VR HMD. I can't tell since the experience is just so amazing with VR, that I couldn't even force myself to try it without. ;) )","April 11","true","3.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's more like designing and racing your own Formula 1 lunar lander, then always pushing it to fly better than the last race. You're always fine-tuning and balancing your skimmer. Deciding whether you want it to naturally thrust up, down or centre, and placing parts in ways that keep you from listing to the left or right.\n\nThe racing itself is an intense mixture of speed (in the later leagues) and straining to keep your skimmer under control (from the very start). You start off racing slow but that lets you hone your skill as a pilot. It's like learning to drive a car on ice, then allowing it to fly. Play with a controller for better accuracy but you'll have to switch to keyboard and mouse for menus.\n\nThis game is very nearly complete and worth every penny.","January 22","true","12.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is pretty unique as far as racing games go, as it has both believable physics and hovercraft, which are not normally found together.\n\nIn Vector 36 you can construct your own Skimmers, which are what the craft are called.  Construction requires you to consider balance between power and stability, as well as actual balance, as center of gravity and thrust will affect the performance of the craft.  I have found few games go to this level of physics as far as customization, it's not just how big of an engine you can stick on the ship, but where it is put and how it is angled.\n\nI have only recently tried the VR aspect myself, as I only just now recieved a VR headset.  I have played on a monitor until now and I must say that it is a completely different experience in VR, and I personally loved flying around in the cockpit in 3D, it felt much more immersive being able to actually appreciate the inside of my skimmer for the first time.\n\nI don't do number scores for games as I really never know exactly how to quantify it, but I personally recommend this game to any fans of sci-fi and racing simulators.","May 19","true","23.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The builder system is a nice concept where you can mix and match a small range of parts to create a racer to compete in higher leagues, not quite an armored core range of parts but this is an early stage. Racing rewards risk taking, such as adjusting the 'bias' which basically means you will go faster but at the cost of maneuvering and altitude. I love the concept of this game and even at this early stage it is my go-to VR experience. I was surprised at how easy it was to plug in my X55 and Vive an start playing within minutes, a luxury that even large games struggle with. The soundtrack fits really well with the game play giving a nice escape from the sounds of thrusters.\n\nThe Bad\nWhilst the ability to customize your skimmer down to the balance of the thrusters is great the garage needs to be improved before I and others can use it properly, trying to alter the power distribution sliders in VR is horrible, I want 80% power not 78% or 82%. There is no formal guide as to recommended tactics when making your skimmer although the dev does have some (older) videos on YouTube and there is a discussion section on the community hub, I personally found that 10 hours into the game it all starts to make sense, but some people don't have 10 hours to sink into a game (although if you bought a HMD I suspect you do). Final point - this is an early access game with DLC, the dev has argued that he sees the DLC as a luxury that not all users will need which I can mostly understand, but I sincerely hope that we don't see any Payday 2, Call of duty or other cash grabbing DLC installments in the future.\n\nThis is shaping up to be a really fun game and if the VR garage problems along with the complexity factors can be worked on I see this being an even better game.\n\nEdit 1: Other points after further time with game + Spellcheck","May 17","true","16.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Don't have a lighter handy? Have some harddrive space handy instead? Here's your solution.\n\nEh, if you want a tweaker racing game you're better off playing Nascar. While this is certainly very interesting, there's very little to add to the value of the game right now. The Dev has also decided to shill out some nonsense for some human dollars in pre-alpha DLC, so take that for what you will.\n\nBut what is Vector 36? Its fantastic, when it wants to be. The racing feels like you're podracing without midichlorians and whiney child-actors. A single wrong move will splatter your dumb carcass over the nearest rock and the race will end for you in the sense there's no way you'd be able to catch up. You get repaired by a little drone-thing mid-race if you do lose some parts, which is nice, but you have to wait for it to start paying attention, then find your broken parts strewn across the landscape, then weld it back roughly where it went before.\n\nWether or not it works after you're 'repaired' is entirely up to how many radiators you strapped on to begin with, and how many work after crashing.\n\nPROS:\n> Its fun to go 700+ mph\n\n> Its fun to mess with the AI racers, even if they tend to follow exactly the same line of movement. I like slamming into their radiors and watching them slowly burn up when they break off.\n\n> Its fun to watch the AI crash and burn around a simple corner\n\n> Its fun to build your skimmer\n\n\nCONS:\n> Its not fun slamming into a wall at 700+ mph because you don't have a perfectly tuned skimmer and it turns out you lose all steering above or below a certain speed and 'bias', which is the ratio between the lift thrusters and the forward thrusters.\n\n> Its not fun to grind through the same race over and over again to get the next part or chassis, especially considering the AI have better parts and go faster by default because of this, nevermind their near perfect piloting against your unexperianced hands\n\n> Its not fun to pay $4.50 of your human dollars for a few garage slots in an alpha game that already asks for a lump sum of $17.00.\n\n\nI'll recommend it, but only for the promise of future development and my lust for a true death-race style game that has good tweaking. Not if you want a finished product, for obvious reasons.","December 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

A unique experience on the Vive. I can't belive its made by just one person. I actually like this racing experience better than Project Cars in VR, although they are quite different and the comparison isn't really fear. Anyway, buy this game if you have a VR headset, play the tutorials (hidden in the race menu) and have a blast! I still have some stuttering, but the developer is working hard on it and has made it a lot better, so I think he will make it perfect in the end. Seems it's good for most people with worse specs than mine (gtx 980ti). And even as it is I'll recommend it wholeheartly.","May 25","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got this and holy crap did this game make me nauseous. Not only that but it was buggy and crashy as hell. The tutorial was super poorly done as well. Am I missing something before I refund this?\n\nEdit:  Like the first time I opened it, it was just solid black screen for a while. So I restarted. Every once in a while in the game it will just fade into my steam VR background screen and fade back in for no apparent reason. Lots of weird flickering and weird stuff.\n\nWhen loading into different screens it will just go black some times. Other than that though, turning sharp just makes me so sick. blech.\n\nRefunding this.  Sorry.  Can't recommend.

The vehicle you get to start with is slow. It handles like some bricks tied onto a kite. You get $3000 or so for finishing the tutorials. You need many tens of thousands to make a better vehicle, and you have to sit there and hold down keys to "accelerate" (for a really really really bad definition of accelerate) and steer your bricky kite through hours and hours of slowness just to get enough to buy parts or a pre-made vehicle. If you want to do anything at all to your vehicle in the garage, you have to deal with one of the most horrible UIs ever made. The "game" should never have been published in this state. To all devs everywhere: Early Access does not mean pre-Alpha. You should have something in a playable and fun state before you start asking for money.","December 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"

Vehicle handles in everyway it is not supposed to. My ♥♥♥ starts to hurt because i have been testing new settings for two hours. Im getting really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.
