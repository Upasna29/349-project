Also, they didn't take one small thing from all the other MMO's.. A Public Testing Server.. As obvious as it might seem, that's something these money hungry developer's either didn't consider or just plain over looked due to costs / labor.\n\nThere's been a cheating problem since the beginning and there will always be a cheater problem because instead of investing in an actual anti-cheat (Their current one is FairFight and it records statistics, all in-game bans are done by hand.) I seriously recommend you not play this unless you plan on cheating yourself because that is the only way you'll ever survive, unless you're actually somewhat decent at FPS's, which,  in that case, be prepared to be banned at random times because a streamer or someone well known in the community said you cheated.\n\nIn the beginning, the developers stole their terms of service from League of Legends, banned people at random times to scare off cheaters (their version of an anti-cheat), and used fake screenshots which resulted in the game originally being pulled from steam. (Seriously.) It's for some reason been allowed back onto steam, and I believe everyone should know of this games terrible past and know that it's not changed one bit. Sergey Titov "OP Productions, LLC. CEO" (Previously known as Hammerpoint Productions) even went as far as to lie in interviews about this game, and delete any comments or reviews that said otherwise.\n\nPlayers who requested a refund originally were reported and blacklisted from the website which then caused them to have international troubles making any further purchases for anything, even things not involved with online games, I.E. General online shopping..\n\nTaken directly from a mod who previously worked for Hammerpoint / OP Productions\n\nhttp://leviathyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/t6F9c.jpg (Source - http://www.leviathyn.com/news/2012/11/29/the-warz-team-blacklists-customers-asking-for-refunds-and-gets-blasted-by-ex-mod/ )\n\nAvoid this game at all costs.","October 3, 2014","false","547.1"," 2,149 of 2,281 people (94%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","94","149","2","98","40"

It's pretty simple. At first you have to get an inspiration. To find it you will need a popular game. Cool ! You have selected Day Z ! Now, create a badly detailed terrain and add some villages which look almost exactly the same. Ok, now take all of the bugs that exist in Day Z and add them to the game. Well, we already have a bad looking glitched map ! Now it's time for some gameplay. Create a typical american character, put some badass clothes on it, make him muscular, add a cool face expression and steal all the animations from Fallout 3 just to make it look like a cowshit. Don't forget that you have to let this guy shoot and wear some armor ! You just have to place deadly military weapons all over the map. Especially in supermarkets ! Everyone knows that a real supermarket should offer a good shotgun next to BBQ accesories. Now, when your character is able to run around with a submachine gun you have to place some targets. Exactly ! Spawn thousands of zombies which must be as glitched as the map (it has to create a perfect composition) and make their corpses bulletproof. Good job ! Now your map is filled with supernatural people living after death who can't get killed after 2000 shots in the torso but they die after a one punch in the head by a flashlight ! Now it's the time for the final spice, a cherry at the top of a cake ! It's time for a Pay 2 Win model. There is no such a thing that would make this game even worse than a Pay 2 Win model. A market with dozens of overpowered weapons which you are able to buy for real money ! That's what we need ! Congratulations ! You've just made an another useless game ! Keep on going with such projects ! Community will appreciate the effort that you've put in this project !","April 2, 2015","false","13.4"," 1,176 of 1,285 people (92%) found this review helpful 806 people found this review funny","92","176","1","806","29"

There is an enormous amount of cheating going on, and the ban waves regularly ban non-cheaters. If I had to guess my Kill to Death ratio was somewhere around 1 to 10, if not worse- but I was scooped up in a ban wave as well.\n\nIt uses an automated ban system, and they do not use any active moderation for banning. The notorious aimbot sites like artificial are still selling functional cheats that cannot be detected, so their only solution to this was banning anyone who has been reported.\n\nI was playing on a stream where it was visible I was not cheating and was still banned. Let that be a warning to other people looking to play this...... "game". I submitted a request to have my ban investigated, three months later I still had not received any word back.\n\nUnfortunately I was stupid enough to pay 5$ for the in game currency to purchase one of the survivors. Several friends who also paid for in game content were "caught" in the ban waves. No way to fight it, no refunds. Let that speak for itself.\n\nAs you can see I had over 155~ hours in the game, and I tried very hard to give it a fair chance. There were a lot of good core ideas, but in the end it's a very poor attempt to cash in on DayZ popularity with no respect for the player base.","December 25, 2013","false","155.2"," 459 of 500 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","459","500","0","7"

It's absolutely horrible, though. The devs took a great idea that had so much potential and... well, turned it to crap basically. Let's start our review off with the Graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't special or anything. They're just your average everyday video game graphics. Next up, the gameplay. Well, like I said, great idea turned to crap. You can explore a large open-world (if you don't crash within the first 5 minutes of joining a server), which has a wide array of locations from cities to abandoned shacks in the forest. You can explore these areas in hope of finding basic supplies, such as food, water, and health. Once you have the basics covered, you can begin looking for more things that aren't nessecary, but make the game alot easier, such as weapons and armor. Of course, being a zombie survival game, the thing contains zombies. In my short time playing the game, I found zombies teleporting around, spotting you from miles away, and attacking you when they weren't even near you. With the help of microtransactions, you can buy points to use in an in-game store (which kinda ruins the whole survival aspect). I don't know if this was fixed from the time I played, but if you bought points and your character dies, the points "die" with the character. Just imagine buying 15 dollars worth of digital credits, only for a zombie to bite you a second after the purchase- 15 dollars down the drain. The replayability would be high, considering you have an urge to play everytime you die and improve. But, because of the state of the game, this factor is significantly lowered. The soundtrack isn't that good. It feels like it was rushed and stuffed into the game, and sometimes tracks play when they're not supposed to. For example, I killed a zombie, and the battle theme kept playing. I checked the area and about 10 minutes later, the track kept playing. Then, of course, it stopped playing right as I entered a real battle.\nOverall, I would just say don't get it and save your money for something better. I apologize for being repetitive, but, again, great idea turned into crap.\nGraphics: 7/20\nStory: (Since this game doesn't really have a story, I'm not gonna count this section.)\nGameplay: 3/20\nReplayability: 4/20\nSoundtrack: 3/20\nOverall: 17/80\n\nLate Edit: Apparently the game has improved or at least changed a bit since the last time I played it, forever ago. So I'm gonna get a few more hours with the game and judge it on it's current state.","November 27, 2013","false","2.5"," 2,744 of 3,333 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","744","3","0","21"

Also, it states that customer support will not help with your account because they THOUGHT I was cheating so thats cool.

There for a while it was definitely a pay to win game. Wait what am i saying it is still a P2W game!! You buy GC which tansfers into zombie cash to buy armor/ammo/meds/attachments and in the end instead of spending hours of looting you can spend 5 minutes and $50.00 to get all the loot you want instead of actually looting. I'd put money on it that sooner or later HP will make guns able to be bought for GC/ZC.They said they wouldn’t do that but it  will happen. They don’t hold their word on anything and they constantly allow their game to go on sale and that feeds the hackers and hackers feed on our hard earned loot. Hackers right now run the game. They patch every two weeks and their patches consists of fixes for the previous patch they put out at the last minute! So in the end they screw one thing up that took them two weeks to make and the next patch actually fixes the previous weeks patch.\n\nThe Devs in the game only care about theirselves. No I didn’t get banned so you can’t say that im salty becasue of a ban i do still play the game just not as much. i used to play at least 8 hours a day and spent hundreds of dollars on this game. I’m just letting people know that it’s not worth their $15.00. BUT if the game goes on sale for 4.00 again which I’m sure it will here soon as they are probably running low on cash then you guys should buy it then and only then.

I would like to discuss game mechanics or game play, but there isn't any. You get a character with horrible and in some cases barely responsive controls, so you can glitch around a horrible world design. I was in  situation where I couldn't jump over 1 foot fence, but I had no problem walking over and on top of people.\n\nFight mechanics... HA! You will spend hours just watching what seems to be a 2 frame motion of your character moving his hand up and down.... up and down... up and down ... until you or the attacker drop. There really is no game here. They use the term "Open World" to hide the fact that they didn't ( or couldn't) make such a broken world work for anything else. It really feels like a failed project that original programmer abandon and gave to someone with less skill to develop. I have seen school kids make a better game then this using a free game maker in ONE DAY!\n\nBut wait, THERE IS MORE! Act now and you will get their version of Punk Buster Service added to your computer. It takes up room, it's always on using up your bandwidth and overheating your CPU and.... you can't uninstall it even if you run as an administrator! TRUE! Strangely enough this awful blight they required me to install on my system so I can play this horrible game, DOES NOT WORK! I've seen people spawn weapons, ammo, unlimited health and such with no problem. But if server you are playing on is updating you will get booted and logged as a cheater. Also, if your time on the server is different or daylight saving time comes on, or your ping shoots up, or you run another program, or you try to listen to music, or windows update, or you don't have the new windows update, or you receive an e-mail on your open browser, or any other random reason you will get booted and sent message that Punk Buster caught you cheating. Oh, did I mention you can't uninstall it?\n\nThis is not a game. This is just a money grab for this company. They hope they will get enough people to build a community so the game keeps going due to people, because they know they got nothing. That's why they invested more effort in marketing of this game instead of developing it. It came out in 2012 and still has the same issues!\n\nWe should all start a petition to include this game on Norton or Kaspersky virus lists, so before you can download it your computer stops you from making this mistake and erase it for you.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME! EVER! Your money would be better spent on getting a tattoo on a side of bleeding haemorrhoid!\nDO NOT INSTALL EVEN IF IT'S FREE!\n\nMOVE ALONG! NOTHING TO SEE HERE!\n\n\n\n","November 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 106 of 116 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","106","116","12","1"

Graphics that make Crysis 3 look like Mario Bros, really smooth gameplay and animations. What really makes this magnificent is the concept of microtransactions, even though I already payed for the game, I feel as though the devs need to be rewarded even further by giving them more of my hard earned money for really useful stuff such as hats. What also really improves gameplay is that it is pay to win, greatly improves the overall experience. Worst game I have ever had the misfortune of playing 10/10.

DON'T COMMENT IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE!\n\nInfestation: Survivor Stories; original The War Z, the worst game created currently.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are terribly made, the animation is worse than Diablo 1 back then and they run like in Diablo 1. My i7-3770k 4,0 GHz CPU can't handle this game, my GPU is a GeForce GTX670 4GB Tri-Force, and i have FPS drops. Even Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag is running better.\n\nSound\n\nThe gunweapons sound like recorded with a phone instead of something better out there. Zero atmosphere, i feel like a zombie, not a survivor. The steps are giving me issues.\n\nGameplay\n\nInfestation: Hacker Stories is a better term for this game. The weapons are poor and unbalanced and it's the worst of all Zombiesurvivals. If i run around, from place to place over miles, without a car or anything, i could go AFK run and cry myself into a pillow why i actually bought the game. DayZ had good places around, but this is hilarious. But if you got something, nope, you die.\n\nOh, if you jump 2 feet down, you lose half of your health points, for no reason.\n\nCommunity\n\nI rather play Call of Duty on XBoX and i don't own one. People tend to kill each other, which is allowed, but they run braindead around and spawncamp with snipers. No fun allowed guys!\n\nEnd\n\nYeah, 10/10 would not buy. I wasted 27 US-Dollar back in the day and got my money back, because it's a simple fraud. But to warn you guys, it is the worst game around, the Metascore is a bloodier red than a menstruation.

This game is 10 pounds of nope in a five pound bag. Anything that could've  been done wrong, was. The developers must have intentionally looked at every aspect of a good zombie survival game and purposely messed it up. The zombies are no threatening in the slightest, however in order to get into any city you have sprint through HUNDREDS of them. Some of the cities can only be accessed by bridge, where you'll find zombies flowing like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from ♥♥♥♥ Cheney's mouth. They lied about content and were temporarily removed from the steam market. They lied about the existence of vehicles. The main threat in the game is players, who will bait you like there's no tomorrow, but eve if you're 20 miles into the middle of nowhere, the map is so small that there's guarunteed to be someone sitting with a sniper rifle watching you at every moment. Back to the cities, if you even manage to get into one there is next to no loot there. I once searched a city for over an hour and found ONE ammo clip on the roof of an apartment building. You'll realize your mistake in buying this game not even 5 minutes after starting it up. There are a series of types of characters you can use, but they are all paid characters except for the absolute worst possible one.

This game's graphics are so amazing, the scenery so breathtaking, that I had a heart attack 27 times in a row. This game's combat is fast-paced and exhilarating. The combat is also realistic and rewarding. I hit a zombie with my metal flashlight in it's face repeatedly for 5 minutes, and when it died I got a fun-sized Milky Way candy bar. It's almost like the apocalypse is really happening! I explored the entire map for 6 hours and I found a slingshot in a police department!

The game at that time was very buggy and filled with hackers. I am going to base this review/recommendation on that. The game is fun but hard to make friends and easy to find enemys. Looters are more annoying then zombies, and respawning is a, well ♥♥♥♥♥. They have people camped up on ridges in glitch rocks or trees with aimbot and hud player markers. They even have people who find ways under the map to "troll" you. I for one never, ever cheat. So when I see this I intantly write the game off as a failed project. Don't buy this, its just a sleezy version of DayZ.","November 26, 2013","false","82.7"," 107 of 132 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","107","132","0","0"

Thats like being a rich guy screwing over the poor, or even a swarm of annoying zombies. Know how awesome the zombie skins and types are sooo amazing? No. Plain stupid boring dull lazy worked through same zombies that walk around and hit and scratch you. Remember how amazing the graphics are, like that mountain flat area? No. I know graphics aren't everything but really... It looks like a picture of a rock in the guy's backyard and he took a ♥♥♥♥ on it and used it. Know how to swim? me too! you can swim across areas and not take long paths! No. Sure the water is dirty and diseased and cold, but do you really want to go past that boring-♥♥♥ horde of zombies in that area? Come on damnit! This game is no fun!

I totalled about 10 hours of ( at times forced) gameplay.\n(Graphics) - It has a beautiful landscape I give it that, but is also a FORCED beauty on your machine. The recent updates took away almost all controls over your video/hardware settings and forced all players to run at what the Developers want you to run.  The outcome is an even more terribly optimized experience rendering all low-end pc's ( fps 30 before update, ran great) unoperable. Fps even for high-end users is a 10 fps experience due to lack of extended work.\n(Gameplay) - The gameplay varies but is generally just as terrible. The difference from the critically acclaimed DayZ and this { turd taped to a radiator} is that this is heavily influenced by the cash shop. Everything required for long term survival is bought on the cash shop i.e powerful guns/equipment/ammo EVERYTHING. Safe zones are camped, item spawns are not randomized and are also camped. Game time can consist of short survival times due to cashshoppers and the frequent HACKER.\n(UI/Community/Support) The maps are big enough, but are suffocating when the server is full. Aside from a couple small settlements and a handful of cities there is NOTHING outside of those areas. Lots of space and very barren unless you love seeing trees. The zombie mechanics are horrible, they run twice as fast as you and apparently have a 10ft reach. The game has glitches left and right and have not been addressed at all. The Developer support is almost nonexistent with little to no cooperation with the community. The weekly updates consist of no major update fixes to glitches and consist of Dev's either "saying" they will be doing an update or going on little breaks. There is no major support from the Game Dev's and have not been any in a long time.\n\nI give it a Charlie Brown rating of meh/10.

Yes, i am serious.\n\nThe early alpha was a very good, yet unstable game. You could freely roam a small world full on zombies, rare of supplies and weapons and occasionly meet other players and either fight or ignore them.\nThe devs expanded the map, greatly expanded the weapon & ammo drop rate, made zombies nearly no threat and decided to implement various ways of unfair advantages.\nPackages full of weapons and supplies which you could buy for real money.\nA cash shop which you could access from anywher ein the world (later changed).\nDeath cooldown timers, only resettable via cash.\n[...]\n\nNowadays this game mostly only features PvP fights full of cashers & / or hackers. There always was a hackerproblem and they were sadly never able to fix it.\nInstead they focussed on developing a new zombie survival game which is just an advanced, yet still bad version of this one.\n\nDo not buy this game.

We have been on the lookout for players until all of a sudden he died after 3 hits to the head from a player whose nick was about enough insulting. Then, I jumped up behind a barricade, and almost immediately I received few hits to the head and also died instantly, even though we both had full stuff gear and snipers on us, we died easy peasy. My friend then logged in on another character and also died instantly. In a while, we joined again, geared fully with snipers to hunt that player down. We went up on that roof and saw that player somewhat 200-300 meters in front of us and I stuck my head out to aim him with my magnum, and then I received 3 hits from him and died before I even noticed my health going down which was a surprise because I had a full skill tree. My friend, also died the same way have I.\n\nLater, whilst consistently checking the I:SS game blocks twitter bans, I have not seen the nickname of that player, it was clarified that this game is f. up and all of it's systems. What's even better though, is that I as a normal, legit player with over 250 kills have been banned by "FairFight". That guy, still hadn't been banned. That guy, used ESP, aimbot, no recoil and no clip whatever else he used; yet I the legit player have been banned FOR NOTHING.\n\nThank you HP and OP, you are amazing. You cannot fix your bugs, and you cannot develop a game. All of yous are a bunch of useless clowns who just await the stupid players who are like "take my moneys men".

I never stopped playing it since back then. I loved this game. I loved how it fused PVP & survival together. No survival game was able to create such great PVP, not even DayZ. However since the original developers left the game back in january the game left with them. The new company has released 1 patch since then and they're working on a new "Infestation" that will probably be a dissapointment aswell. It really sucks that i can't have back the awesome times back i had in 2013 with this game. Now only campers & hackers play this game. It's horrible. Most of my friends also left this game. So if you want a good Survival game, choose DayZ. If you want a good survival-pvp game, Wait for H1Z1. If you simply want Infestation. Wait for the "new" version. The developers are milking as much money as they can right now before they're gonna move on to make other games. I will use up my Global Inventory then uninstall this game and just let it rest.\n\nR.I.P The War Z (Oct, 2012- Dec, 2013) You will be missed.","May 23, 2014","false","314.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","4"

I have had great time with my friends exploring and fighting the zombie hordes for the first time.\n\nI wish I could say the same for the rest of my experience, the game had great potential, I can say had because it is beyond repair, the game is run by Hammerpoint Interactive, just about the worst company in existance.\n\nExamples, crashes every 5 minutes, just an array of graphical issues, pc compatibility issues... what can I say, Alienware pc's can't run the game above 20 fps.... for todays standards ugly graphics, and oh, the cream on top, an absolute swarm of hackers, just about the only game where every single server is swarmed by hackers, I'm not talking about 1 or 2, 90% of servers current population is hacking, this is a fact.\nAnti cheat system there is simply for looks and that's pretty much that.\n\nTo keep the story short, the game's head developer at the current time, the community manager, calls players doorknobs for trying to prevent the game becoming pay2win, one of the more polite words we have heard from the community manager.\n\nAbsolute 0 communication with the player base, 0 bug fixes, there are bugs that first appeared in alpha that haven't been fixed, a whole year and some months ago gone by, company cares only about money. 0 customer support, people bought  in game currency for real money and never got what they paid for.\n\nIn short, the absolute worst game of my life, sure it had some bright moments, but if you want to avoid getting cancer, don't buy this game ever.\n\nIf this game was free to play I wouldn't recommend it.","January 28, 2014","false","755.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

I thought at the sight of the sale 'Oh it's only £1, It'll be funny to pay little for a TOTALLY GREAT game' So I bought it and for the first twenty minutes it physically would not launch. But I persisted, I installed the game after a TOTALLY SHORT amount of time and began to play...Wait - wait no that didn't happen. I didn't play. I spent another REALLY SHORT amount of time installing the game again and then it finally launched. I just had enough time to play the game for about 30 minutes and submit this review before I clawed my eyes out and shot myself in the face with a 12 gauge Double Barreled shotgun, WHICH ACCORDING TO THIS GAME ONLY HAS ONE BULLET.

Alot, and alot did. The game has been poorly optimized since day 1 challenging the greatest of graphics cards with poorly rendered areas and straight up disrespect to optimizaiton. Hacking albeit progress has been made is still a major issue with the devs struggling to keep their software and systems up to date with the latest releases. One of the key elements of the game is the ability to group up and share the expierience with your friends. However this becomes more of a challenge than the zombies themselves with huge amounts of map to cover with relatively little supplies and the constant threats of the world.

Nevermind.\n\nI still cannot believe that i was so hyped for this game. Me and my friends bought this ♥♥♥♥ for playing together.  We wanted to have fun. WRONG! Everything went wrong. First of all, for the creators of this game, nice job, really ♥♥♥♥ing nice. THEY PROMISED FOR LOTS OF THINGS AND NONE CAME TO REALITY! I started playing this game when it was still in Alpha. I bought the second package for it. The game wasnt so bad in the first days. Except the ghost zombie bug, that was awful. Me and 4 friends of mine were searching for supplies and weapons for days. What? WOW WE FOUND A SHOTGUN!!! But the game creators didnt want us to have some ammo.  Oh, now we are starving? Doesnt matter, we will just go and die slowly. Alright enough with the Alpha and Beta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nAnd the game was released. I wanted do try this game again. I entered the game and... Nothing changed? Oh okay, let me wander a little bit and BAM, a big hole in my head. This is normal.\n\nMonths later me and my friends wanted to play this again. We found a low populated server and joined it. We found some equipment and wanted to wander together. Somehow everyone left the server. There were 2 people in the server except us. And what happened? When we were raiding the city, someguy flied near us, and "quickscoped" everyone in 2 seconds. Well flying + killing 4 people in 2 seconds, totally not a cheater.\n\nAnyway, dont buy it,  Steam has enough mercy to give this game 20/100\n\nI would give didiwritethisreviewforthis♥♥♥♥♥♥game/100","November 3, 2014","false","6.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Firstly, i think the game is amazing, fun to play and the best of its kind out at the moment. Gameplay is awesome, the shere anxiety you fell in sintuations as amazing. There is nothing like it. Picture this:\n\nYou are approaching a town through a grassy forest at night. You can hear an owl from the tree above and lonelyness sets in. All you have is your flashlight and a few scraps of food. You are wounded and bleeding from a previous encounter with an infected and need to scavange a bandage as fast as you can or you are going to bleed to death. In the near distance, you can see the small town. The moonlight shimmers a slight reflection on the town roads allowing you to barely make out dark figures scattered around. You notice an ambulance led on its side. An aftermath caused by the sudden panic upon outbreak. You move toward it steadily, checking your surroundings for threats. Suddenly ahead of you, a flash of light and the sound of a gunshot follows. You hit the deck, concealed by the long grass listening, wondering if that shot was meant for you.\n\nHOWEVER, yes, i know. My reccomendation is a NO. This is why.\nWhen the game was released it was released titled WARZ and during the early stages, there were no anti-cheat software. Bearing in mind that you could BUY items from the in game store for REAL MONEY. Anyone who bought items with their hard earned cash was quickly robbed of it buy cheaters. At one point i read that there was a FREE cheat software available for the game. IU liked the site in the forum to the developers. Nothing came of it. Cheaters accounts were banned. So all that they had to do to play again was buy the game, create a new account and they were back on their way to stealing items. The devs could have issued an IP ban, but that has never happened.\n\nConstant crash issues, files miraculousy go missing. PB failiures, random kicks from PB communication errors.\n\nDEVS are money grabbers, There was once a time when loot was fairly balanced, fair ammount of guns/backpacks/meds etc. Before the trading was available, they severly nerfed the loot spawns, forcing players to spend money in their store. A lot of items in the store were only available for purchase with GC (in game money purchased with real money). So the more you spent the more you won (unless a hacker got you first)\n\nThis game has been avaiable a very long time. And only recently have they added vehicles. again, i kept crashing at one point upon entry. There is 1 map and 1 map only. the new map has been in development for 6 months. You can play in a PTE. The map has a city and 4 TINY towns. The rest of the gigantic map is baron lands which has no actual use.\n\nTHis is only a tiny portion of why you should NEVER buy this game. I could write PAGES and PAGES of negatives. In a nutshell, if this game was ran by devs who actually gave a crap about the community and were not trying to bleed them dry i would have been one of the best games of all time. Shame on you DEVS.

I didn't play the game for about a year and just decided to do so now. Nothing has changed except the main screen.\n\nNew maps? No. The same good old "Colorado".\nNew weapons? Not really.\nVehicles, or anything like that? Yeah, no.\nAbility to actually find a player and not run around by yourself the whole game like in Arma 3? Nope.\nNew zombies? Nope.\nAbility to go into more buildings? Nope.\n\nShould you buy this game? Nope.\n\nI also have a Velocity Micro gaming PC, and even when running the game on Ultra uber graphics mode it still doesn't even come close to the graphics shown in the Steam preview pics. My guess is they are touched up lies.\n\nI'm actually pretty offended that I bought it for 50 dollars and now its only 5 dollars. I want my 45 dollar refund damn it.

It has so many problems, hackers end your fun and take your hard earned gear. I have a graphics card that can run high detailed games fine, but the graphics on this game are so terrible and can cause FPS issues. What really makes me dislike the game is that players can simply buy their way into surviving and have all this gear they never even found. But no, it gets worse. Ammo is appearently very rare in the game, being 3x harder to find than actual guns! The guns seem to deal low damage to both zombies and players, which in this case, need more ammo. Where can you get this ammo? You can get it via purchase. I didn't realize that it takes 3 shots with a shotgun to kill a SINGLE zombie. The delevopers pretty much made the guns weak so that they would need more ammo, more ammo that people have to buy in order to get enough to for 1 emergency. This game has an endless amount of problems and issues that im not going to get started on. The only thing I like about this game is how the loot is placed around the map (hat on a dresser, gun in a gun rack, etc.) and more of the buildings are enterable. But aside from only 2 things I thought was well done, I don't recommend this game. I recommend titles such as DayZ, Rust, and State of Decay if your looking for a good zombie apocolyptic survival game.","December 14, 2013","false","4.0"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","0"

Post apocalyptic zombie survival mmo sounds hard to mess up but nearly every one does and this game takes the cake and eats the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. When first released on steam as War It had pictures of the game looking fun, playable, and looking polished with features. Sadly they were all fake all these features were not even included and still are not. They stole pictures and loading screens from other games and was forced to take them down along with the whole game its self for awhile on steam. It doesn't stop there the developers made acounts went in game and banned people talking ♥♥♥♥ about the game. About the only thing worse then the developers is the actual community its self. Camping outside one of the 3 safe zones with wepons killing new players that only have flashlights for no reason. I guess I should mention the gameplay as well. Gun combat is shakey, inaccurate, and almost useless unless you have a scope. Most of you would be lucky to even get far enough to find a gun. Cause once you get killed by an other player for no reason you get to waitover an hour of real life to respawn! That is unless you pay to them real life money to respawn faster of course!. Melee combat is almost useless as hits do not register. Most items are locked behind a pay 2 win wall. I could go on for hours about just my horror stories in this game. Maybe I will write more just to keep you from buying this game from these greedy lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nFinal Score\n3/10","April 27, 2014","false","7.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

At first it looked very interesting, but it was just a terrible copy of DayZ and other similar games. I'm quite sure there was a reason this game was about 1$ during a Steam sale, and yet even though it was only a dollar I still wish to refund it. When I first bought the game, downloaded it, then played it, I was suddenly thrown into the main menu having no idea what to do. There is no tutorial whatsoever, and you're not going to recieve any help from other players. When I first entered a server I spawned right next to a man with an AK-47. Instantly I tried to ask for some assistance and tips. Same goes for all the other servers. It's always shoot first then talk for some reason. This game is certainly not friendly to new players, nor is the community very friendly either.

If you try to stand on hard to reach places the zombies sometimes stack on each other and can eventually hit you.\n\nA big flaw in the game is how the zombies match your running speed, This matched with the fact you walk slower the more damaged you are, But the zombies seem to keep jogging on so it becomes very hard to outrun them this matched with their hit range makes the game too hard and almost unplayable.\n\nAll this negativity doesn't mean the game doesn't have some positve atributes, One thing I liked was the time capsule feature   which allowed players to write a message in a tube can leave it for other players to find so this added "Role playing" if you're into that. Also you cannot buy guns on the store which doesn't make it purely pay to win\n\nThe game still is in alpha so this could all change but it's has not had any major updates since release which makes me think the developers have abandoned the game.\n\n","November 28, 2013","false","22.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The controls are choppy and the damage you can do vs the zombiesis disheartening. However gameplay problems aside thats not the reason why I don't recomend this game, its the customer support and the way they deal with players. Given that games through steam, especially ones that require an account, can't be changed once initialy set. This makes it impossible to play the game if anything happens.  If you look on my record, you can see that I have barely any time on this game, that is due to the way the game works. If you die, theres a 24 hour cooldown before you can play again. Its fine I'll play a little bit, and if I die turn the game off. After getting the 7 or so hours of total play time, I was tired of playing. I uninstalled it and went on to play other games.\n\nMonths later, I see the new update and decide to play it again to see if anything was made better. And to my surprise I find that my account is banned. Why was it banned? I haven't played the game at all. I decide to contact customer support about the problem, perhaps they can shed some light on what happened or what they mistakenly think happened in game. January 10th was when I sent them a support ticket to repeal the ban, they only just got back to me today saying there was detected uses of exploits or programs to basically cheat the game. And that because this so called detection was against their agreement they won't unban the account. Now remember I haven't played the game at all in this entire time they say something happened. So how could I have suposedly done any of this? Their answer? "We are unable to provide any further detail regarding the results of our investigations due to its sensitive nature." So the information about my account is sensitive and unable to be shared with me, the account owner. They won't overturn the decision cuz it aparently is against their terms even if it may be their mistake in the first place, and I can't make a new account cuz its perminately tied with steam, making it a useless game stuck in my library.\n\nI can deal with crappy gameplay mechanics and annoying texture glitches and such. I can deal with boring gameplay and whatnot. I can ignore all that, but when a company doesn't want to help its players in their own game. That is where I draw the line, and this is the reason why I do not ever recomend this game or any of their future products.","February 3, 2014","false","6.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend this game to Lucifer in person.[/b] - Last words from Hater Guy, after being shot by hackers aimbotters at market entrance.\n\nInfestation: Hacker Stories is the WORST game I've ever played in my entire life. I tried, I tried sooo freaking hard to like this game, alone, with friends, 2, 3, 10 friends, 100 times!!!. It was a 50 dollar investment back then, but I never had fun with this piece of ♥♥♥♥. EVER.\n\nThis game is worst than E.T from Atari. It should be buried deep down in the desert along with this shameful company\n\nI've been playing videogames since I was 7, I'm 27 now. I've played more than 3000 titles so far and THIS, this very game is an example to not be followed - either by its flawed design or by its company and developers.\n\nI regret the day when I bought this piece of trash at pre-alpha, when it still called "WarZ", before being legally forced to change its name due copyright infringement from World War Z movie.\n\nThe community on this game is sick, the developers sucks, game itself sucks hard. Full of bugs, glitches, hacks and absent staffers that wouldn't give you a ♥♥♥♥ even if your life depended on it. No to mention all the random banhammer rage who banned innocent people and leave hackers unpunished.\n\nMonths ago, it got worse. There was a data corruption or something on their forums and servers and the guys showed us that they simply couldn't handle it. All data erased and, again, no one give us a single ♥♥♥♥ to make it better. I wouldn't trust my credit card information to these leechers again! I wouldn't do if I were you.\n\nThe only reason for this game have been released was the huge zombie hype brought by The Walking Dead and World War Z. I wish I could delete this game from my list.\n\nWAR Z     WORLD WAR Z INFESTATION FEATURES:\n- Laughable IA\n- More hackers per m² than Crossfire, Combat Arms and similar ♥♥♥♥ games\n- GMs who don't give a dame.\n- TONS of microtransations. It's a pay-to-win out there, fellows.\n- Hacks!\n- Delayed updates, delayed fixed, delayed maps, delayed everything.\n- No respect for you, customer, at all. I mean, REALLY, visit their forums and check it out.\n- No security for your billing information.\n- Get T-bagged all day long, by hackers, by zombies, by GMs, by life.\n\nWant a better survival horror game?\nDay Z on the way. I didn't played the new standalone yet, but the Arma 2 mod gave me SO MUCH more fun than Infestation could ever possibly give.","June 23, 2014","false","90.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

However, the developers made a mess of it, instead focusing on adding more and more content and complicating things by constantly changing loot spawning rates and postions, making it impossible to actually set up with a group of friends in one location. By failing to address the needs and requests of the community, they allowed this game to flop and become a sore point for any self-respecting survival player. Anyone looking to purchase a survival game, avoid this one, if you're set on a zombie survival game get Day-Z or, for an interesting twist, Nether, though as for the latter there is again the worry that it could also follow the same path as ISS did.","January 30, 2014","false","253.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

I decided to go into a zombie infested military base in hopes of finding at the very least a pistol. I had plenty of ammunition. Without realizing it, I spent 2 hours searching that enitre base, hacking my way through an endless amount of zombies, with way too many close calls only to realize that there is no gun in that base. Of all places to find a gun, you would think a military base would have it. But nope. I even searched Police stations, nothing. Now to stop myself from rambeling, I am just going to list what is wrong with this game.\n-Zombies run like they have some sort of strange disease that doesn't just bring them back to life.\n-Guns are almost impossible to find, yet some people have them by what seems to be a miracle.\n-You cannot trust anyone, if you group with someone you can expect 9 times out of 10, they will kill you.\n- You will spend hours just searching ONE military base, thankfully I called it quits after realizing I had just spent 2 hours.\n- Animation horrible\n- Server Crashes\n- the ressurection system is unfair\n- insufficient customization options\n- lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag oh did i mention? LAG\n- NOT EVEN A DEAD ZOMBIE SOLDIER HAD A DAMN PISTOL\n- ammo everywhere, no gun in sight.\n- you lose everything when you die.... including the points you just bought with REAL money.\n- Flare gun.....

To be honest if you enter a 5/100 populated server, you can be almost 90-100% sure that you get shot.

As I land, the world around me starts to become clear. Trees have taken over the world. I wander throughout the day with my flashlight on, until I come across what appears to be a large amount of zombies surrounding a random spot in the road where everyone has decided to park their cars and leave. I approach with caution. I run up and jump onto the back of a truck. That's when I find myself a delicious candy bar. I enjoy this sweet piece of tastiness. Then the zombies learn to climb. I bash their skulls in with my flashlight with ease. I pick up a rifle to pick off the rest. Little did I know, it had no bullets. Gun is useless. Zombies are now entirely surrounding me. I spend the next half hour breaking the heads of the zombies with my extremely durable flashlight until the coast is clear. I make a run for it. I find a farm, but unfortunately, it is filled with nothing but duct tape. I also found a glow stick, but alas, my small kindergarden backpack could not carry any more, as it was filled with tape. That's when I set out to find a home for the night. I search effortlessly, when I finally see a city. It is very close, I start to run. Suddenly, zombies start teleporting to my location. What do I do? Kill them with my flashlight. Oh no! My flashlight no longer hits where I tell it to! I swing but no matter how many times the light makes contact with the zombie, it continues to brush right through it! I am forced to run. I run to the city, finally safe. I find a revolver on the ground, good. Now I can survive better. Wait! No I can't! Sniped. My journey had ended. As I die, all of my duct tape falls out onto the ground. Then... Oh man...

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.\n","January 16, 2015","false","15.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","8","9","8","9"

Yup. They even made sure you knew how bad it was going to be in the description. The War Z, or, as it's now called Infestation: Survivor Stories (like that makes it any better) is a failiure of a game. What I would do, I would pay a little extra to buy DayZ or the Arma II mod for a game similar but waaaay better than this. It sucks for the creators because from now on, they'll be known as "The People who brought you Infestation: Survivor Stories".

I can say the same for this time aswell.\n\nThe fact that this game has a 20 in the Metascore is giving the developers too much credit.\n\nThis game was not even remotely worth the $1.49 it was on sale for. They should pay YOU to play this game. This game is garbage and a half. I would get into more detail, but after 30 minutes of this game, I can tell you that the AI might aswell had been by the developers of Big Rigs. The only reason this game was ever scraped together from Hammerpoint Interactive was to vampire off of the success of DayZ, and they did perfectly at just that. They made their game War Inc, except with different models and added zombies, they couldn't even make their own ToS. They deliberately took League of Legend's ToS and made it their own, just finding and replacing Riot's name to their own. The only thing this game and the developers did well, was steal the money of zombie game enthusiasts and bite the hand that feeds these low-life cretins.\n\nThe load times and the amount of cheaters on the game are nothing compared to any other game I've played, including World at War on console.","March 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

By the time i played with my friends,in 2013, the game had already been oficially launched, and it was a buggy mess. It was sad. The gameplay was incredible boring, the graphics were unfinished, the amount of bugs we found in just a little time playing were huge. And also, a lot of microtransitions. Terrible game, i hope the developers are working hard to fix this, people are telling me that this game is still broken. And this change of name(the game was called War Z before, if im not wrong) was also sad. Infestation - Survivor Stories.....lol, that's a bad name, sorry.

Akin to DayZ, it's vast open world full of zombies and loot allow for hours of gameplay. But, unlike DayZ I:SS offers a unique EXP system and persistent inventory comparable to the stash system from Diablo or PoE. But all of this is for naught, as the EXP is just that, an accumulation of EXP with nothing to spend it on, and the persistant inventory/stash would be GREAT, if not for the horrible lacking of items to find and the Pay to Win MTM.\n\nThe game intentionally tries to make you less than self sufficient, forcing you to either buy from the MTM, starve to death, die of Dehydration, or have almost no ammo, ever. Guns are also scarce beyond everything you'd ever imagine. If you find a shotgun, good luck finding ammo for it, and STANAG's are more rare than Sniper Rifles.\n\nSo be warned, this game is full of empty promises, corruption, and greed.\n\nUpdate: I returned to this game after an 8 month hiatus, and alot has been fixed. Many of the stability issues have been fixed, the spawn rate of items is acceptable (but certainly not lucrative), the skill tree has finally been implemented, vehicles have been added and missions have improved the rate in which you accumulate in-game currency you can spend at settlements.

This game is a scam and buyer beware because if you do happen to purchase this game you better be on the look out for hackers in every server and the game devs around every corner. Also just know that when you are facing an enemy during a pvp battle that he has the chance to hit one key that takes him straight to the games marketplace where he can buy healing items or even armor while you engage in a shoot out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ootieextreme/recommended/226700/","ootieextreme","ootieextreme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ootieextreme/","33 products in account","So I decided to make a review for Infestation: Survivor Stories after I opened up the game for the first time in a week and got a message that said "You have been banned permanetly by fairfight". Now I dont remember me hacking or anything but I do remember right now that im about to give a horrible review for this copy of "war inc" ♥♥♥♥. I guess they could tell the future to know that I am about to write a long, honest review. And believe, to the devs, HONEST isn't the word they're looking for about this game.\n\nSo where do I start? Well I will just start from the beginning.\n\nSo here I am loading into the world of colorado for the first time. My DayZ expectations up and my Call Of Duty expectations down to the minimum but let me tell you....I should have flipped those two around. I ran for 10 minutes until I met this little base. I checked my map and it said..."Norad Military Base". So I ran in there and I saw a zombie. I had courage with my flashlight gripped in my hand and immedatly walked towards the zombie...All of the sudden I heard ♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio moaning from all directions. I sprinted down into the middle of the base and then I heard a huge BANG..."You are dead" it said as it played sad music. That wasn't the first time I got shot out of the blue at will NEVER be its last. After 100 hours of pain and suffering I got a good inventory. I found a clan and we PvP'd all day. We got loads of loot..LOADS OF IT. But then later something stranged happened....at blue ridge safe zone I saw 2 guys doing something with guns. There were only 10 people on the server including me so I ran to get closer and they looked like they were dooping snipers. At first I though that was dumb and stupid but I look now at it and see that hacking was everywhere. 80% off all infestation players are Hackers. So the zombie AI is rigged, no player is friendly, frame rate sucks, guns suck, hacker's always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new spawns, constant kicking by fairfight, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev's like Artimes Knives. What else......Oh yeah...Everything you see in the screenshot's of this game on steam store is false. They also bring you in to spend alot of money on ingame GC. So never and I say NEVER reach for your wallet for this ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nLooks like this is the end of my review...I let I:SS off easy on this one.....Thanks for reading...DONT GET GAME","December 29, 2014","false","918.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

BTW, this mite be an old rant for some of you (if it is, dont troll a sarcy reply, youll just show how much of a nub you are) but i cant understand why a game with such huge potential cant give an option to be or not to be part of the mindelss PvP side. spawn...dead....another flashlight looted (awesome fun -_- ), i understand for some players thats all they can cope with...but if thats what their mental capacity wants, then why dont they go and kick some in Planet side 2 or something designed around full PvP. forcing it into a survival game and allowing sooo much of the game to be ignored, must be either be a brilliant idea building up to something gamechanging by the devs or else they realy dont give a damn and are just in it for the money from these gankers who micro trans shed loads of ammo (like i said earlier)....either way. GIVE US A CHANCE TO PLAY THE GAME BY OPTING OUT OF THE PVP is the main shout about this game.\nIt is a good game, and a private server deffinatly pays of if PvP is not your thang. Does need alot of work still as a game. but stick with it. Im sure the Devs will listn to what the people want soon enough.\nAnd Hackers..those souless, friendless, idiotic mindless sad celler dwelling game wreking ♥♥♥♥♥s need to get out more and stop making other people suffer for their own insufferable empty lives.\n\n*takes a bow and thanks you all :)","August 25, 2014","true","197.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","1"

Their whole forums die, have robots and use their own staff to reply to their own threads, no support, change the prices of their games consistently, Steam wouldn't allow me to remove it from my games list after being unfairly banned and no support forums.\n\nI hated this game to begin with but really tried to give it a chance, it was more of a sandbox with hackers, endless unpatched exploits to gain easy gear, noclip zombies, terrible animations, then added pay-to-win features such as quicker revival time [limted time to play a day if you died too much, to player slots and gear slots, etc. Oh and did I mention their own "anti-cheat" before they used FairFight, was used to monitor your screen while you played, yeah, totally not fishy at all...\n\n\nI haven't installed this game in years, never was going to re-install either, but I laugh as I see the game hasn't been removed from steam, and do enjoy reading the endless comments. Do no bother playing any of these games, as if you do some background checks, the same thing happens with most, if not all of his unsuccessful games, did I say games? I meant demos... Over priced demos...\n\nOh yes before I pulbish I see a "Shattered Skies" promo underneath, took a quick glance, wouldn't bother buying that either. It's an ARMA clone with the same engine used in this abandonware.","May 22","false","29.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noqda/recommended/226700/","noqda","n0qda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noqda/","148 products in account","Alright, I decided to review this after owning it for months now.  I know Steam says I only have roughly 1 hour played on this game, but I originally bought it from their website after it was released.  So, here's my review for 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' (Originally known as 'WarZ').\n\nPerformance : Most of my friends on Steam know that I have a superb gaming PC, which I bought for roughly $2,000. It's GPU (graphics processing unit) is amazing, and etc. Despite my PC's specs, I somehow average at roughly 15 frames per second on  low  settings. Did they create the game so it works better for specific graphics cards or something? If they did, that's really idiotic on the developer's part.\n\nGraphics : Personally, I don't judge a game by it's graphics... but there are some people out there who do. The game's graphics looks like a game out of 2008, and isn't detailed that well.\n\nCombat & AI: The combat of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' has always given me a huge headache, even when I have a superb weapon. Whether I'm using a combat knife or an axe, I find it taking absolutely  forever  to kill one zombie... while hitting it's head. The combat is really buggy as well, from my experiences playing the game. The AI of the zombies is less than decent as well, but they're zombies... so it's not like they're  supposed  to be smart.\n\nCommunity : The community of the game is fairly nice, although there is one thing to be aware of before buying this game.  Do not trust anyone.  Usually that's the case for most zombie MMO's out there, but there are friendly people... right? Not in 'Infestation: Survival Stories'! Any player I've come across in this game has either killed me or attempted to kill me and died in the process. I'm sure there may be a few people playing a hero here and there, but none that I've come across so far. Another problem of this game is that  alot  of people hack in this game. So, if you're going to fight someone... it may not always be a fair fight.\n\nServers : I personally haven't had many connection issues with the servers in 'Infestation: Survival Stories', but like most game there are a few connections issues here and there.  Although, you should expect to be banned on servers in this game... alot.  Even if you aren't doing anything, you could possibly get banned from the server you're playing on. I've been banned constantly off of servers for hacking when I've done nothing.\n\nIs this game 'P2W'? : When people say this game is P2W (pay to win), they are completely right. This game is extremely P2W, as you can buy almost any item from the game with real money, instead of finding it in the game.\n\nMy overall rating of the game is 4/10.  It has it's moments, but it can be frustrating as all hell.\n\nSo, this concludes my review of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' ('WarZ'). I hope you found this review helpful, and if you didn't, feel free to comment why! And lastly, thanks for reading my review. =)","February 15, 2014","false","3.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Seriously, do not deal with this studio ever. Been ages ago, I've been playing this with my girlfriend and my bestfriend when we all got slaughtered by a hacker. Recently, there's a new game which is free for owners of this game and when I tried to log in this game : "This account has been permanently banned by FairFight. Do not appeal, you won't receive a reply. See support." and what support has to say "You beleive your account is compromised. Account security is your responsibility." I'm someone who uses password generator and is careful where he navigates, so I doubt the security breach is on my end.\n\nI did get account blocked on various games due to hackers, god knows how they get password (I don't even know them myself since they are random), and I've been able to gain back access. This is the first time I'm told "Sucks to be you, thanks for your money."\n\nI thought the game was OK, but chances are you'll get hacked and you'll get perma-ban too. So skip wasting 15$+ on this game.\n\nN.B. You might think it isn't that bad since it has mixed reviews. Read the positive, you'll  notice how peoples are jerks and flawed that "Recommend" system is.","April 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was recent ip banned from forum now with my new find freedom. I can finally express my true thought without restriction. After a year of playing this game, I feel I would like to express my through for the game.\n\nFirst off I love this game. This game could be so much fun if the developer would actually listen to me. I truly wanted this game to success. I truly do love this game. I personally spend over 100 dollar in this game. I have brought over 6 accounts and I have no regret what so ever in buying this game. This is game can exciting and rage inducing game. This game has a high risk factor which can make or break you. I personally find that there are a lot good people who play this game. I also know some of them will can also stab you in the back.\n\nOne of my most negative experiences was that I find out that the dev and mods were talk crap about other player. Yes some of the people in the community are annoying but it not needs to talk crap about them. The incident with Mad Max aka Striker Cade and a new developer Artemis knives is a fine example of this. I have heard of from a ex Moderator that the dev were talking negative thing about their playerbase and daily too. It a shame this company lack of professionism to it playerbase. I have keep silent about many incident. However now that I have nothing else left. I am going to say this. They clearly didn't expect for the game to do so well. The dev have no faith in it fanbase on it forum community. I even find out that both Kewk and Zombert have talk crap about me too. ( i know you read my personal PMs too) However my love for this game have kept me silent and I do wish this game to be as big as League of Legend or even DOTA. However the dev lack of respect and faith on their community will be it downfall.\n\nI have seen multiple their fans actually tired to help make this game better. However the direction of the developer of OP production was very misleading. They have promise multiple time they will fix the issue and many time they never even try to fix the problem. Look at unstable server continue disconnection from server. There are many bugs and buggy zombie. I understand you have a small team but it over a year. we have waited over for a year for stronghold. It nothing but a death arena. I have remain positive this whole time however I am not going to sit by and watch something I care about died with a fight .\nI even play legit all this time. I never even cheated once in this game and I will never cheat in this game. I have been kill so many time that by hacker and I stop caring about it. I have stop caring about them now as this is a never ending battle. Yeah the dev have step up their anti cheat. Yeah Fairfight is a good anti cheat system . However this undermine by the cheap account situation. i know dev you are in need of money. This revolving door policy is not good in the long run. I know they have HWID ip banned. I have seen it in action . It can be very effective however they do not use it. Yeah it a revolving door policy.\nI know it long but bear with me.\n\nSupport I know support is nonexistence until this year . Yeah I have sent ticket too. None were answer until this year by a real person. They close all my ticket from last year and never solve any of them.\nHowever I admit support now is a alot better and there is no more automated closed response and it a good start from there. Yes if you hacked they know and they do check ip too. So you cannot send a ticket for your friend.\n\nI even got a warning point for reporting a duper who was c-mag and was streaming it too. Yes Kewk give a warning point and I never report a duper until he quited. I give public posting about them and warn you about them. I personally took that too heart. Do you know why now there is a black market and why you are losing money now. I have warned you that duper existed. They are even showing it the public and it so easy to find it too. You can hide on your forum but not the internet. This reward of new duping method for 1000000Gc is a joke and no one will report it now. You have made people in fear of report their finding. I personally know of only one method right now . However it not worth duping anymore. As sniper rifle were duped like it was in style and people have over 100 sniper in their legit account lockbox. I can say one thing was it worth silenting your loyal fanbase.\n\nThe forum was a treasure of info. Even hacker announce their attack against you daliy. I have over 8500 post and I read the forum and never forget them. They would make spam site and hack login and many other thing. Almost half of the trader there was a hacker or is hacker. I know them by their name. I personally feel that you should bring back gc trading at least then you can make money from that. Instead of them using the black market.\nI have many thing I wish to tell you however I want to leave it one positive note. Dev and staff of OP Production this game is wonderful and it even could have been a great success However you just keep making the same mistake over and over again. I have tell you the flaw of them. If you choose to listen or don't. I personally hope do success but I believe your flaws will caught up to you.\n\nLove you lot Black Lotus","April 17, 2014","true","1.2"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","22","38","0","19"

The way the devs pulled together flying zombies and zombies with slenderman arms that can grab you from ten feet away is just a perfect mix to this game.  It's soooo good.  I love the fact to that I can buy whatever I want and can go around slaughtering those slenderman zombies.  There's also zombies in the game that are like the Flash and sprint 1000 miles per hour towards you and frog jumping zombies that hop towards you and slap you once for 99.9% of your health, then you start bleeding 20 seconds later and die.  And can I tell you about how amazing the vehicles are.  The vehicles are so relistic.  The driving makes Forza look like a playground.  When I first started playing this game, I was instantly impressed on how much character customization there was.  My character was so sexy I instantly started jerking off to his beautiful bald head and nice body.  The load times for the game is fantastic.  Never in my life have I seen a game load as fast as it does.  After speedily loading into the game I saw a group of 3 people with assault rifles sprinting towards me.  I tried to run but a frog zombie caught up to me and bent me over and ♥♥♥♥♥ me over a fence.  I was so pleased with the gameplay that I went to a dollar tree and robbed the cash register for money to revive my character and give him some melee weapons.  Shortly after I used my map to head towards a military base called Norad.  There I found a gigantic white zombie and knew I wanted him in my butt.  I smiled at him and was mesmerized by his skill of trying to grab my ♥♥♥ through a wall.  I knew he was a fiesty one and ran towards him, in one punch he knocked me out and ♥♥♥♥♥ my unaware body.  I know this because I woke up and felt like my  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was bigger.  It was so good that it knocked me all the way to an airport where I found a gun.  I treasured this pistol it looked like an angel to me I quickly left the game to save my pistol.  I went to sleep and dreamed about how those zombie penetrated me.  I woke up to find my mom playing the game.  She was in a trance shortly after she started laughing histerically.  I saw her go out to the kitchen and grab a knife.  She walded towards me and took my favorite stuffed animal and beheaded it as to please the dev gods.  She then ate the stuffing of my animal and wore its ur as a hat.  I knew something was wrong and I was my mom get 24 kills without dying.  She then called in a MOAB and blew up the whole map getting even more kills.  The devs were so pleased they rode into my house on a unicorn and asked my mom to join them in being a dev.  My mom smiled from ear to ear, and the dev lifted her on to the unicron by her ♥♥♥.  I knew my mom had to do this, so a waved bye and thought of how wonderful the game was.","April 4, 2013","false","205.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The way the devs pulled together flying zombies and zombies with slenderman arms that can grab you from ten feet away is just a perfect mix to this game.  It's soooo good.  I love the fact to that I can buy whatever I want and can go around slaughtering those slenderman zombies.  There's also zombies in the game that are like the Flash and sprint 1000 miles per hour towards you and frog jumping zombies that hop towards you and slap you once for 99.9% of your health, then you start bleeding 20 seconds later and die.  And can I tell you about how amazing the vehicles are.  The vehicles are so relistic.  The driving makes Forza look like a playground.  When I first started playing this game, I was instantly impressed on how much character customization there was.  My character was so sexy I instantly started jerking off to his beautiful bald head and nice body.  The load times for the game is fantastic.  Never in my life have I seen a game load as fast as it does.  After speedily loading into the game I saw a group of 3 people with assault rifles sprinting towards me.  I tried to run but a frog zombie caught up to me and bent me over and ♥♥♥♥♥ me over a fence.  I was so pleased with the gameplay that I went to a dollar tree and robbed the cash register for money to revive my character and give him some melee weapons.  Shortly after I used my map to head towards a military base called Norad.  There I found a gigantic white zombie and knew I wanted him in my butt.  I smiled at him and was mesmerized by his skill of trying to grab my ♥♥♥ through a wall.  I knew he was a fiesty one and ran towards him, in one punch he knocked me out and ♥♥♥♥♥ my unaware body.  I know this because I woke up and felt like my  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was bigger.  It was so good that it knocked me all the way to an airport where I found a gun.  I treasured this pistol it looked like an angel to me I quickly left the game to save my pistol.  I went to sleep and dreamed about how those zombie penetrated me.  I woke up to find my mom playing the game.  She was in a trance shortly after she started laughing histerically.  I saw her go out to the kitchen and grab a knife.  She walded towards me and took my favorite stuffed animal and beheaded it as to please the dev gods.  She then ate the stuffing of my animal and wore its ur as a hat.  I knew something was wrong and I was my mom get 24 kills without dying.  She then called in a MOAB and blew up the whole map getting even more kills.  The devs were so pleased they rode into my house on a unicorn and asked my mom to join them in being a dev.  My mom smiled from ear to ear, and the dev lifted her on to the unicron by her ♥♥♥.  I knew my mom had to do this, so a waved bye and thought of how wonderful the game was.","April 4, 2013","false","205.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

If I had to compare how bad this game is to an everyday occurence, i'd compare it to waking up to have your divorced wife cutting off your ♥♥♥♥ with a pair of safety scissors. Then, taking all of your money and house then ♥♥♥♥ing a new man in your bed and turning your own children on you. After that, you get in your car. You realize your tires have been stolen and a blackman is in the back seat. He force ♥♥♥♥s you and then breaks your legs. After he gives you aids and breaks your jaw, he leaves allowing you to change your tires and go to work. When you get to work there are jewish men standing there with their big noses and paper work. They then ask you if you are you and you say yes. Your boss walks out and slugs you in the face and twists your nipples and rips them off. You scream in agony as you fall to the floor as all of the jews whip out their ♥♥♥♥♥ and beat you with them until your cheek bones are shattered and you're deaf in one ear. Your boss then fires you and tortures you for the rest of the day. After all of this you get home, go upstairs, get on your computer and see that your new game has finished downloading. You say to yourself, atleast I can still play this new game called "Infestation: Survivor Stories". and "What could be worse?"","November 7, 2013","true","0.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

I was absolutely wrong. Or better yet, i wasn't, the game's wrong. Awful animations, zombies killing you from 5 meters, 60 mins to respawn your character after dying. Funny is they offer buying stuff with real currency, who would want that... Even if you buy everything to make your way easier, some PVP maggot kills you on sight, GR8!
