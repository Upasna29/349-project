And even at that price, I would not recommend buying this game.\n\nThis game in a word? Unrealised. The actual game has two themes -- the first being a fairly generic 'your actions have moral consequences' theme that's used extremely simplistically by giving an occasional yes/no choice, and the second being age, which is dealt with only in an exceedingly shallow capacity. While both of these themes can be compelling when written sufficiently well, the more unique and interesting one is age; most people playing videogames are fairly young or approaching middle age, so age is a topic that gets swept under the rug or only dealt with as a way to get rid of a character in most games. Given a nuanced portrayal, it could have been excellent here. It wasn't.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it has the standard non-combat rpg maker formula -- wander around, talk to people, get information, solve puzzles. Most rpg maker games will attempt to flavour their world beyond the basic graphics by giving interesting flavour text on clickable items, a feature I adore. True, this game does have many clickable items, and a lot of flavour text... but all of it is either very bland descriptions of what you're looking at, or immature flavour text.\n\nActually, let's cycle back to the immature bit. Do you think naked pixelated old men are funny? Do you think it's great that a good portion of your game world is compared to poo? Because that's why some of the steam pages related to this game ask for age confirmation, and the devs never seem to get tired of it. It's pretty much worthless in terms of content, both comedically and in terms of worldbuilding. It just makes the game seem like it was made by juvenile teenagers.\n\nThe writing, outside of the themes it tries and fails to tackle, is uninspiring. NPCs are both unlikeable and boring, as, in fact, are all the player characters. There simply isn't enough dialogue given -- in a format, mind you, that really *needs* dialogue and description in order to be effective -- to characterise even one of the protagonists beyond a very simple pastiche of whatever their problem is. I feel like the dev(s?) of this game aren't really familiar with creating works of art or fiction -- although, as a plus, I only noticed one glaring grammar problem (an NPC using "were" when the correct version for the context would have been "where." There were moments of writing which, although not fantastic, was at least interesting (the nurse chapter, with the mindscrew hospital segment  was intriguing).\n\nPoor programming is also evident; two instances that I spotted were being able to drive directly into the wall of the Pub while in my car, and the game locking up if you gave a certain item to an NPC from below. Usually, giving the item triggers the npc to down one square out of your way, and there is no exception made for the player choosing to stand there. Even accepting that there may be technical limitations in coding npc behaviour, it would have been child's play to simply make the npc move back through the passage to a square the player couldn't occupy, or alter the map slightly to ensure the player couldn't stand below the npc but the npc could still move there.\n\nOn top of that, there is a huge lack of content in this game. It can all be seen and discovered in an hour or two, with no real problem; after that, everything else is repetition and padding.\n\nUltimately, it feels like somebody's first game in rpg maker -- ambitious themes, poor execution. And that's perfectly fine, but not if there's an asking price. If you want a combat-light rpg maker game with better writing, more entertaining characters, and don't mind nudity (which, to be fair, this game has as well), then go and download Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle. It's free, and a shining example of what rpg maker games can do when the effort's put in considering all the detail and jokes put into the world.\n\nIf you're considering buying this as a way to support the developer/support other rpgmaker games being on steam, don't. This game also had a small kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1604197967/greyfox); again, considering you'll find much, much better rpgmaker games out there for free, has already created more money than the product deserves.\n\nTo improve this game, I would advise the devs to recruit somebody with some real writing experience to draw out the potential of the themes it tries to handle, and, moreover, consider whether this is really the medium the game needs in order to shine. Very little of the good points of this game would be lost if it were in a visual novel format, due to the flavour text in the environment being mostly not worthwhile, and it would give the game chance to focus on dialogues, characterisation and story while dropping the largely redundant fetch quest gameplay. I would also advise them to do a little market research and observe what the standards are for commercial games of this type.\n\nTo clarify: I think there's potential here in the themes, and if I had just downloaded it as somebody's first rpg maker project, I would be considerably more enthusiastic about it. But Greyfox is not a good enough product to demand money for, and too basic to justify the kickstarter that was attached. With more experience, this game could have been a gem. As it is? Not worth it.","July 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 130 of 159 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","130","159","5","6"

She quits her job and moves to a town called Greyfox with no promise of a new job or even a place to live.

I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end.”  ― Simone de Beauvoir, La Vieillesse\n\nGreyfox is a really short RPGMaker adventure game that tries to come as an empathy simulation with the touch of speculative supernatural motifs scattered on the side. Fair warning though: pledging catch phrases like "a town with a sinister secret" and "uncover its mysteries" that we encounter in the trailer are quite the misleading advertisement here. Whether there be any sinister secret or a mystery to uncover - or not, it sadly won't be in our heroine's power to reveal in this really, really short adventure. We are just invited for a brief experience and shooed away to carry on with our lives without much explanation.\n\nIf we are to arrange a consistent outline of events; here we have a young, dumbly cheery heroine who gets bored of her daily rush in the big city and decides to move into the retirement community of Greyfox. She comes in, greeted by a townful of dull, bitter old people without an ounce of empathy left in them and struggles through some frustrating interactions. Tired by the end of her first day, the heroine is welcomed by a mysterious old lady in the local pub only, with a sarcastic yet intriguing proposition to make: What if you could live their lives and decide their fates? By the touch of this mysterious lady, our heroine is to live an ordinary day in the lives of four town inhabitants and decide their fates eventually.\n\nLet's blurt out the truth: as far as choice and consequence games go, Greyfox isn't one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean that its trash. The game feels mysterious and deep at first, but it unravels to become quite superficial in display, limited and fractured in dialogues; and sadly rushed in its endings. On the other hand, there is also some symbolic figures and attributions to other games in the genre here and there, that may bring a brief smile when encountered. There is quite a good amount of anecdotes scattered around the little town for you to discover, alongside some interesting characters.\n\nOne primarily weak point of all display is the narrative. It is depressing, cyclical and limited in its perspective. There isn't much humor - or at least qualitative humor to lessen the burden of the subject, yet the gravity isn't concluded with a consistent argument either. The final conclusion presented by the mysterious lady about the concept of right and wrong felt a bit contradictory for my taste. Please do not go into this little adventure to come across a genuine miracle. You'll get what you pay for: a small story with one ambiguous point of view that will present you maybe something to think about. With better writing, this game could have been much, much more.\n\nGraphics are basic RPGMaker, without a notable soundtrack or any voice acting. Character designs are somewhat curious and interesting though. The first playthrough will take about an hour - one and a half at max - and the game has 3 different endings. Going for all will give you roughly 2 hours of gameplay. Oh, and it has achievements if that means anything to you. For its current price, I think its basically fair deal. If on sale; heck, why the hell not to support an indie developer struggling to create her first game?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 26","true","2.5"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scarcia/recommended/341310/","scarcia","Who the fuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scarcia/","156 products in account","At most, I think the game is okay.\n\nI can see what its goal was to do and for what it presents, it's okay as a whole. However, the dialogue can be groan-worthy at times and the story arc for each character is too short to actually be memorable or even to have anything more than the cliches. I was able to finish this game and got all the achievements in less than two hours. The game tries to present this "depressing" and "mysterious" story and present "tough" choices for the fate of each character, but looking at it as a whole, it doesn't exactly deliver the impact that it wants to give off.\n\n// Spoilers start here, I guess //\n\n"A town with a sinister secret", "Uncover its mysteries".\n\nThese are two phrases that appear in the trailer, but really, I personally felt misled. There's no secret or mystery about the town; You move to a little town from the city and you feel ready to retire when some woman with the power to implant you into other peoples' bodies wants you to see that you're still too young and you aren't really ready for death. She shows you the stories of those who are, and you have the choice of whether or not you think each character should die. There's no "discovering the truth" unless you're just learning about the characters' backgrounds, and even then, they're pretty flat and to the point.\n\nFor a game that literally has the aspect of "tough choices" in its description, even the character you play as doesn't have a lot of feeling in either choice you made. She replies with short sentences that hardly show emotion, so why should the player have any emotion? Furthermore, when you can just skip to the end for some parts of an arc, it really puts all the other dialogue and event checks to waste, like in Kat's where all you have to do is get your medicine and talk to the Mysterious Woman.\n\nOne thing that bugs me is that once you finish going through the characters' stories, she tells you how many people you chose to kill and tells you that she hopes you're ready to take on the guilt of your actions for the rest of your life, but she also tells you that she's not going to tell you what's "right" or "wrong," which feels extremely contridictory to me. She brings you into these peoples' lives for you to judge them, and of course it's by your norm moral standards, so naturally you and the woman must have a sense of "right" and "wrong" when she talks about guilt for your murders (if you chose to do that), so what's her real angle here? That aspect of the story is just a nitpick for me, though.\n\n// Spoilers end here //\n\nMaybe I'm just more heartless than most people, but I don't really feel the impact of a depressing story like all the other positive reviewers do, because I don't feel for these characters. I do understand what the developer may have been trying to go for and it was a nice attempt. It could have been worse.\n\nAs for the visual aspect, it's not anything terrible. They're decent; Using RPG Maker's base elements plus others' isn't something that should account into this game.\n\n\n\n\n/// TL;DR: I think that Greyfox is alright for a start, but is definitely only worth the $0.19 paid for it. I hope the developer will continue to try and make more content that will have a more fleshed-out story.","July 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 61 of 79 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","61","79","0","2"

It's basically like a point and click adventure type game, but instead of pointing and clicking you have RPG type controls and environments. The basic plot is that you, the main character, get sick of your day to day life. You decide to quit your job and move to the small town of Greyfox, which is inhabited mainly by elderly people. You quickly get into a scenario where you are forced to live a day in the life of someone in town. This happens multiple times. This is essentially all you do in the game, without going into spoiler terrirory about what happens with each character.\n\nThe gameplay, as mentioned, is basically going around, examining the environments, talking to people, getting items, and trying to use items to complete tasks within the game. Some things can be missed but others are necessary to progress. You will get to pick different options in some dialogues. The answers sometimes have consequences and sometimes don't matter. At the end of each day, you get to decide whether the character you've played as lives or dies. After all the days, there's a final cutscene and the game ends.\n\nI liked how the game played, as opposed to actual point and click games. The RPG playstyle and art style helped me get into it more than some visual novel or point and click adventure normally would. I also like how the game gives you choices that may or may not matter. In fact, and this may be a bit of a spoiler but it doesn't really matter ultimately, in the end all of your choices have no true consequences aside from how you personally feel about them. This is a pretty cool idea, to let you feel how you want to about what you've chosen as the fate of these people. The way you play is determined by your own set of values moreso than those of the developers. It's also nice to play some depressing games now and then. It's not necessarily a happy ending, but it can be as long as you feel like it is. It's just a neat little concept.\n\nOn the downside, there's also no true goal of this game. The rather aimless nature is strung along by a few integral decidions that you have to make and actions you have to do in order to move on. You can't really lose the game. So there's no real goal here. There IS replay value to see what happens if you do different things, but there's not a lot of incentive when it goes against your own values to make such choices, especially in a game that is so fueled on such choices. Also, many times during the game certain places will be closed off to you. This doesn't feel like it's all that natural. It just seems like they didn't program interesting things in those areas for the entire game so only areas where you'd need to go are programmed in. It's okay, but feels a little lacking and as though it's trying to herd you in the right direction... in a game that's about exploring the world in other people's shoes. Also, a minor complain about the art. I like it, but it seems like a lot of it is just assests from some RPG maker. Not a big deal in terms of the story and atmosphere, but still a little lazy on some of it.\n\nOverall? Greyfox is a fun, interesting little game. It'll probably only last you one to two hours to finish... which means you'll either want to achievement hunt or idle it to get the card drops. It's not for everyone, and I wouldn't call it an RPG, but if you like the concept of exploring the lives of old people and choosing their fate, then look into it. Is it worth the full 5 bucks? I would say no, personally. BUT, if you can get it for around 50 cents or less, it's definitely worth a shot. Maybe a dollar if you're really interested. It's just not long enough or deep enough to be worth full price. Greyfox gets a 5 out of 10 for being a fun, interesting little adventure where personal values and investment in the characters really pay off.","July 13, 2015","true","3.4"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","4"

It's not the worst rpgmaker game on steam, but it doesn't have much content to be interesting or give a lasting impression.\n\n\nWhat I like best in Greyfox RPG is the theme. You basically control 4 different characters in the game and make choices about whether you think they should live or die. It's an interesting mechanic and idea, especially because it's unique, but that's about the best the game has to offer.\n\nGraphics are fairly basic for this kind of game, though by no means ugly, and dialouge is just okay. Gameplay is dull though. You do little besides walk around, talk to people, and collect items. It's not a bad system by any means, but if the characters and story are bland, which in all honestly, they are, it's a bad idea to have little gameplay. Each full playthrough, if taking your time, will last about an hour or so. I did a speedrun for leftover achievements which took about 20 minutes.\n\nI would not recommend this game unless it's onsale, and even then I'd recommend it for seeing the theme of the game (which would be great for psychologial/thriller types) or for the easy 100% or trading cards. It is somewhat misleading to call it an RPG because it gives the player a certain expectation in their mind. This game, while having an interesting concept, does not utilize it to its fullest potential. At the end especially, it tries to be deep and complex, but gives no reason or explanation why the player should care. I will say though, that the 2+ hours I spent on this game was a waste of time for me.","May 6","false","2.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

This title was a bit of a special case though, since it played more like a linear novel than a traditional RPG.\n\nFirst of all there are no combat scenes, and by extension, no level ups to speak of. There is an inventory of sorts, but what you get is mostly linear to the plot progression. The game play lasts around two hours or so and there is a lot of talking involved, if visual novels are not your cup of tea, this won’t fare much better for you.\n\nIf you’re willing to look past the strange design choices, or the mediocre range of sprites used, you’ll probably get to enjoy the storyline as I did; which was a decent mix between the slice-of-life and supernatural genres.\n\nLastly, I regret to say that the game has zero replay value beyond the different endings, but it was memorable for the duration, no matter how short it was. I would recommend this to others, though only if you have nothing else to play on your backlog.","April 4","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When it says "style of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy", it means the art, and I still question that. The game is nothing like those.\n\nYou are a young woman who is excited to move to a town called Greyfox to start a new chapter of her life. When she gets there she meets a few grumpy and a few odd characters, including a strange woman. When she goes to sleep, she meets that woman in a dream. The woman asks her about being old and inserts her into the bodies of 4 different elderly residents.\n\nThe store page claims that you enter at crucial moments in their lives, which is somewhat true. What isn't true is that you make important choices. The one choice you make in each is to kill the person or not, except in one where you can kill someone else.\n\nNow these people are not great people, to be sure. One is a rude miser, another murdered her husband, another considers murdering her husband (though the end of that arc made me wonder if it was real or not) and the last is a Crazy Cat Lady that sees Santa Clause everywhere without her meds. My problem is that there is no chance to help these people be better or at least help the people around them, like the silly Chris Rock movie "Down to Earth."\n\nI think the game wanted to make a statement about being old and dying or something but all it really is asking is if you want to be a murderer or not. Even the good ending isn't the least bit satisfying. All I did was not murder people. Wow, what an achievement. Everything stayed the same!\n\nThe only good thing about this game is that afterwards you read a few newspaper clippings. If you killed someone, there is a story about it. If not, you get a story about that person's peaceful death some time later. They could have done something cool with this concept, but they didn't.

Sadly greyfox doesn't manage to deliver more than some clichee portrayals and shallow characterization.

The rest of the gameplay consists of fetch quests and triggering enough events to advance the story.\n\nWith a pricetag on it, this game feels like a cheap cashgrab.

It starts out fairly average, leaving the player to feel as if they are simply going about their character's normal life... which they are. Little will you know until later on how ironic the character's comment, "I am taking control of my life" is, in consideration of what happens next.\n\nIt doesn't take long to finish the game, but the different outcomes you can get for different, vital choices in the game encourage more than one playthrough, at least if you're curious how fate can happen differently. Overall it's pretty straightfoward though, and you get to experience life through the eyes of different people and become responsible for their fate... literally.\n\nMy favorite thing about the game is that the antagonist isn't painted in black and white; she isn't necessarily evil, even if she denies responsibility for any of the tragedies that happened (even if she is a direct influence and she is responsible for placing you in a position where you can make potentially bad choices). However, it could be argued that she is simply trying to enhance your knowledge and your perception on life... even if her reasons for doing this are unclear.\n\nEither way, it's definitely worth a playthrough or two.

It’s a lazily-designed, glorified point-and-click game dressed up as a proper role-playing game that provides a mere semblance of an actual narrative concept. The game tells the story of the residents of Greyfox—a small town inhabited mostly by the elderly and named after the big stone statue of a fox in the centre of the little village. Everyone in town seems to openly aggressive towards the player, which the game is quick to point out is as a result of their age. For some reason.\n\nThroughout the game’s short story—I saw all three endings in under two hours—age seems to be the primary theme, though none of the endings have anything to do with this. Honestly, the entire plot is a meandering, disjointed mess with no proper focus and excessive use of ex machinas do drive the proceedings. The decisions you make essentially come down to either killing a person or not killing them, with the only impact being different ending cinematics. Maybe Greyfox could win a short story contest hosted by a primary school, but as a game it’s just a frustrating mess.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, Greyfox does initially start out with a mildly interesting element of exploration. You’re presented with the eponymous town and encouraged to just explore, which is fun for a few minutes, until you realise the map is approximately the size of the average grocery store, and is filled with random NPCs who yell at you for talking to them. The game completely fails to capitalise on the sense of discovery it almost establishes, instead railroading you down a ludicrously linear corridor of short, hastily written dialogue which relies heavily on exposition. The gameplay itself is about as organic and enjoyable as checking items of a shopping list—talk to someone, then go to a specific building and click on a specific item and then go back and talk to the same person. It’s a rinse and repeat formula from which next to no enjoyment could be derived.\n\nThere’s not much else to say about Greyfox, because there’s very little to say in the first place. It’s a tiny game with no proper story or gameplay that’s really best avoided. Some may appreciate its focus on emotion, but it is no more than a short and lacklustre experience.","December 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The storyline is a bit misguiding, there isn't any "sinister secret" in the town of Greyfox. There was a tiny bit of "thought-provoking" storyline that was slightly interesting, and it was a cool concept to execute. However, the execution wasn't great, and the game wasn't all that enjoyable. All in all, Greyfox is a game that you probably shouldn't buy unless you get it for super cheap like I did (I paid around 50 cents because of a Steam coupon).","January 21","false","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Should they die?' And even if you're just playing for achievements, the text is always slow and you might accidently say to kill someone from mashing the continue button.\n\nEven with a cheap price it felt like a waste of time with no real substance to it.

For most games in this genre there is a special way how I evaluate Maker-games, but instead of showing you this list (I didn't ever wrote it down anyway) I will take this game as example...\n\nContent\nThe little driving part in the first minutes of gameplay was well designed, also was the town Greyfox. You can interact with almost every item in this game and get one or two lines with a good description about it. And then there was some hilarious moments and little details I enjoyed. But unfortunately - the game is short. One single hour in fact. But because it has three different endings it is worth to re-play it... atleast one time I think.\n\nBesides the driving part (with way too stupid AI and bad mechanics), gameplay is more offside the road. You get some little side-quests here and there, rewarded with an achievement and that's it. No mini games or puzzles... unfortunately.\n\nBut where it really leaks, is the story. The fact that you can play as different charakters and judge over their misdeeds whether they should kill themselfes or not is quite enjoyable... but was it really necessary? Killing or leaving those people doesn't feel right. What if you were able to save everyone and fix their lives again (active)... Speak to your family, show them that you aren't just an eldery ♥♥♥♥ in a retirement home... Have a last day together with your poisoned husband to bring love to 'em - a last time again. Maybe it is kitchy but better than just leave them and forget them again. I mean you won't ever get any clues how you were able to do this or why you were chosen to do so. It doesn't feel alive or reasoned. So why not? At the end it's better than nothing.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice: Okay -> You got your money spent on two or three hours; one filled with the actual story, the last one is probably filled with skipping text massages to gain the rest of the achievements... maybe wait for a sale.\n\nRating: Average -> What is there more to say? We have a interesting setting but no answers to the story... you want more in the end and unfortunately there was so much potentioal wasted... that's why for me it's just an ordinary game. Go for the achievements if you want, or else, just leave it.","August 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I understand their points, in fact, my first playthrough took me 1.3 hours - which is kinda insane, considering the $1.99 price tag, and all the poor production value involved.\n\nIt's true. Greyfox begs for a remake with better art style, character development and meaningful choices... but, to be honest, I actually liked this game. Why? Well, I got it on sale for $0.19 and while it didn't blow my mind, I think it has a good message and a lot of potential.\n\nIf you're into the art business, you may like it for inspiration.","November 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end.” ― Simone de Beauvoir, La Vieillesse\n\nGreyfox is a really short RPGMaker adventure game that tries to come as an empathy simulation with the touch of speculative supernatural motifs scattered on the side. Fair warning though: pledging catch phrases like "a town with a sinister secret" and "uncover its mysteries" that we encounter in the trailer are quite the misleading advertisement here. Whether there be any sinister secret or a mystery to uncover - or not, it sadly won't be in our heroine's power to reveal in this really, really short adventure. We are just invited for a brief experience and shooed away to carry on with our lives without much explanation.\n\nIf we are to arrange a consistent outline of events; here we have a young, dumbly cheery heroine who gets bored of her daily rush in the big city and decides to move into the retirement community of Greyfox. She comes in, greeted by a townful of dull, bitter old people without an ounce of empathy left in them and struggles through some frustrating interactions. Tired by the end of her first day, the heroine is welcomed by a mysterious old lady in the local pub only, with a sarcastic yet intriguing proposition to make: What if you could live their lives and decide their fates? By the touch of this mysterious lady, our heroine is to live an ordinary day in the lives of four town inhabitants and decide their fates eventually.\n\nLet's blurt out the truth: as far as choice and consequence games go, Greyfox isn't one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean that its trash. The game feels mysterious and deep at first, but it unravels to become quite superficial in display, limited and fractured in dialogues; and sadly rushed in its endings. On the other hand, there is also some symbolic figures and attributions to other games in the genre here and there, that may bring a brief smile when encountered. There is quite a good amount of anecdotes scattered around the little town for you to discover, alongside some interesting characters.\n\nOne primarily weak point of all display is the narrative. It is depressing, cyclical and limited in its perspective. There isn't much humor - or at least qualitative humor to lessen the burden of the subject, yet the gravity isn't concluded with a consistent argument either. The final conclusion presented by the mysterious lady about the concept of right and wrong felt a bit contradictory for my taste. Please do not go into this little adventure to come across a genuine miracle. You'll get what you pay for: a small story with one ambiguous point of view that will present you maybe something to think about. With better writing, this game could have been much, much more.\n\nGraphics are basic RPGMaker, without a notable soundtrack or any voice acting. Character designs are somewhat curious and interesting though. The first playthrough will take about an hour - one and a half at max - and the game has 3 different endings. Going for all will give you roughly 2 hours of gameplay. Oh, and it has achievements if that means anything to you. For its current price, I think its basically fair deal. If on sale; heck, why the hell not to support an indie developer struggling to create her first game?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","June 3","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like seeing an unusual mechanic used in an RPG, you'll want to look at this; otherwise, you can skip it.\nThis review will have minor spoilers throughout, but I don't think they're the sort that should ruin any of the story.\nAfter all, the storytelling mostly ruins itself.\n\nSo, you're a fairly young woman (it looks that way, anyway) who hates her life, and decides to fix that by quitting her job to move to an old folks' retirement community named Greyfox.  Arriving with no money at all, she picks up dog poop, rummages through seat cushions, steals jewelry, and buys grapes to pay for her hotel room.  But our hero gets to play, too:  after wrecking an old lady's flower garden, she gets one of the more interesting characters arrested for questionable business practices.  Was it for ethics or just lulz?  [whynotboth.jpg]  (The truth?  In this game, probably neither.)  Then a mystical Marla Singer From Fight Club shows up and gives your protagonist the power to possess geezers' bodies and kill them off.\n\nThe best of the game's humor is in the story above.  There's other jokes that are okay, but mostly it's about poop and rather repetitive.\n\nWhat makes this game special is the way it has you play the different roles.  I'm sure other games have done it (Live A Live from SNES is the closest game that comes to mind), but it's a delightful mechanic to see, and worth trying this game out just to see it.  The story arcs are short and mediocre, and desperately beg for being re-written with some depth.  The important dialog options are yes/no choices that totally prevent an in-depth analysis of morality that the game needs.\n\nThe flavor text, like of the plants, and the hidden items -- random stuff behind pillars, etc. -- are nice, but really make you wonder what the writers thought their game was supposed to be.  For a story and gameplay that's essentially all about morality and mortality, and appears to delve into deep matters, that's really all quite superficial.  The utter lack of nuance in dealing with aging is baffling (I feel like more needs to be said, but I don't know what to say:  I really mean "baffling").  You can tell what the author's real interests were:  more thought was put into the unique descriptions of plants in the game than into the philosophy that the game seems to revolve around, "You killed people: I won't make moral judgements, I just hope you learn to value life"; "you didn't kill people:  I hope you learn to value your own life" is about the extent of it.  It's all pathetically binary, and unimpressive.  The game talks of people who might "deserve to die"; it'd be far deeper if it even once considered asking the question:  what does it even mean for someone to deserve to die?  But with such shallow characters, lacking a past, a real present, or a future, and often terribly cliched, you get no chance to even think about them, let alone care about them, before the game moves on and forgets them, too.\n\nThere are other issues:  if you're the sort who looks for bugs, you'll find them.  You crash the game if you drive back the way you came.  You freeze the game if you stand in the wrong place when feeding the dog.  If you enter buildings in the wrong order, you can get the man walking the dog stuck in the corner of the map.  If you talk to people in the wrong order, you can get rid of 20 cats when you only had 10.  Magic!  There's various typos.  A few areas at the start look like they were supposed to be used for something, but were unfinished, and in their current state, are pointless and shouldn't exist.  Which brings up another point:  this game is 250MB when it should be one-twentieth that size.  This game is not extensive.  What the crap?  (Is it an RPG Maker issue? maybe)\n\nIt's worth it if you find it cheap, especially if you like a game making serious effort to not be another typical RPG.  It doesn't take long to go through (you can look at *everything* and finish it in two hours), so it's not like you're wasting your life.\nThis really needed better characters, far more depth of philosophy and exploration of the nature of mortality and age, and of moral judgement of peoples' lives.  I'm sure this was someone's first attempt at a game (well, I sure hope so).  I think if it was re-written into a Greyfox v2.0 you could have a genuine masterpiece, but as it stands, I give it a 2-out-of-10.","July 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What a great game! Except it is way too short. I see a very bright future for the developers of this game. I beat the game in 69 minutes, and it might take you up to 2 hours to get all the 16 achievements.\n\nThe game has a great story! Very interesting, and really just outright good. The gameplay isn't much. It's just walking around and interacting. Now the story is about the main character (which surprisingly, or not, I thought was a boy) and this mysterious witch-like character which makes the main character think about how horrible life is. You live in the lives of 4 different old people and experience their lives.\n\nNow, the game is truly an RPG game. You can do things ranging from stealing and old man's watch all the way down to commiting suicide as an old lady, you can do whatever you want. Moslty. Well, only if the game gives you the choice.\n\nI managed to get this game for 15p. For 15p, it is cheaper than all arcade games I know of and much longer. I mean, you can die in an arcade game, while here it's mostly about the story. The graphics are retro styled which is... okay. It is certainly understandable since it is easy to do for most developers.\n\nIf this game developer can continue to bring these great story-based games down to us, the gamers, then they'd do a good job and I'd probably buy their games all the time (as long as the reviews state positiveness).\n\nI believe you should totally give this game a try, BUT ONLY ON SALE. ONLY AT 15p will this game be worth it. If a little longer, about 4 hours, and other stuff to do then it might truly be worth it. But that's too late anyway.\nI might've scared you off, but trust me, this game is incredible and I loved 2/3 of the game. One thing I have to point out is that you're driving a BMW in the beginning for about 1 ~ 2 minutes and the car drives badly. Very badly. It is as fast, or slow, as your main character whilst walking. It's like one of those Java games you'd get on a Samsung Tocco.\n\nGet this game. But only on sale. I enjoyed the music, the story, the dialogue between some characters, etc.\n\nEDIT --\n\nMind you, it is going to take you just around 4 hours to get all achievements since you have to replay the game numerous times to get the different endings.","September 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

However, if you are looking for a game with a good or deep story/plot, loveable characters or that plays with your emotions, this one is not for you.\n\nIronically, I also found some game glitches and mistakes which I will list below in the order I found them while playing. Please be aware of some as they might "BREAK" your game and force you to reload a saved file! I will add more when I find them as I didn't finish the game yet.\n\n- Guy walking with dog in dog park always walks through you and is later stuck in the upper left corner, so you can never talk to him.\n- The playing cards on the table during Mr. Browns dream change into a meal set when you click on them from below.\n- If you want to give the dog cookie to the lonely dog in the dog park, you have to do that from the left side. Otherwise the GAME WILL BE STUCK and you have to RELOAD a saved game!!!\n- Even though you give your cats to the pirate and he takes off, he turns invisible (your path is blocked where he was standing.) and you can still talk to him. This means you can send him off again which COSTS you again! I accidentally did that and reloaded an earlier saved game as I don't know if you need the money later on or not or if you can even keep the money throughout different dreams because I didn't play it any further yet.","November 5, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Really?\n\nGraphics: + There are some added tilesets and graphics that give the game a much smoother look.\n\nSound: Ø Quite standard, even though there are some added tracks.\n\nPlayability: - There are bugs in this game, one of them actually is a case of bad scripting.\n\nGenre Type Values:\n\nStory: + Have you ever played the game Alter Ego? No? It's now a classic game in which you had to make decissions that were opening up options deeper into your life. There was a boys and a girls edition of this game and I played the game till I had no more options open... This game has, superficially some of these options, but they are quite base. You might enjoy the game, although it's very short if offers different endings (two involve some criminal decissions to be made).\n\nImmersion: Ø It's nothing too special, the story is quite nice but very short. Somehow it doesn't capture the mood of the story and thus becomes quite... well... not as entertaining as I thought it would get.\n\nCharacters: - The protagonist is... well... boldly said a bit of a bore. Yes, the job in the cubiculum might be boring, everybody longs for a change of pace, or a change of scenery. And no, the "Fate" or Moira theme of the mystery woman was a bit too overdrawn. But actually, a retirement town at an early age? Was the new job she's been prospecting for a nurse or caretaker job? Hmmm?!\n\nOverall: +/- 0  The final solution on the given contents is mediocre, the game fails in a lot of reasons in my opinion. It's both not going far enough with the resolution of the game and ends in a way with far too many open threads. The most prominent word after playing this game was... "Why?"... and there are still a lot of why's that have to find an answer.\n\nValue for Money: Fair at 99 Cents. The game has about two to three hours of gaming time, depending on the player and the breaks one might take. It actually is a fair offer for the gaming time. However the final resoulution is:\n\nNot Recommended\nBased on my gaming experience and the bugs I encountered in the game I can't recommend the game. Yes the story is at first neat, but given a closer look and trying to unwrap the background of the story. It's just a unsatisfying gaming experience. Maybe I am a bit too spoiled, but no, that is not the reason. Maybe it's just the simple fact, that it's a rushed story.","April 28","false","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The premise is really interestng as it is modern day.\n\nYou play as a young girl looking to better her life. She quits her job and moves to a town called Greyfox with no promise of a new job or even a place to live. Then you meet a strange woman who tries to deter her from staying and she leads the main character through a set of dreams where she gets to live the lives of other people in the town.\n\nOverall though, I'd recommend the game. It's short and simple, but also not very pricey. It's definitely a game to pick up and play and you can easily finish in one game session. The premise is definitely unique and a refreshing change.","July 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

DoctorowWith a style reminiscent of classic roleplaying titles, Greyfox is a story-driven game in which players control a young woman who has just recently retired from her career to live in the modest town of, aptly named, Greyfox. This game was created with RPG Maker and involves making difficult decisions while progressing, and with much more to discover throughout the township. Though rather short in duration, it is quite enjoyable, and the dialogue is impressive.\nHere are a few items that I enjoyed and found compelling about Greyfox:\n\nStory - As explained, Greyfox is centered around a young woman who is relieving herself from work for the final time to retire in a the remote town of Greyfox. The player discovers secrets within the community, as well as between its members, in a well-written adventure that spans over several periods; the dialogue and themes are fluid and interlock appropriately. This title has multiple endings and subsequent consequences depending on what the player decides to do throughout its advancement. *I do not wish to reveal too much about the story, but please reveal the spoiler text if you would like to know more a little more* As the said character, the player takes control of four elderly individuals with distinct destinies. The player then discovers the dim mysteries of each elderly individual while also completing side quests involved in the other characters’ arcs.\n\nHidden Content - From its side objectives to its references, unlike many Indie titles, Greyfox’s composition is established on subtlety. Because of this, exploration is highly encouraged; the game only takes about an hour to complete the story entirely while interacting with most things in the world, but there is so much more to unearth in the relationships between the various people and timelines.\n\nDialogue - Greyfox, since there are no complex mechanics other than its sense of choice, heavily relies on spoken and written word. In a sense, there is a purpose and comment for and from each non-player character in this title which really entices the player to inquire from others within the world to not only progress, but to also simply enjoy what is said. As stated previously and emphasized by the opening quote, Greyfox empowers the player when it should and shuts them down when applicable; it has some powerful writing, which compliments the playstyle well. It is humorous, fun, grim, and intelligent at the points it is necessary to be.\n\nTL:DR - Beginning this title, I was skeptical with the story hook. However, it did not take long for the lore to engulf my entirety, as I interacted with nearly everything I could with glee simply to see what text would appear from either the author or the individual being spoken to. This title is extremely cheap but easy to finish totally, and is generally fun and thought-provoking throughout. I would highly recommend this title for those who enjoy story-based games as well as simple roleplaying games with choice-related elements. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

What could go wrong?\n\n\nFull ExplanationSImple game, built using RPG Maker VX Ace.\nThis game focused on storyline. And no, there's no battle scene or puzzle scene like the others.\nGreyfox purely entertain you by its story-driven experience.\n\nPROS:\n+ Multi ending. Very interesting to see a game where your decision matters.\n+ Sprite, BGM.\n+ Very little bug. Unfortunately, I found a bug while playing it (don't worry, not an annoying one)\n+ Well writen storyline.\nThe very core of this game is the story. While I found it interesting, the story itself is very philosophical, means not everyone can enjoy it.\nSometime, some of you would think, "what's the purpose of this game by playing in somebody story? I want to know what's gonna happen with the main character's story after she move to Greyfox, not the story of Greyfox citizens."\n\nCONS:\n- Story.\nI like this heavy story. IMO not everyone can enjoy this one.\nProbably some of you will press ALT+F4 because you feel bored.\n\n","July 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It’s worth its price if you are into fanfic style stories.\n\nLong version:Made by a group of enthusiastic young artists, Greyfox is an anthology made on the popular RPG Maker game engine, about the concept of growing old and how most people feel about their aging.\n\nThese tales are told through the eyes of an energetic young woman who moves to the titular town, Greyfox, with the hopes of starting a new, exciting life there. But she soon finds out the town is full of grumpy old people, and with a help of an unexplained mystic, she manages to take control of four of them.\nThe scenarios after that try to tell you how not to grow miserable by your old age, further emphasised with the option to give a verdict on the lives you intrude on. This message is not always easy to spot under the clunky dialogues, but it is there.\n\nDon’t expect detailed and complex stories; unless you get lost, the entire game can be finished in about 30-45 minutes– 60-70, if you want to see all endings. Still, it’s cheap, and gives as much entertainment as one would expect for this price.","September 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a generic RPG-maker game, so not much gameplay difference here. As for the story, it's short and understandably simple. It follows a "god-for-a-day" theme following 4 residents of the town.\n\nFor what it is, it's alright. 1.8 hours of generic RPG-Maker. That being said, it's not inspired by Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 3. That's a horrible little niche tactic these games are using, simply because they "look retro". In fact, it doesn't even have any fighting in it, nor' any stats of any kind other than money (which acts as a plot device for the most part). Don't be fooled by these tactics. Always wait a while when buying a RPG Maker game because that single sentence "inspired by Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3" is over-used and usually absolute BS.\n\nI'm being generous when I say it's a 6/10. It's very short, simple, and overall anticlimatic. That being said, it's a good 1 1/2 hour distraction, including 100% achievements. 1 or 2 of the achievements are pretty obscure, though.

A music CD from a superstore, some food, maybe some fruit juice. But what about 5 unique perspectives on growing older and dealing with it? That kind of thing doesn't come cheap, but that's exactly what this game provides. I got this game for mere cents on sale, and I'd say I payed too little. While Greyfox is an RPG, it's more like a visual novel in a RPG style. Frankly, I really like that. I enjoy RPG stylization, but not some RPG elements generally. Greyfox makes the best with the limits of RPG Maker, and stands out as a unique title with a extremely thought-provoking story.","October 31, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After doing a bit of exploring around town, talking to the residents, you come across a mysterious woman who talks about seeing life through someone else’s eyes, then she vanishes. Not thinking any further of this, you head to your room at the inn to turn in for the night.\n\nAs you wake up, you find yourself in a strange place with that mysterious lady. Your “heroine” is suddenly all wrinkled up and confuse about what happened to her. The mysterious lady will then ask you how you feel about old age, one of the main theme this game keep bringing up. Depending on your answer, you will taking be at the control of some of the resident of Greyfox, seeing what they see and deciding of their fates.\n\nDesign\n\nAs you will quickly notice, this game is pretty basic when it comes to a RPG maker spawn. A few element look like customized assets but there’s not too many of them. The town itself is small, but beautiful. Greyfox is the only area where you’ll be traveling into, aside for the little street map that precedes you entering the town, you’re boxed in there.\n\nUI are kept to a minimum with only an inventory box, and an option to save and quit the game. There also a window to keep track of your cash, but given how little use it has through the game, its almost useless.\n\nWhile this game is fairly short and easy to complete, it does offer multiple endings. Your actions throughout the game’s course will dictate which ending you will be getting. Seeing all the endings will require 3 playthroughs. Before you claim that it will be a daunting task to accomplish, just note you can see it all and obtain all the achievements in less than 2 hours. Your first run of the game might take you longer if you chose to fully explore and interact with everyone and everything, but after that, you can just go for the story triggers and finish this game in about 30 minutes or less.\n\nAs the author mentioned on the kickstarter page for this project, the concept inspiration came from their own life, living in a “retirement” town similar to what depicted in the game. What disappoints me is that this game could have been a great thing, it seem full of potential,  it touches on topics not often bought up in video games, but alas after playing through multiples times to get all the achievement, it felt lackluster.  The characters may have been inspired by real-life people, but here they felt generic and lacking depth. Each character could had a much deeper story, more events to unravel. Instead we just get treated to a point and click visual novel.\n\nGameplay\n\nGreyfox is your non-combat flavor of RPG. So no random battles, grinding, dungeons or challenging boss battles. Instead you take control of four different town residents and guide them through their “tough” choice. By tough choice, i mean a decision between yes and no more oft than not. Do you put your avatar out of their misery by killing them off or do you let Father Time take care of it for you. Certainly brings a question of morality but given how bland and shallow they are scripted, you barely get any attachment to any of them. If killing them off meant to bring a shock value of any kind, it missed its mark by a long shot.\n\nYou can interact with just about any object found in the game which is good to see that a lot effort went into making this possible. If you’re looking to get all the achievement, you will need to check everywhere for hidden stuff. Some items found make getting some achievements impossible to attain unless you get them. Overall this might prolong the duration of your first run of the game, but ultimately  it acts like filler to give you something else to do in this short game rather than always going from point A to point B.\n\nThe effort put in this project is real, but somehow, it feels more like a PSA to raise awareness on how many seniors people can have it difficult in their old age, rather than a video game. It does a good job at this. Most people probably know an old scrooge who hates and is hated by everyone around him, or that crazy cat lady who just seems even crazier when she’s off her meds.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRegardless of what ending you get, it all seems like it was all a dream. The good ending sees you waking up in your bedroom to the sound of a blaring alarm clock. The bad ending sees you locked in the loony bin, perhaps because killing all these people in your dream snapped your sanity last straw. The so-so ending finds you in therapy with a psychiatrist who believes you imagined everything and the town of Greyfox might just be a figment of your vivid imagination and ups the dosage of your medication.\n\nRegardless of its brevity, Greyfox did entertain me for a little while, if you like a short story game that doesn’t require to much thinking to get through, then you’d probably like this game. You don’t need to be a hardcore completionist to get all the achievements, a few might be a bit cryptic at first, but just in case you’re stumped you can always check out the guide in the community section.\n\nWith this in mind, I give this game a final rating of 6/10","January 31","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/recommended/341310/","djforekast","Forekast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/","76 products in account","A Short But Entertaining RPG Maker TitleLet me start this review off by saying that I actually enjoy playing these little RPG Maker titles regardless of how in depth or simplistic they are as a whole.  The entire game can be completed in under 30 minutes if you really gruel through the game with a walkthrough / guide.  I finished it two times (paying attention the first time, and grueling for achievements the second) in under 80 minutes.\n\nStory Line\nGreyfox is a game in which you (initially) control a female main character, who at the start of the game quits her "dead-end" job to move to a different (quiet) town by the name of Greyfox.  Upon arriving in the town, your character settles in by getting a room at the local Inn and exploring the town a bit.  During your explorations, you come upon a rather strange female NPC that ends up being the catalyst for the rest of the story line.\n\nAfter talking to the weird female NPC, you go to the Inn and rest.  At this point, you're sent into a series of 4 different "dream" sequences / stories.  In each dream, you control a different character, explore and learn more about that particular character.  At the end of each dream, you are tasked with making a choice which impacts the main plot (to an extent).  These choices also correspond to the different achievements for the game, if you're interested in that.\n\nOnce you complete all 4 dream sequences, you are returned to your main female character for the final time, in which weirdo lady says a few things to you and the game ends.\n\nSPOILER: After completing the game, I think that the real message behind it is that things may not always be as they seem, and that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Take the time to view things from the opposing perspective and think carefully before you make (blanket) statements in your life.  That's essentially what I took away from it, maybe a bit more in depth but I won't bore you with that.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is just like any other RPG Maker project, except there's no fighting or anything of that sort.  Mostly exploring, interacting, and making decisions.\n\nControls\nI believe this game works with a gamepad, but I just used my arrow keys and the 2-4-6-8 keys + space bar / enter.  Easy enough and since the game is short, it's not really tedious.  WASD don't work for this game, so be aware of that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI bought this game as part of a bundle of other JRPGs and so far I'm happy with my purchase.  I don't really see the hate for this game.  Yeah, some typos here and there, nothing groundbreaking in terms of story or gameplay, but I feel that it accomplishes what it set out to do.\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG Maker titles, short gameplay, no grinding battles, and a somewhat thought provoking story line - check this title out.\n\nIn closing, do I recommend Greyfox?  Absolutely, especially if it's on sale.\n\nI got my money's worth out of it, and plus I can sell the cards so it's like I actually got paid a few cents to play the game.  That's a win / win if you ask me.\n","February 14","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Extremely short. RPG Maker games are being pumped out pretty quick and they are starting to all feel same-same.\n\nI believe I purchaed this game at 96% off, no doubt seeing that the cards will mean that I'll make the money back on the game (don't you love how Steam does this every now and then?). Achievements is a plus as I do like hunting for extras within a game and sometimes this provides some replayability. Well, I played it, twice (to get all of the achievements) and noticed that I still had a single card drop left. This is a short game. At full price, I'd feel ripped off.\n\nThe game concepts were good and I'd wish they could have extended it somehow or made it more branching (as compared to kill/not kill). It could also be a bit darker, at least it would have made you think about the choices you were making a bit more.\n\ntl;dr - If it's only a few cents and you're a card trader or achievement hunter, go for it. If you're after a great game then you'll be found wanting.","September 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Greyfox really took me out of my FPS, 3rd person action adventure game trance and placed me in the Greyfox world full of secrects and mystery. I can't play one scenrio without going back to play the other one to see what the outcome will be. On most RPG games you pick who you really want or need to talk to the most.\n\nIn Greyfox I want to converse with everyone I encounter. You never know what the outcome will be when you talk to people.

It doesn't matter if it was an RPG Maker game, this isn't an RPG. This is an Adventure game. And further more, evoking the names of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III/VI simply because it was made with a product that can enable reproduction of similar styles in mass quantities is ridiculous and uncalled for.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's trite. The "truth" about this town is that it is uninteresting. The town is generic and shows nothing other than there are a few bad apples. There are always bad apples in every town.\n\nWas the point of making this game to show that people are mistreating the elderly? If so, the point wasn't made well.\n\nIt's a decent enough concept with some potentially well-intentioned ideas, but Lesley Dodd didn't go far enough with it.","September 26, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wandered around talking to everybody and the game didn't really give me any hints as to what I was supposed to do. The game can also be glitchy as you can't delete any of the letters in the hospital section and trying to go back from where you came in the car results in a crash. Overall a decent game that I would reccomend if you have time to kill.","July 18, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short? Yeah. Depressing? Very. But those really add to the games' atmosphere. By the end of the hour and twenty minutes I put into this game, I felt like I knew most of the main charectars and could navigate the town. The cheeriness in the game is what makes the sad parts worth it. True, the trading cards didn't work for me and I didn't realise there was a sprint or an inventory system until the end, but other than that the game tells a great story about seeing the world through the eyes of those around you.","July 18, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I however wouldn't recommend that you buy this game at full price, as 4.99€ seem a bit extreme.\n\nThe game is a typical 2D RPG game, with very simple controls and the graphics are what you can expect from this kind of game. The game has a short storyline attached to it, which will take you about 1 hour to complete, if you dont rush your way through the game that is. I liked the game for what it is, and I would say the storyline was a bit different from other games I have played.\n\nOh and the game has different endings, depending on how you choose to play out the game ;)\n\n\nFor achievement hunters. It's a relatively easy game to get 100% in, as it took me about 2½ hours to do. It can however be done alot faster, because I didn't even start looking at the achievements untill I was done with my first playthrough, and I guess if you abuse the save options a bit, and plan ahead, it won't really take you long.","July 18, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the time of writing this review, I paid 19 cents for it, but the full 5 dollars would have been worth it.\n\n-Pros-\n\nI enjoyed the means of story telling and was wowed by the great character development.\n\nChoices were extremely important to its story.\n\nMusic was also really well done. Its dark tones really brought the story to life.\n\nGraphics kinda reminded me of old school pixel graphics with HD makeover. Which is nice. A lot of the sprites were well done as well.\n\nPerfect length for this style of game.\n\n-Cons-\n\nDiscovered a game breaking bug by accident in the very first place you can move\n\nSometimes felt like I had no idea how to figure out what to do next; Somethings were a bit confusing.\n\n-Summary-\n\nHonestly this was an awesome game, however limited it was on the engine it was on. In my opinion story telling is the most important thing a game needs, and this nailed it on the head. If you like visual novels, it's quite similar in style, but kinda in a RPG style look. It had the perfect legnth for its story and I might go back to try to get the other endings as well.\n\nIf you want a short game with an awesome story, this is it.\n\n\n","July 19, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a history with RPG Maker games, and checked out its page.  I don't like seeing many of the harsh reviews people have because of poor writing or the way some people use their RPG Maker games as a sort of "fan-fiction," ripping off ideas from other media instead of being completely creative and fresh.\nThat being said, I noticed that I could buy the one game for 49 cents on sale, or buy 4 games in this bundle for the same price.  Honestly, who could complain about such a cheap game?  So I bought it and the same day played the smallest game on the list, Greyfox RPG.\nFirst off, I couldn't call this a JRPG for anything, and I could barely call it an RPG in the sense I am familiar with RPGs.  (Although, in the sense of you playing the role of a person, this IS an RPG.)  It is just like the description says.  You move to a town called Greyfox where you meet a mysterious woman and you get to live the lives of 4 old people in the town.  You decide what happens at the end of their lives, and can possibly solve a mystery or two along the way.  I have only played through once so far, getting the "bad" ending, but I liked its premise.  I played a Psychological-Horror type game with RPG Maker when I was a lot younger, and appreciated the use of the program for story-telling, rather than a traditional "kill enemies and level-up" RPG game.\nThere are a few little secrets to find, a little bit of humor, and many "What exactly is going on here?" moments that make you feel like you're in the main character's shoes.  So far, I can't say I would spend the full $1.99 on it, but if you ever come across another sale where the game is 49 cents or is in a bundle with other games dropping the price down to around 12 cents, pick it up.  It's a fun little gem, perfect for playing on a night where you wake up at 2am and can't get back to sleep, or any time you have an hour to kill.","January 4","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However when I finally figured out what I had to do the twist in the story was really well done. I must say this is a very unique game with some ideas that I dont think I have ever seen in any other games. The points of view and perspective of the story made the game fantastic to play, I would recommend playing this game purely because of the story to the game, it is really quite fasinating and interesting to watch everything that goes on in the game and for the small price the game costs I would definately say that it is worth the play.","November 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tackles a difficult topic (death and getting old) and I think it does it marvelously.\n\nThe game features 3 endings, pixel jrpg-like graphics, is set in one town and is really short (3,5 hours are enough to get all endings and achievements). Because of that the story is compacted, with bits and pieces of information scattered around the place. Despite the limited forms of expression the feeling the game delivers is genuine. But what is is all about? Judging. You get to judge people on their life choices. Surprisingly, your choices are not really judged, although there is responsibility.\n\nIf you don't mind the graphics and are up for a bit of thinking, I strongly recommend this game. It's super cheap anyway.","November 30, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You decide to move to a small town northwest of where you start the game.When you get into the city you have to wait for a room at the inn. You can only make that happen if you talk to most of the grumpy people in town and then go to the pub. A lady with a sigar will sit on the left side of the room, alone. You talk to her and she explains that every person here is old and grumpy. Then she says something about viewing the world from different people's eyes. When you walk out of the pub your room is free and you can go to sleep to progress the story.  Well with that being said i will move on to the pro's and cons.\n\n\nPro's\n-original\n-very amusing\n-very good story\n-multiple endings\n-your choices effect the game\n-really cheap when on sale\n-achievements are fun to get\n\n\nCons -when not on sale it is pretty expensive\n-game is not that long (2.5 hours max with the achievements)\n\n\nWell i really recommend tis game...WHEN IT IS ON SALE!\nBecause, i dont think this game is worth the five bux for a story that only lasts 2.5 hours.\nBut when it is on sale.\nGET IT.","January 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That kind of thing doesn't come cheap, but that's exactly what this game provides. I got this game for mere cents on sale, and I'd say I payed too little. While Greyfox is an RPG, it's more like a visual novel in a RPG style. Frankly, I really like that. I enjoy RPG stylization, but not some RPG elements generally.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ducktastic24/recommended/341310/","ducktastic24","Ducktastic24","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ducktastic24/","58 products in account","Overview: Greyfox is a short point-and-click (without the click) adventure game. You take on the role of a young woman who is fed up with life in the big city and decides to move to a sleepy little town called Greyfox. However, shortly after arrival, you find yourself learning more about certain members of the community than you ever thought possible.\n\nPlot: The plot is simple but creative. You take on the lives of some of the townsfolk, granting you the ability to make a critical decision for each of the four residents you play as. I really like the concept, and the fact that there multiple endings depending on your choices, but I feel like they definitely could have taken it a step further. Only one of the four characters gives you an additional decision, although it has no bearing on the ending. It would have been nice to expand range of influence you have over more minor decisions and see those choices reflected in the ending. The endings, too, leave something to be desired. They consist of very short cutscenes that briefly depict how your decisions ultimately affected you. While you do get a snippet about each of the characters you played as, I think it would have been more interesting to have a couple of additional cutscenes from their perspectives or that of their familes/friends/townsfolk.\n\nGraphics/Interface: The graphics aren’t the super high quality stuff that many of the top video games feature, but it’s certainly not a drawback. The town of Greyfox is cute and set up with consideration that encourages – and sometimes demands – careful exploration of your surroundings. I personally found the controls a little bizarre, using the arrow keys/enter after being so used to WASD/mouse, but it’s not a big deal.\n\nReplay Value: The alternate endings provide at least three iterations of the game – more if you missed certain achievements. However, once you’ve played through all the possibilities (~2 hours, maybe more if you’re struggling to nab those last couple achievements and you’re determined not to look it up), you’re probably not going to play it again.\n\nMy recommendation: It’s an interesting premise and perfect if you don’t have the time to get sucked into a really involved game. I bought it on sale for $0.19, and for 2 hours of entertainment, I think it was worth it. I personally wouldn’t spend $5 on it, though.","October 22, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can about an hour to an hour and a half of gameplay from this, more if you want the 'chieves, but the game is riddled with issues. In the beginning, going immediately south upon getting in your car will crash your game with a missing sound error. Attempting to feed a dog in the dog park a biscuit while standing below it will break your game as it tries to move the dog into the spot your character is occupying. Confusing objectives and no way to check your progress in parts will leave you wandering around aimlessly. There are also boring side choices in the game, that in the end don't matter, as the only 3 endings are affected by who you kill and nothing else.\n\nOverall?

You decide to move to a small town northwest of where you start the game.When you get into the city you have to wait for a room at the inn.

The points of view and perspective of the story made the game fantastic to play, I would recommend playing this game purely because of the story to the game, it is really quite fasinating and interesting to watch everything that goes on in the game and for the small price the game costs I would definately say that it is worth the play.","November 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Extremely short. RPG Maker games are being pumped out pretty quick and they are starting to all feel same-same.\n\nI believe I purchaed this game at 96% off, no doubt seeing that the cards will mean that I'll make the money back on the game (don't you love how Steam does this every now and then?). Achievements is a plus as I do like hunting for extras within a game and sometimes this provides some replayability. Well, I played it, twice (to get all of the achievements) and noticed that I still had a single card drop left. This is a short game. At full price, I'd feel ripped off.\n\nThe game concepts were good and I'd wish they could have extended it somehow or made it more branching (as compared to kill/not kill). It could also be a bit darker, at least it would have made you think about the choices you were making a bit more.\n\ntl;dr - If it's only a few cents and you're a card trader or achievement hunter, go for it.

I have a history with RPG Maker games, and checked out its page.  I don't like seeing many of the harsh reviews people have because of poor writing or the way some people use their RPG Maker games as a sort of "fan-fiction," ripping off ideas from other media instead of being completely creative and fresh.\nThat being said, I noticed that I could buy the one game for 49 cents on sale, or buy 4 games in this bundle for the same price.  Honestly, who could complain about such a cheap game?  So I bought it and the same day played the smallest game on the list, Greyfox RPG.\nFirst off, I couldn't call this a JRPG for anything, and I could barely call it an RPG in the sense I am familiar with RPGs.  (Although, in the sense of you playing the role of a person, this IS an RPG.)  It is just like the description says.  You move to a town called Greyfox where you meet a mysterious woman and you get to live the lives of 4 old people in the town.  You decide what happens at the end of their lives, and can possibly solve a mystery or two along the way.  I have only played through once so far, getting the "bad" ending, but I liked its premise.  I played a Psychological-Horror type game with RPG Maker when I was a lot younger, and appreciated the use of the program for story-telling, rather than a traditional "kill enemies and level-up" RPG game.\nThere are a few little secrets to find, a little bit of humor, and many "What exactly is going on here?" moments that make you feel like you're in the main character's shoes.  So far, I can't say I would spend the full $1.99 on it, but if you ever come across another sale where the game is 49 cents or is in a bundle with other games dropping the price down to around 12 cents, pick it up.  It's a fun little gem, perfect for playing on a night where you wake up at 2am and can't get back to sleep, or any time you have an hour to kill.","January 4","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a relatively easy game to get 100% in, as it took me about 2½ hours to do. It can however be done alot faster, because I didn't even start looking at the achievements untill I was done with my first playthrough, and I guess if you abuse the save options a bit, and plan ahead, it won't really take you long.","July 18, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Greyfox I found to be memorable in it's delivery, and stood out in it's attempt to tackle some uncomfortable subject matter not often spoken of in the day to day, never mind a game world based on real life.\n\nPros:\n+  Encourages exploration\n+  Enjoyable to play through the story at least once\n+  Makes you think about stuff\n+  Music is atmospheric and fits the setting\n+  Characters are just developed enough to be engaging\n+  The environments and people in them seemed fairly realistic, and alluded to real world issues like elder abuse, familial drama/estrangement, and...  hoarding cats, I suppose?\n+  Life or Death decisions change the way the ending plays out\n+  Has a wittiness at times, and more mature jokes (nothing super racy)\n+  You get bang for your buck if you catch it on sale\n\nNeutrals/Cons:\n-  Linear in design, with some flexibility for trying out new things\n-  Short, which doesn't leave as much room for development\n-  Haven't played an RPG Maker game before, but the contrast between the "hand-drawn" and "pulled" sprites was pretty noticeable I guess? Also, the pointy-eared/elven priest dude kinda broke my immersion\n-  Could have had a bit more closure on the protagonist's life following their ending\n\nOverall:\n7.5  to 8 out of 10\n\nGreyfox I would say is a game that is more about the experience than it is about gameplay, which is a key element in point-and-click adventures. It is not pretentious like some Indie games out there, and really tries to do something different...  an aspect certain gamers may appreciate more than others.\n\nWarning for potentially deep reflections on life and the aging process, numerous references to bodily waste, and stripping grandpa.","July 18, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/recommended/341310/","djforekast","Forekast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/","76 products in account","A Short But Entertaining RPG Maker TitleLet me start this review off by saying that I actually enjoy playing these little RPG Maker titles regardless of how in depth or simplistic they are as a whole.  The entire game can be completed in under 30 minutes if you really gruel through the game with a walkthrough / guide.  I finished it two times (paying attention the first time, and grueling for achievements the second) in under 80 minutes.\n\nStory Line\nGreyfox is a game in which you (initially) control a female main character, who at the start of the game quits her "dead-end" job to move to a different (quiet) town by the name of Greyfox.  Upon arriving in the town, your character settles in by getting a room at the local Inn and exploring the town a bit.  During your explorations, you come upon a rather strange female NPC that ends up being the catalyst for the rest of the story line.\n\nAfter talking to the weird female NPC, you go to the Inn and rest.  At this point, you're sent into a series of 4 different "dream" sequences / stories.  In each dream, you control a different character, explore and learn more about that particular character.  At the end of each dream, you are tasked with making a choice which impacts the main plot (to an extent).  These choices also correspond to the different achievements for the game, if you're interested in that.\n\nOnce you complete all 4 dream sequences, you are returned to your main female character for the final time, in which weirdo lady says a few things to you and the game ends.\n\nSPOILER: After completing the game, I think that the real message behind it is that things may not always be as they seem, and that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Take the time to view things from the opposing perspective and think carefully before you make (blanket) statements in your life.  That's essentially what I took away from it, maybe a bit more in depth but I won't bore you with that.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is just like any other RPG Maker project, except there's no fighting or anything of that sort.  Mostly exploring, interacting, and making decisions.\n\nControls\nI believe this game works with a gamepad, but I just used my arrow keys and the 2-4-6-8 keys + space bar / enter.  Easy enough and since the game is short, it's not really tedious.  WASD don't work for this game, so be aware of that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI bought this game as part of a bundle of other JRPGs and so far I'm happy with my purchase.  I don't really see the hate for this game.  Yeah, some typos here and there, nothing groundbreaking in terms of story or gameplay, but I feel that it accomplishes what it set out to do.\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG Maker titles, short gameplay, no grinding battles, and a somewhat thought provoking story line - check this title out.\n\nIn closing, do I recommend Greyfox?  Absolutely, especially if it's on sale.\n\nI got my money's worth out of it, and plus I can sell the cards so it's like I actually got paid a few cents to play the game.  That's a win / win if you ask me.\n","February 14","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/recommended/341310/","deadstanley","DeadStanley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/","142 products in account",""Greyfox" is a brief interactive short story that can be played out over the course of an hour or two. The game deals with issues of mortality and ethical values, which you explore as you play as a young woman who up and leaves her current life in order to start anew in the town of Greyfox.\n\nThis title falls very short in terms of storytelling, which is unfortunate because the gameplay is nearly non-existent. The moment you start the game you are thrust into your character's life with essentially zero backstory. The only other thing you will learn about your character will depend on the ending you wind up with, which will depend on the major decisions you make during the game.\n\nSo, the majority of time you will play through the present day events of four elderly people. As with your own character, you will learn very little of these people. You will guide them through their current circumstances and in the end make a life or death choice. The huge problem with this game is that there is so little character development that when you come to this final choice, you really don't care which outcome you choose. There are other games out there, such as "To The Moon", which do a much better job at creating an emotional link between the characters and yourself. "Greyfox" just doesn't have the same effect.","January 22","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is simple enough, the gameplay was focused on finding objects and talking to people and was very intuitive, there was simple path options, the text is realistic, does not read as too dramatic, manipulative or too "edgy".\n\nThis game is short, but had effort put to it and it shows, as an experiment and for the price I would say its an okay game with a story that is different, though not that exciting or suspenseful, but it was creative and in the end that counts for a lot.","January 3","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing very complicated about it; you interact with objects and NPC's to discover more about them, the town, and what exactly it is that's going on. The story is interesting and a bit humorous, the soundtrack is simple but pretty, and there's just enough going on to keep you interested in what happens to everybody. Unfortunately, the game is quite short, and even with 2 hours under my belt I've played through it three times and gotten all of the achievements. For the full price, that's not really worth it.\n\n6 / 10, but only due to simplicity and extremely short length.

My point is that the story is short-ish but more than enough, for this price at least. I don't want to spoil anything so I am just going to say that "Greyfox" teaches you a(n) (somewhat important in my opinion) lesson about life. I got it in a bundle for maybe 10 cents.

Short game, took me about an hour for a single playthrough, but would be willing to go through it again making different choices. Gives a perspective on elderly life. Mechanically sound, no strange bugs or errors, but there are a couple of weird "sticking" points throughout the game where it's unclear what to do next. Focusing on a unique subject in games, Greyfox is one of those games that is interesting to play at least once. Additionally, I'd say it's a good game to understand how games can be works of art in and of themselves, as compared to movies or books.","June 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
