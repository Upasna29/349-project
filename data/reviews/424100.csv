These developers took the risk of heresy to make a heliocentric simulator. It actually has the sun in the center of the solar system! Now that we have Celestrion, Copernicus' work will not be in vain.\nOn a more serious note, the game itself is pretty bare-bones in presentation but nevertheless reasonably priced.\n\nAdvantages:\n-Pretty cool looking graphics overall; the background is rough though.\n-It's accessible, cheap, and exactly what it says on the tin.\n-Basic but fitting music and sound. It actually has a good ambiance to it.\n\nDisadvantages:\n-May face religious prosecution from inquisitors.\n-Would not recommend sunscreen while on Venus.\n-It's a neat widget but doesn't have the most replayability. I feel like it could be a lot more interactive than it currently is.\n\nSuggestion:\n-Make the rotations of the planets affected by time, not just their revolutions.\n\nConclusion: It's cheap, basic, but nevertheless enjoyable simulator. It could do with a little polishing though.\n\nWould orbit again.","January 22","true","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","9","10","8","0"

Saturn (my main) is really hard to play, and has poor frame data and movement speed. If they buffed saturn, I might give this another go.\n\nPros-\n-Fast, exciting gameplay\n-epic music\n3. Lots of cool things to do; replayability\n\nCons-\n-Jupider is OP\n-No controller support\n-Hard to learn\n-No techs","February 27","false","0.1"," 0 of 29 people (0%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","0","0","29","11","2"
