It's not about military power of the Nazi, Red Army or even RAF. It's about a person who try to survive in the war that consumes many other. But of course, you will be joining the Allies in the war against the German. From the desert of Tobruk to the plains and forest of Europe, you fight for your survival.\n\nAir Conflicts: Secret Wars has good gameplay, it's just since the game is about a person, it doesn't have so many great battles and some of it are stealth mission. Still, it's a challenges, not a bad game for me. The graphics is quite good, the sounds are good and the music is kinda good.

This is not a simulator, flight controls are very simple. Missions consist of destroying ground targets, taking out rival aircraft, protecting allies and picking up supplies. I found all the missions to be quite similar after a few rounds. The planes are incredibly easy to control, so you can start divebombing and doing flybys of every tower in no time. The bombs and rockets are a little more difficult to use than the machine guns. I found myself having to loop around and try to hit targets multiple times.\n\nThe cutscenes are voice overs over well drawn still frames. The graphics overall could have used some polish. This is definitely a budget game, in that most objects are quite blocky. The resolution settings do not go very high, so you will most likely be playing in a lower resolution than you are used to. The voice acting is not offensive but not great. I couldn't really tell the difference between the male characters.\n\nDon't mistake this for a flight sim. If you are looking for a cheap arcade flight game, you could do worse than Air Conflict. However, the dated graphics and repetitive gameplay will not keep your attention for long.\n\nGrade: C","June 18, 2014","false","1.3"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

You play a female protagonist named DeeDee who, being a pilot smuggler gets caught up into World War II. And she serves with a man who personally flew and fought with her father in World War One. As the missions progress, the story unfolds through static cut scenes that have a pleasant cell shaded hand drawn look. Missions vary from stealthy strike missions to all out balls to the wall multi-plane dogfights. If you’re looking to play an IL-2 Sturmovik imitation, look elsewhere; this is strictly for the arcade fans. Difficulty can be toggled, but some missions are more difficult than they have any right to be. One particular mission toward the end involved destroying fleeing vehicles through the city of Berlin. Tall buildings made it difficult to get decent bombing runs or rocket attacks, and it took me over 50 tries to get it. (But at this point, being so close to the end I had to finish it!)\n\nGraphics are okay, serving the purpose. They look console-ish, and the voice acting is pretty much done by three people. One guy doing four different men’s voices with different accents is cheesy to the point of being hilarious. The music score, on the other hand, is polished and grandiose. It’s on par with a Stephen Spielberg Hollywood feature. I even looked during the end credits to find out who the composer was. Sadly, he was not credited.\nThe game offers multiplayer, but servers were pretty scant. I did find one each time I logged on, and this is probably a testament to the game’s age. It was fun, but mostly consisted of aerial jousts with rockets being launched at each other. A lot of my kills were dumb luck.\n\nI won’t be in a hurry to play the original Air Conflicts or Air Conflicts: Vietnam, but if you have a few bucks left in your Steam Wallet during a Summer or Winter Steam sale, you could do worse.\n","January 18, 2015","true","38.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Flak? Anti-Air? Anyone?] that they probably were a little scared of how the second would turn out) but they managed to make this game a very, VERY, good budget game, especially for $10.\nI'm not sure what people are talking about with the low resolution stuff. These past two weeks I've been able to play it in full 1920 x 1080, no iffy decals or anything. Though, on my laptop (I used to play this on a laptop, ran pretty well actually) I encountered a bug where the text, some of the logos, and most of the decals were very, very, low res. Didn't happen to me when I played it on my desktop, though.\nI'll cover a few key parts:\nGameplay - For a budget game (budget game in this context is something that doesn't have EA throwing money at it) the gameplay is excellent, furthurmore with it only being $10. It CAN be repetitive and frustrating at times, but it was still a fun game, for me at least.\nVoice acting - Lemme let you in on a little secret I bet a lot of people didn't notice. They had, I believe it was four or five (can't remember) voice actors, for about eight or so characters. Don't believe me? Watch the credits. Despite this, those voice actors deserve some (a lot) of credit. Personally I heard some similarites, never suspected it was because they were all the same voice actor. I just thought it was (no offense) the English accent.\nGraphics - In my opinion, 9.5/10. You must remember this is "AIR conflicts" not "GROUND conflicts" they put a lot of work into the planes to make them detailed. Seriously, the machine gun bullets ACTUALLY shoot out of the machine guns! (This is a big deal because this is pretty rare among air sims under $20) The ground graphics were sacrificed, of course. I was able to fly through some of the buildings to a point without exploding, as an example. The building textures seem low res as well. But if you want this game for it's ground graphics, you really should spend your $10 on a FPS shooter.\nCamera - VERY well suited for this game. You can change camera locations, such as 3rd person, in-cabin without the cockpit visible, in-cabin with the cockpit visible. There's also a follow bomb/missile ability.\nMissiles are NOT lock-on/tracking. You must manually aim them. As said in-game, they did not have tracking missiles during WW2.\nMy experience was probably made better by the fact that I have a joystick (Logitech Extereme 3D Pro)\n\nAll in all, the game is worth the $10, in my opinion.","March 9, 2015","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an arcade turn-and-burn WW2 flight game with some interesting story line rarely covered in WW2 games: the Balkan conflict, and how the resistance in Poland, Azerbaijan, and other eastern European countries fought the Nazi invasion. You play the daughter of a WW1 Ace, "Deedee" as you attempt to work your way out of Africa into Eastern Europe, attempting to work your way through the war, as sort of a mercenary / smuggler for hire of the Allied side, along with your mentor Tommy (who flew with your father) and Clive, the best mechanic / drunk. You start working for Flight Captain McIntyre of the RAF, but you'll end up helping a lot fo different factions on the Allied side, not all of whom are that friendly, as you attempt to survive WW2.\n\nThe game has quite good graphics, and fully supports high resolution screens, as well as all sort of eye candy, from bump maps to high polygon models to post processing effects, and more. However, your windows need to use the regular DPI instead of any enlargement (125% or 150% under display) or you won't be able to run the config program as you can't see the buttons. Sound is quite good.\n\nThe game play has variety of mission types, such as eliminate all enemies. Though it's the timed missions, as well as the "plinking" missions that are the most frustrating. As an example of timed mission, you have to destroy advancing German tanks within 2 minutes (or they'll fire upon the convoy and you'll fail the mission).  Another example is the "plink the parachutes" mission... German transports are bringing in paratroopers. You need to shoot down the paratroopers. Yes, you are here to shoot parachutes (WTF?!)  And you need to shoot dozens and dozens of them... until you killed at least 12% of those darn parachutes. There's another one where "kill 70 soldiers on the ground with bombs or strafing". YIKES.\n\nThat parachute missions is the most hideous I've encountered so far, with the "kill 70 soldiers on ground" a close second. And I don't mean the objective, but the sheer frustration attempting to finish such. The parachute mission lasts 12 minutes, and you are barely informed of how you're doing. You simply keep shooting parachutes until you get a 'pass' or 'fail'. And yes, the paratroopers will scream as they fall from the sky. Same with ground soldiers you kill.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some missions that are more... subtle, such as the "smuggle" missions where you are trying to stay undetected (with a stealth meter), or a rescue / recon mission about finding a signal (radio finder blips). There's also a mission or two where you simply pilot a captured Luftwaffe plane and fly over enemy territory for recon... and hopefully not get caught by air patrols. That can get tense.\n\nDepending on the aircraft you fly (and you fly a lot, from WW1 fighter to civilian transport, from fighters to fighter bombers, even a B-24... ) you get guns, bombs, and maybe rockets. The bombs and rockets are unlimited but takes time to regen. The guns are unlimited too, but won't fire if overheated.  If you can hit a plane with a rocket, you get insta-kill, but obviously that'll be quite difficult. Hit ground targets with bombs or rockets, but you need to be VERY precise... or you don't get the kill (and fail the objective). The bigger planes have additional turrets and tail guns, and those fire automatically. You can even take control fo the turrets and let AI fly for a while. Bombers may be able to drop salvos of bombs rather than one at a time.\n\nThere are missions set in both WW1 and WW2. The story is told from POV of Dorothy "Deedee" Derbec, who fight in the various conflicts (that you play) in WW2, but also relive the missions talked about by friends of Deedee's father in WW1.\n\nAs you complete missions, depending in kills and objective completion you gain 'stars', which you accumulate to add a point to your four attributes such as luck, leadership, armor, and damage, giving it a slight RPG flavor. This also controls what planes you can unlock, and there are more than a dozen planes from all sides: German, American, British, Russian, even a few jets and rocket powered planes, not to mention bombers, fighter bombers, and pure fighters.\n\nThe locations are interesting, at least to those accustomed to regular WW2 games, as you do a lot of fighting in Eastern Europe (but that's understandable, the developers are from Slovakia), and they mixed in quite a bit of WW2 history (or at least, hypothetical history).\n\nThe game has simplified landing... basically fly through a series of "rings" and you're considered "landed". Taking off is easy: full throttle and you'll take off.\n\nController is fully supported, and can be set to arcade or sim mode with different control schemes. There's also multiple difficulty levels to customize your game. There's also plenty of quick dogfight missions (random AI opponents) and plenty of multiplayer options.\n\nEnemy AI is not bad, as they do try to get on your tail and stay there.\n\nOverall, my impression of the game is positive, except for those painfully tedious "plinking" missions (i.e. kill paratroopers and kill 70 ground troops). I'm about 60% complete and I sincerely hope I don't run into more missions of that type. Once I got past the female narrator (female French accented English) the game is actually quite enjoyable. Enemy planes smoke and break apart convincingly, and at Rookie difficulty you generally do breeze through the missions (except for those tedious plinking missions).\n\nif you like the genre, arcade WW2 flight game, this game is quite good. Not a must play, but definitely something to try.","January 18, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The flight model/controls is highly simplified (designed for consoles) meaning you only turn up/down (pitch) and left/right. It is possible to roll the aircraft in 'simulation' mode but without rudder controls it is rather pointless.  Ammo also refills automatically.\n\nShooting down lots of enemy planes and bombing lots of tanks, soldiers etc. is pretty fun. There's a bit of variety to missions but overall you still spend a lot of time shooting down planes and bombing vehicles. The AI for enemy planes, particularly for evasive manoeuvres is just awful though.\n\nMultiplayer is so laggy it's unplayable.\n\n6/10.","January 21, 2012","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the graphics are satisfactory, and good for persons with lower end computers (single-core, 512MB graphics card), the general game play is more arcade than simulation--this isn't a sit in your ♥♥♥♥-pit and sweat it out combat (even getting the ♥♥♥♥-pit view is hard, and flying the 'chase' default is a pain).  The combat experience leaves much to be desired in regards to realism--your ammo in unlimited, your 'damage' repairs over time, and your weapons have a very generous lead tolerance when it comes to targeting enemy aircraft.\n\nThe plus side to the game is that it has a decent story-line to follow, that offers up different challenges to the player.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that offers realism in terms of flight and fight--get DOS Box and download Aces Over Europe. Otherwise, this is just an annoying want-to-be. If you are looking for a fun arcade that offers a bit of eye-candy and a tad of challenge, go ahead, and have some fun with the game.","November 25, 2013","false","0.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

There is a wide selection of different planes to choose from at the start of your missions, each having their own different stats, strengths and weaknesses. I won't spoil too much, but one of the planes is so much better than any of the others so the large choice is kind of pointless once you work it out.\n\nThere is an essence of customization when you reach certain goals, you will be granted experience points to improve your character (planes). I focused on agility and luck (which increases your critical shot chance), and this turned my plane into a little nippy bomber that could avoid pretty much any rockets!\n\nThe main story took me about 8-9 hours to complete,  and it was quite an enjoyable play through. There is plenty of re-playability in the arcade mode, which is where I spent most of my time.\n\nI would recommend this game, however if you are playing this expecting a crisp AAA experience, you will be disappointed, if you go into this with the only expectation is that you are going to fly a plane and blow stuff up, you'll enjoy it.\n\n7/10","December 11, 2014","true","31.2"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

Objectives are presented as dialogues between different characters.

Further, the player can choose between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation.

The stealth mission functionality is not as advertised - there's no "detection zone" displayed on your radar - and so certain stealth missions present a frustrating difficulty spike. There are little hints here and there of features that didn't quite get fully implemented, but still made it in somehow.\n\nBut the game is remarkably fun, because even simplified, "arcade-style" air combat can offer lots of opportunities to try a mission in a slightly different way.\n\nNo, this isn't a AAA title, but it can be highly enjoyable if you're willing to "suspend your disbelief" a bit and enjoy the ride.","November 30, 2014","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I'm not really into simulations I thought I try out the "Blazing Angels" games, but Ubisoft apparently can't make games work on Windows 7 and so far I wasn’t able to run both “Blazing Angels” games on my pc.\n\nSo I was still looking for a game to scratch that itch I was having. I then stumbled onto "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars". Looking primarily for a game that would let me fly something like prototype planes from the Second World War I thought with a title like "Secret Wars" I'd hit the jackpot.\n\nWell, after about 5 hours I'm sure of a few things:\n(0. So far I haven't seen a plane I would describe as a prototype, just the standard planes of British and Russian fighter planes and/or bombers. But this is mostly my fault for expecting something that the game probably doesn't provide. That’s the reason I’m not factoring this in my overall opinion of the game, but I thought I let you know.)\n\n1. I had to restart my campaign progression, because I couldn't find my save files after I de-installed the game, so I spent the last hour or so of my whole experience with this game getting back to where I was before.\nBut after only 5 hours I seriously couldn't drag myself through the campaign again. Story wise it progresses very slowly, since there isn't much happening inside of the mission except for a few radio messages every now and then. "Cutscenes" outside of the missions are made with a comic-like style and subtitles (although they are narrated). Everything else is pure text (mostly diary entries).\nAlso missions seem to be very repetitive (from what I've seen of the game). So far it's been pretty much about shooting other fighter planes, shooting bombers, destroying stationary ground targets, destroying moving ground targets and sometimes defending other planes by doing the before mentioned things. Although it’s maybe a bit unfair to expect more of this sort of game.\n\n2. Overall control of the planes and how keys are setup works really nice, although some advanced maneuvers, like looping or barrel-rolls don't seem to be possible. I was playing on the arcade mouse + keyboard setting, so it's maybe possible that controlling the game with a joystick or something similar might enable it.\n\n3. Shooting other planes felt like fun, although I couldn't really find a good middle way with the difficulty settings. Either I was shooting everything easily while not really getting shot at (aside from stationary AA) or I was damaged far too fast for me to enjoy the game. So while the original control and feeling for a plane is nice, it just isn’t fun for too long, when barely anything gives you a fight and what you’re doing is pretty much flying circles to get a few hits on target and repeat.\n\nOver all I could say it probably wasn't the game I was looking for (I'm much more sure it was "Blazing Angels" but that didn't work out). I should have also probably checked a few reviews or just some random campaign gameplay before I bought it.\nIt's just that the game isn't bad, maybe the story gets better after a while or the missions are more varied in the end, but to get there I don't want to go through the first missions again.\n\nAlthough I don’t have knowledge of the full game, after the 5+ hours I have no desire to play it again, because have tried to get into the game, but it just won’t click, like many other games do.\nSo no, I cannot recommend this game.","December 8, 2013","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is highly repetitive and the AI is little match for a child let alone an experienced flight sim buff.  The graphics and aircraft damage are very well done, scenery looks quite nice.  The real selling factor on this is the multiplayer which can be quite a bit of fun.  Unfortunately, the community for it has dried up a bit with the release of subsequent titles, so you're better off buying those both for a better campaign and the larger online multiplayer community.  The game's not terrible, but I just can't recommend a purchase given the draw backs and easily available alternatives.","December 21, 2013","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not try yet but i doubt It will be enjoyable  playing in simulator mode with a Gamepad. The aircraft fly well and the story so far has been entertaining as you are a girl who's father was an Ace in WW2.\n\nGraphices are nice the terrain has detailed buildings, docks, ships, tanks, vehicals the usual things you would find in a arcade sim. Have not tryed the online mutiplayer yet I hope it is as enjoyable as the single player mode.\n\nThe game and two more games of the same nature are on sale right now 75% of so you get Air Conflicts: Secret Wars, Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers & Air Conflicts: Vietnam all for $11 and some odd cents well worth it if you like these types of games.\n\nNot sure if they have coop support but if they do and anyone wants to be my wingman I would Love to give it a try just send me a msg/invite.\n\nUpdate. I have ust completed the Campain it was a blast the story telling was very good and missions well thought. There are alot of missions in the campain which is a good thing didn't want it to end to soon. After playing the game a while it really reminded me of a classic SNES game called Aces High or Wings 2 Aces High, I loved playing that game fighting the aces at the end and if your pilot died he stayed dead. You had 5 pilots each with there own unquie skills each one was skilled best for certain missions, strafing/bombing/air combat so on. This game has a few hard missions like shooting down a zillion guys parachuting out of bombers that mission took many trys to complete but it was fun. This game is a classic to me now. Well on to the next one "Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers", hope it is as enjoyable as "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars"","March 22, 2014","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
