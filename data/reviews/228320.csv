"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmeindustries/recommended/228320/","tmeindustries","The Centipede","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmeindustries/","274 products in account","Hoo boy.\n\nThe original A Valley Without Wind struck me as about the quality of a particularly impressive bit of shareware in the late 90s: horribly dated by modern standards and without 1980s retro charm (though maybe that just means it came a decade early), but at the very least technically competent. Animations were smooth (though obviously based on some simple figure rendering program like Poser), the control scheme worked, the story didn't make much sense but a lot of 90s shareware didn't so I could at least poke around with it and be vaguely amused.\n\nYou will note that I only have 19 minutes on record with A Valley Without Wind 2.\n\nI'm going to hold off on explaining why for just a moment. This sequel--if it can really be called that, since the whole AVWW "broken reality" thing never made much narrative sense to begin with, and apparently intentionally so--has you running a rebellion against a big bad. Unlike the original AVWW, where you had followers who you would make go away for so many minutes to go gather firewood or whatever while you ran around the infinitely side-scrolling (well, infinitely transitioning, at least) map, this actually has a strategic map for you to tell your followers to go to places and do things and fight baddies. It's a nice touch, adding some level of strategic force movement rather than simply "Bob has a 57% chance of getting a carrot with a 99% risk of dying because Bob is a loser."\n\nWell, I lie. It would've been a nice touch. If it worked.\n\nIf anything worked.\n\nIf AVWW has the quality of decent 90s shareware, AVWW2 has the quality of bad 90s shareware, the kind that I have spent a good decade and a half trying to forget that I grew up on. The characters have gone from smoothly-animated pre-rendered 3D geometry sprites to poorly MS Paint'd cartoons that move as though they're suffing grand mal seizures. In AVWW, everything was made of pre-rendered sprites so it all fit together visually. Random elements in AVWW2 are pre-rendered, some are drawn, others are painted, and they're all mashed together in incoherent tilesets so it's actually extremely distracting. The control system went from a simple but effective "keyboard to move, mouse to aim" system in AVWW to a clunky and incoherent keyboard-only system. For a comparative example, let's say you want to shoot your magical ball-o'-death at some critter at an angle: AVWW, point and click. AVWW2, hold the right and up and fire keys at the same time and pray to whatever gods you have that you timed that perfect 45° angle shot just right because 45° angles are all you're going to be doing and also if you don't do the fire button at the right time then you're just going to jerkily leap your character up and into the target in a valiant but utterly stupid attempt to smash the enemy with her face. That's how Archon worked back in the late 80s. It's as though the AVWW2 was coded for a particularly archaic D-pad setup. Everything about it is completely retrograde from the original.\n\nIt's completely unforgivable, since these people were able to make something competent, if not particularly impressive before. However, it's also unimaginably hilarious. It is so bad you just have to stop and laugh at everything.\n\nAnd then just stop, since there's absolutely no point to go on any further with it.\n\nThere's certainly no point in actually spending money on the experience.","March 18, 2015","false","0.3"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","57","68","9","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/recommended/228320/","FIGHTME","I love the lag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/","481 products in account","There's some interesting ideas here, and it's a multiplayer game in the strictest sense of the word, but at the end of the day when you cross genres you want to blend them rather than keep them in their own awkward boxes.  This game has an art style that will be off-putting to many, but I found it charming in an odd way.  The different powers are interesting, but could be a little more imaginative and balance between them is basically non-existant.  For the most part, the powers don't make good use of the movement- and neither do the randomly generated maps that generally end up being narrow tunnels to fall down and strange ceilings.  The boss fights are slightly better by being a little more open, but overall it's very static and repetitive.\n\nThe game has a metric ton of good ideas, but the implementation and integration is so poor that everything steps on each other's toes.  In addition the game uses strange terminology and despite explaning itself is still pretty difficult to puzzle out.  Figuring it out is kind of fun, but once you unlock the puzzle you realize that it's a lot simpler than it lets on in a bad way and it's more about getting lucky early on with a co-operative starting area than anything else.  Speaking of Co-op, it is barely functional and requires a great deal of patience.  Still, it's nice to have the option to be able to suffer together.\n\nTo it's credit, I can't say I didn't have any fun, but bad platforming, dissonant storyline, confusing mechanics and characters and luck-based play (a decent beginning can trivialize the hardest difficulty but a bad one makes all but the easiest one impossible) as well as terrible implementation of platforming means I'm not going to be missing it.","May 3, 2014","false","14.2"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/228320/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","A Valley Without Wind 2 is nothing like A Valley Without Wind 1. So many of the things that made me eventually love Valley 1 — it takes a while to wrap your head around that game, and you might give up before you realize you love it — are missing in this overhaul, which has just been released as a separate executable available for free to owners of Valley 1. Valley 2 has no crafting, no collectibles, no inventory, no spell customization, no fancy traversal gimmicks, no dungeon exploration, no grinding. It is basically missing 90% of the gameplay that dragged me into Valley 1. The sorts of moments I detailed here are entirely gone. Even the music is different. The original game’s 8-bit retro ditty has been replaced with a Japanese pop song, but in English.  So what Valley 1 fan is going to want anything to do with Valley 2?\n\nA Valley Without Wind 2 is a streamlined side-scrolling action platformer embedded in a turn-based territory control boardgame about trying to contain a rampaging demon and mostly failing. There. That’s the basic pitch. The action platformer bits are mostly about moving to the far side of the level. Your goal isn’t necessarily to kill the various hopping, crawling, flying monsters; it’s to stay alive while getting past them. As you play the action platformer level for any given tile, you spread your control of the map. Map control lets you earn more resources by moving pieces around the board representing your band of resistance fighters. They gather resources, knock down obstacles, take on minor monsters, and power special superbuildings.\n\nBut Valley 2 has a brutal clock mechanism that crawls out of the center of the map. Imagine an invulnerable — or is she? — demon running around the board, trashing your buildings, casting total ♥♥♥♥ spells that render swathes of territory uninhabitable, murdering your dudes, and scattering the survivors like terrified sheep. You have to stop this demon by getting super powerful, which is going to take about as long as a JRPG, give or take ten hours. Until then, the demon is going to mess stuff up and you can do precious little about it. Some power fantasy.\n\nLike Valley 1, Valley 2 can be awkward on the overworld. Arcen Games comes up with brilliant ideas that often stretch beyond their interfaces. Despite the basic boardgame mechanics, there is almost no boardgame elegance here. But the basics of exploring the world and keeping your survivors alive are a fantastic hook, and I can’t think of many games that offer this basic experience. This is no city builder. This isn’t about reconstruction. This is a survival horror strategy game about refugees trying to survive a cataclysm in progress, a cataclysm that chases them around the map and often drives them into fatal corners or flushes them down economic death spirals. Choose your difficulty level wisely.\n\nThe actual sidescrolling action is superlative, perfectly suited to a gamepad controller and featuring more colorful and elaborate artwork since Valley 1. I thought Valley 1 was weirdly gorgeous as it was, but Valley 2’s graphics overhaul makes it more conventionally gorgeous. The more significant change is Valley 2’s new sense of focus in place of Valley 1’s wide-open spell choice and customization. Now you must choose a pre-set class. Each class has four attacks, varied by power, range, how they’re aimed, whether they use ammo, and so forth. Attacks also vary by “caliber”, which determines which attacks punch through which other attacks. If you really want to finesse the gameplay, caliber is an important consideration for playing defensively. You’ll want to build up a concentration bonus by not taking damage, so driving back enemy attacks with a higher caliber is an important part of avoiding damage, particularly in the confines of underground areas.\n\nThe classes are imaginative and no one names a character class like Arcen Games. Who needs paladins and barbarians when you have featherologists, ashists, lumbermancers, and entropicists? But there are so many that I’ll never use most of them, even though they’re randomly doled out five at a time as you progress through a game. I wish Arcen had focused on fewer classes, and therefore made each one more important. As it is now, once you go up a few tiers, it’s like a racing game where you have a garage full of cars but no reason to use any beyond your two or three favorites. But those two or three favorites sure are sweet. Why would I ever not use my sleetlock with his freeze flamethrower and fancy magnetic ice?\n\nValley 2 is a long game with some pleasant surprises waiting on the map and even in the narrative. Unfortunately, for a game that seems so perfect for replaying, there’s no persistence. When you win or lose, you simply win or lose. As it is now, Valley 2 is like playing through a long RPG with randomized elements that you can play again if you want. Which would be fine if it wasn’t the strategy game that it is.\n\nIt’s a minor miracle that Arcen Games could revise Valley Without Wind 1 so completely without simply upgrading it, that they have instead made a completely separate game that plays so differently and creates a unique type of experience based on getting your ♥♥♥ kicked.","January 31","true","77.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","0"

I love this game.  It's one of a kind.  If you like metroidvania type games you should definitely check it out especially when it's only 2.99 right now on sale.  What makes it so unique compared to other games of the kind is that every level is a tile on the turn based strategy game portion, and what level you will want to do is going to be decided by what you need to be happening strategically.\n\nWhat makes the game such a fun challenge is that each tile has a difficulty percentage that can vary widely depending on different factors including what is happening in the strategy portion.  So, you might really need to open up a section of a map that's blocked by a tile with %500 difficulty level, but have fun with those crazy fast enemies and projectiles that knock off a third of your health, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Or, what if you can't make it through?  Time to rethink your strategy,  work on earning enough coins to hire mercenaries to open it up for you, tweak your character to go for speed over health, or or whatever else you can think of.  The world has it's own rules and mysteries and a lot of the fun is these things slowly becoming apparent to you as you play.\n\nWhat I love about the game is all the variety in the side scrolling action and it's effect in making your strategy come together to win the game.  I think personally this game is tied with Red Faction Guerilla for most underrated, but this probably even more for all the hate it gets from people that can't look past its subpar graphics to see the amazing gameplay and feeling of being in a coherent world with its own inherent logic all coming together in a challenging and satisfying experience.  Just like other Arcen games there are lots of difficulty settings, I suggest you crank it up a bit.","October 27, 2014","true","76.1"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","32","42","0","0"

There is a small amount of tactical strategy in the world map now that was neat except with it came with a very unwanted time pressure.

This game is the ActRaiser successor I never realized I wanted until I played.  It's a strategy board game tightly integrated with run and gun action.  The regular threats to my units and structures provided by Demonaica and summoned monsters along the way kept me alert.  You need those units and those units need at least some of those structures.  While I won on the default settings, know that this is a game that allows you to lose after hours and hours of investment.\n\nThe duration might be the only real gripe I have.  I could be biased by my analysis paralysis and the time it took to learn my first game.  However, the promise of another procedurally generated map to conquer loses some of its charm for me when it takes double digit hours to finish.  I realize that's probably not uncommon for the strategy genre, but I have to too many games in my Steam library to bother.\n\nAs a bonus, the game also comes with the prequel.  Some may enjoy the more freeform exploration, but the branching pathways contain a lot of empty, useless space.  It's big for the sake of being big.  I much prefer the sequel's selection of more linear playfields.  The prequel also allows players to gather much more loot and micromanage their inventory.  Though I may whine when my equipment breaks, I much prefer the sequel's limit of a single, temporary piece of loot that disappears when replaced.  With the collection of perks, feats and mage classes tied so closely to one's progress, there's enough to gather and worry about as it is.  In short, the sequel cuts out a lot of the cruft and is a better game for it.\n\nFinally, forum complaints can largely be ignored.  Mouse control has been added.  It allegedly makes the game too easy at the moment so I'd suggest gamepad or keyboard controls for now.  Either way, it shows that Arcen listens.  I'd personally also like to see more animation detail and a final sendoff when the game ends.  However, it's worth playing as it is.","February 22, 2013","true","42.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

With landsharks.\n\nWeird mash-up of different genres. Plays really well, both in the world map's strategy mode and in the platformer mode you go into when exploring tiles of the map. The art style and graphics are... interesting, but very low quality.\n\nThe objective of the game is simply to survive in the Valley, until you're strong enough to beat the evil boss, Demonaica. Survival is pretty damn hard at times, as Demonaica's stronghold regularly spawns nasty creatures to try and kill your survivor buddies.\n\nOn the world map, you get to move around survivors you've rescued, construct buildings that increase resource generation on specific tiles, heal nearby survivors, etc. The interesting bit is that because the game spawns monsters regularly, you need to keep your survivors mobile, while still balancing the resource generation with losses taken in battle.\n\nThe platformer sections remind me of Terraria's combat system: you run and jump around in randomly generated levels while monsters try to eat your face. Every class has 4 spells, usually one long-range spell, two short-range spell and a unique, extremely powerful special spell.\n\nThe objective in the platformer sections is to find wind generators and destroy them, allowing your survivors to move to the tiles you've 'purified'. Certain tiles also have perk tokens and other things for customizing your character, usually found in dangerous caves.\n\nThere's some weird time travel stuff going on in the platformer sections, as different tiles represent different time periods: you can explore the ruins of a modern city, with skyscrapers and stuff, and next turn find yourself in a steampunk city, or perhaps the ruins of an ancient, Egyptian style civilization. The level art is quite diverse, but as I said, the assets are pretty damn low quality.\n\nFun game, and very much worth the low price if you'd like to try a platformer with a strategy game element. AVWW2 does both damn well.\n\nDemo available here: http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/valley2-downloads Allows you to play 'till turn 20, or level 3, but other than that, has all the features of the full game.","April 17, 2013","true","11.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

They basically just stapled the name "a valley without wind" to it and wrote a crappy hybrid game with a great soundtrack.\n\nThe platforming is boring and clunky; They actually tell you that aiming with your mouse will make the game TOO easy. They literally coupldn't develope a computer game meant to use a mouse. They threw out Valley 1's controls and replaced it with a painfully floating/fuzzy unresponive slow mess. Some enemies are invulnerable unless you get within melee range despite both your main attacks being ranged. Just really lazy design choices meant to artificially create difficulty where they couldn't make the game properly.\n\nThe "strategy" is just a keep-you-head-above-water gind to win before you lose. When I was new it was hard to figure out and I felt like it was needlessly compicated. WHen I got hte hang of it it was worse than a face-book game.","February 23","false","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Less Open World But With A Better Focus On Strategy and Sidescrolling CombatGenre: 2D Action Platformer and Turn Based Strategy Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Arcen Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Dual-Pack\nFree Press Copy Was Supplied Read the Full Blog Review[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nWhat Is This Game?\nAVWW2 is a blending of strategy and platforming genres into one 2D game experience. The gameplay alternates between two different modes: turn-based strategy and side-scrolling platforming action. Your basic goal is to ensure that your Resistance survives long enough for you to gain enough power to defeat Demonaica. In order to do so, you'll need to level up in power, acquire higher level mage classes, find feats that give you special abilities and customize your character with perks. There are different mage classes which change the type of spells you can use. Everything from water to decay-based abilities. Feats allow you to gain special abilities necessary to progress through the game. Perks are items that let you fine-tune your character.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nA Valley Without Wind 2 is a well polished sequel that takes some of the ideas of the previous game and polishes them up. The combat is more engaging with its variety of spells, different classes and different monsters. It's not the same game AVWW1 was and that's for better or for worse depending on your point of view. It's not the same open-world game like its predecessor. Instead, it focuses on a direct evil threat that you get to know throughout the course of the game. The linear nature of the side-scrolling areas and the combat do eventually become more frustrating later on as the challenge really starts to spike at the end to the point of unfairness.\n\nSidescroller Combat Musings\nThe combat is definitely more engaging and rewarding than the original game. You only have four spells you can use and I think they worked. You have a fast primary attack, a slower but stronger secondary attack, a special attack which varies depending on your class and ammo spells which are more powerful spells that you can only use in limited amounts. For the most part, the spells felt balanced to their own strengths although some were a little too situational for my tastes. The combat system is about you finding the ideal place to throw your spells while dodging the spells being thrown at you. Taken as a whole, the side-scrolling element is nicely designed. I had a lot of fun with it until the mid-late to late end of the main campaign.\n\nThat's when I begin to notice a few problems with the combat. I was starting to die a lot more. Sure, the combat should be more challenging towards the later end of the game, but it felt like a constant battle of attrition. I would simply run out of health before I could get to the end of the level from all the little cuts of damage I would take. It got too frustrating at times. The floaty nature of the jumping and the large hitbox of your character feels at odd with the bullet-hell and precision that the game demands. You have so many spells being cast at you and traps to avoid that it's nearly impossible to avoid taking a lot of damage in the course of the level. Taking on the tougher monsters becomes a bad idea as you'll likely take a ton of damage for very little reward. Your better off just avoiding them altogether. Combine that with the difficulty of regenerating health and you can end up dying a lot.\n\nThe Strategy Gameplay\nThis was definitely the highlight of the game for me. The strategy element of the game is fairly simple and straightforward, once you figure it out. As I’ve mentioned before, the main goal is to keep the members of the Resistance alive long enough for your mage to grow strong enough to overthrow Demonaica. You have to salvage food and scrap, constantly recruit new members, destroy obstacles and capture/construct new buildings. Moving your resistance members around, planning out how to tackle new areas of the map all while dodging Demonaica and his forces really worked well and I had a blast with it.\n\nPC Settings and Controls\nAVWW2 comes with all of the PC settings you'll want/need and I can't think of anything missing. It's built on the same engine that all Arcen Games have been. You can adjust the resolution, rebind all the keys and a lot of other settings you might find interesting. It also supports modding via texture packs which you can find in Arcen's forums. As for the controls, well, that's a bit complicated.\n\nAVWW2's design was focused for controller and keyboard only. While it does allow for mouse aiming in the game, I don't recommend using it. It was put in after the game was released due to a lot of complaints made about the lack of mouse control. I personally don't agree with their decision to put it in the game but I can understand why since they did. Keyboard works but it's not as enjoyable to use as the controller.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA Valley Without Wind 2 is a different kind of platforming/strategy experience. Unlike it's open-world predecessor with city-building & light strategy elements, AVWW2 is a more laser focused, linear side-scrolling/strategy game. It does remove a lot of the open-world aspects that the original had. However, I think it works out for the better. You should treat both AVWW1 & AVWW2 as unique games sharing the same universe. Also, keep in mind that while the game is worth experiencing, there are some aspects that may turn you away due to its more experimental nature.\n\nRead the Notes on This Updated Review[wp.me]\nRead the Full Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nA Paladin's Review: A Valley Without Wind (1)","March 9, 2013","true","13.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering replayability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character.\n\nI'll update and post comments as I accumulate more game time, as long as I learn anything worth adding, but so far, the game does look like it's going to drain quite a lot of my spare time. :D","November 19, 2013","true","6.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","3"

This game is damn horrible. Don't play it. Just don't. They hired an art studio which makes the game look better, until one of the animations is triggered; then it makes you wish to cry and pluck your eyes out. There are not enough frames to the misaligned animations, especially in comparison to A Valley Without Wind I, which I highly recommend. In addition, they destroyed the combat system by making your magic become the choice of which colour kills your enemy, and also by implementing this silly caliber system. Next is the fact that you come back to life in your archenemy's palace, yet he doesn't really do much to stop you.\nHmm... what else is horrible about this game? That damn font. Don't need to say anything else on it. The loot system is also weird, because as soon as you find an item you actually want to use... it breaks. Then you get an achievement for every single tiny thing you do, which is just EXTREMELY annoying. You enter a certain kind of zone for the first time and you get an achievement! Then for each bloody type of equipment you pick up you get an achievement. It is like Arcen are trying to get the players to keep playing by making them feel like they are achieving something through their boredom and eye-plucking. Speaking of eye-plucking, you have to use the standard OS cursor, which just looks really annoying if you try playing with a mouse. That, combined with the fact that its predecessor had a perfectly fine mouse cursor that they could have just pasted right into this game, annoys me.\nI would highly recommend the intro song though. It is a good intro song.\nBuy this game, because you unfortunately have to to get its predecessor, which has a better combat system, better graphics, more to do, a better world exploration system and a lot more variance.","February 3, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Where as the original was a procedurally generated metroidvania with little strategy and plot, this games has a lot more of the latter two and is lacking in the first. If you've played the first one, you'll immediately notice the improvements in the overworld strategic parts. You control several soldiers that you must keep alive while running away from monsters and an undefeatable demonic overlord. The strategy part of this, is actually very well done, and the map is littered with special structures that you can task to produce resources or other special effects.  The plot is impressively coherent for a procedurally generated game, and actually rather interesting. My main complaints with the game, lie in the fact that I'd argue that the platforming is a step down from the original. It no longer has the fluid speed of the first game, which makes it far less enjoyable to play. The controls have also been changed to make the combat more keyboard centric and calculated with certain moves blocking certain enemy attacks. Frankly, I didn't enjoy it as much. I believe the could have found a better balance between the rapid fire spamming from the first and this messy system in the second. There are more RPG elements added on in this game than it's prequel, but unfortunately their implementation is lack luster as well. Most equipable items have a limited amount of uses and generally only last for one map. Other than perks, and new classes, there's really nothing else to unlock, so content feels a little scarce. Over all it's a better designed game than it's prequel, with a stronger sense of progression and better story, but I found the gameplay a lot less enjoyable and at times hard to slog through.","December 5, 2013","false","28.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I feel this is unfair to the developers. The sidescrolling levels and strategic map work together well. Each tile on the world map can be played in sidescrolling mode, and depending on what's around it, it'll be a different type/difficulty of level, have different rewards etc. I found that this system gave more meaning to the levels, since they were each part of my greater strategy. There are some light RPG elements, but it basically comes down to switching movesets once in awhile and choosing attack or health bonuses. Nice, but not too deep.\n\nThe production values are surprising for such a budget game, featuring nice backgrounds, tons of menu options/difficulty settings/etc, and a memorable soundtrack that even has a vocal theme song. The one downside is that the sprites are kind of crappily-animated, though you get used to it after an hour or two. Netplay has been smooth for me with 3 players... For some reason, it supports (in theory) hundreds. It wouldn't make any sense to do, but could be quite funny.\n\nThere is a story, but it feels more like justification for the gameplay than a real setting to invest yourself in. You fight robots and dinosaurs in the future with magic... Just go with it.\n\nOverall, VWOW2 was a really nice surprise, and I'd definitely recommend it despite what others say. As far as things to improve, I'd say Arcen should get a different team to do the sprite work, make less predictable/more complex enemy AIs, and either refine or ditch the half-baked equipment system. I can't fault them too much for throwing it into a game with already-robust features, but it seemed pretty unnecessary.\n\n7.5/10","September 8, 2013","true","39.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The new art is, surprisingly, less attractive than the original and many monsters seem to have been glued in from different artists, with different styles, and the various types of 'classes' are really a matter of what type of colors you'd like to hit enemies with.\n\nThe overworld aspect is interesting and would've been better with more depth but as is its very shallow and the game's instructions even treat the two halves like separate games prompting one to ask: why aren't they? Both ends have been drastically over simplified and there isn't any real feel of progression or transference from one half to the other. Getting better at the combat doesn't influence the overworld and vice versa. Plus the tacked on timer, rushing you to try to understand its clunky interfaces as soon as possible and penalizing early mistakes sharply composes the sprinkles on this inedible cake of a game.\n\nIs it playable?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBromancer/recommended/228320/","TheBromancer","Tankian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBromancer/","77 products in account","Alright... first off... I did NOT play the first game. However, after watching my friend play and log hours on it, it looked like a nifty Metroid-like platformer. So, we decided to try the second one...\n\nStarting off, you are a person... who is in an apocalyptic like world. Now, there is not much variation here at all... I mean come on, there's only health and attack? Not much of an add-on there...\nAnyways, after starting a character you pick what mage class you are (why are there only mages? Is this Harry Potter on Dooms Day....?) There are NOT very many choices for the mages either and you're stuck with the same boring skills unlike the first one where you have a lot of options. Next, Satan is in front of you... Demonica (very original! What's next?  The Angel Angelica!) He tells you he wants you to recruit for him now that you have passed you're training. Now, who knows what training you had to go through, but it doesn't seem like much... Now, Demonica has blessed you with immortality. This is shown by a purple/blackish shade moving weird object behind you. So, unlike the first game, when you die you keep your character. Sounds good right? You can now bond with your character. You have that emotional connection. You can now freaking dry hump the screen and pretend that you are ONE with your character... however... this isn't a good thing as I will mention soon.\n\nNext, you leave the place and you find out you're actually a spy with the "resistance"... again not original at all... LE SIGH. You rebels want to defeat Demonica by recruiting more people and then using a technological building that can actually hurt him and you can fight him. Wait, no you're on a world map! Much like Super Mario World and similar to games like Civ V...you now can move around the cells and travel to different lands! It is explained now that you personally CANNOT recruit people. They are scared of you because you have Demonica's purple/blackish blob thing showing you're immortality and allegience.\n\nWhat must you do? You must get these world map NPCs on your side, who will then recruit the people for you by standing there doing nothing on the cell. Now, these cells are terrible. This is TERRIBLE idea and terribly made... like Age of Empires Civ V + ABSOLUTE DOG CRAP. You start off, you have a farm. Your people on the map need food to live. These people are just 2D stick figures with no personality, no cool skills, and "life" that is only 1-9. This life is used to fight world monsters who also have life... every time they fight, you lose number of life points to the number of life points an enemiy has. Simple right? So, you build a clinic now... one guy has to keep farming for food for your new recruits. The clinic lets you heal life points. Alright, sounds good. So far (besides me mentioning CRAP) you would think this is a unique, cool twist on a platformer + Civ V like elements. WRONG.\n\nEvery time you "purify" a cell, a turn ends for you. In 14 turns, Demonica comes out as well as monsters every consecutive X amount of turns. Well, you keep purifying, awesome! We are Team Good Guy Terraria now! But wait, Demonica is now out. No biggie, all you have to do is dodge Demonica, who moves only 3 spaces a turn. WRONG. I found that sometimes Demonica magically moves more than 3 somehow... after counting 5 spaces away or so , the next turn my people STILL Die. Yes, Demonica 1 hits them all. Now, here comes the REALLY stupid part of this aspect of the game. When Demonica goes through a space with buildings you make, he destroys that building and you CANNOT rebuild it. So, when your farm is gone... it is gone. I thought this would an easy fix... farm is "grassland farm" so if there is an empty grassland I can build a farm, right? NOPE NOT AT ALL IN THIS CRAZY BACKWARDS LAND OF JUJUBEEZBANANABOATS! You CANNOT. Like what in the hell? BUT WAIT. I found when you go to the Arctic cells, you CAN build farms. What in the actual duck mcfreaking hell is that? Farmlands... nope, the soil is TOO good. Arctic... hell yeah! Antartica is the best place for crops! What is this!?!?!\nFurthermore, you cannot build buildings on anything unless there are already pre-existing buildings there... which is also dumb?\n\nRemember when I said that having the same character throughout the game was VERY BAD... well here is why... So, you are like wow this is like a RPG ... minus the fact that you don't get to customize SHEET with consideration to the skills... also you do not even get to wear cool armor or look like a giant rainbow bunny like most RPGs. Now, you level up because your friend tells you to... because monsters level up every so often. After leveling up, you do not get any cool skills or anything... you get perks. Some perks are useful like more HP... others are well... completely useless... like literally making you into a glass cannon? Nothing works better than having crazy high attack with -5000 HP and defense! Anyways... this MAY be a bug for an online game me and my friend were playing, but after leveling up and getting perks we ended up dying. While trying to further my experience in the game, suddenly we lost all of our perks from dying... You CANNOT undo this? Like this is literally the most annoying thing! Once you beat a level up cell it disappears. So, you CAN exhaust all the level ups and then die... and be stuck at level 1 yourself for the entirety of the game? WTF IS THIS !? DEMON SOULS!? Seriously, I HOPE this is a bug because otherwise this game is like a 12 year old pre-pubescent troll face kid who spends his time on the 3DS trading Pokemon while asking his mother why he has hair growing on his genitals whilst Uncle Bad Touch is watching him... now if you like this game you may say, "Well, that sounds kind of hot!" to which I say...NO IT ISN'T YOU PEDOPHILE ♥♥♥♥♥ GAMER FREAK! ITS WEIRD AND JUST PLAIN AWKWARD!\n\nNow, onto the biomes... this made little to no sense AT ALL. Now, when you first try to go to a Lava biome or an Arctic biome, you are told that it is too hot or too cold respectively and that you must take out the tower associated to each biome that will fix this...somehow? Well, one would figure that the tower to take down a lava place would be near the lava right? Well, wrong, because you cannot go into any lava areas without dying over there. Well, where the hell is the lava tower thing you ask? OH I KNOW! IT IS LITERALLY SURROUNDED BY THE ARCTIC AREA! How the HELL does this make sense to anyone? Why would there be 10 cells of arctic, then ONE lava cell in the middle of them all? How does this even work? It also works vice-versa... so POORLY constructed layouts here.\n\nThe final problem with this game is the storyline too... they make it seem like there SHOULD be a story line with dialogue boxes popping up in every biome and when you kill a boss... but there isn't really. All I hear is, "DEMONICA WANTS YOU DEAD. SO DOES LILITH. DON'T WORRY I AM STRONGER THAN THIS PERSON AND YOU SHOULDN'T LIVE! I MAKE YOU DEAD BWAHAHA!" ... in which I reply... SCREW YOU SPECIAL ATTACK THREE TIMES AND YOU DEAD BOOIII. The "bosses" were no stronger than normal mobs... they were just humanoids with magic spells easy to dodge... like literally this was like Harry Potter again but with half-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adults who are mindless drones babbling about how the trailer park smells of fish when no one there likes sushi in the first place.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shawnecy/recommended/228320/","Shawnecy","Shawnecy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shawnecy/","981 products in account","AVWW2 is a turn based post-apocolytpic land/resource management game wrapping a 2d Platformer. You move troops around the map to farm, build buildings, etc. to fight the evil head honcho who can show up and wreak havoc. Monsters spawn every so many turns.\n\nThere's a number of little nuanced details about the turn-based aspect which feels like much ado about nothing. The game, like its predecessor, beats you over the head with tutorial text for the management aspects of the game (although the platforming aspect does seem to carry a little less of the complexity baggage from the first game).\n\nThe platforming here is pretty uninspired. Moving feels sluggish; I was amazed that holding down shift actually slowed down my already slow character who can jump 4 stories high.\n\nThe game warns you about using mouse+keyboard (and actively makes it a chore to set what should be default) due to it being "overpowered for the game design". Okay, so fix your game design. Playing a platformer with 2 hands on the keyboard feels like junk. Trying to play this game with a controller only feels like junk. Trying to do a hybrid of those 2 feels like junk.\n\nThe music here is much better than the first, but that's not saying much. The graphics still feel lackluster for 2013. A SNES-era retro look would probably serve the game better than what it has which carries an air of mediocrity.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole thing feels uninspired and boring in the most insipid way possible. Technically, it possesses the aspects and features a game should have, but so many things are either poorly implemented or not implemented in a way that makes them synergistic or relevant. On the scale of quality, this game lies in that precarious spot where many things sound good on paper, but it all fails to add up to something engaging. It's like the developer had a checklist of features that they think every game should have, and they checked them all off as development progressed, but they failed to take a cohesive look at the sub par results. The game takes no risk with unique gameplay aspects. I suspect the developers felt that the genre-blending would be that unique offering, but it feels like 2 poorly developed games smashed together.\n\n4/10. There are far better turn-based strategy games and far better platform shooters. This game is neither a jack nor a master of either trade. Save your money for something with far more polish and presentation.","February 13","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, it's a game, while AVWW1 was just barely. It has a sense of progression, and meaningfulness in what you do, while in the first title you spent hours realizing that you lost time and didn't make any real progress, and even if you progress in that game, you progress towards nothing because the game has no end (maybe if you care about achievements you can go on until you unlock them all). Not so in Valley 2, where the turn-based strategical part of the game is also much better. As in Valley 1, every game is totally different from the others, and this is also a great plus, and makes them stand apart for their originality, but overall Valley 2 is a much better balanced and fun game, where Valley 1 is fun for a while, but then it becomes repetitive and without goal.","January 14, 2015","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
