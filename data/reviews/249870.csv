Do you like DC Comics in remotely any shape or form? BUY THIS. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the game is a giant nerd love letter. Even better - instead of the "5 missions and a starite" system of Unlimited, all non-"event" missions are randomly generated, and I think the only thing I saw repeat on my first run through the whole game was the occasional "capture this person" bounty hunt.\n\nLiterally the only character I wanted in the game who wasn't already was due to licensing issues with Milestone (sorry Static :( ), this thing popped out anything I threw at it, sometimes even surprising ME with the versions it'd conjure up. Also it's very, very cleverly written for the funnybook fans. I'm pretty sure one joke is even a giant shot over the bow of current DC and a massive ♥♥♥♥ing plothole.\n\nThe only thing some people might find an issue with: there's now a scoring system on your solutions to puzzles. If you use the same adjective and/or item over and over, you get diminishing returns. (A little icon will warn you.) It limits you from performing The Dead Clown Trick this time around, but I thought it was worth it to go for high scores given that you can spend the points to unlock new powers/outfits for Maxwell as a result. I only wish they'd gone a little further with the lady outfits, you have no idea how bad I wanted to get a Power Girl costume. (They cover some real niche roles though. Starman? Swamp Thing? Animal Man? A random Wonder Woman battle armor? Yeah those are all in there.)\n\nThis is a game where, due to my choices, Harley Quinn ended up riding a cow as she and my evil twin tried to murder me with giant novelty props.

In a way, it's educational because you'll try to remember words you used to know, and it also makes you think of objects you usually have no connection with, or that only existed in your imagination.\n\nBut as the title suggests it's all about the DC universe so if you hate comic books you probably won't be able to enjoy yourself with this game. or at least not as much.\n\nSo, there are multiple worlds to visit; Gotham City, Metropolis and worlds connected to other DC characters like Aquaman or Wonder Woman. The levels are pretty big, and there are always multiple random objectives/quests to finish, and one story segment to complete. Modifiers can also be activated (like only writing words starting with the letter N) that earn you extra points. These points are used to play origin stories or other levels. You'll need to unlock all levels in order to be able to complete the game (which should take you somewhere between 10-15 hours, depending on how much you want to complete). Earning points, however, happens very fast and it will never take long before you can go the next area.\n\nScribblenauts Unmasked is basically the same as the previous Scribblenauts games, but with a different theme. This time it's a theme I usually adore. But writing and thinking of words is what it's really all about. And that's not bad. Not bad at all. In fact, I had a very fun time with it, but I do wonder if it can keep your attention long enough...\n\nI would highly recommend it personally.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","February 6, 2014","true","14.2"," 85 of 100 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","85","100","0","0"

I am happy to say that I was wrong and while it does have its shortcomings, it's still a good game at its core.\n\nThe best way to look at this game is to view it as half Scribblenauts and half another medium to experience the DC universe. It takes a small bit of the creativity that was required in the previous game and fills the vacuum with all the DC heroes and villains we've come to love.\n\nHere are some slight observations after 2 days of playing and completing the game:\n\nThe Good:\n- Adds a plethora of new characters\n- Interesting origin stories!\n- Cool costumes. It was fun to test them all out. Keep in mind some of them overlap due to having similar strengths.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The game can limit your line of thinking by having you rely on the same nouns and adjectives over and over again. There's more combat so this is normal. Consider it a challenge to find more creative ways to deal with these combat scenarios.\n- Content = less meaty overall. The previous game had way more things to do so therefore I can't really agree with the current price.\n- If you're not a DC enthusiast, you may not know how to do some of the repeatable objectives (such as the number guessing game).\n\nIt's a good game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Make sure to watch the cutscenes! 4/5","April 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 74 of 86 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","74","86","6","0"

If you enjoyed the other Scribblenauts games, there's a chance you won't really enjoy this one. Instead of the last games, there's not unique places and certain quests to do. The quests in this game are repeatative and you have to do the same ones over and over again despite what location you go to. For instance, someone tells you to bring 3 people their donuts; you find this task numerous times in gameplay. There are many others that you'll find yourself getting deja vu.\n\nThe controls and mechanics are still the same for the most part. The only difference is that you can't use the same word twice in one location gameplay or you'll be tallied -50 points. You also can't create your own avatar either, you're stuck using the vanilla Maxwell character. Another thing is there's much more talking in this game; yet there's still little character development. A few cameos of the last game were mentioned.\n\nHowever, if you're a DC fan, you might enjoy it. I'm personally a Marval fan so I wasn't too fimilar with much besides Batman. Although there are mostly all of the DC characters you can imagine; even original ones from generations ago. You can visit their unique locations and do their missions and experience their past life in a quest.\n\nSo in general, Scribblenauts fans be careful of buying it because it's not what you're expecting. If you're just looking for some entertainment, DC and easy achievements, go ahead and grab it. I'd wait for it to go back on sale though.","June 9, 2014","true","12.5"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","74","89","0","0"

Let me begin by saying, yes, I believe Scribblenauts Unlimited is a better game. Now, Unmasked is still a fantastic game, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor. Unmasked focuses too much on the combat that has never been the strong suit of a scribblenauts game. In addition, the random mission aspect of the game, while a good idea, tends to be the same few missions repeated. Gone is the uniqueness of all the small sidequests of Unlimited, replaced with random fetch quests.\n\nWith that being said, The game is still, at it's core, a scribblenauts game. Your creativity fuels the game, and the inclusion of the DC universe brings some interesting things to the table. If you get the chance, definitely pick this one up FIRST. You won't be disapointed.

You have been warned!\n\nScribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comic Adventure is very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited. Different in their freedom, different in their objects, different in achievements, different in level desgin, and different in their challeneges.\n\nIn Scribblenauts Unlimited there was unlimited freedom, as it says on the tin. But in Scribblenauts Unmasked there is a big limit, and this limit can inspire even more creativity than Scribblenauts Unlimited. The limit in question is that in each level in each session, you can only use a certain adjective or noun once, and if you continue to use it, points will be deducted. (These points are merely a type of coin system you can use in-game to perchase in-game costumes for your character.) This will force you to come up with a different object to use instead of the one you were going to use, or it will force you to come up with a way to do the same thing you were doing, but without that adjective or noun.\n\nScribblenauts Unmasked is obviously a DC Comics game, and thus you can spawn DC Comic related things, which means that the objects you can spawn are very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited, in that they are actual copyrighted things that are allowed in game. This doesn't just serve as a theme, or as a nice little detail to fanboy about, but also it can serve as another way to challenge you or to give you new ideas. As well as it being DC Comics, you are also allowed to make your character some description of a superhero, or supervillian, when you desgin your own character you can give him/her super powers and a swanky costume that you designed yourself. Of course the super powers are a bit limiting, I will warn you, as they only really involve attacking and nothing like flying or invisibilty, but those can be added after character creation with adjectives or even nouns, such as a flying ring.\n\nThere are almost double the achievements (Scribblenauts Unlimited 25, Scribblenauts Unmasked 40), as well as adding random (showing up at random) challeneges when you enter a level, which will challenge you to not use adjectives, or only use DC characters, which can be interesting and a lot of fun. Because there is so much to unlock with the points you collect, when you finish everything in the game then you can gather heaps of points and try and buy all the costumes and super powers.\n\nThe level designs are much different in Scribblenauts Unmasked, as they are a lot darker and grittier. There is also a level path for certain parts of DC comics, such as a Batman path, where at the end you can 'learn' about his backstory, just in case you were so isolated that you don't know.\n\nIf you are going to buy this game, keep in mind that although it has many positives that Scribblenauts Unlimited didn't have, you will most likely get more playtime out of Scribblenauts Unlimited then this game. But this game has a lot more potential play time then Scribblenauts Unlimited had. And in some ways it is better than Scribblenauts Unlimited,","January 15","true","17.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","6"

You will learn about comic book heros you've never known existed.\n- Lots of interactive Lore, the starite missions and the origin missions are a blast!\n\nCons:\n- Fighting is horrible. It is the same horrible clunky fighting system as in Scribblenauts unlimited but it is used everywhere constantly! It is almost unbearable and is entirely frustrating\n- Game progression is clunky, new areas are opened up by collecting medals in each respective comic universe.\n- Did I mention the fighting is terrible? Weapons degrade and disappear faster than they can kill an enemy, yet every time you turn around some random bad guy is attacking either you or the person you're doing a riddle for.\n\nOver all? 7/10 if you really liked scribblenauts unlimited.

I'm loving seeing this game help with his reading, typing, spelling as well as his mouse and keyboard skills. We have a rule that if he is playing then he has to think things through and also try to enter the names of items and characters - and it works! Of course I'm also getting a kick of out any hearing the weird or wacky ideas he comes up with that solve the puzzle (as well as dropping a few of my own) and there have been times when we have both laughed quite freely while playing.\n\nAnd yes, I've had a blast playing on the game myself.

I was personally kind of bummed I couldn’t summon, say, Lou Martin just to be pleasantly surprised later when I saw Vext or Shade the Changing Man pop out.\n\nThe story is really cute and permeated from start to finish with irony and a childlike sense of adventure. There’s a whole lot of little in-jokes from Batman refusing to use guns, to little hearts appearing over the heads of characters who are romantically involved with each other, to Maxwell time traveling to the past and asking Batgirl how her spine feels as a thank you after she saves him.\n\nThe problem with the game is that it might not be as appealing for a fan of Scribblenauts who is not into DC. When you strip it of the fanservice the game feels inferior to Unlimited. The random tasks add a lot of variety but they feel tacked-on and sometimes even break for no reason. It may happen that you enter a stage just to see a character with a task icon die miserably or conversely see a task complete without any input from the player. The game is also far more combat oriented than its predecessors and a lot of challenges can be completed simply by creating a lot of powerful superheroes. Last but not least, Unmasked is painfully short. There is only 12 main missions divided between 3 categories (Gotham, Metropolis and Justice League, which involves Oa, Atlantis, Themyscira and Central City), which are only a few minutes long, and 6 mini missions in which you help the main DC heroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Flash) through their origin story, which are even shorter.\n\nIn the end Scribblenauts Unmasked is a good game if you are a DC Comics fan and an ok game if you are a Scribblenauts fan, but if you are just interested in the series and trying to pick your first title, go with Unlimited instead.","July 29, 2014","true","17.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

The number of items you can create is astonishing and now you can create DC comics characters (as well as a lot of alternative versions of them). You can have a lot of fun trying to make them interact with each other. I don't know much about comics characters and the game teaches you quite a bit about their origin (there are dedicated quests about the origins of a few characters), their powers and how they're all linked to each other. The number of side quests is huge and can sometimes be tricky to solve. It's also interesting to find some unusual combinations to solve them. Scribblenauts might look like it aims at a younger audience but even when you're not a kid anymore, it's still a hella lot of fun. I love the very cute graphic style and the soundtrack is pretty awesome. Imagination is a powerful tool. Finally, for achievement hunters, most of the achievements are easy to get.\n\nThe negative\nIt's not very long (just a few hours) and unlocking costumes is just grinding, you have to solve a lot of quests to get them all. The story isn't very compelling to be honest and is mostly carried by the DC universe. The number of different environment isn't very high as well and it's a bit disappointing.\n\nConclusion\nGreat game, for both kids and adults. The cuteness of the graphics and the soundtrack, as well as the (probably not always obvious) depth of the gameplay makes it really enjoyable. I'm just disappointed that they basically took Scribblenauts Unlimited, added the DC universe and didn't add very much new gameplay mechanics. Get the first one if you haven't played it since it's better in my opinion, unless you're a huge fan of the DC universe.","December 30, 2014","true","7.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

It was a charming, relaxing game that was an absolute joy start-to-finish.\n\nThis game? Well, it took the core formula of 'Unlimited', and added an amazing amount of characters and items from the DC comics world. It's a lot of fun to just fly around goofing off- spawning a giant Parralax and various heroes to fight him. Things like that. But the changes they made to the core gameplay are a big turn-off for me- namely combat. The first game had only a few very basic situations in which you could be hurt. They were not threatening and few and far between.\n\nThis game is almost constantly putting you in combat, which might be an acceptable change if combat wasn't dreadfully boring, clumsy and imprecise.\n\nI still HIGHLY suggest playing this game (especially at a discount), but I just wish it had dropped all the combat nonsense.","June 13, 2015","true","2.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

For now... is it a bad game? No it's not, nor it is the little masterpiece it could have been.\n\nThe "create what you want writing it" thing is cool to some extent; it could easily become boring and, when rapid action is needed, you would probably create something basic just to solve the problem quickly. Otherwise, you would smile two or three times creating absurd things, then the action will become very repetitive. In the end, also language understanding problems by the AI will prevent some of your fantasies to be created in the game.\n\nWhat about the DC Universe? On the one hand, the game has an enormous library containing almost all of the DC characters, the most strange and forgotten ones too. That's cool, but... on the other hand, the narrative is very basic and not only made for chidren, but actually childish and sometimes annoying. So, if the game is made for (quite stupid) children who probably haven't a deep knowldege of the DC comics, why is this enormous fan-service library provided?\n\n...who is this game for, exactly?

This game expands that by adding many villians to fight and heroes to help you, all from DC comics. It also makes it a much bigger part of the game by directing you to do it more. Maxwell takes on the role of a superhero, thus having to frequently fight. That's what was so fun to me about this game. I also enjoyed having DC characters in the game.\n\nOne complaint I have though is that the missions can sometimes repeat themselves. The reason is that Unlimited had a lot of programmed tasks, each unique, but Unmasked generates a set of missions randomly upon entering an area.\n\nAlso, the game is quite expensive for a Steam game, so it may be a good idea to wait for a sale.

Adding to the large dictionary the previous iterations had to offer, the developers add almost every DC character- an impressive acomplishment. You can still screw around in a sandbox world, just like in the previous games, writing anything. The only problem is that your sandbox doesn't save your progress when you exit, however, which can be annoying since there is already the manual option for resetting.\nA (somewhat) new feature was the hero creator. In short, it's Scribblenauts Unlimited's object editor in which you could edit any existing object, but with the ability to add super powers. Additionally, Unmasked introduced a combat system. Right clicking would activate your built in powers, or otherwise, a punch from your character. If you add more than one ability, it's kind of inconsistant on which ability will appear. Often times, my heat rays will shoot everything, and my green lantern punches were nowhere to be found. The superpowers are neat, but they feel difficult to use.\nSomething I should also point out is that the charming Scribblenauts music from the previous games did not return. It was a bit depressing not to hear the familiar songs, but eventually you don't bother to really care about the music anyway.\nThe puzzles in this game felt like a combination between the first Scribblenauts puzzles with Unlimited's puzzles. They aren't perfect though. After about two hours, you'll find the same recurring puzzles, which makes you want to stay in the sandbox batcave. The biggest problem though, is that sometimes, I could enter a world, let my character stand there, and immediately, somehow automatically get an achievement. You'll soon take notice that it's due to the puzzle givers intertwining paths, killing each other because "Heroes V.S. Villains". I understand the developers had put effort into keeping all the puzzle givers into one world, but it didn't end up working.\nEven though Scribblenauts may be losing its color, it's still a very unique game. Fighting with/against the DC characters in their adventures makes you want to read the comics.  In some ways, Scribblenauts Unmasked excelled in areas its predecessors could not handle. In other ways, this game went back some steps. Despite all this, it won't stop me from continuing to beat up Batman with my bare fists.","April 13, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is very cute and enjoyable. Afterwards I spent my time completing any and every mission to get ALL the achievements. Some of these missions were very repetitive with only different faces for them. My last moments on this game were honestly just constantly spawning the Green Lanter Corp and zombies. I wish there were more achievements. Finally I hope that Scribblenauts continues making games.

For those new to the Scribblenauts franchise, essentially each game has you play as the lead Maxwell, who goes about solving problems and helping others by creating practically anything using his magical notebook, meaning that a mundane task of say knocking over a pile of bottles can be done with a more typical throw of a ball or perhaps by the use of something unorthodox like the shot of a battleship. In a nutshell, every Scribblenauts game uses this formula of requiring the player to creatively and often hilariously use their own preferred means of problem-solving a variety of different scenarios that warrant different kinds of thinking - which is awesome! This basically means that you can play and progress the way you want to, which feels rewarding for the player since it is because of your own imagination and thinking that got you past that particular level.\n\nNow, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains this same mentality, but admittedly pigeon-holds it. How Unmasked differentiates itself from the other games in the franchise is its introduction of DC-related items. As you can probably already assume from the screenshots and titlecard, Unmasked's story (without trying to give away too much) involves Maxwell helping out in the DC Universe. To anyone vaguely interested in DC, this concept sounds extremely great on paper, but in execution, it was a bit lackluster. Certainly, it was great to see familiar faces like Batman and Superman, to be introduced to more obscure characters, and to utilize both DC heroes and their gadgets to solve puzzles. However, the puzzles, or "Heroic Feats," that we are supposed to solve are all extremely similar. They almost always involve you either destroying/killing something/someone, finding something for someone and returning it, or delivering stuff in some shape or form. Any other puzzles are unmemorable or are too easy to be worthy of any mention. Because of the similarity in all the puzzles, you end up just using the same methods of solving them, making optional puzzles something more of a chore/point farm than something I do out of just genuine interest. As well, there was little to no theming done for any of the locations. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, in each place you visited, e.g. the hospital, firehouse, art museum, etc., there were missions related or made sense in the context of each respective location, which helped with theming and immersion. I sadly found little of this in Unmasked. The optional Heroic Feats scattered around each location, and even the story missions specific to each location, were so similar that nothing really separated each location apart, aside from obvious things like aesthetics. What was frustrating was how the game put you into a position where you had to farm these optional puzzles, because unlocking other worlds required you to spend points, hence the puzzles being, as already mentioned, now a chore. It didn't even feel that fulfilling to unlock a new location for all you really did was do the exact same puzzles.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not trying to paint Scribblenauts Unmasked as a bad game, because it isn't. Despite these flaws, it's still fun and a feel-good experience, but it's definitely the weakest title released within the Scribblenauts franchise. If I could, I would give perhaps a sideways thumb, for I want to both recommend this game and not recommend this game, but to particular groups of people. I would only recommend Unmasked to specific demographics, namely to children/parents looking to buy their kid a light-hearted and fun game, fans or players who have already enjoyed other Scribblenauts games, and achievement hunters. Scribblenauts games are all easy to pick up and play and are games which can easily be enjoyed by all members of a family, which is why I'd recommend it to the former. For those already familiar with the series, while there are certainly those aforementioned flaws, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains enough of the original Scribblenauts formula to keep fans interested. And as for the latter, the achievements for this game are relatively easy - you should have both the story fully complete as well as unlock all the achievements within 6-8 hours. The demographic I wouldn't recommend this game too are those using this game as their entry into the Scribblenauts experience. In other words, if you are new to the Scribblenauts series, you should avoid this title as your first Scribblenauts game, because although Unmasked is still pretty fun, it doesn't do the franchise complete justice - try Scribblenauts Unlimited first. Whether or not you like Unlimited will help you in determining whether or not you'll like this game, because if you end up disliking Unlimited, you'll definitely be disliking Unmasked. I would also advise anyone and everyone looking to buy this game to get it on sale, for while it is still fun - it isn't up to par with the previous titles, and the whole game feels like it's just an expansion for Unlimited.\n\nCondensed review: Scribblenauts Unmasked is a fun game for any aged and kind of gamer, but is riddled with a number of glaring flaws that hinder it from being as great as the earlier released Scribblenauts game; Scribblenauts Unlimited. Grab it on sale, or get Scribblenauts Unlimited instead if new to the series.","January 2, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then I read online that it had virtually every DC character EVER MADE.  So next I tried to stump the game with an obscure character.  (In fact, one of the earlier Batman quests has him request an alternate universe version of himself - so I typed in "Earth One Batman." Instantly Batman shouted "There Can Be Only One!" and attacked him).  So I started with some easy ones.  Black Lantern is in the game.  As is every color of the spectrum of lanterns (even the Indigo Tribe).  I tried true identities (for example, I typed in "Julian Day" and the game automatically created Calendar Man).  I tried one-shot alternates like Red Son, Batman Year One, Dark Knight Returns ROBIN (the female one).  Then I looked at the dictionary of characters and noted that under the letter "A" there are 640 PAGES of characters. That's just for the letter A.\n\nMy quest has been fruitless, but I am definitely recreating the Infinite Crisis battle with this.

The game is really fun and addicting. The create a hero thing is especially cool because you can create things that you have on your mind. It is a sequal from an already fun game, Scribblenauts. There is only two downsides to this one. In one and the original one you had a stamp limit for creating your own things. That really annoys me because I like to make detailed things but with the stamp limit it doesnt let me. If the make another Scribblenauts game they should get rid of the stamp limit. The other thing I like which is only on this game is when you are riding or using something that can attack, they can get destroyed. If they make another i would also like them to remove that.

In this version when you spawn into an area all the tasks and characters in the level you help are automatically generated.  This can sometimes cause chaos when it begins with contradictory items with even some goals completing themself.  Some find this RNG element boring and repetitive as it takes away the unique feeling and creative design in every mission from the previous Scribblenauts but it is a trade off for replayability with new scenarios each time.","December 31, 2013","true","19.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The three intially available ones are probably the biggest, and they already aren't  what I'd call expansive. Each of the ten levels has one measly story mission through which they more or less handhold you with no real increase in difficulty.

The gameplay was repetitive at some points as I had to do the same heroic feats many times to get enough reputation to get through the whole story, which was the main negative for me in this game. I was looking the most forward to having the gameplay been approved from Scribblenauts : Unlimited, but it got worser in my opinion. The game overall was great because it was saved by its storyline, as it was interesting and long with many interactions with the DC heroes. Also, I enjoyed the bonus unlockables where background info was shown through stories of the main DC heroes. The game gived out another great moral, like all games should have and it was shown in the "tearful" ending animation where the main lesson of the whole story was that you should always forgive others even if they caused so much trouble to you for a long time because you will eventually see that they have feeling to.\n\nGG, 5th Cell and Warners Bros., hoping for a next installment to Scribblenauts coming to PC in the near future.\n\n-8/10","June 25, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It had a very interesting story that I found cute and funny at the same time. The ending however really pulls your feels. Especially if you played Super Scribblenauts since in the last level you go up against Doppelganger. This game continued on Doppelganger's story, showing that he was not really an evil version of Maxwell, but just a lost and lonely person who only need a friend...which is how Doppelily (Doppelganger's new sister, the doppelganger version of Lily) was created. The Doppelgangers remained in the DC universe to fix all the damage caused.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/249870/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ Just like the first game, the art style gives the game a cute unique look, with many characters and locales from the DC Comics universe being realised here\n+ Some gameplay elements (reduced reputation points on repeated words, and a bonus for DC Comics references) encourage you to be more creative with what you should create to solve problems.\n\n\nNegative\n- Again, the gameplay is very simple; unless you have little knowledge on the DC Comics universe, which may lead you to struggle through some of the tasks (though the game does provide a big database with all of the necessary knowledge you may need). NPCs randomly attacking you very often in some of the levels was also rather annoying when trying to accomplish some of the side missions\n- The game is noticeably shorter than the previous one (around 3 hours for the story, and another 2 hours to get 100%). The way progression is handled is also rather tedious, involving you completing random side missions until you gather enough reputation points; I feel the previous game’s mission structure was much better.\n\n\nVerdict\n“Not quite as intuitive or fun as before, Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure does still provide an enjoyable experience... just on a smaller scale. The use of DC Comics properties does breathe new life into the series, but also somewhat limits how you can play the game, with some tasks having odd solutions. Still a solid game nonetheless.”\n\n7/10 TJBs","February 24, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not as good as Unlimited by far, it seems a lot of the development time was spent making 80 different versions of Batman that you can spawn instead of the various challenges and actual gameplay. Most of it consists of ten or so focuses missions, which are similiar to the Starite misisons from Unlimited; somewhat scripted. Everything else is mini "Spawn a thing" or "Do a thing" missions to get bux to unlock outfits. You can beat the actual game in a hour and be left with nothing but the mediocore filler missions.\n\nIf it's on sale for under ten, by all means. I wouldn't recommend it for anything higher.

While it was fun overall, I never quite completed the game due to repetive puzzles, restrictions and frequnt crashes. Bad level design and a lack of features from the original Scribblenauts: Unlimited makes this title a huge step down. Puzzles are randomly selected, meaning on more than one occasion I have been given the same puzzle to complete, and the game seems to want to trick you into thinking that the game isn't linear by showing you multiple worlds from the map screen you can't unlock until you've solved enough puzzles. There are side missions thrown in, but overall the game is unstable and dissapointing. I tried to finish this one to the end, but by the 3rd crash on the very last level I was finished.","December 16, 2013","false","11.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

The DC universe adds to the potental of the creativity. And having different puzzles each time you load into a level also adds potental. But dispite having more potental then predicesors I would have to say if your going to pick up a Sciblenauts game that Scibblenauts Unlimited is a much more enjoyable game because while the puzzles are the same every time, having a smaller pool of puzzles allowed for more interesting mechanics to the puzzles, Unmaked puzzles just don't feel as thought out.  And because of that I unfortinitly can not  recommend this game. Its fun, it has more items then Unlimited, but between this and Unlimited, Unlimited is a much better purchase. In either case both are better on PC then any console both because of having an actual keyboard to type, but because Steamworks adds a lot more items into the game that the console versions don't get, so though games like the Wii/WiiU versions have more items built in like Mario characters, but with Steamworks you can get those items anyways with someone having created them.\n\nGood game, pick it up if you played Unlimited all the way through and wanted more puzzles to solve, but otherwise pickup Unlimited instead.","February 10, 2014","false","1.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Finally, in Scribblenauts Unmasked, you can create objects and people from the DC universe, and the game is shaped like a comic book.

(plus a hat for tf2 if you pre-ordered the game) you buy the game and it basicly just like a DLC for scribblenauts unlimited. you could just easily get scribblenauts unlimited and download some DC stuff. seriously just look at the workshop they have plenty of them! plus this game is buggy and constantly freezes in cutscenes (mostly in boss battles) i can't finish the final mission due too this bug. this game is borderlined. crap. just crap don't buy it. and i intend to never buy a scribblenauts game again.","April 10, 2014","false","25.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Although this is supposed to be integrated into the DC Universe, this has also adopted many new game mechanics and a completely different art style, which makes Maxwell look like he's on drugs... Anyway back to the mechanics, there has been a new system in which you cannot repeat the same word or you'll lose some 'Superhero Points', which I honestly do not know or care for. This introduces a completely unnecessary learning curve for younger Scribblenaut players and ruins the fun for people who like mucking around. Like, I'm all for a good challenge and all, but you don't really expect this to be for hardcore gamers right? Next time, play your cards like CoD and stick with what works to keep your fans happy.","September 22, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I think it would be great for kids just learning how to read (as long as they stay away from browser history, I think that is a very good thing).  This game is meant for super-hero fan boys, and you know they type! Let me explain… let’s say you take a HUGE crap and then shape it into the bat-symbol & clam it to be a chocolate bar… A fan boy would buy it for an excessive amount of money and after taking a bite would clam it to be the best chocolate bar of all time without critical thought.\n\nCON:\n-Every level forces you to replay it.  They are so small and honestly not that fun the first time you play it.  How small… You can transverse the level in less than 50 seconds and see everything each worlds has to offer.\n\n- Puzzles seem to be more repetitive than fun.  The game feels like work.\n\n- Levels tend to be so lame that even you’re in-game sister will interrupt your “free-romming,” every 5 seconds to annoy the you by asking you to leave a map, because even she thinks this game sucks.  She is like that girl you know that will not stop talking but has nothing relevant to say.  She also makes me think this game is sexist.\n\n- Game tends to use a lot of Zombification as game mechanic and it makes it more frustrating than fun.\n\n- Combat is so terrible. You have to face the character your hitting, so if you use a keyboard to move.  Even then your allies get in the way and if you accidently hit them 1 freaken time they go Bat-SHHIT-CRAZY and attack you.  You will be like… Dude I just stood still and your literally ran into my fist.\n\n- There is no grey view of ethics of justice.   If you spawn Catwomen, she is considered to be a villain and will be attacked by heroes.\n\n- They left Static Shock out of the game…  I assume it is because this game is full of sterotypes that make it Rasist, Sexist, and Homophobic.  Including one of the original created black superhero might be controversial… Sorry I think Feminist Frequency has brain-washed me into caring about such things… What is with feminist and Plaid shirts…Seriously, do you think they are like, “Hey this looks terrible, now people will take me seriously”.\n\n- You cannot play as 60s Robin from that Adam West Days.  That guy had some serious bulges in his shorts.\n\nPRO\n-	Making random strangers get “pregnant” out of no-where.\n\n-	They have all my favorite obscure characters that you do not hear about too often. (Suicide Squad, Green Arrow, Deadman, the Question, PowerGirl Owlman and Plastic Man).\n\n-	The game even manages to include different versions of every character excluding Nazi Superman, which is probably a good thing.\n\nPERSONALLY\n-	The game just too small, too short, and too easy.  This is the definition of a cash grab because it is low quality crap.\n\nTIPS\nYou can use adjectives like FAST/Speedy & STRONG to get through the game quicker.\n\nWHEN you accidently hit a dumbass allies: Use the adjective “Peaceful OR Happy.”  My preference is to just kill the F@#$ and then respond someone cooler.\n\nUse your Keyboard to move; otherwise you are more likely to hit allies.\n\nIt is a good thing that Fan-boys love chocolate (I sell a special one of a kind batman chocolate so send me money!!!!)\n\nYou can make your own hero costumes.  I like playing as the Ambiguously Gay Duo.\n","June 12, 2015","false","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But it's not very good, either.\n\nOne of the new things they advertise that this game comes with is a random mission generator. The idea of this is there's supposed to be an infinite number of missions, but in truth, there are only, like, 12, each with slight variations -- despite what the devs think, simply replacing "Item A" with "Item B" only rarely causes an actual change a mission.\n\nBeyond that, most of the missions are based on combat and other action-y things. If you've played any previous Scribblenauts games, you'd know why this is a bad thing - Scribblenaut's is at it's funnest when you're allowed to let your imagination run free, but that's not really an option when it comes to fighting -- it just comes down to "Summon a new weapon or superhero, wait till either you kill them or the weapon/hero breaks, rinse and repeat."\n\nThe story's not that great, either. Granted, I wasn't expecting it to be great, but if you're buying this because you think the DC influence will lead to an interesting and engaging story-line, well, then this will disappoint.\n\nNow, this game does have its cool parts. The fact that it makes you constantly come up with new items in a mission is a cool idea. The special conditions that rarely apply when you approach a new area is a cool feature.\n\nBut overall, this game is not very good, and if you want a fun Scribblenauts game, I'd recommend the infinitely more polished and well done Scribblenauts Unlimited.","January 17, 2015","false","12.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

(Protip, use Doughnuts, the UK spelling of it to save a XP penalty). But now it's joined by the "HAWKMAN IS A LAZY PLEB, GIVE HIM A FLYING MACHINE TO FLY WITH"\n\nScribblenauts had good potential when it first game out, but they never really expanded upon it, sad really, as there are several unsupported concepts that would work well in this game, but just aren't programmed in.","May 31, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What this game is a Scribblenauts and DC Universe mashup that contains both heroes, villains, and Maxwell & Lilly (The protaganists of Scribblenauts) all in one game.\n\nThe story is Maxwell and Lilly travelling to the DC universe after losing the starites that allowed them to get there in the first place, but the villains have claimed them as their own and are using to them to benefit themselves. You have your story missions that take you five minutes to complete in which you create roughly three things and the conversations take over the entire duration of a mission. All missions are not unlocked up front, you have to get reputation to purchase areas for you to explore, but this is a poorly executed idea.\n\nThe quests are extremely repetative & it bored me out of my mind by doing the same thing over and over again just so I could progress with the story. The person who thought that you shouldn't be able to use the same two words in the same area needs to be FIRED. This just toys with the experience and it doesn't take long before you rip out your hair trying to think of a new word for dead.\n\nYou can also purchase costumes that add ♥♥♥♥-all to the game & origin missio...FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKES. Stop with the origins! The movies, the video games (most, anyway) just are trying to tack on entertainment value but they cost alot of reputation and after 30 minutes of playing you really begin to wonder what you are doing with your life and just want to give up and start your life again in China.\n\nIf you are new to the series, just do yourself a favor and buy Scribblenauts: Unlimited. That game was alot more fun to play with and it doesn't get repeative to a such a quick extent as Unmasked does. Not saying that this game is completely awful, but it just doesn't seem worthy as Unlimited was.","January 3, 2014","false","6.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME." I can't even describe how unsatisfactory the first thirty minutes of game play had been for me... I feel like if I had been tricked into buying this game. Despite the use of the notebook, it shares none of the qualities Scribblenauts Ulimated possesses. There is very little freedom in the amount of words you can use in this version compared to Unlimated, and you're even punished if you want to use the same word more than once. It's... just... terrible. I'm so happy there's a refund option, because I will be able to get something that isn't this with what money I spent on it.","June 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's rather faithful and has a lot more content then I actually expected it to have. I didn't pick it up during launch because I learned from buying Scribblenauts Unlimited during the winter sale, then seeing it on amazon for $7.49. I'm enjoying this game but Unlimited is better and more broad. If you own Scribblenauts Unlimited and want more, this game will definitely tide you over for a good time. It's on sale on amazon as of 5/24/14 for $5 and I say thats definitely worth it.\n\n\nEdit: I no longer can recommend this game, as I expected I got bored pretty quickly.

I played unlimited, and it was a lot of fun, so when I found Unmasked that included the DC universe, I was convinced before trying. First meeting was batman, I thought I was about to start something very good... But the problems started. First, the mission system is definitely not well established. They tried to create a randomization system, so that you can have countless missions. I don't know if I have very bad luck, or if it is a bad coding, but I ALWAYS have the same, and they are pain to complete. Then there is the map, one per hero, and too few heros included in the scenario. Compared to the last game where you had lots and lots, you end up having gotham, metropolis, and atlantis... and almost nothing else. Last but not least, the cinematic system. If you fail a campain mission, it has to start all over again (ok that's fair) but you also have to watch and read all of the introduction from its beginning. Damn that's a pain because they are so slow. And the worst part is that they crash sometimes. Between two dialogs, it stops, and you only can watch your characters gazing at each other, with as only option "restart the mission" (and endure the cinematics again). Difficulty is unbalanced, the game is short, and uninspired. It was one of my greatest deception through every steam games I have.","June 8, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

While the game does kinda deliver on the DC part with a load of characters, it seems to have gone at the cost of anything else. There wasn't much of a desire to toy around in this game, since using regular objects on DC characters feels kinda flat, in fact, I think I saw less regular objects than the last game, but I could be wrong on that. The missions of sorts seem cool at first, helping heroes fight their respective villains, but it feels very linear and forced, with the actual solutions being so specific that I was forced to go for the straightforward boring options. This game also seems to have more of a story, but it just feels like a bad fanfic and is an excuse to have way too many unskippable exposition cutscenes. I completely lost interest after playing Metropolis for a bit. If you are a big fan of either Scribblenauts or DC you might want to check this out for yourself, but for anyone else this is a definite skip.

It is very much more of the same from the previous Scribblenauts game. The only thing different this time is story line now includes super-heroes.\n\nYou can "draw" your favorite heroes and have them join in on the action whenever you want. Each hero has multiple different costumes from their own comics which adds to the variety in the gameplay.\n\nI couldn't quite get into this game very easily however, the story seemed very bland and not interesting. The side quests which were available were also all very samey. I suppose I am probably in the wrong age bracket for this sort of game, the younger audience may appreciate this more.\n\nThe graphics keep to the same colorful playful style as with the other games in the series. Plenty of customization is available through creating your own heroes and sharing them through Steam Works.\n\nIf you are a fan of the series or want to try something a little bit quirky and different, definitely check this out.

The style and art direction are fantastic! The characterisation of the DC roster is generally solid, if understandably 2D. It feels like the kind of simplicistic presentation that comes from love of the source material. In that sense, it could be seen as a less successful cousin to the LEGO games. The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations. The game is suitably slow-paced, so it never becomes genuinely problematic. A fun game, if lacking in depth.","December 23, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only the objet editor... but finally the keyboard and mouse that this game so needed. I have spend 20-30 hours on the last game (Unlimited) and completed this one in less than 6 hours. I luckily bought it on sale for 5$ and I'm happy I did. I would not recommend buying it for more since you only get a few hours of gameplay out of it and there is not really any replayability value. I am not a fan of DC comics either, maybe that's why I didn't love that game as much as the previous entries in the serie.","September 27, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The camera movement. Previously you use the right mouse click to move, now u just move the mouse to the corner of the screen to move it while they replace the right mouse click with Attack. Is it better this way? Well in my opinion, no. Previously u hv the feeling of control of the scene u see but now u feel like dragging the camera around and feels sluggish.\n\nOh and also u hv all the DC Universe characters in it. So yea. Should've stat this first but then again, the camera viewing really irritates me. Maybe its just me, I dunno. The game works like all the other games in its franchise, but implimented with DC related characters in the story.\n\nSo is it bad or is it good? Well, depends if u r off two things.\nOne, if u r a DC fan\nTwo, if u r a Scribblenauts fan.\nIf u r both, great! Get it. If ur a DC fan, u will be amazed how many characters u can make in this game, its just mind blowing. If ur a Scribblenauts fan like me, well I think u can pretty much skip this or wait for it to be on sale. Its exactly like all the other Scribblenauts games, but shorter and seemingly easier in my opinion since I played a few before.\n\nThis is not a bad game, but as a Scribblenauts fan, I really wish it could be a teenie-tiny bit longer.\n\n7/10","September 30, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Escrypha/recommended/249870/","Escrypha","Escrypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Escrypha/","72 products in account","This is like a $40 DC Comics Database. They have almost every hero you can think of. The game ruined me from enjoying the others, though. This was my first Scribblenauts game. I bought it because I saw Smosh play it. xD\nI suggest you start off from a different one, unless you're a big DC fan like myself. However, it seems like people who start from Scribblenauts Unlimited tend to not like this one. I am an example of someone who started playing Scribblenauts with this game, and I don't enjoy the others as much.\nThe customization, sadly, is flawed. When trying to create an avatar (You can do this for free, which is friggin' awesome! xD), you'll often find that you aren't able to move Maxwell's bum. The only thing you can do is color it black, shrink it, then cover it with the bum you want. Actually, shrinking it messes up the animations, so one can only cover it with the desired bum. (xD Bum!) It would be nice if one could move it, too. Plus, it's difficult to make custom weapons. There's no way to make one shoot lasers from scratch. I've tried beams, but it shoots out arched metal beams. I've tried laser, but the laser gun comes out. It becomes a laser gun that shoots laser guns out. I have, however, made a mod of one that can shoot laser, but I simply colored the laser gun black, shrank it, then covered it over, much like Maxwell's bum. xD\nSadly, when I tried changing the laser's color, I lost its ability to shoot lasers. I tried the laser thing again, but it wouldn't work. It was only shooting laser guns out. <.>\nThis caused me to have to redo it from scratch. (Not really. As I said, you can't really make one from scrath.)\nI uploaded my final result to Steam's Workshop. You can try it out if you'd like.\nSeriously, though... THis game needs some updates.\nOn the bright side, I bought this game for $40, and I don't regret it. I know a lot more about DC Comics' Superheros now, thanks to this game. If you don't like it for its game play, it's like a comic book database. Plus, Smosh played it! xD\nBecause of them, I always give Batman a warm toilet seat, or voice act when I'm bored. It's pretty nice.\n(Allowing multiple savegames would've been nice, too. I've had to delete my save game again and again just to experience the story mode again. Plus, to experience it again once the game is finished, one has to go through the chapters, which are not in order. It's bothersome. That is why I just delete my save game and start over instead.)\nI recommend it! In all seriousness, I hope the people who made this game see this review. We need updates!

It is, but I didn't realize how little I knew about DC comics and their superheroes/villains before I played this game, and it really took away a lot of the fun - you end up creating the same few heroes you know again and again. Admittedly there's a huge encyclopedia included in-game that lets you look up every single included hero or villain, but it's just not as much fun if you're not deeply into DC comics to begin with. Aside from that, while the superhero thing is worked into the Scribblenauts universe nicely, it's just not as much fun coming up with creative solutions when most of the time, creating a giant Superman will solve things anyway. So, it's still a fun game, but I only recommend it if you're a big Justice League fan or DC comics reader.","June 22, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may seem childish at first, seeing as it's just a cartoon character who smiles all the time and runs around helping people, but in the first 10 minutes of playing, I stole a police officers gun and started shooting everyone in sight. I created a mecha robot T-Rex and startd to attack the villans Joker and Deadshot at the same time. I kicked enemies into the ocean, and then spawned a massive shark into the water to finish off the job. This game is full of imagination and extreme possibilities. This version is connected to the unlimited version, and I suggest playing that one first. I jumped straight into Unmasked because I love the DC comic Superheros and was sold on the idea of playing a game with all the characters. It really does test your imaginiation and creativity. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. Especially for five dollars. Get it while it's cheap. Because it's worth it.","September 19, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have almost every hero you can think of. The game ruined me from enjoying the others, though. This was my first Scribblenauts game. I bought it because I saw Smosh play it. xD\nI suggest you start off from a different one, unless you're a big DC fan like myself. However, it seems like people who start from Scribblenauts Unlimited tend to not like this one. I am an example of someone who started playing Scribblenauts with this game, and I don't enjoy the others as much.\nThe customization, sadly, is flawed. When trying to create an avatar (You can do this for free, which is friggin' awesome! xD), you'll often find that you aren't able to move Maxwell's bum. The only thing you can do is color it black, shrink it, then cover it with the bum you want. Actually, shrinking it messes up the animations, so one can only cover it with the desired bum. (xD Bum!) It would be nice if one could move it, too. Plus, it's difficult to make custom weapons. There's no way to make one shoot lasers from scratch. I've tried beams, but it shoots out arched metal beams. I've tried laser, but the laser gun comes out. It becomes a laser gun that shoots laser guns out. I have, however, made a mod of one that can shoot laser, but I simply colored the laser gun black, shrank it, then covered it over, much like Maxwell's bum. xD\nSadly, when I tried changing the laser's color, I lost its ability to shoot lasers. I tried the laser thing again, but it wouldn't work. It was only shooting laser guns out. <.>\nThis caused me to have to redo it from scratch. (Not really. As I said, you can't really make one from scrath.)\nI uploaded my final result to Steam's Workshop. You can try it out if you'd like.\nSeriously, though... THis game needs some updates.\nOn the bright side, I bought this game for $40, and I don't regret it. I know a lot more about DC Comics' Superheros now, thanks to this game. If you don't like it for its game play, it's like a comic book database. Plus, Smosh played it! xD\nBecause of them, I always give Batman a warm toilet seat, or voice act when I'm bored. It's pretty nice.\n(Allowing multiple savegames would've been nice, too. I've had to delete my save game again and again just to experience the story mode again. Plus, to experience it again once the game is finished, one has to go through the chapters, which are not in order. It's bothersome. That is why I just delete my save game and start over instead.)\nI recommend it! In all seriousness, I hope the people who made this game see this review. We need updates!

The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations.

At the time you'd get a car, a rope, and a basket and solve every puzzle ever. Scribblenauts Unmasked ups the ante by sending you into the DC comic world of Superman, Batman and all the other super heroes you didn't know.\n\nThe game consists of a series of puzzles in the form of distressed NPC's who need your help with their troubles. Instead of getting the star out of a tree, you're now trying to get the entire red lantarn corps out of a fortified tree hut by conjuring a different lantern corps of your own. Or you're trying to help superman overcome his nemesis Lex Luthor by giving Supes a lead armour and replacing Luthor's laser cannons with water pistols. Everything is doing overly simplistic and rather adorable, but it gets old quite fast.\n\nThe big, narrative driven puzzles are amusing, but you need to unlock them by collecting enough points of a certain currency. This gets tedious fast because the payout is actually quite low and the controls are a bit iffy. You'll be grinding your way though menial tasks like giving musicians they instruments or by curing sick bear cubs of the flu. What you want to be doing is summoning 17 different versions of Superman and letting them duke it out over a sandwich.\n\nStill, it is a funny little game, but I cannot reccomend it at it's regular price point. Get it in a sale, and have a few laughs.","July 14, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Length could be stretched out a bit, but you could always reset the levels and set in-house restrictions on the puzzles*. Nonetheless, I loved this game."\n\nIn some ways, I enjoyed this game a bit more than the last. Despite not being a big superhero fan, seeing how the developers used each character was clever (not to mention genius implementation of a few of them and their powers). I'm a fan of the set pieces, and the game is charming as heck.\n\nWith all of that said, I think I enjoyed Unlimited a tiny bit more. This could very well be because it felt like I had more freedom (perhaps due to the lack of a license, and therefore lack of corporate restrictions). More likely, because it was my first go with the Scribblenauts series. If Unmasked is your intro, there's a good chance you'll make a similar attachment.\n\nNo matter what, this is a darn fine title -- an all-ages one to boot -- so give it a shot.","May 20, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He was able to help with the challenges and we had a great experience playing it together. As we finished up Scribblenauts Unlimited he was excited about playing Scribblenauts Unmasked.\n\nIf you're like me and played the first game with a young kid, I do not recommend this game. Many challenges start with your character being attacked before you even know what is going on, other challenges have confusing failure states where you will knock out or freeze a villain and the challenge will be failed or you will scare a villain and when he runs away he'll scare other characters and break another challenge. It's a mess and it is not for someone who is playing with a kid or wants to take their time to think up solutions.\n\nIf the hero action that disrupted the puzzle challenges was fun, I might still recommend this game for adults, but it is a mess. Characters fly around bumping into each other, attacks frequently harm bystanders, and heroes often behave like drunks at a tough man competition just punching away even if they have powers. I don't really know who this game would appeal to except maybe people who just want to see what DC characters would look like as Scribblenauts characters.\n\nDefinitely do not buy, even on sale.","April 4, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hopes that the game really didn't live up to. The levels are a pain to get around in, and some of them outright require flying, which is just annoying to have to reenable over and over again. The puzzles themselves really just seems overly repetitive, and it didn't feel like there was as much creativity involved in them.\n\nIn the first, areas could be cleared, whereas here there's a boss fight (these were rarely terribly interesting) but every time you visit a level it will be filled with a new set of randomly selected puzzles. It meant that I didn't really feel like it had the neat theming that was present in the first game. It also meant that having to clear out these smaller puzzles just felt repetitive and uninteresting.\n\nFinally, the superhero element, while neat in some situations, largely just meant that there was a whole bunch of repetitively high powered foes and at a certain point, it just became frustating enough that my solution to every indication of violence was "Green lantern corps", which would bring in like 10 heroes at once. At least that made the achievement for 150 green lantern members happen faster.\n\nThe game should feel fun, and it just really, didn't.","August 2, 2015","false","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Hawkman's wings, for example, let you fly faster than just plain old wings) If you know that game, you know what to look for. If not, I'm certain that there are plenty of reviews that'll clue you in. :)\n\nI had a blast playing through this, and might play it again sometime.

Hopes that the game really didn't live up to. The levels are a pain to get around in, and some of them outright require flying, which is just annoying to have to reenable over and over again. The puzzles themselves really just seems overly repetitive, and it didn't feel like there was as much creativity involved in them.\n\nIn the first, areas could be cleared, whereas here there's a boss fight (these were rarely terribly interesting) but every time you visit a level it will be filled with a new set of randomly selected puzzles. It meant that I didn't really feel like it had the neat theming that was present in the first game. It also meant that having to clear out these smaller puzzles just felt repetitive and uninteresting.\n\nFinally, the superhero element, while neat in some situations, largely just meant that there was a whole bunch of repetitively high powered foes and at a certain point, it just became frustating enough that my solution to every indication of violence was "Green lantern corps", which would bring in like 10 heroes at once. At least that made the achievement for 150 green lantern members happen faster.\n\nThe game should feel fun, and it just really, didn't.","August 2, 2015","false","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The camera movement. Previously you use the right mouse click to move, now u just move the mouse to the corner of the screen to move it while they replace the right mouse click with Attack. Is it better this way? Well in my opinion, no. Previously u hv the feeling of control of the scene u see but now u feel like dragging the camera around and feels sluggish.\n\nOh and also u hv all the DC Universe characters in it. So yea. Should've stat this first but then again, the camera viewing really irritates me. Maybe its just me, I dunno. The game works like all the other games in its franchise, but implimented with DC related characters in the story.\n\nSo is it bad or is it good? Well, depends if u r off two things.\nOne, if u r a DC fan\nTwo, if u r a Scribblenauts fan.\nIf u r both, great! Get it. If ur a DC fan, u will be amazed how many characters u can make in this game, its just mind blowing. If ur a Scribblenauts fan like me, well I think u can pretty much skip this or wait for it to be on sale. Its exactly like all the other Scribblenauts games, but shorter and seemingly easier in my opinion since I played a few before.\n\nThis is not a bad game, but as a Scribblenauts fan, I really wish it could be a teenie-tiny bit longer.\n\n7/10","September 30, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Slightly less fun than Scribblenauts Unlimited, but still very fun. After about 5.5 hours I was done with the story, and just had to grind reputation with Gotham and Justice League to unlock all the characters to complete achievements.\n\nThe reputation grind here is probably going to make me work on the reputation bit by bit. Maybe an hour or two this day, few hours the next, etc. I need around 20,000 reputation with Justice League alone to unlock the characters. Insane! (This grind is really the only reason it's slightly less fun than Unlimited.)\n\nFinished the rep grind and the last few achievements after 9 hours of play. Not too bad for a pretty simple game, but I do wish it had several more levels so it hadn't felt like the game was over so fast.\n\nOverall I think this is a super fun game for fans of Scribblenauts, and especially if you like DC Comics! It's pretty fun to help the Flash win a race and try to stump a “comic expert” by summoning a random hero!\n\n8/10","April 14","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is pretty much only limited by your imagination, and it is incredibly fun thinking of differnt things to create and do.\n\nNEUTRAL: The controls leave something to be desired\n\nCONS: Gets kind of old and it can be hard to figure out how to solve puzzles due to the vagueness.\n\nVERDICT: This is a game for the child inside of you. Brings a smile to my face every time I play it.","January 4","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love scribblenauts unlimited and i am one of the biggest teenage comic book fans you'll ever meet, so i love this game. It's fun and extremely interactive. The story is fun, but it's just such a great a great overall game. There's tons of cool things you can make (it's really insane how much there is), and it's actually really great for learning things about everything that you can create that's DC related.","June 2","true","240.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brushing up on obscure DC trivia is icing on the cake.

Finally, I can play as God controlling and destroying everything I see fit.\n\nIn all seriously this is a fun game. Almost a little too addicting actually. I had a grand time working out what I can sprawn (which is almost everything) and creating ridiculous situations. Why not have Superman fighting a kraken? Why not have Wonder Woman hang off a giant baguette? Why not give Batman his parents in baby form?\n\nThe possibilites are limitless.","June 6","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
