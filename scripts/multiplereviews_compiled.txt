Ruined my life.

The cupcake version of Half-Life.\nPlay as Barney Calhoun and show United States Marines, Black Ops Ninjas, and inter-dimensional mutants that real badasses wear ties and make $26,000 a year.

Here is the Review for non-tf2 players: A pretty neat old online multiplayer shooter using the GoldSource engine\nits not dead, it still has great community servers and is fun\nwith friends (if you have any) or with strangers you can annoy by simply saying tf2 is better because of hats\n\nReview for Tf2 Players:	 > No Hats\n> Nobody plays Pyro because he sucks\n> spy has a shotgun and a smg\n> sniper plays like the tf2 sniper using classic (obviously)\n> no bonus ducks

Play and understand why we need Half-Life 3.

>be at school\n>have headphones in\n>headphones come unplugged\n>whole class panics as a hail of gunfire is heard followed by the message that the bomb has been planted\n>suspended for a week\n>was totally worth it\nI rate it 9/11 on a scale of 5/4

Half-Life vs Half-Life: Source\nFeature        Half-Life        Half-Life: Source                Mods        Many        not many                Soundtrack free DLC        Yes        -                usable in Garry's Mod        -        Yes

We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush.\n\nJohannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly. Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nThe others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.\n\nIt was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.\n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon.  Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere.  From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.\n\nWaking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room.  The only thing visible was a glowing box directly in front of me with words written on it.  Squinting my eyes, I barely made out the small, black letters.\n\nThe box read:\n\nKicked from server.  Reason: lol dont use MG skrub
