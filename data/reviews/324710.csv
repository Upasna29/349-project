The writer explained a lot of his jokes too much or put words in ALL CAPS to EMPHASIZE how FUNNY or ABSURD it is, RIGHT?!\n- Way too much money to pay for what it offers, a more appropriate price would be $5\n\nTo Be or Not to Be is a really good concept of a game. I happen to be a fan of "Choose Your Own Adventure" books and this game was trying to emulate that. What made me buy this game was the Kickstarter page, where it raised more than $500,000 for an originally $20,000 budget game. It clearly had devoted fans and excited developers (especially the writer), so I had to try it out with the expectation that this would be a witty and fresh take on the Hamlet story.\n\nMy biggest criticism is that the pacing is rushed. There was too much summary, like the writer is assuming we don't want to read certain bits or want to know how we got from Point A to Point B. In one playthrough, I played Ophelia and I got a choice of who was at the door: Hamlet, her father, or her best friend. I chose her best friend, but the narration declared that it was Hamlet and Ophelia can't "CONTROL reality with her MIND. Sheesh!" Then why would you give me the choice? Unless that was supposed to be funny, which leads me to my next criticism: The humor. There was no subtlety. Imagine someone paraphrasing Hamlet for you in a parodied slang, and then whenever a joke is coming they only get LOUDER and LOUDER to emphasize their point. That is the humor of this game.\n\nAnother playthrough, I played Hamlet Sr. and I had a choice of how to kill Claudius, his brother: Enlist your son to do it, or do it yourself. I chose to enlist his son, Hamlet, to do it only to be met with judgments and grief from the narrator claiming that the choice was "awful, dude". So they emphasize I have to live with this choice and then attempt to save me by saying I should pick an "afterlife career" (to which they needlessly list a bunch of mundane careers) or I can continue with my choice. I chose to go through with my choice only to be yelled at more and the narrator refusing to cooperate with me. So they just changed my character into Hamlet instead of my original choice, Hamlet Sr., because if I was going to "induce a man to murder", I had to go through with the murder myself. If I refused this change of events, they gave me an abrupt ending. In Shakespeare's play, Hamlet Sr.'s ghost form appears to Hamlet and tells him about the murder, planting the seed of revenge in Hamlet's mind. Judgmental narrators can work, but not when they don't allow you to make the choice at all.\n\nAs for the art (one piece for every ending), there wasn't too much of it and I don't think it was redeeming enough to make up for the writing, which is the dominant force of the game. So if you're buying the game to see the art, I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale.\n\nI went in expecting a coherent, branching storyline where "your choices matter" and you develop relationships with the characters in a way that was more in-depth than Shakespeare. This game is very casual and rushed, a playthrough possibly taking no more than a minute. While the "canon" playthrough is accurate and developed, I would suggest reading a Sparknotes version of Hamlet if you don't want to read Shakespeare's version. If you're still interested in the game, pick it up when it's on sale. However, if you share my criticisms, there are many games that do this style of game better.\n\nEDIT: A commenter pointed out that the Kickstarter was for the print book, not the game. Which in that case, I understand the rushed pace and perhaps lack of funding for the game. But my points still stand, since most of it was for the writing.","February 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 206 of 295 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","206","295","11","8"

Aside utilizing the names and events of the original storyline for a setting - and paraphrasing the book now and then - this is nothing even slightly close to the original work. If you have never read or watched the play, I strongly recommend doing so before venturing into this cheesy spoof.\n\nI've always been a bit of a fan for chose-your-own-adventure format, exploring various courses of actions and their consequences presented for a singular story. I basically grew up reading them, playing on the notion of a choice action. Also becoming a fan of Shakespeare's all works as my age and experience in English language progressed enough for me to appreciate them; this game felt like a natural choice for me. Well... this wasn't what I expected.\n\nAs the narration starts, you are given the opportunity to play the game as Hamlet, Ophelia or Hamlet Sr. a.k.a. King of Denmark, exploring 110 various parody paths and their endings harboring cringe and insult comedy, narrated in modern slang mostly. It's a cute and imaginative game to spare some mindless time with, sure but nothing exceptionally rich I must say. You start playing the game with a silent smirk on your face, scoffing now and then, deepening that smirk into a smile. It has its almost hilarious moments too, mostly presented in situational comedy through written narrative.  It works for 2-3 playthroughs. Yet, as you keep playing and keep witnessing the same kind of shallow remarks for the 30th time, the game quickly loses its charm.\n\nI must confess that the humor presented here was not my cup of tea. It is mostly rough parody and elementary satire, downright underrating the brilliance of the original author by taking crude logic and blatant exaggeration as its weapons. It's not a traditional or psychological reading of the concept. It's an absurd and cheesy parody of the norms of the era, story path choices, gender representations, free-will itself and character interrelations. The relationship between the player and the narrator is somewhat of a semblance to The Stanley Parable with the narrator constantly criticizing you, intervening with your choices and rearranging actions to fit into prearranged storyline format, and doing so while belittling your sentience mostly. Some of the scenes presented - like the naval war between Hamlet's fleet and pirates - are imaginative and entertaining; but most scenes end up being direct hits on the original play with American sitcom humor.\n\nI am aware that I've mostly presented downsides, but would I recommend the game as a final verdict? Meh, why not if it's in a heavy sale and you'd feel like watching Ophelia going on a killing spree, Hamlet time travelling or King of Denmark exploring the bottom of the sea. It is cute, but that effect doesn't last. There is nothing to actually dislike in the game. Narrative dynamic functions fine and the author obviously knows his Shakespeare enough to criticize Hamlet in to this extent. This whole thing is a matter of taste. I'll refuse to downvote it for the sake of creative spark it contains. It should be some labor to write 110 different endings to begin with.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 12","true","8.1"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","31","31","0","2"

Seriously, the Prince of Denmark is a colossal dumbass. He spends most of the play in a state of crippling indecision, talking to himself, talking to the ghost of his father and on one occasion even talking to the skull of some dude he used to know. When he does choose to do something, it is in almost every instance the worst possible thing he could have done. No man of action is Hamlet, instead he's an emo manbaby whose most famous speech is basically him debating whether or not to off himself. Pretty much anyone could do a better job of being Hamlet than Hamlet did, am I right?\n\nWell, good news! In To Be or Not To Be, you can find out just how well you'd do in Hamlet's shoes! You needn't limit yourself to being Hamlet, either. You can also choose to play as the beautiful, brilliant, emotionally unstable Ophelia or Hamlet's dad! Yes that's right, the dead dude, but remember, the whole reason the play even happens is because his ghost is hanging out in the castle! If you want, you can skip getting your idiot son involved and carry out your own ghostly revenge. Pretty kick ♥♥♥, eh?\n\nI couldn't reccomend this game more highly. It is clever, funny and highly irreverent. However, potential buyers should keep in mind that this is a direct adaptation of a choose your own adventure style book. That means that interaction is limited to reading (or having read to you, via optional narration) the story and making choices when prompted. If that's not your cup of tea, fair enough. But if it is, you're in for a great time. To Be or Not To Be is an awesome and hilarious interactive novel with dozens of story paths and over 100 endings, each one beautifully and humorously illustrated by a wide variety of artists.","February 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","41","51","14","0"

Look, you're on the internet, you're already familiar with Ryan North: he's smart, he's funny, he doesn't believe in venerating historical sacred cows. You stir those elements together into a choose-your-own-adventure story and the result is *great*. Nowhere is this more obvious than when you play through the story making all the choices that follow Hamlet as WS wrote it -- there are so many points where you could be choosing a cooler option, whether that's making out with Ophelia or stabbing Claudius at the first opportunity or BECOMING A PIRATE KING. By the time you make it all the way to the play's conclusion it's screamingly obvious that this tragedy was not inevitable but rather the result of Hamlet being kind of a huge wang bag ("an emo teen in his early 30s," North says).\n\nRecommended, and double recommended for English or theater majors.","September 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","0"

I like that I can play a storyline in the 10-minute breaks between my classes; the writing style, humor, and references work for me; and the game singlehandedly convinced me to nickname my car Ophelia (+1 to science, -1 to water, and +10,000 to badassery). This is also a game where it is really fun to achievement hunt -- achievements tip you off to lots of silly but non-required moments, and chasing them down is a good way to structure your playtime.\n\nThat said, the humor relies a lot on the inherent silliness of juxtaposing Hamlet with modernity and may not hit the mark for everyone. Additionally, a lot of humor is milked from the narrator being exasperated with and/or railroading you, a la The Stanley Parable. I found this funny, but given the way To Be or Not To Be is checkpointed, I understand why others might find it frustrating.\n\nAnd that brings me to my biggest problem with To Be or Not To Be: the checkpointing. Checkpoints are infrequent, and while they mostly come at sensible points (at any major scene/plot turn), you'll still end up skipping a lot of text to get back to that one spot where you didn't take the other branching path. It's a minor annoyance, but it's still an annoyance.\n\nAdditionally, for whatever reason, only some of my checkpoints (and ending art!) ever persist after exiting the game -- this is a known bug, and I'm hoping it'll be patched soon. [Edit: This has since been remedied!]\n\nA lesser problem is the sound controls. Although the music and narration volumes have been adjusted since release so the former no longer totally drowns out the latter, there's still no sliders; you can only turn things on or off. My advice: Skip the narration and leave the music on. It's more fun to read the story in your own voice and give the words your own emphasis anyway, and the music really adds to the scenes and the humor in a way that the narration doesn't.","February 7, 2015","true","7.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Do you enjoy the comics of Ryan North?  If you said yes to both of these- you should really get this game for your library! If you said no to either, you'll probably be bored out of your mind. Play as Hamlet, Ophelia, or Hamlet Sr- You can stay as true to the story as you desire or go off the deep end and become someone entirely new! The choices are yours to make!\n\nAt the point of writing this I have yet to see all the VERY numerous endings, and can firmly say that I have only one criticism for this game. If you have the narration on the gentleman talks way too slow for my (or near anyones) reading level and I wind up reading far ahead while listening to dialogue from prior pages. While it's fantastic that narrations been included, I advise turning it off and enjoying the story at your own pace. Other than that- I love this game!\n\n(As a digression, you should really check out Kate Beaton as well since she's a hilarious AND history based comic artist.

The premise is simple, read along and make choices and create your own version of Hamlet. With so many choices, and some  cringingly awesome puns, you control the fate of your character and his/her kin.  The gameplay is fun, although, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't enjoy reading or appreciate Ryan North's brand of humor (snarky, sarcastic, and nerdy).

It's a choose your own adventure book, revamped and updated with a shiny digital interface, achievements, and cards. It takes an esoteric subject matter banished to the wasteland of high school English courses, Hamlet, and asks the player to simply reconsider what they remembered.\n\n"Perhaps Hamlet had been hit with Gamma Radiation and turned into a green killing machine anytime he got angry?"\n"Didn't Ophelia have a thing for science? No no, I'm sure left to her own devices, she'd have created a death ray, right?"\n"How big a thing was dripping poison in someone's ear really? I mean, that's actually a thing right? like ghosts?"\n\nI love this game; it's a bold attempt to pay homage to one of the pillars of English literature, while not taking itself seriously at all. It's the game equivalent of bringing your nerdy friend with a Masters Degree in English Literature to a party, and after some drinking, asking them “so, what did you –really- think of Shakespeare?” The resultant pandemonium as they work out ever semi-coherent grievance is an ambrosia.\n","March 15","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, not here. There's a handy list of checkpoints to just jump to the meaty parts, and there are dozens and dozens of endings, that include pirates, hand chopping, time travel, a cool narrator telling you to be the best person that you can be, and lots and lots of drowning and stabbing and murdering because this is a Shakespeare play after all.\n\nBesides, with each different ending you unlock cool art.

I  wouldn't recomend it to my friends as, others have pointed out, there isn't much in the way of story for the players to read. Way too much is summerized and replay gets pretty boring. Even when I seemed to play a "main" story line I was still finished in about 10mins.\n\nThe writing is at an elementry/early highschool level and the hummour is more silly than "uproarious" and "hilarious", but not unfunny as some other people have suggested. As an English Lit student I guess I expected more...I don't know... academic humour or at least a more critical understanding of the material.\n\nI guess I expected more because I heard about this game from Kate Beaton and I always liked Ryan North's Dinasour Comics. However, over all the writing falls flat and feels rushed. Some of it attempts to recreate Kate Beaton's anachronistic dialouge style, but it comes accross as someone who doesn't understand WHY it works.\n\nI think it has potential and I would love to see this game redone, maybe with a bit of a "Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)" vibe and just mix ALL the Shakespeare storylines together.","April 11","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Everyone knows the line, and mostly everyone who hears it know that it's from Hamlet, arguably Shakespeare's greatest play, and undoubtedly his longest. But when most people think "Shakespeare," they don't automatically think "Shakespearian-based-Visual-Novel/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-Game" as an actual, plausible way to make Hamlet understandable and, indeed, relatable to those unfamiliar with the Bard. As both an avid gamer and someone with a few years of professional training in performing Shakespeare (including a few actual performance credits under my belt), I was surprised to learn of this little gem's existance, and eagerly dove in.\nHaving completed the "Main" Storyline, I am entirely satisfied with my purchase...and now look forward to going back through it again and discovering all the crazy tangents and unbeaten paths.\nFor those who've never seen or read Hamlet, the game helpfully marks the choices that take you down the course of the plot with little skulls. To those scared of being overwhelmed with confusing text, fear not, as the game only dips into the play's text for two or three of the more well known speeches. The rest is told in a humorously critical analysis of just what the characters were saying to each other, and just how insulting and coarse the Bard's characters can be sometimes.\nAnd that's just the path that follows the Bard's version of the tale. Every choice you make could put you into the shoes of      Hamlet himself, his girlfriend Ophelia, and even the Ghost of King Hamlet Sr. without warning. One of my favorite moments so far came from a sidepath of the Ghost King that took me completely by surprise. I won't spoil it, but that moment alone has made me determined to unlock every possible ending just to see what crazy misadventure happens next.\nWhile not the most orthodox way to introduce newcomers to Shakespeare, this game is a treat that should not be passed up by anyone. I give it a 10/10.","June 13, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Incredibly annoying.\n\n*whew*  Got that out of my system.  Anyway, this game (more of a massive choose-your-own-adventure book than a GAME) is very clever and very funny, if occasionally irritating.  The humor is surprisingly arch and for all of the "choosing" that happens in a choose-your-own-adventure, this one can be unexpectedly railroading at times: lots of "but that doesn't make sense; are you sure you wouldn't rather xxx?" or "humor" that practically qualifies as self-impressed liberalism writ large.\n\nI do recommend it; it really is funny and clever and interesting.  But I'm not sure I plan on reading Dinosaur Comics again any time soon after playing this.","October 30, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clever use of Shakespeare's work, amazing artwork and the suave-ist Ophelia that ever graced this planet.  It's smart, it's snappy and it's sassy as all hell.  Could use some better explanation of the key bindings (took me a while to reaslise esc would skip etc etc) but around about the point I was basejumping in a glide suit I decided I didn't care about the details, I just want to live in the world this team created.\n\nI would recommend this if you are a fan of "Hark A Vagrant" or "Dinosaur Comics".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevonessence/recommended/324710/","thevonessence","The von Essence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevonessence/","44 products in account","The thing about this game is that it's an adaption of a choose-your-own-story adventure book. As such, there's not much "gameplay" - it's literally just clicking the mouse to advance text boxes and select options. And after you've played through the whole thing as each character once or twice, a lot of the game becomes pretty repetitive. But if you're a Shakespeare fanatic or someone who's read Hamlet before and likes playing games, To Be or Not To Be is definitely for you. I liked Hamlet because it was utterly absurd, and TBoNTB allows you to both rationaly resolve the situation and take the ridiculousness of the original play to a whole other level.\n\nTL;DR: If you've read Hamlet at least once before, love choose-your-own-adventure novels, and have a silly sense of humor, this is the game for you!","May 19","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

See any edition of 'Dinosaur Comics' for an idea of the kind of thorough analysis, smart-♥♥♥ and righteously PC commentary and gleefully silly fourth-wall jokes you can expect. In the prologue, Ophelia is described as having 'a -1 weakness against water'.\n\nAlso be aware that this is an ebook rather than a game in the strictest sense - though it's very much an interactive 'choose your own adventure'. North takes the time to get as much as he can from the premise ('make fun of Hamlet'), sometimes allowing the player's choices to explore wild tangents that have less to do with the original play but are there as options for those who would rather help Claudius battle skeletons than pick apart another soliloquy. Throughout, though, the book goes to the trouble of adding multiple, widely-varied paths and alternate 'playable characters'.\n\nThe presentation for the Steam edition is a little awkward (you'll want to switch that music off very soon and probably also the voice-over) but the layout - following the printed version - is very solid and doesn't skimp on quality illustrations from numerous respected webcomic authors.\n\nAt one point I had Hamlet make up for his caution by turning into the Incredible Hulk over Ophelia's grave. I loved it.","May 10, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
