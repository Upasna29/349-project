"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/recommended/268220/","PinkLily","(♥) Pink Lily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/","1355 products in account","Overall Game\nIndie RPG game that is re-playable and I would recommend to buy it in packs. You start off with a character that as you level you can customize it.\n\n[Gear]\nYou can buy all sorts of equipment's like head gear, weapons (you can have 2 guns and a melee) which give extra perks to your character besides alter the look. You may carry 2 guns, 1 is your main and have a secondary which you can swap in the middle of fights and have separate ammo. A melee weapon which can be a knife, chainsaw, plasma cutter, wrench and more. They have no upgrades and have a base melee damage locked.\n\nWeapons (guns) have upgrades of their own, levels which you can make it more useful like increasing percentage of damage which you can upgrade with money and  "chips"\n\n[Currency]\nThere are 2 forms of currency in the game, 1 coins and another is chips which u can only get through Boxes. These boxes are drops after killing enemies.\n\nBoxes when opened can give you either coins, chips, XP or 1up. 1up is a Life that can be used when you die on a map to come back into the game in the same place you died otherwise you can quit (lose all the boxes only) or restart.\n\n[Skills]\nAs you level you also gain Skill Points, in game you have a tree of skills that you can put points into and gain extra character perks for your overall character abilities. This may increase your ability to use your weapons more effectively and armor can complement these perks. The tree has 3 main directions you can focus on but ultimately you can have all of them upgraded but keep in mind 1st tier or row must be all upgraded before you can then move to the next row. Specialist, Solider and Medic are the paths you can take.\n\n[Upgrades+Skills]\nTo make the most of your character abilities the main thing to keep in mind is that you can have your characters (gear)  complement your (weapons) Skills can add to these strengths. An example is..\n\nGear- Carbon Armor (base no upgrades)\nShield +5\nShotgun/spread gun damage +7%\nweapon fire rate 3%\n\nPLUS\nGear- Cowboy Hat\nShotgun/Spread gun damage 3%\nWeapon Reload Speed +5%\n\nPLUS\nGear- Carbon Pads\nShotgun/Spread gun damage 3%\nWeapon Fire Rate +1%\n\nPLUS\nSunglasses\nExperience Gain +2% (can be increased to max 15%)\n\nTotal\nShotgun/Spread gun damage 13% (Starting base damage)\nWeapon Fire Rate 4% (Starting Base)\nWeapon Fire Rate +1% (Starting Base)\n\nComplement it with Skills found in specialist but this is just an example in how you can combine your equipment to increase the most out of your weapons. You can swap the sunglasses instead of experience you can get\nHockey Mask which gives u health +5\nMelee weapon damage +5%\nMore fun with your melee weapon which if you finish an enemy off with it you can EXTRA Xp.\n\nWhat I like MOST about the game\n\n[Music]\nThe music.. I found myself lost in the game play. The game play is awesome and the music just complements it so well you just seem to let time pass you by.  I never found myself wanting to buy the sound track of a game until now!\n\nOnline play. The game has a decent amount of players playing this online on multiplayer which make each level a bit more challenging and rewarding. You seem to get more enemies which in result is more XP and Box drops. You can simply start a level and NOT lock the room by not making it password locked. This would allow random "pugs" to join you on your level and assist you in completing the level.\n\nThings that need some work\nServer Connection can be irritating, you dc at the start of the game quit a few times before you can finally establish a secure connection to the server when you are playing ONLINE. Single player there are no issues of connectivity but this game is even sweeter when you play online.\n\nSide Note: It is worth full price and comes with cards. If you aim to get 100% achievement for it play it online it is must faster and easier.\n\nUpdate: The achivement "Rage" is bugged but on 1.7.15 the developer replied on the forums he will be working on fixing this bug. We hope to see this fixed soon so I can work on this last achievement.","January 12, 2015","true","31.1"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","55","64","0","6"

It has a lot of things going for it, great look, easy controls, great enemy diversity, randomly generated maps for each mission, drop in cooperative play and accessories that affect your stats. If you want to play alone, there is a quick setting for that, but I think it adds a lot of fun having some random stranger drop into my game. It breaks up me vs everyone. Enemies get increased stats when people enter your game, otherwise it would just be easy and robbing you of fun and challenge. There is an easy list of games to see, so you can drop in on someone else.\n\nThe controls are easy and combat is fun. A roll to dodge or move quick. A melee button that will get you more experience for close kills. Change between two different equipped guns and of course a trigger to shoot. Your character automatically aims at the nearest target, which for the most part is exactly how it should be. You can't miss.\n\nYou have a shield and health. Your shield regenerates, but your health doesn't. When you're dying, you feel it the screen gets more difficult to see as you go all woozy. There are also random objects to use for cover. If you walk up to cover and just rest without shooting, you're hidden as long as nothing flanks you. When you shoot or melee, then you're standing so enemies can shoot you. Its an easy to use mechanic that has a lot of use further in the game where the sheer amount of damage. Some cover objects can get destroyed, but they are pretty rare. There are even walls that move up and down to take away your cover. Humanoid enemies will also use cover to hide behind. To get over cover, just get up next to it and hit the roll button to vault over. Jumping over cover into an enemy can hurt them, just as they can hurt you. Its such a nice system.\n\nAs you kill enemies, you're rewarded with coins, upgrade parts, the occasional mystery box and power ups like double damage or nuke'em that hurts all active enemies. After every completed mission, you'll open all the collected mystery boxes which can contain coins, extra experience, nothing, upgrade parts or even the rare extra life. These extra lives are hard to come by. When you die on a mission, you can use an extra life, but once you're dead, you either restart the mission or quit. One and done with this game, so you need to pick where you use your extra lives to get thrown back into the action where you died.\n\nThere are 30 missions, but there is plenty to do even if you don't take on an official mission. There is a death match where you compete against other players. A quick play that generates a map just for you based on your current level and because you're special! A wave battle, where you just keep fighting wave after wave until you die. I usually get bored playing other horde modes, but  this is one of the rare times where I kept having fun time and time again. What makes Meltdown interesting is that everything is randomly generated. Even if its your tenth time playing the same mission, it will always be different.\n\nWhen you're not playing the game, you're upgrading. You have items and the abilities. Items unlock as you level up, but you still need to buy them. There is a selection of five guns (shotgun, flame thrower, SMG, pistol and grenade launcher) that can get upgraded with 9 improvements out of 6 slots in 3 different tiers. Once you get to the 9th or 10th upgrade it unlocks better version of the gun. So you can equip both the shotgun and its better counterpart the spread gun. There are different melee weapons to buy, but it only amounts to more damage. Then equip your four different accessories from armors, headgear, shoulder gear and face wear. Its not just cosmetic differences, but things that change combat stats. Such as a cowboy hat that improve shotgun damage. Armor that regenerates ammunition or a ninja mask that improves move speed and dodge speed. Its all up to you. All the wearable items can get upgraded too!\n\nEvery time you level up, you get an ability to use. Each of the several tiers has three different abilities to unlock. Health, melee and guns. Each slot can get upgraded 3 times before it lets you go up a tier. The abilities are subtle, but do a lot, especially the health. They make enemies have a chance to drop shield charges or health. You can get an ability that lets you regenerate health if your shields are full. I would say stick to the health, but you'll have everything maxed out by the end of 30 missions. When you do have everything maxed out, you can chose to rank up your prestige which gives you more health.... but resets your character and missions. A game this good, I enjoy that extra replay value. It also unlocks new items.\n\nWith the need to upgrade, level up and buy things, this might sound like a grind of a game. You can grind, but I never did except for the rare times that I wanted lives from mystery boxes. I didn't have to make this a job to level up.\n\nThe game feels like it has limited map assets and rarely changes its blue metallic look. As the missions progress, blue and green are thrown into the mix, but its all the same. Since everything is randomly generated, the areas get remixed and while everything all looks the same, it doesn't feel familiar outside of the boss battles. A few times there are cars here and there, parked on platforms that seem crazy to have cars, but whatever. The sad part is that you can't make the vehicles explode. The music is techno or dub step and it seems to fit the game, even if I'm not a fan of the music, its still great game music in this case.\n\nSince the levels rarely change the look, its the enemies that stand. There is a wide array of enemies, tactics and weapons they use. It starts with simple bomb spiders that come to you and explode. Then goes up to small cannon tanks. Stationary sentries that come in a wide variety: fire, machine guns, cannons and even walking electricity sentries that can zap you through cover. Red light hover pods will shoot at you, blue ones will electrocute you exposing you up from cover.\n\nThen come the androids. Easy wrench melee droids that run at you, machine gunners that find cover and shoot, shot gunners that won't just kill you close range, but dash to stab you, grenaders that hide and extra deadly snipers. As the missions progress, some of the robots like the machine gunners and snipers will roll to find cover. If you jump over anyone's cover they'll find cover elsewhere. The enemy intelligence is really nice and every weapon from every enemy seems effective to kill you. Grenades knock you down, electricity stuns you, melee enemies break through your cover so the others can advance closer. They all have their limitations though. Snipers fire one at a time and after a few shots need to reload. Machine gunners are slow to follow your movements, but the number of bullets will melt your health. Cannons do bigger damage, but fire much slower.\n\nMost missions offer some unique gimmick where at some point of the map, the game locks you in an area and forces you to defeat either a giant pink boss version of a normal enemy, a unique boss, a wall or a simple wave battle. The wave battles are the easiest. The unique bosses are pretty difficult and you can tell, because they're the levels that everyone joins you to play. The walls are far more difficult. There are 3 plungers that regenerate their health, 1 wall and 3 sections of force field. Damage the plunger will remove a section of wall for you to take out the sentries behind the section. Why is it difficult? Because you're always aimed at the nearest target. So even if you want to shoot the two machine gun sentries about to annihilate you, your character turns to take out a different plunger.\n\nWith all this said, I highly recommend this cheap game. Even if the scenery doesn't change much, the combat is excellent.ThanksRybcka!","January 27, 2015","true","11.6"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

What if you don't care about achievements? Then the game will offer no more than 30 minutes to an hour of enjoyment because there really isn't a whole lot to do in the game\n\n-You have to replay areas over and over again because in order to upgrade and unlock weapons you need coins, something that takes a while to collect. There are accessories to help collect coins faster but that still doesn't make up for the fact that it takes a while to collect enough coins to buy upgrades and buy the weapons you want. It seems like such an artificial hurdle to pad the game length for no reason.\n\n- As you kill enemies you gain xp to upgrade your character. You have a total of 55 levels and it becomes incredibly easy to upgrade your character, One online wave attack mode with a few people and you can easily level up 10-15 times depending on how far you get or how many people are playing. Because you can max out every skill, you don't have to make any difficult choices on how you develop your character.\n\n-The game offers 30 levels and they all look and play the same. Every level is linear and you simply kill enemies until you reach the end. Rinse and Repeat.   As I said earlier, wave attack mode is the only fun thing in the game.\n\n-The game froze on me one too many times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe core of the game is solid, it controls really well and it has a lot of solid ideas, the problem is the developers didn't really build a game around those ideas. The upgrade/character development is horribly balanced and with some rebalancing and improvements I can see this game being a lot better. This game is an ios port and it shows and is a perfect example of what works well on one platform may not work well on others.  As it stands, I cannot recommend this game, there just isn't enough content to justify a purchase.\n","October 24, 2014","false","9.8"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","1"

The mechanics are solid, the graphics decent, and the music almost catchy, but it never changes even a slight bit from the very first level in the game. It's almost as if the developers created a single level and felt that was enough to sustain the entire game, repeating it to incessant amounts to pad the experience which might as well begin and end in the few minutes it takes you to complete the tutorial.\n\nMeltdown is an isometric shooter that favors simplicity for complex mechanics or enemies. Enemy AI is mostly nonexistent, weapons are self explanatory, and the leveling system generous enough that you'll never need to choose between upgrades as you have more than enough points to level them all with more to spare. And if I'm being completely honest, the basic design is actually enjoyable to an extent (at least in coop), but its design is so stagnant, so painfully repetitive that it was literally on the verge of putting me to sleep as I struggled to retain interest while playing through what felt like the exact same level I'd played a dozen times before. Enemies, encounter designs, environments and level layouts; they're all exactly the same from each level to level, leaving on to wonder what exactly the point of continuing is.\n\nRending progression even more useless, is how you are restricted from so much until you prestige your character (which first requires you level up every skill tree), which then completely erases all progress you've made (including unlocked missions) and expects you to play it all again with nothing more to show for it but a new color on your username. It's incredibly poor design decisions like this that make Meltdown feel as if the developers didn't bother to think how the player would take this forced repetition past that which you experience by default going through the game, as if they expected them not only to endure the grind but actually enjoy it.\n\nTo be entirely fair, there are actually a few interesting ideas presented with Meltdown (such as the automatic cover system), but they are so entirely useless that there really is no need for them to be in the game at all. So many elements seem out of place or pointless, making an even bigger case for the game being less than finished or thought out.\n\nMeltdown at its core is a solid, if largely unremarkable, coop focused isometric shooter, but the amount of content it contains wouldn't fill the average demo. It's one of the worst offenders at artificially padding a game's length by reusing the same content I've ever seen, and isn't worth bothering with for anymore than a mindless time waster. Even as that it fails to entertain, with the most enjoyment to be found in the numerous moments the game decides to break and glitch you and enemies onto objects.\n\nWho knew getting stuck on a wall could be so much fun.","June 30, 2014","false","4.9"," 61 of 102 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","61","102","0","0"

You will not be disappointed.\nYou are nameless commando guy, your goal: destroy a sea of droids and reach the exit elevator. Where this game really shines is it's customization and music. You collect money and chips which you use to buy and upgrade weapons, armour and accessories. There is a good of each and they really allow for a lot of different playstyles. The music is perfect and keeps you pumped. The gameplay is repetitive but really fun and addicting. Enemies are challenging and can kill you quick if your not prepared so killing them stays satisfying, even when your grinding for that next item. The level design keeps things fresh by featuring wave attacks, boss battles and mini bosses. There’s also a really fluid cover system that a lot of triple A games could learn from.\n\nThe bad: All the levels look pretty similar. The game is relatively short, you can complete all the levels and get a max level character in under 5 hours - but, there is a lot of replayability so that helps. Online multiplayer is poorly done: no chat, random annoying people dropping in your game and no way to kick them, difficult to play with friends or make friends to play with - but, the devs are working on this and local co op is the shiznittlebambizzle.

It did not disappoint.\n\nIts essentially a twin stick shooter. With an extremely addictive gameplay loop. Unfortunately the reasons it becomes addictive is that its set up almost exactly like a free to play game. The good aspect of this once you buy it, no more actual money is needed to play. There are multiple resources in order to level your character, weapons and gear up.\n\nThere are coins, chips and skill points as well as other requirements to unlock new gear which will allow for different styles of play. However mostly its a mixture of fast moving character builds or tank builds or some concoction of assorted gear designed to min/max coin drops or XP gain. There is even some gear that requires the renowned 'prestige' mode to unlock. Another aspect of the free to play model breaking through is that enemies occasionally drop mystery boxes which are opened individually at the end of a mission and yes, some of them are empty.\n\nAnother aspect I rather enjoy is that there is drop in drop out co-op up to 4 players and the more players there are an instance or mission, stronger and more enemies are spawned with more XP to be gained for all. It borrows from Diablo in the way the loot on screen is only grabbable by yourself. So there is no fighting over coin and chip drops.\n\nIf your looking for something mildly mindless but enjoyable and like games 'where the numbers go up' this is sure to deliver.","September 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is composed of thirty stages along with wave-attack, level-attack, and deathmatch modes. You blast robots with a variety of unlockable and upgradeable weapons, and level up to acquire numerous abilities. This game supports up to four players locally or online.\n\nWell..that was an exciting +1 to my review count wasn't it?\n\nWhat?\nNot good enough?\nSheesh. Alright then.\n\nMeltdown is the kinda game you play, when you want to free your mind of pesky questions such as: "What should I wear to work tomorrow?" and "Should I go to work tomorrow?" and even "Will I get fired because I didn't show up for work today?" It's addictive, and there are enough hooks in place to keep you on the hamster wheel for quite awhile.\n\nThe enemy robots are decently varied, and it's important to adopt a play-style that suits your loadout. Sure you could commando your way through everything with rockets and grenades, but extended fire-fights will require that you take cover. Expect to do a lot of rolling as well. Equipment introduces other variables such as bonuses to specific weapons, better shields/HP, or speedier movement. It's not totally in-depth, but that's probably why I appreciate it. You get an idea of what works and what doesn't immediately.\n\nThe stages are standard fare, with a few boss-fights, arenas, and shielded walls to mix things up. It's a bit on the padded side, but they go by pretty quickly. It can get frustrating sometimes with cheap enemy spawns. There have been more than a couple occasions, where two shotgun-bots spawned next to me and immediately fired. Also the last couple stages are a slog, because of all the freakin' snipers. That could be on me though for using underpowered weapons.\n\nEverything is better with a partner and this game is no different. It's rare to see online co-op so well-implemented. It's almost as good as if you were playing an arcade machine and somebody walked up next to you to join in. Joining an online game is very fast and smooth, and connection drops are fairly rare (even with my overpriced crapfest Roadrunner internet). Admittedly, most of my co-op time was spent in wave-attack (easiest to grind for exp/money/upgrade-chips). Running the regular stages with partners tends to make them a bit too easy. There is damage-scaling depending on how many people are playing, but it's not nearly enough due to the overwhelming weapons, knockdown effects that keep robots inactive, and so on. Plus, even if you die you can just use a 1up to get right back in the fight(unlike arcade games, these aren't rare at all).\n\nSo there it is, a more fleshed-out review of the perfectly serviceable Meltdown. Play it until you unlock everything, play it until you get bored, but give it a shot. I think it's decent enough, even if it's a bit too safe.\n\nFor a potential sequel I'd suggest:\n\n-Higher enemy counts (especially in co-op)\n-More varied builds (Classes? Maybe hand out some unique abilities)\n-Limit the number of available lives\n-Better stage variety (Plenty of classic arcade shooters to pull ideas from)","January 15, 2015","true","13.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game is fairly straightforward in an arcade fashion, and as such is pretty repetitive.  However, I've found the best part of the game is the "wave mission" where you get enemies in waves and see how long you can last (though 1ups feel a bit like cheating in that spirit).  I feel this probably works best in a quick pick-up game fashion.  So far the two biggest gripes I have are on standard missions you can get unfair mechanics such as a sniper spawning in front of you and a rocket launcher behind you so you're pretty much dead, and that the game seems to freeze and stop responding when I try to quit to desktop.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a simple, fun shooter I would recommend the game. Depth and story are not present, so if you need those this isn't your game.","August 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

And there is too little visual variation in the maps. Some more enemy types, attack/movement options might prevent the 30 "campaign" levels from feeling as repetetive as they did.\n\nThe VR support for Oculus rift (DK2) is really solid, with large easily readable menu texts, and while it doesn't really immerse you (or attempts to), it definately heightens the sense of involvement and intensity. Only complaint is the zoom effect when someone levels up - it's too much in VR.\n\nIf you're just looking for a non-VR twinstick shooter, try the Halo Spartan Assault/Strike games instead which are similarly priced.

The controls are responsive, the animations and sounds great, and the enemy diversity challenging and engaging. By completing missions and defeating enemies you gain experience and coins, along with upgrade chips, that you can use to purchase and upgrade weapons along with choosing skills related to three different paths. There are very minor annoyances, such as no recovery from being knocked to the ground (during which you are still VERY vulnerable). The game is also a bit grindy, since upgrade chips are awarded somewhat randomly and the amount required to upgrade each weapon increases as you level the weapon. However, VERY minor - they don't affect the enjoyment of the game at all. I haven't played the coop yet, but it seems like it could be extremely entertaining. Pick it up, especially at $3.99.

I can be going through a level and doing fine, then all of a sudden two machine gunners pop up on both sides of me and no matter what gear or weapons you are using, if two machine gunners pop up close to you like that, it's game over. Any enemies spawning in on top of you like that creates a real problem in any game. Some weapons are worthless, like the flame and shotgun weapons. You will never be able to get close enough to use them without dying. You will never progress in the normal missions unless you do a lot of grinding in the wave attack mode. It seems like now though I am at lvl 50 the wave attack does not give enough exp so I have to play the regular missions and pray to God that I don't get random pop-ins on top of me during them. The wave attack + wearing the extra coin drop hat is also the only way you can get enough coins and upgrade chips to afford new weapons, upgrades, and armor. There are weapon upgrades that are also worthless but you don't know until you find out with some trial and error. The upgrade for the machine gun that gives you ammo regen is basically a requirement because without it, you will run out of ammo quickly during a level and ammo drops are rare and even when they drop only give you a few bullets. This means that you basically can't pick the upgrade next to the ammo regen unless you want to see that problem. So if that is the case, why even offer another skill?\n\nThe graphics are well done, the sound is good, the music is great dubstep, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is pretty much non-existent, just like I like it. I get quite enough story in my rpg's and books I read, I don't need it in my action games. I play action games because they are simple and I want to just blow people away. I don't want a bunch of cut scenes or text in my action games. This game is just straight up fighting.\n\n7/10 pretty fun, although the problems I mentioned really should be addressed but obviously never will.","December 28, 2014","true","14.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Only without the... "unorthodox", distasteful art direction and theme that the latter had.\nIt also has a cover system to, although it ISN'T snap-to, but rather you're automatically in cover near a wall and can move without penalty (although shooting while in cover exposes you to enemy fire).\n\nWeapons and armor are upgraded using a combination of coins and "chips" which drop randomly in the field. As upgrades become higher in tier, so to does the chip and coin cost. Money and chips come at a fast rate though, so you won't feel much of a grind until you reach the higher levels of equipment. Even then, the grind is nullfied by the simple yet addicting gameplay.\n\nThere's a skill tree system present that allows the player to pick between one of three categories. Unfortunately, your choices are ultimately meaningless as the game gives you enough skill points to max out all three trees.\nFortunately! Ranged weapons all have their own skill trees, which you are given enough skill points to spend throughout aproximately half of it. The upgrades are different enough so that what you spend your points on is a point of consideration. The great thing about this though is that you can freely reset your weapons any time and re-upgrade them back to their previous level with no cost, so experiment away! (You can't freely reset your character, but that's a useless feature anyway as levels come SUPER fast, like crazy fast).\n\nPerhaps if the skill tree customization was closer to the weapon customization in implementation, players might be able to specialize more and fill specific roles. Adding to the "tactical" side of things.\n\nRight now I've identified five distinct (although not concrete) methods of fighting, through weapon and armor combinations.\n-Mid-range DPS\n-Long range burst\n-Short range burst\n-Explosives/AoE\n-Melee (my current favourite; you can roll REALLY fast and cheat death so many times if luck is in your favour)\nBut you can mix and match between these roles as you wish thanks to having seven customizable slots: Weapon 1, Weapon 2, Melee, Body, Head, Shoulders and Accesoriy.\n\nAn unfortunate thing to note about melee is that it is distinctly less varied than the ranged weapon options. With the weapons simply being straight upgrades (it doesn't help that they're more expensive than guns/armor as well). Range, attack speed and other differences between the weapons would go a VERY long way. As would weapon skill trees too.","June 20, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That I was so excited I knew I could confidentally offer a very favorable review for Meltdown!\n\nFirst & Foremost - The game is ready for Xbox 360 Game Pads out of the box but the developers thought waaaay ahead of most others as they also allow you to map your game pad in options. Logitechs set to X-Input still can not switch the trigger buttons over to Digital from Analogue but with the option to map it totally circumvented those frustrations us Logitech fans have had with a portion of past releases.\n\nSecondly - Meltdown is a highly focused and minimalist approach to Run & Gun\Wave Attack\Schmups. Unlockable modes? Check! Unlockable weapons and skills? Check! You can even opt between three different soldier specialities which determine which skills are available in your skill tree.\n\nThirdly - Polish. The game looks finished already! 'nuff said.\n\nAnd Finally - More to come. Before choosing mission (both static or randomly generated) I could easily option for online co-op with the press of the "Y" button and 33 players were online playing already at the time of this writing. Before release developers have also promised offline, split-screen co-op for those with friends in their area, siblings or little ones to look after.\n\n$4 for this, so far, plus more to come?

The buttons on the main menu has a bit of a weird placement and are rather large, which would be good for a tablet game but not on desktop.\n\nSupports 360 controller (and other gamepads) which is a plus, plays really well with it aswell. (I've played with both keyboard/mouse and controller)\n\nReally nice graphics, I thought the flares was a bit much to start with but it looks nice :)\n\nGood customization/upgrade options for both weapons and the player character. Some interesting upgrades, and not very difficult to obtain.\n\nCharacter movement is nicely fluid, however I feel that bullets don't go strictly where you aim which was really annoying at the start, once you get used to it it's not that big of a deal tho.\n\nThe difficulty of the gameplay increased rather rapidly like on mobile games that are "free" when they want you to purchase virtual currency to proceed.. That gameplay mechanic is quite obvious when you die, if you have obtained 1up's you can use them when you die in a level to proceed, otherwise you have to restart the level, losing progress & things you have obtained during the level.\nThis type of gameplay mechanic is frequently used in mobile games with micro-transactions. It's apparent that the devs have tried to ease down on that mechanic, but it is not completely removed.\n\nHopefully they will balance it out better during the Early Access stage.","May 30, 2014","true","3.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Surprisingly good for a mobile port to the PC, the gameplay is good for what it is and the graphics are stylized and work well.\n\nCombat appears simple, though it requires thought and strategy. Sometimes taking cover and shooting works well, other times running and gunning (with rolling and dodging) is best. It all depends on what's shooting or throwing grenades at you, or self destructs (scary). Different weapons (and armor) for different situations, which are unlocked for purchase by meeting various criteria. You can carry up to two weapons at once and switch on the fly. Various upgrades are also available for purchase once sufficient funds and upgrade chips are collected.\n\nUpgrade your skills as you level up. There are three branches: Specialist, Soldier and Medic. Each one has features and bonuses appropriate for it's type. Choose which ones you want first to fit your play style or adapt it as you see fit (you get all of them eventually). Skills can be reset for the right price. Weapon upgrades can also be reset, you get nine points to allocate amongst two sequential branches and are a bit more limited. With weapons, resetting is free (at the time of this writing).\n\nMystery boxes (bonus items) which appear to be randomly dropped as loot, contain assorted items such as Extra Credits, Extra Experience, Upgrade Chips, One Ups (extra lives/continues) and the dreaded...Nothing! These boxes are opened after level completion, if you survive. Add in looted powerups such as Double Damage (a brief damage spree) and Nuke 'Em (damages all nearby enemies on pick-up) for extra fun and mayhem. Replay levels to improve your rating (up to three stars). Steam achievements (collect 'em all) and trading cards included.\n\n__\nNotes: This review is based on the reviewer's single player experience (finished level 30 in a bit over 10 hours). Multi-player has not yet been attempted. No game crashes were encountered although some issues with the game interface (weapon unlocks) have been noted while playing with a gamepad and require a mouse to respond.","June 8, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good variety of weapons and armour as well as upgrades.\n2.) Skill tree that has various attributes that you can notice in game.\n3.) Some decent replayability with the prestige mode and fun multiplayer maps\n4.) Graphics + Music were nice as well\n\nMultiplayer was done really well as well, you can just jump in and out of various games as well as host your own.  Enemies become more challenging with more people in game, but also makes the game a little more fun.  Only oddity with it was with the Wave Challenge mode, if you died out of the mode and someone else was still in game you could rejoin that game even though you had already died out, odd thing, but okay by me.\n\nCouple of things that really bugged me on my playtime though.  For starters you get mystery boxes throughout the levels that you cash in when you finish the level or run out of lives.  In those mystery boxes you can get gold (to upgrade or buy weapons/armour), EXP, upgrade discs, lives, or NOTHING.  I don't like the inclusion of nothing, doesn't add anything.  As well when you become max level you still get EXP in those boxes which is slightly annoying.\n\nA bug with the weapons and armour as well.  There is various types of armour that are incompatible with one another, however sometimes one piece of armour will say it is incompatible while the other will say it's fine and you can equip both pieces even though 1 out of 2 pieces says it is incompatible.\n\nAs well with the prestige mode, I wish you got more perks for going through it a couple times, like some of the perks got to higher percentages or more base stats.  I don't remember seeing any big jumps in stats in the points you could put into various perks between various prestige levels.","February 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/268220/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUpH9nKZIyY\n\nMeltdown is a good game. It's an addicting twin stick shooter with drop in, drop out multiplayer. I played little more than 3 hours, so this is my first impressions of the game.\n\nIt's an okay mobile port. It's not the best, nor the worst. There are not enough settings. Just graphics quality, resolution, music and fx sliders and Vsync. Keys are not rebindable. Also there is option for Aim-assist and I think it might be a good idea to be on. I'll explain later way.\n\nThere isn't a story here. Well, it's not entirly true, but I wouldn't call it this a plot. You are traped in a space station as result of system malfunction. That's it. In this case I don't mind the lack of any story, because the game is all about shooting. Tense, fun and addicting.\n\nGraphics are alright. All charaters have this black outline to feel cel shaded, but actually they are not. At close inspection the main character is not that good looking, but you see him only when you buy stuff. Overall levels, enemies and your character are nice to look at, but not great.\n\nYou've seen this kind of gameplay a milion times before. Here it doesn't offer something new. It's simple and generic, but at the same time fun. You just run, gun, collect coins, chips, mystery boxes and gain XP. Basic stuff. You buy new firearms, armor, melee weapons. Guns have six different stats that can be upgraded. They are all standard – more damage, increase fire rate etc. But beside money for them you need chips. The catch is you can't upgrade the six of them, only three, so choose wisely or if you want to make correction, reset them, but i'm not sure if you will get back your money and chips. The two of them are gathered from dead enemies. And armors can be upgraded too. You can also pick up two power ups – double damage and nuke.\n\nThe coolest feature here is drop in, drop out multiplayer. You start alone, but at any time others can join you, up to three more people. It's defenently more fun and little bit more easy to have someone by your side to watch your back literally. You can do the same thing, join someone else to play together.\n\nAt the end of each level you will open mystery boxes. From them you can get xp, chips, coins, lives or nothing. Yes, here you have lives. If you loose all of them you have start at the beginning of the level.\n\nBeside all those things, you can buy additional cosmetics like eye patch, hats, shoulder pads and so on. They don't just change the appearance, they also have additional buffs like more health, more damage etc.\n\nAfter you level up, you have points to distrubute in three directions – specialist, medic and soldier. They also can be reset. In the beginning they are standard buffs, like more damage, but later they become more interesting – health regeneration, fire rate increase with weapon overheat and so on. Weapons can overheat and when this happen you have to wait them to cooldown.\n\nEnemies are all robots with different attacks. They are diverse and require different tacktics to kill them. The two bosses I encounter are fun and tough to fight, especially when you are alone.\n\nLevel design is okay. In the beginning the levels are small, but later they are getting bigger. All have similar design – bridges, sandbags, boxes, cars, froklifts, small walls to take cover and so on. Here there is a cover system, but I rarely use it. First 10 levels have different design, than later ones are different, so you have a little bit diversity. Sometimes you'll get locked in a area and to get out you have to kill everything  to progress. There is one “But”. As I said all are similar to each other. You will see the same boxes, the same sandbags and after 3 h with the game the layouts and design are still the same\n\nSound is great. All weapons sound appropriate and feel meaty and explosions are good. The soundtrack is really great. You will hear techno and dubstep, fitting excelent in this sci-fi setting. I won't listen it every day, but throughout my time with the game I never wanted to stop the music.\n\nI have one big issue with the game and few small ones. You can clearly see in the video that the crosshair have to be near a target, not on him to hit him, but this depends where the enemy come from. This is so bizzare and annoying. That's why I said in the beginning maybe the aim-assist is not a bad idea. Through my time with the game I encounter two bugs, one was game breaking. The first was I was frozen when I respawn and I lost a life. And the other was, I fall through the floor in to the abyss. Both bugs are just one time experience. Also the game is build around grinding and there is no doubt about it. I reach a point where I have to repeat few levels to get a better gun. And lastly, almost all menus have to be draged with the mouse to move them and it's annoying. Obvious mobile port.\n\nThe game doesn't do anything bad, nor anything great and that's fine. It's a really simple, yet addicting. Easy to pick up and play. But to be fair after 3 h I start to get a little bit bored. I've seen what the game have to offer. You are doing the same thing over and over again. It's a perfect time killer, a game where you can go in play 1or 2 levels before you go somewhere for example. There two additional modes – Wave Attack and Deathmatch, but I didn't try them. As much as I have problems with the game, i'm kinda addicted to it, maybe because of the simplicity and almost great gameplay. It have good gameplay, great sound design and it still have few players online, but it have this annoyance with the crosshair, suffers from repetition both in gameplay and level design. I recommend it, but on sale.","February 28","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/268220/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TL:DR – Meltdown is a fun short term game with ‘drop-in’ multi-player co-op and there are still people playing online so you can join in. It’s a grind fest though, so if you’re looking for a quick “play-and-forget” game, this might not be for you. You’ll grow “satisfied” with the game within 5-6 hours\n\nThere’s no real story to the game, just a short cinematic intro video that shows the hero Zed landing on a platform ready to kick some ♥♥♥. There are a couple of bosses, but they don’t talk to you and there’s no significant narration. You’re basically killing a bunch of nameless robots like a contestant in a game show.\n\nMeltdown is an isometric or “top down” shooter with gameplay similar to Bastion, but with guns. Like Bastion, you can roll to dodge enemy attacks or get close enough to melee them. It’s similar to the game Alien Swarm in the way that you unlock weapons as you level up and choose your loadout at the beginning of each mission. A key difference though, is that in Meltdown you can upgrade your gear by spending money and chips that you find from fallen enemies.  Bear in mind that while upgrading gear does make a difference, the damage of weapons never really gets that much higher. So it’s not like Diablo where you start with 1-10 damage and end the game with 9,000 – 20,000 damage. Because of this, when a high level player joins the game of a lower level character, the damage difference between the two characters isn’t outrageous.\n\nThe level of your character is separate from your gear, and the two only interact when you unlock new gear at certain levels. A high level character might still be too poor to buy the good stuff. Each time you level up, you get a skill point to put into your 3 skill trees. Don’t be fooled when the game says there are 3 character classes. You will end up maxing all 3 trees, and frankly it doesn’t make too big of a difference which skill path you take first. All the skills are passive such as regenerating ammo or +5% damage.\n\nWhen you reach the maximum level of 55 (all skill trees are maxed), you have the option to “prestige.” This means you reset your level, skills, mission progress, and gear. It’s basically like starting from scratch except you keep whatever money you’re currently holding. The game is broken down into 30 “randomly generated levels” and each time you finish a level, you unlock the next. For example to play mission 20 you need to have beaten mission 19. Honestly, even though the levels are randomly generated, they are all pretty much the same. You just keep moving to the upper -right direction to get to the end. The levels are very linear, you’re not going to get lost.\n\nPros:\n+The game is beautiful in its simplicity. There’s no real inventory system to deal with and only a few things drop from fallen enemies, such as ammo, health, money, and chips. You want all of these. Grinding for loot is easy and the game itself is almost casual at times.\n+The multi-player component is fun, though it seems incomplete. I didn’t see any way to actually “talk” even typing messages to people in your game doesn’t seem to be an option. Oh well, each level is like 10 minutes long and you’ll never see the other guy again.\n\nCons:\n-Hard to find info for the game online since it’s so small. Because of this, it may be a little intimidating to get into. It’s not like you can ask a high level guy a question since you can’t talk in game. I didn’t understand what the prestige option did until I did some online research.\n-The multiplayer experience gain doesn’t seem scaled correctly. If a level 1 character joins a high level game he will level up very very fast.\n\nOverall, if you have the game and are considering whether or not to try it, definitely do. The download size is small and it’s pretty fun. You can also get about 20 Steam achievements in about 6 hours.\n","April 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First thing: this is a grinding game done right! It is my new favorite "pew-pew-pew" type of game. More of an arena shoot 'em up type of game than plot driven shooter. I won't be talking about variety of enemies and gear - you REALLY should check them yourself. All items in game give some bonuses. No cosmetics. The most fun thing in game is the upgrade section. You got limited upgrade slots for each weapon. And this means... You can customize each gun just the way YOU want to use it. Want a short ranged heavy machine gun that pierces enemies? Sure, why not? Want a ranged flamethrower that ignites bots from afar rather than a classic variant? Take one, please. The char skill system is neat too.

After checking out some of the gameplay footage and reviews and figured I would give this a go since I LOVE Bastion and it was so cheap! I'm glad I did! It plays very similarly to Bastion, which is a great thing! That said, this game still feels very different in its own respect. The gameplay is tight, the co-op is a blast, and the AI is surprisingly good. I actually really enjoy everything this game does. My ONLY complaint, and I mean only, is that the 1up's system is a little annoying because you have limited checkpoints. Other than that, this game is a must buy if you enjoyed Bastion or any other arcade type game with slick mechanics. The control system is surprisingly good on keyboard, considering I only liked to play Bastion with a gamepad. I still play this with a gamepad, but both systems work well.\n\nAnyways, BUY THIS GAME! Don't let the low price fool you into thinking it isn't a polished masterpiece!

If you want a game with fast paced action and a wide variety of things to do, Meltdown is the game for you. The game itself is fairly new so it only has a campaign mode, which you can play online. The game is definitely already a work of art, and still has so much potential. If the developers could add a sandbox mode, where players could build their own maps, that could lead to PVP multiplayer. The game can already generate random maps, but those are only like the ones we have. With the addition of sandbox, developers could add different types of terrain, different elevations, and even vehicles. Vehicles like tanks and military jeeps could maybe seat about 3 people, but I'm getting off topic. The game so far has not had any bugs (to my experience), and runs really smoothly. So, if you are thinking of buying this game, what are you waiting for? The graphics are amazing, the gameplay's great, the multiplayer's great, and the price is low.

I mean, what is the point of upgrading your weapons and completing missions just to have it all reset when you prestige? I can understand resetting the skill tree (that's the point of prestige), but this is just blatant padding. Besides, what do you get from prestige? A whopping +5 health and +5 shield and the ability to upgrade your weapons one level higher! Oh, and a golden nickname of course, because everybody wants to be special!\nAnd you have to do it three effing times, btw.\n\nEnemies. They lack in variety and some of them are just a pain in the аss, like the bot that will chase you down and if you ever stop mashing the spacebar or run into something, you get immobilized, and then the other bots come and rip you into shreds.\n\nGame mechanics. I get that only humans can trigger the mines, but why explosions don't affect the bots? Your grenade launcher damages them and the mines don't. Also the bot that throws literally the same grenades at you and nobody takes damage (except you, that is).\n\nOh, and about mashing the spacebar. If you don't care about drops, you can complete some of the levels just by infinitely dodging the enemies straight to the end.\n\nOverall, don't bother buying it if you don't have a group of friends that can play with you and contain your frustration.","January 8","false","15.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

I'm giving it a negative review because a patch they released for Occulus Rift support prevents any XP user from playing. They haven't fixed it for over 3 months. The game advertises as being sold to run on XP. They are lying to customers and several buyers before the refund policy have been shafted because of this. When it is fixed, I will recommend this game.\n\nDo not bother telling me to update my OS. This is strictly reading the requirements listed in the store page. Work as advertise or modify the listing so people aren't given false hope they can multiplayer with a friend.\n\nPros: Controls are well done as a twin stick run and gun style game. None of the buttons are in weird places of the keyboard and conforms to first person shooter standards.\n\nGuns fire with a satisfying feel from the sound of the shotgun, to the recoil from holding down the machinegun.\n\nEquipment provides enough variables to promote tactics, such as using equipment that boosts shotgun damage or even having nothing equipped to move faster if that is something you want.\n\nCon: The delay of switching from melee back to gun leaves you too vulnerable to want to use in later levels. It became a gimmick that looks cool, but will end up killing you easily.\n\nThere is an end game where you can no longer level up and get new things to make life easier playing this. Once you complete the campaign, you will more than likely stop playing because you will have beaten all the content there is to have.\n\nThe latter half of the game will be grinding for chips to upgrade gear.","September 21, 2015","false","14.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Enemies just randomly spawn in front of you, so you have no time to plan an approach. Only two weapons and basically nothing else to do. No grenades, no powers, no flanking, no combos, no strategy, no nothing. Most shots don't really hit multiple enemies, exploding enemies don't damage each other, etc... so positioning is of very little importance. Just avoid their damage zones and shoot. Cover is not 'tactical' enough, it's mostly a gimmick. Ironically enough, you will find more 'tactical' gameplay in the hardcore action twinstick competitors this tries to differentiate itself from.\n- Too slow paced to be an action twin stick shooter. 2-3 enemies on screen at a time is just boring for an action game.\n- EXTREMELY repetitive levels. Basically all the maps are linear and predesigned with the same 10 or so areas (that are made with some generic assets to begin with). No PCG maps and no variety in level design.\n- Bad design in general, like inconsistent pacing (most of the game is boring while bosses are extremely hard), game breaking (life regen) or useless upgrades, you simply run out of ammo during boss battles because see point below. Enemies can stunlock you at full health and you die without any chance of retaliation\n- Bosses are just regular enemies with more HP.\n\nThe ugly:\n- The unlock system is designed as a F2P game for mobile and is a chore as expected. While there are no paid microtransactions here, the difficulty ramps up horribly, forcing you to grind earlier levels so you can get good enough gear for later levels. But hey, levels are all the same anyway, so you probably can't even tell the difference between level 5 and level 10. Oh, and after you unlock stuff in single player/online, have fun doing basically the same thing AGAIN for local coop. Having fun yet?\n\nSo maybe after a 10 hour grind you could have enough variety in this game for it to actually be entertaining for once, but by then you'd have uninstalled it.","December 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There seem to be some complaints about every level being the same, whilst i must admit they do look similar there are a fair few different level designs, granted the theme is exactly the same on each level ( space station ) and it would have been nice to see some different terrain, jungle, city etc.\n\nGraphically its a very nice game bright and clean looking. The soundtrack is fairly good but can grind a little after a few hours it does change a little through the levels. If you love grinding for armour / guns etc this game will really appeal to you and whilst the enemies aren't easy to defeat they never feel extremely overpowered.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent in fact more expensive titles have a lot to learn from this game, It's extremely smooth and responsive. The upgrades make a noticeable defference to your weapons which allows you to complete levels with that extra bit of XP to show for it.\n\nAll in all its been a game i have played over and over and will continue to do so i'm just hoping the developers add more and more to this great game.\n\nGraphics  10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nsoundtrack 7/10\nValue for money and overall 10/10  ( sorry it just really appeals to me personally )\n\n","October 15, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Enemies are randomly generated so re running the same level will always be different.\n\nOverall, not a game to look at as an android port. This one stands up to the big boys in the coop genre. It's not an AAA, but for indie, it's the best you can get.","January 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This topdown twinstick shooter is a lot of fun, and the VR support in the Oculus Rift is exemplary. I'd even go as far as saying the melee kill cams really aren't so jarring - the only problem I'd have with them is just prior to the mele kill scene, the cut makes me think I just died or did something I wasn't supposed to. After a while this subsides as you get used to the cut.\n\nAt my first attempt I thought I had encountered a UI bug but go figure, it was just my mouse button that was giving out. :-D\n\nAll in all a satisfying purchase.\n\nPS: A lot of folks report a center-drift issue with the game. Rather the problem is it's resetting the tracker at each secene load. Word of advice, when you finish a level and click to go to the next, or click to start your game, don't steer your head until the next scene has actually loaded.

The game also runs flawlessly (except perhaps on Ultra settings).\n\nThere is no story, just a guy going through some space station of sorts blasting enemy bots, with lots of cool guns and upgrade options. You can tell exactly what the game plays and feels like by the screenshots alone and that is good enough.\n\nThe game looks great, though with a single industrial sci-fi environment modulated with about three variations, linear levels soon start to feel repetitive. Similar surprise spawn tactics are used throughout, and you get to pass by the same sections many times despite some basic randomization.\n\nThe few boss fights add a welcome variety to the combat setups, as do the inclusion of locked areas where you must defeat waves of enemies before proceeding. Incomprehensibly, loot crates often appear at the very end of the level when all enemies have already been defeated, making the tons of acquired health and ammo entirely useless (except for upgrade chips).\n\nThe sound design is nearly perfect, with licensed upbeat electro music and satisfying sound effects blasting their way throughout.\n\nUnfortunately there is almost no one online, which is a shame because the game shines in coop when it does happen.\n\nDon't expect to get more than a few hours of fun with this one but those hours will be well worth it. Best enjoyed during a Steam sale and with coop buddies. I would gladly support this excellent small development team with a sequel to their fine project.","May 3","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a grizzled mercenary, it's your job to put them down, and restore the peace.  Third-person 2.5D sci-fi shooter/slasher.\n\nThe Good\nIt is exactly what it sets out to be.  A simple shoot-em up action thriller.  It wastes little time getting you into the action, and provides simple, but fun gun-and-melee combat reminiscent of arcade games of the same genre.\n\nThe Bad\nThere's no real story to speak of.  But that's hardly a flaw in a game that's more akin to Metal Storm than Deus Ex.  If you're wanting an arching epic tale, this really is not your game.\n\nThe Ugly\nNothing to speak of.\n\nSuggestions\nNothing major comes to mind.\n\nThe Summary\n10/10, which seems to be a first.  If you like shooter/slasher crawlers, then this is a good pick.  Stable platform, decent setup for local play and simple, vibrant robot destruction.  Can't complain about that.\n\nEdit: Well color me pickled and dip me in a sack of flour.  Not the first game I've given a 10/10 to.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 11, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/recommended/268220/","krayzkrok","krayzkrok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/","523 products in account","This game originated on iOS, and it shows with the grind-centric gameplay. It starts off promisingly enough, a decent twin-stick shooter with satisfying feedback, rolling and cover mechanics, and an upgrade system. Trouble is, that's it. Each new mission is essentially the exact same thing, through the same basic scenario (some generic future industrial rooms), with the same type of gameplay: strafe and shoot. As you level up your weapons, so the enemies level up in strength, which means it actually doesn't feel like you're getting anywhere at all. Really, level 10 feels exactly the same as level 1. The only variety is a gradual reveal of different enemy types, although nothing here will surprise you, and a slow unlocking of weapons and armour that you have to upgrade with coins and upgrade tokens. It's here that the iOS origins really show, this quest for coins that you gradually amass, the need to repeatedly play the same levels to find the right tokens to upgrade your weapons, so you can keep up with the enemies. Around level 10 is when the game introduces stun-lock enemies that are a massive pain in the butt, and very hard to avoid as they travel quite a bit faster than you can, and take some putting down. That was about as much as I could take. I'm sure you could get a couple of hours out of this, but that's not enough to recommend it.","August 31, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","2"

Its neither for aim training nor casual shooter for fun. Its boring, levels are all the same.\n\nPlayability is low - plenty of bad designed concepts, like weird upgrade system, useless items, bad aiming mechanics (aiming on the ground where enemy stands), weird auto-guarding mechanics (why not a key to duck?). Melee kills are taking too long time making a hero kill plenty of times like being hit by rocket or body blocked by exploding+stunning enemy: 2 of them is certain death no matter how high level your hero is.\n\nGraphics and music are cool, but at the same time it gives you misleading feeling that the game gonna be cool, full of action and shooting - its not.\n\nThe idea of oblique floor annoys you very quickly as it takes 2 keys instead of 1 to walk straight + you will be pressing "roll" key all the time to avoid being hit and just to move faster - btw. you can just roll the whole level ignoring all enemies up to final-battle. The final-battle itself is annoyingly hard compared to rest of the level - you are locked in small space being attacked by spawning all the time enemies.\n\nDouble Damage boost lasts only few seconds - being dropped by last killed enemy its almost over when you meet another on your way.\n\nIn addition UI is badly designed, using menu and scrolling with a mouse is a pain - why keyboard is disabled for anvigation?\n\nNo info on future Upgrades (until you reach them) is making you guess what direction you are leveling up your hero/weapons.\n\nBottom line: audio and graphics are cool, but playability is low.","January 1, 2015","false","1.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Only single player mode.  The android version has local coop multiplayer and is much cheaper.  At first, the game is easy enough and is somewhat fun to play.  The levels seem a bit repetitive and this is where the trouble starts.  Later in the game the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly and you are forced to replay previous missions to gain enough equipment and perks to continue through the tougher spots.  The missions are ok to play thorough once, but die on a boss level and lose all of your continues and you'll find yourself deleting this game from your local game cache as I just did.  I could see this as a pay 2 win feature, but for a full game this is just unacceptable and poor game dsign in my opinion.

My first impression of this game was that it was a dual-stick shooter full of microtransaction incentivising you to buy better gear to be less pathetic. I later came to realise there isn't any kind of paid transaction and that this game was simply a grind-fest.\n\nMeltdown is a fun shooter where you go down a randomly generated level and fill robots of different shapes and sizes into smoldering piles of medal. You do this with a selection of weapons that don't win points for originality but are adequate while protecting yourself with different armor pieces and upgrades. It also incorparates quick and easy multiplayer making company welcome and later in the game, kind of nessacary (coming from a guy who deliberitly avoids online interactions). The music is like a mild wubfest, not my cup of tea, but it 's as easy as turning of music and playing some 2SFH in it's place.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half I was able to "prestige" reseting all my stuff while letting me unlock more armor (you still have to pay for) and upgrading weapons one more level than they could previously. "Cool," I thought but you reset EVERYTHING, including your weapon upgrades and expensive armor pieces. You keep you're money but nothing else, it was then I realised I wasn't the badass in thugged out armor and weapons assisting weak characters, I was the sucker wasting his time and money until he prestiged for the first time, unknowlingy shooting himself in the foot. Unless you don't want the locked armors, you have to grind, and grind, and grind. Then you still have to grind for the money to afford the items and having to have enough chips to upgrade selected items. You also can't get the good weapons until you FULLY upgrade the subpar ones and if you are going to prestige you're going to be stuck as an armorless, smg-toting weakling for a few hours, adding to the difficulty. I IMPLORE YOU, IF YOU GET MELTDOWN, IF YOU READ THIS, SAVE YOUR GOLD SHOULD YOU WANT THE GEWD STUFF, DON'T ADD ANYMORE TO THE GRIND THAN THERE ALREADY IS. IF YOU DO AT LEAST GET TO LVL 3 PRESTIGE THE JUMP OUT THE NEAREST WINDOW.\n\nBut I digress, if you don't mind a bit of a grind, it is a fun distraction. I got it on sale but I think it's cheap regardless.","February 2, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I've only played in single player mode so far, the arcade style action is sufficiently fast paced for brief bites of gaming, with enough random components to keep longer play sessions interesting. The actual levels are rather reptitive in layout, but enemy placement is randomized. Enemny variety is strong, with each combination of foes requiring different tactics and usage of cover. There's a relatively grindy progression system, but the rewards aren't too spread out to feel like progress is impossible. This is definitely not a game meant for marathon play sessions, just short bursts of action every now and then.","September 24, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I brought it up (in private) with the caster, and was sent a key for Meltdown, instead... this one time, I'm actually rather grateful for the internet being the internet. :P\n\nI'd never heard of this game, so I had very little in the way of expectations going in. And I have to say, I've had way more fun than I was expecting.\n\nThe progression kinda feels like the free Flash games I played several years ago. There's a sense of grinding for the necessary coins or chips to purchase or upgrade the things you want. But- unlike those old Flash games- the music and general sense of fun keep the grind from feeling too much like a chore.\n\nI've yet to try the multiplayer, so I cannot attest to connectivity or lag issues. But I still give Meltdown a solid recommendation even as a casual single-player game. :3\n\nPros:\n- Music is wubby (a con, if that's not to your taste)\n- Cover mechanic adds a bit of strategy\n- Weapons feel nice (I've only unlocked a few... more on that in cons)\n\nCons:\n- Music may not be everyone's cuppa tea\n- Gear Progression can sometimes feel a bit grindy...\n- Especially when it comes to initially unlocking weapons/accessories, as they require increasingly larger amounts of coin\n(Multiplayer would likely help in this case, but as stated previously, I've only played solo thus far.)","January 18, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I've only played in single player mode so far, the arcade style action is sufficiently fast paced for brief bites of gaming, with enough random components to keep longer play sessions interesting. The actual levels are rather reptitive in layout, but enemy placement is randomized. Enemny variety is strong, with each combination of foes requiring different tactics and usage of cover. There's a relatively grindy progression system, but the rewards aren't too spread out to feel like progress is impossible.

Here are some great things I've observed:\n\nPOSITIVE\n\n(+) Awesome multiplayer\nAnyone can jump in in the middle of missions and help you out. No more fuss: no chat option or anything, just pure action!\n\n(+) Enemy variety\nThere are many enemies with different kinds of weaponry and behaviors, and there can be many of them at a time, so you have to be alert!\n\n(+) Fast-paced action\nMany enemies can swam you, and they move fast. You have to dodge around, hide behind cover, and make stuff blow up!  The game isn't too much on the "tactical" side, as they seem to describe it. But that's a good thing for me actually.\n\n(+) Customization\nThere's only a small variety of weapons, but they have different gameplay styles, and you can choose upgrades with different effects. There's also many armors you can choose from to compliment your style. The game has some good replay value because of this.\n\nJust a couple of minor negative things, though.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\n(-) Maps\nOkay, the maps have pretty interesting layouts at first, with covers laid out at the right places... but they get repetitive very quickly. They get longer as you start to finish more missions, but they still have the same layouts.\n\n(-) Length of game and grinding\nThe game is pretty short with just 30 short missions. Grinding seems to add to the game's longevity because buying and upgrading gear requires you to collect coins and chips. It would be much more fun if it had more missions instead, or perhaps a more varied grinding system.\n\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives greatly. So in conclusion, THIS GAME IS FUN AND YOU SHOULD PLAY IT","January 28, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You play as a customizable character with a full range of available guns, melee weapons, shoulder pads, torso armor, hats, masks, and more, each giving various buffs to the player character.\n\nYou begin every game the same; riding down an elevator to a facility infested with various robot enemies. Every enemy is extremely different, and adds new challenges as you progress. Some of them fire missiles, some of them melee-rush, some of them are static, some stationary, and most levels end with boss fights. It controls like a dual-stick shooter, but handles very well (if not better) with mouse and keyboard. I haven't tried it with a gamepad yet, and I don't intend to, but I believe the option is available.\n\nEvery piece of gear you add to your character is upgradeable, and fits to various playstyles. Some armor increases shotgun damage and range, other armor increases shield amount, health amount, etc. There are at least a dozen different weapons to choose from, both melee and ranged, and two gun slots allow for quick playstyle switching during the game. All weapons (save for the knife that you start out with) are able to be upgraded, allowing you to choose a "class" character. There is also a skill tree, but you aren't limited to a single branch, and never run out of points with which to upgrade.\n\nThere is both an arcade mode and an online mode, which allow for up to four friends on a single machine, or joining various multiplayer lobbies (up to four people). Both arcade and online feature three different game modes; a dungeon crawl level mode, a wave-based mode, and a four-player deathmatch mode. The most profitable tends to be the Wave mode, but the other game modes bring about one of the only problems I've had with the whole game.\n\nThe grinding. The grinding is real. The most expensive items are 3,000 to 4,000 gold, with the average gold per game rounding out to about 50 or so pieces. While this encourages playability, every game gets old after a while. There are items that increase gold drop rate (by 30% max), and there are mystery boxes (with a very rare drop rate) that could contain up to 200 gold, but these are pretty rare, and often it takes ten or so different games before you're able to afford that new armor you've been eyeing.\n\nAll in all, this game is excellent, and for a complete FTP version, it's pointless NOT to get it. High replayability, good team lobbies, and a lot of fun.","February 2, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I brought it up (in private) with the caster, and was sent a key for Meltdown, instead... this one time, I'm actually rather grateful for the internet being the internet. :P\n\nI'd never heard of this game, so I had very little in the way of expectations going in. And I have to say, I've had way more fun than I was expecting.\n\nThe progression kinda feels like the free Flash games I played several years ago. There's a sense of grinding for the necessary coins or chips to purchase or upgrade the things you want. But- unlike those old Flash games- the music and general sense of fun keep the grind from feeling too much like a chore.\n\nI've yet to try the multiplayer, so I cannot attest to connectivity or lag issues. But I still give Meltdown a solid recommendation even as a casual single-player game. :3\n\nPros:\n- Music is wubby (a con, if that's not to your taste)\n- Cover mechanic adds a bit of strategy\n- Weapons feel nice (I've only unlocked a few... more on that in cons)\n\nCons:\n- Music may not be everyone's cuppa tea\n- Gear Progression can sometimes feel a bit grindy...\n- Especially when it comes to initially unlocking weapons/accessories, as they require increasingly larger amounts of coin\n(Multiplayer would likely help in this case, but as stated previously, I've only played solo thus far.)","January 18, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has genuinely fun gameplay, nice graphics, and even basic multiplayer.\n\nWhere it wins:\nThe short missions make it perfect when I'm just killing some time. I can pick a mission based on anticipated time to complete if I have something I need to do soon. It's also nice to see that the Steam version is a complete game, unlike the mobile version. The gamepad setup is nice, and the aim assist makes it easy to work with. Multiplayer is fun to play as well. Well worth the $1.74 I paid when it was on sale.\n\nWhere it fails:\nIt is made for mobile and there are some nonfunctional remnants left over from that, namely the leaderboard buttons. The multiplayer doesn't let a set or group of players to follow eachother through missions. It also said that if you are having trouble on a level, play multiplayer to make it easier, but when additional players are in a mission, there are more bots that can take much more damage, making it more than twice as difficult, so it more than negates the concept of getting help. The aim assist, while being handy, can also hinder your play. It automatically targets things for you. When there are power nodes, it's difficult to get back on target with bots, or the bots you actually want to target.\n\nOverall, it's worth playing, if you catch it while it's on sale, but I sure hope the devs are planning on making some improvements, especially with the aim assist, multiplayer, and benifits of being Prestige 3 Level 55. I'd also kind of like to see a good way to reset the data to restart from scratch.","February 13, 2015","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some great things I've observed:\n\nPOSITIVE\n\n(+) Awesome multiplayer\nAnyone can jump in in the middle of missions and help you out. No more fuss: no chat option or anything, just pure action!\n\n(+) Enemy variety\nThere are many enemies with different kinds of weaponry and behaviors, and there can be many of them at a time, so you have to be alert!\n\n(+) Fast-paced action\nMany enemies can swam you, and they move fast. You have to dodge around, hide behind cover, and make stuff blow up!  The game isn't too much on the "tactical" side, as they seem to describe it. But that's a good thing for me actually.\n\n(+) Customization\nThere's only a small variety of weapons, but they have different gameplay styles, and you can choose upgrades with different effects. There's also many armors you can choose from to compliment your style. The game has some good replay value because of this.\n\nJust a couple of minor negative things, though.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\n(-) Maps\nOkay, the maps have pretty interesting layouts at first, with covers laid out at the right places... but they get repetitive very quickly. They get longer as you start to finish more missions, but they still have the same layouts.\n\n(-) Length of game and grinding\nThe game is pretty short with just 30 short missions. Grinding seems to add to the game's longevity because buying and upgrading gear requires you to collect coins and chips. It would be much more fun if it had more missions instead, or perhaps a more varied grinding system.\n\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives greatly. So in conclusion, THIS GAME IS FUN AND YOU SHOULD PLAY IT","January 28, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's not trying to be big or boastful, it clocks in at 100MB, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing fun.

Upgrades feel a bit grindy at times since you unlock items faster than you get money to actually buy them but since you can replay previous levels again to get some cash that's fine.\n\nThe tactical part really isn't as big as claimed, however for some enemy types it's indeed helpful to cover and get the timing right (Sniper Bot!). For most other moving enemies a combo of circling and retreat seems to be just enough.\n\nThe multiplayer system is quite nice and even enabled by default so any singleplayer mission may become a multiplayer mission at any time.","January 5","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
