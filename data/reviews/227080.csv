The game is quite short; but it boasts an undeniable charm that makes every hour played, however few, rather enjoyable.\n\nThe metaphorical narrative is mostly told through the emotion in the atmosphere and the styles of the puzzles, rather than lines and lines of dialogue.  The enchanting soundtrack and imaginative environments serve to create a stimulating atmosphere that tells the story through its interpretation.   This approach to storytelling in video games can be hit-or-miss, but I think Papo & Yo is a good example of how it can be quite effective.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to three-dimensional, environment-based puzzles that can be solved mostly through exploration and experimentation.  Due to this style of gameplay, the game is quite linear.  It will usher you from one location to the next, each with its own puzzle to solve.  The puzzles are mostly challenging without becoming needlessly frustrating, although some of them can be a little tricky to figure out without any hints or direction.\n\nAs I alluded to, the game is fairly short‚Äî topping out at a handful of hours, depending on how quickly you can solve the puzzles.  To add a little supplemental depth, there is also a decent set of collectibles to search for (i.e.: hats) that can add a little more to the game for players who choose to pursue that.  That said, I personally felt the length of the game was perfect and that it helped create a short-and-sweet appeal to the game, instead of allowing it to grow stale.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough of Papo & Yo.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys atmospheric games and/or puzzle-platformers in this style.  Further, I feel this is a game that can also appeal to gamers who don‚Äôt normally play this type of genre, due to the fact that it is intriguing and short enough to give someone a taste of something different without overburdening them.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 27, 2015","true","5.7"," 79 of 83 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","79","83","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piiicky/recommended/227080/","piiicky","CRITICAL, PENETRATED","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piiicky/","685 products in account","I am outraged that I have never seen this game before getting it in the Humble Bundle. The fact that Papo & Yo got almost no attention while Gone Home got game of the years, 10/10s, and several thousands articles written about it frustrates me to no end. Not only is Papo & Yo a good game, it does more for story telling and social commentary than any video game I can think of.\n\nHere's the important part first. Purely as a game, it is a good game. The player is required to solve a series of platforming puzzles that gradually become more complex the further in they go. None of them were incredibly difficult. Most of the difficultly comes from figuring out how you're suppose to use a new mechanic or item and then adding it to larger problems. Using the classic system of introduce, teach, then impliment, it makes sure the player is never confused. I was only once stumped enough to restart the level, thinking I had broken the game. However, I had just not been looking hard enough at the answer staring me in the face. Other than solid platform puzzling there's nothing completely amazing. It does what it does well and is definitely worth the Humble Bundle price.\n\n\nNow for extra bullox.\nPapo & Yo is not 2deep4you. In fact, it states the symbolism of the monster in the first few seconds of starting the game, but everything about the game manages to be abstract enough to make the player think and form their own interpetations. It is rather light on story, focusing instead on the gameplay itself. What this game aces is the use of gameplay to tell the story. From the beginning, the player should know that the monster is an abusive parent, but nothing else is ever stated. The interaction between the boy and the monster in the form of puzzle solving mechanics reveals their relationship. There is no walking around reading notes. Very little of the story is spoon-fed. This combination of gameplay and story is what makes Papo & Yo so fantastic. It is telling a story about social issues by the means of a video game, not by a collection of text files.\nAnd the best part is that this social commentary goes beyond first-world, white people problems. It covers problems of child abuse, alcoholism, and class issues, which I feel are much bigger problems in the world than sexuality. Quite honestly, I didn't understand the story at first because I have never been in any similar situations. Still, I was able to feel for the central characters far more than any other attempts at video game social commentary because I was involved with the basics of the relationship through gameplay.\nIf video games want to be taken seriously they never will , they need to bring to light world issues that don't involve the internet and Papo & Yo does that excellently.\n\nI'm sure someone else could say this far more eloquently than I ever could. Papo & Yo is a good game and is a fantastic example of how to mix gameplay and a serious, non-action story into an enjoyable and emotional experience.","January 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 66 of 67 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","66","67","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/227080/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Papo & Yo is a rare game that manages to perfectly represent what it is like to be a child and the effects of substance abuse by those closest to them. This surprised me, because it is hard to tell a story with such complex themes under the guise of a game with any degree of success. Yet Papo & Yo handles it beautifully, and crafts an emotionally rewarding experience that deserves to be played. It certainly has its problems, but it manages to entertain and engage the player from beginning to end.Throughout Papo & Yo you play as Quico, a young boy who explores a dream like interpretation of Brazilian styled favelas. Throughout the game you are accompanied by three characters. The first is Lula, a cute yellow robot who hangs on to Quico‚Äôs back throughout the game, and serves to help him navigate and solve the puzzles that he encounters throughout his journey. There is also a girl who uses chalk to bring buildings and other objects in the environment to life, and more often than not plays tricks rather than help. These two characters are the ones that actively communicate to you.And then there‚Äôs Monster, a giant pink beast who grunts and roars as he eats and sleeps. Despite his outward frightful appearance, he is actually quite peaceful more often than not.Papo & Yo handles the complexities of addiction and abuse extremely well, never going into lengthy explanations or long, dialogue encumbered scenes in order to convey its themes. Instead, the game mostly relies on the actions of the characters and the change in environments and scenery in order to communicate, which is a very welcome change.Throughout Quico‚Äôs journey, he will encounter puzzles of varying length and complexity that obstruct his path. What is most amazing about Papo & Yo‚Äôs puzzles is that they involve the environment in rather stunning and wonderful ways.Turning a switch can result in a building gaining legs and moving to another position, pulling a lever could turn a building sideways to unveil a hidden set of stairs, and lifting a box can create and move giant crates that could be used at your disposal. The mechanics and feel of Papo & Yo also deserve praise. The jumping and navigating of the world feels natural, and I always enjoyed how Quico interacts with his environment. The favelas are simply stunning to navigate and explore. The locations feel like they have been lived in, but also are off just enough that you can tell that it is in an imaginative world. The sounds that the environment makes as you solve puzzles and move about are a delight to listen to, and credit must be given to whoever designed the ambient sounds found within the game.Papo & Yo is a unique game. It handles its themes extremely well, and the world is simply amazing to behold. Though the game is not without its faults, chief among them a lack of difficulty and challenge, Papo & Yo should be played at least once. Trust me, the journey will be quite worth it.","December 20, 2014","true","58.4"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","0"

Its design is subtle and meaningful, created in an attempt to tell nuanced human story but without the intention of forcing its meaning upon you. It‚Äôs an exploration of our capacity to love someone trapped and tormented by their inner demons, and how sometimes the ability to help them is beyond our ability.\n\nMuch of Papo & Yo is surreal and impossible, with walking houses and magic chalk lines allowing its themes to come across less overtly. Playing as the young Brazillian, Quico, the world takes on a sort of childlike wonder, delightfully playful and unconcerned with any greater troubles that might exist within it. Running around picking up frogs and reading the crayon drawn insides of cardboard boxes, I was struck by how humbly the game presents itself. It doesn‚Äôt attempt more than it knows it‚Äôs capable of, but at the same time has something important to say and wants to make sure it says it right.\n\nOne of the ways developer Minority Media achieves this, is how it presents its other main character, Monster. It‚Äôs a giant horned creature, but what‚Äôs important about it is it‚Äôs never framed as the antagonist. When you first meet Monster he‚Äôs just a big sleepy companion, who runs around with its tongue hanging out as you lead it around with the help of a mellon. These early moments help to develop the bond between Quico and Monster, as they help each other through levels and Quico shows a very clear fondness for his hulking friend.\n\nMonster‚Äôs love of poisonous frogs however, turns him into something to fear. As he ravishly gobbles them up, his actions become violent and his appearance demonic. What was once your friend becomes an unstable brute, and in this feeling of helpless terror Papo & Yo strives to give you a glimpse at the horror of being a child surrounded by abuse. I wanted to help Monster, but any attempt to do so only lead to him taking out his aggression on me. It made me feel small and powerless to do anything but flee, and distressed that there seemed no solution to Monster‚Äôs addiction.\n\nPapo & Yo might not be the most polished game, and its puzzle design is rife with unnecessary backtracking and tedious solutions, but it‚Äôs overshadowed by what the game represents and is trying to convey to the player. With much of the narrative being autobiographical, it makes it all the more raw and haunting to watch Quico and Monster be torn apart from each other. It‚Äôs a complicated story told with uncomplicated methods, deriving empathy through gameplay more than dialogue. From the start of the game, Minority Media seem prepared to not overly simplify the story they want to tell or to take the reassuring route with a clean cut happy ending. I‚Äôm finding it hard to completely reconcile my feelings over how everything wrapped up, but if nothing else I feel I comprehend at least a little more what those going through the sort of experiences displayed here are feeling. And that‚Äôs something we could all stand to do more often.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","3"

The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but still provide a comfortable feeling of accomplishment when you conquer them. The platforming could have used a tiny bit of tweaking though. But the game's real goal is to let you share the emotional journey of the silent protagonist. Unfortunately, as the entire game is a metaphor I don't want to explain it too much by giving away the meaning (sadly the trailers, while beautifully made, blatantly tell the hidden meaning so I recommend to interested parties that they do /not/ watch them).

What if your best friend was a monster?  Papo & Yo is truly a remarkable adventure, puzzle platformer which may make you rethink these questions.  Truth be told, Papo & Yo only caught my eye after a good friend of mine added it to his Steam Wishlist.  As many of you may have done, I waited for this game to go on a 75%+ sale when it was released as Humble Indie Bundle X's beat-the-average tier.  Luckily for me, rather than leaving this game to sit in my Steam Library to collect dust, I downloaded and decided to try it out.\n\nWhat I discovered was one of the most captivating games I have ever played or watched.

Vander Caballero," to the ending of the credits, this game does not disappoint - it simply gets better.\n\nVerdict: Papo & Yo is simply an absolutely stunning game.

In order to not reveal any spoilers, all I can say is "this game is a must-play."

Think of it as Portal, but with child abuse and alcoholism instead of cake and fat jokes. If nothing else, it is an interesting experience that doesn't overstay its welcome.","May 20, 2014","true","11.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Or all together.\nOthers are just plain crap or bad games.\n\nAnd there are others, like Papo & Yo - that shouldnt be missed - because they show us, how our beloved media videogame can go a step farther, than shooting baddies or just platforming or whatever - it goes much farther than just surfacing. But let me tell you why.\n\nPapo & Yo - an adventure game - set in a brazilian fantasy world - full of rad architecture and really atmospheric favelas.\nIts an authors game (like Neverending Nightmares) - because Vander Caballero (lead designer) tries to tell us some personal story about a part of his life - and even manages, to make it into a videogame - more important they didnt fail, in any of the disciplines. The game works (at least for me) the fulliest.\n\nThe game is very short, but its just fitting for this kind of story/game.\n\nThere arent many games out there, that really can touch your soul - and I would say, I cant imagine, a single person, who will not be touched by this great and fragile story - in the ending. Its just not possible.\n\nI dare to say, any receptive videogamer - owes it to himself, to play this well polished gem. Its just a masterpiece!\n\nStory: Okay, now after 4 years after release, almost any should heared of the game or the story.\nYou play as the boy Quico, who regularly flee into his own fantasy world, due to his harsh relationship with his father.\nThe only thing, that gives him an alternative, to his abusing (not sexual) father - that he has. Very sad stuff.\n\nGood thing, Quico has this wonderful amout of "fantasy" - because his adorable toy robot Lula - is really alive in this fantasy world - and she is really friendly, and a true "best friend" - even if she is imaginary - in this sense.\n\nThis shows me, that Vander & his team, have a huge sense of humanity, etc - because its just so true. I can understand Quico. Even more, Lula has some great super powers to help Qucio  in his Quest, about his abusive alcoholic father/and the fantasy favelas of Quicos imagination.\n\nThis is just a great idea, to make this with this yin&yan thing (real bad world, because father/fantasy good, with Lula)\nBut thing arent that simple (they never are in videogames) - the fantasy world is not like a safe haven - to be secure from Monster - no its more like an rearranged reality, that Quico flees himself into, but for sure, Monster still can interact in this world...\n\nThe gameplay is plain simple. You play as Quico, from a third person view, you run and jump through the worlds, solving puzzles etc. The special thing, about this is, how the developers managed, to implent those puzzles. I have to say, most of 'em are very creative, in a sense, I didnt encounter before, and I really played tons of games.\n\nWhen I played, I had never the impression, of a bad designed puzzle, they were all very thought-through and are not repetitive (sure, running & jumping is repetitive) because they really made those puzzles uniquely. Also, they are in some way made, like from an enthusiastic child - in a good sense - like you will have a smile a lot on your face, because everything is so well designed.\n\nThe game is very very short, but It still manages, to give you some upgrades during playtime - like if you get Lula, you can use her boost and make a double jump - makes the puzzles, again not repetitive.\n\nSome puzzles are just that clever, you will find yourself saying during playing "Why the heck, did not ANY game came up with this idea - before Papo & Yo" - because you played similar puzzles in other games - and they rarely or never came up in any game with this kind of creativity. Well done, no really - I am impressed by Papo & Yo's level & puzzle design. We have Euclid, Escher-esk stuff, we have child fantasies, we have just a truly masterfully fantasy-setting - NOT YET seen in ANY game before. Chapeau. Awesome stuff!!!!\n\nThe artdesign is also awesome. Everything is very atmospheric, you never feel again, like its repetitive levels or design - even if some houses etc surely are. You will not notice. Its that good made. There are details everywhere, like flower pots, futebols (ball for soccer) - I found it very strange, for a brazilian game - not able to interact with the ball?? - but else of that everything rocks. More details, many cool fantasy-architecture of houses and cities - never seen before.\nThe game gets you from its very first minute, because everything is so well crafted.\n\nThe story, isnt that hard to interpret, because you see a lot of flashbacks (real world Quico with his dad) - and you even get enough hints, to find out, without any thinkings, what this is all about. Well done, to tell a story in this simple, but effective ways!\n\nThe score, is just also very awesome. I did watch full credits, but I cant remind the one, who is in charge of the score!!!\nThis score is amazing! The "papo" song in the end just got my heart. No, i didnt cry........but its very very touching.\n\nI'd like to give, an award for the score, an award for game design, an award for art design - an award for Papo & Yo in every category!!!! No really!!!!\n\nThere arent many NPCs, but for a game like this, its just fitting. Everything is awesome in this game. The topic is a harsh one, but its cool to see, how such things should be taken care of.\n\nThis game found a place in my heart, forever. I will never forget it, because It really hits me, from the very first minute.\nI think, receptive gamers wont me dissappointed of this. Promised.\n\nThis game, is for me one of those indies, or even videogames that cannot be missed.\nNo really, you should play this - its an encounter, you wont find on any corner. Its really a bless.\n\nThis gem should not be missed!!! Its too important, not being played!\n\nMuito obrigado Vander Caballero, La Hacienda Creative & Minority for bringing us this awesome game!!!\n\nHighly recommended - dont miss this!\n\nCoolest feature of the game:\n-Lula and her powers - yeah!!!\n\nPros:\n-Lula\n-important story of an uneasy topic with a personal pov from the designer\n-great fantasy setting in the brazilian favelas\n-great third person adventure with nice controls\n-Monster - very nice to interact and solve puzzles based on Monster\n-Brazilian magic, shaman and folklore\n-Awesome score\n-nice level design, puzzle design and art design\n-Quico & Alejandra\n\nCons:\n-very short","May 15","true","5.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Every part of it. you play as a kid who is trying to escape reality cause his father drinks a lot and becomes abusive ( the plot twist in the end is really sad and made me cry :( )\n-your playground is a colorful shanty town which you can  change and alter part of it to solve easy to medium puzzles , nothing hard and your main objective is to escape from a monster and try to cure him.\n-didn't face any problems or bugs, everything was smooth\n-the music is very emotional and really good, voice acting is in a different language but still good, and the sound effect are perfect.\n- easy achievements but sadly no cards to craft a badge\n- takes 4 to 5 h to complete .\ni highly recommend this gem to anyone who likes platform games and emotional/atmospheric games such as me ( i did cry in the end T^T )\n- i was going to say that the price is a bit too much but after i finished the game i think its worth it .\n9/10","March 9","true","7.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The story is very carefully revealed and if you don't get spoiled through reading guides or wikis, you'll be stabbed in the stomach with feelings. These aren't 'girly visual novel' feelings, these are 'I have never cried at a movie and I'm not scared of horror games; there's just something in my eye, please hold me' feelings. For some people, the topic may actually hit very close to home.\n\nOn a gameplay note, the gameplay itself is actually fairly simple though it can be periodically frustrating if you don't know what to do. It's a short-ish game, taking about 4 and a half hours to complete if you get stuck only on a couple of puzzles. Definitely worth it, especially if you get it on sale. I've had the game for over a year and I don't regret purchasing it.","June 26, 2014","true","12.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I love the imagination that just shows in the game, and the controls are tight, great quality apart from the camera being a bit too close when the monster's chasing you.\n\nNow on the emotional part  - the creator said himself that it's based on his experience of being abused in his childhood, and while I have not gone through emotional or physical distress like that personally, the way this game showed me these emotions was simply genius. It was gentle, yet it was a completely new emotional for me. That a video game could do that really earned my respect.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game though it's short and maybe not your style if you're looking for a challenge, but it's something I cherish and am glad I've played.\n\nHere's a link to the behind the scenes I mentioned above: http://www.desura.com/games/papo-yo/news/the-music-stylings-of-papo-yos-soundtrack","August 25, 2013","true","5.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Just as there are books and movies that really have no real value other than being a fun ride, most games today are played simply because they are enjoyable. But when something like this comes around the corner and gives you a story that challenges your opinions and so clearly mirrors the pain we see in our lives, I have to take notice. This is a small story that mirrors the Big Story, and it's asking us to listen and learn.\n\nSo go ahead. Play it with an open mind, and reflect on what you find.

Think of a TV series that finishes after two series or so while it's still fresh and the stories are worthwhile, instead of dragging on season after season trying to wring every last penny out of the idea. Papo & Yo communicates some very strong emotions and makes sure it gets the point across and then it ends. Simple and perfect. The graphics aren't exactly mind blowing, but if you're looking for graphics you're in the wrong place - Papo & Yo is about story and, more importantly, emotion.

This is a beautiful story, tackling subject matter that is important but very rarely dealt with, especially in video games. The art is colourful and unique. The soundtrack is good. The puzzles are maybe a bit easy but I think the difficulty in playing this comes from the topics at hand rather than progressing through the levels. You're meant to feel good about completing stuff because the story itself is quite dark.

And personally I wouldn't let a 10 yo anywhere near it, cute though the beginning might be. I know we've all already murdered a million people in games, but games like this come around and manage to use a simple as anything game mechanic to give you goosebumbs, to put it mildly. (Yes, I'm talking about the darn lifeless "dolls" - 'nough said.)\n\nIt's not about the puzzles. Don't come to this game for the sense of accomplishment a difficult puzzle platformer gives you. There is no place for competitiveness here, it's storytelling by playing. It's not a walking simulator either though (and I am using the term as a descriptor, not as a curseword). The gameplay is simple without being simplistic, and the puzzles are well, one could say they're easy, but I felt they were appropriate. Basically the puzzles play like the platforming elements do: They flow comfortably, at a natural pace, an average player won't have to stop anywhere long. The atmosphere and the visuals are fantastic, the music and the voice acting are beautifully done. Everything, including the rythym of the gameplay, just flows well and all elements work together to tell a simple story, albeit one we don't often hear in games in this manner.\n\nAnd btw, it's so insanely refreshing to see minority and lower class protagonists, languages and aesthetics so uncomrpomisingly portrayed in a game.\n\nIt's not flawless, but its flaws are totally secondary and besides the point. It deserves every penny we can throw its way, because these developers should be encouraged to try again and do more. So yes, buy it. As for whether you will enjoy it, well, if you aren't coming to it with an all macho "harcore" attitude, then yes, you will get something out of it. I don't know if you'll love it, and personally I wouldn't play it again, but it's definitely a game worth meeting and a little journey worth taking.","February 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not only for your liver but for the lives of your surroundings. Especially your family, and even more specifically, your kids. The delirious anger can inhibit a child's imagination and creativity in ways you never thought possible. The shame that comes with a parents insane behavior could possibly mentally scar a child for life. Not giving a child the proper attention, will belittle him or her to the point of extinction. Humans have a bond to their parents, a bond that is hard to break, especially when that bond is held tighter by constant attempts to catch a father or mother's attention, and failing. This need for acceptance is everlasting, and never getting it will assemble a world-view of misconstrued self-hating nonsense. Self-hatred and shame will burn inside of you with the same fire that fueled your father's anger. You will feel so insignificant and, subsequently, depressed, feelings of hopelessness will cover your interests in creative endeavors in a thick goo of inability; a lack of energy, lack of confidence, lack of belief in your own talent. These associative memories will be there however long your experiences of the world stays the same. And this is where Papa & Yo comes in.\n\nThe game takes us through an imaginary world - where we are the co-creators and reformers. We are accompanied by our lovely companion "Lula" and eventually we meet the Monster! He seems like a lovable fellow, mostly interested in nuts and sleeping, we provide him with these life-essential things, mostly because he provides us with progression.\nThings seems to go fine until we stumble across some cute-looking "frogs". This is where our Monster scurries into a frenzy, he no longer cares about our needs of progression, he just wants to get a hold of this frog and devour it. We are left behind, until we see him coming back, but now the sky is red and our Monster is on fire: charging right at us. What does this mean? We don't have long to think before he grabs hold of us and throw us to the ground with a thump. Huh. This monster is not a friendly one after all, then why are we with him? We run around for a bit and see this blue/purple fruit, described as rotten. Our first instinct is to throw it at him, we do, he calms down. He is back to his pinkish, amicable and lovable form. In this form he only sleeps and eat, he doesn't hurt us, we can manage to stick with him for a while longer. Along the journey his fiery temper tantrums become more frequent and more limiting. We need to get rid of him, we need to let go, we need to move on. We need to exempt ourselves from the grips of destruction, to separate ourselves from the person that is this angry, projecting, mean-spirited Monster. Despite him being our means of progression and survival. Despite him being the reason we exist and survive.\n\nPapa & Yo tackles the subject of a destructive family very well. It illustrates the need to let go of your parents, in general, perhaps not just the despicable alcoholic abuser. A realization: we are separate human beings from the ones which created us, we are our own persons and have our own quirks and dreams. This game illustrates the need to escape when your family life is in shambles, in imagination or videogames. Escapism until you can finally escape it in reality. Papa & Yo gives people a way to escape and even more, it manifests a scenario a huge amount of people are in and gives them validation, a feeling of acceptance and most of all, advice is given. Good advice, helpful advice. Your family is not you, there is a world outside of this small world, imaginative or not. The world is truly yours. Sometimes you just need to let go, of whatever is holding you back.","February 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm sure it will leave an impact in those who can share a similar story, without spoiling too much, and for the most part it's well executed and directed. A couple of scenes in particular can be breathtaking, leaving you to contemplate the artsy visuals in the midst of this surreal world.\n\nThe soundtrack is what I consider to be the highlight of this experience and it's exactly how I imagined this game to sound like, nothing more nothing less. It's simply brilliant and it does capture the world like only a few other games manage to accomplish through sound alone. It's comparable to titles such as Machinarium.\n\nIt does, however, come with a few drawbacks that may or may not ruin your experience. Some of the later puzzles can be a little frustrating to clear, not because their execution per se is particularly demanding, but the logic behind such puzzles require you to go through massive amounts of trial-and-error and solutions that up until that point become quite "exotic". The camera is sometimes a little annoying to manage, especially during timed puzzles where you're supposed to constantly monitor your character or else you'd fail and start over again.\n\nDespite that, I think it's still an enjoyable experience and it's worth its relatively short length. If puzzle-platformers aren't your thing, then simply skip this game and enjoy something else.","December 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is a horrible review and should not be taken seriously.)\n\nPapo & Yo is a 3-D puzzle platformer by Minority Media taht was first released for the PS3, but then brought to the PC. At first, you might not understand the story, but you will understand it once you get towards the end. The story is actually quite depressing and makes you sympathize for the main character. The game is only about 3-4 hours long, but it is an amazing and well made game. I feel the length of the story is perfect for a game like this.\n\nThe game is pretty basic since it is a puzzle platformer, but there are other aspects added to the game at some points. Some of these include trying to get a monster following you from one area to the other, or even jumping on his belly to get to a higher platform. The puzzles in the game are mostly easy, though there were a couple that I had to look up, personally. I felt the music used in the game was quite good and very fitting for the game. The graphics are pretty good and can be compared to some triple a games, in my opinion.\n\nI didn't find many issues with the game, except for occasional bad frames and it would sometimes freeze for a couple seconds, though this could have been my PC. It mainly happened to me when I walked near where a cutscene would start, or occasionally when I hit a checkpoint. I must say that this is now one of my favorite indie titles, and I hope to see more games from Minority Media.

Being to control the environment in ways I have never seen before was fascinating.

You use platforming to reach various stuff in the environment to change the the world around you to progress. Well, on one plane. On another plane, and this is made clear right before the game proper starts, this is a game about overcoming a drunk abusive father. Papo & Yo's story isn't the best, but it has a reasonably well put together theme and a very strong subject matter. There were a few story elements that felt somewhat jarring, taking you out of the immersion. For example, the tone of the girl changes dramatically and unexpectedly at times.\n\nIt's puzzles are on the easy side, all difficulty in this game comes from either finding the things you are to interact with or with your 3D platforming skills, sometimes together with a timed element in the  puzzle. Some times, it's hard to judge the distance to items and when using the robot overshoot. The platforming control does feel well implemented and I did not encounter any situations where I had managed to block progress by going somewhere I was not supposed to and with no recovery options.\n\nGraphically, it's a nice looking game with a very consistent style to it. Textures and effects aren't the very best, but on the other hand, that's not really to be expected from a game like this. It does some world building through the environment, but over all, it is a very linear world that does not present mane chances for exploration outside of your immediate puzzle surroundings.\n\nGame world isn't the largest, and the game doesn't take more than maybe 4-6 hours to complete if played with no prior knowledge, but for what it provides for the price, it is a solid and well designed game.","October 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is one of those, is a not very difficult puzzle game, with some platforming, and in this regard if you find yourself stuck most probably is because you are overthinking it, is a nice looking game, not astonishing but it looks good, the soundtraack is pretty good in my opinion, is short as most of this games are but it¬¥s worth its price.  the game has certain issues with the camera in some parts , specially when the monster chases you and in that regard i wouldn¬¥t have mind and FOV slider (the deffault is 90 wich is good enough but i  like something like 105 usually)\n\nthe core of the history goes around and alcoholic and abusive father and how the protagonist deals with it, to be honest it lacks the punch of something like brothers but is a moving one nonetheless. Overall a good way to spend three to four hours, it has a checkpoint save system but it doesn¬¥t take much time to get to the next one and you can play it in one sitting or chapter to chapter.\n\nSo if you are into this kind of experiences is a game you should check out","November 12, 2014","true","3.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As you play the game you will slowly start to understand the boys imagination intill the end in which everything is explained in the end you you will then learn and understand the game you had just played.\n\n+ The game runs great on PC, there is no lag and is always smooth with max settings. There was not one point in the hole game in which I was getting lower than 100 FPS which means almost all computer will be able to run Papo & Yo without a problem.\n\n+ The games looks are good, the textures are okay but the lighting is amazing! I wish more games had lighting like this becasue the game looks alot better and you become more immersed in the game. The character models looks good aswell.\n\n+ The story is very vivid at first but as you start to play though you will slowly get a understanding of the game. It adds a mystery to the story and you will want to find out whats happaning. You will quickly realise that you are in a childs imagination so the world changes and is not normal (almost like a dream) and uses puzzles to improve that.\n\n+ Controls for Papo & Yo are very simple, they are like every other game which is a good thing since you dont even have to learn them. You can just play straght away without thinking about it.\n\n+ The creativity in this game is huge! There are lots of diffrent and weird things happening in Papo & Yo which is great since its something diffrent from most games today. Its unique game which feels alot diffrent from anything else.\n\n+ The soundtrack works well and adds depth the the game which is needed, its not used to much but its used in the right places that make it sound and feel alot better.\n\nNow I do like Papo & Yo but there are alot of things which I just didnt like and disagree on which is a shame. This is what I find annoying about Papo & Yo.\n\n- The puzzles are good at first but after a bit of time they become the same thing over and over, this makes them a bit pointless and since there are so easy most of the time I some times which they just wernt there. At first they are good and you want to play but once you know what your doing its pointless.\n\n- The length of Papo & Yo is tiny! Its about 3 to 4 hours long, 5 hours to get all the Achievements thats it... A short and isnt necessary bad but since the game is priced at ¬£10.99 it makes it was too expensive. You should wait for a sale if you wanted to buy the game.\n\n- There is next to no replayability once you have finished. The only thing that you can do is get the Achievements or just play again. Nothing else and since its only a 3 to 4 hour game this means that you feel like you want more. I would recommend getting the Achievements if you want to get your moneys worth out of it.\n\n- The story... I know people arnt going to like me becasur of this but I didnt like it personally since I have no experience or relation to the games ending. For me its was a bit bland but I did understand it and for the people who have experienced and know what its like, then I bet you will love this game. But it seems that for me it was an okay ending.\n\nOverall I think that Papo & Yo is a good game for a few hours and a nice easy playthough with is some ways relaxes you when you play. Becasue its so unique in its own ways and how diffrent it isto any other game I will rate Papo & Yo 6 out of 10.

Both game elements are so easy, there's hardly any challenge in the game.\nAdditionally the jumping is very boring. Quico, the game's protagonist, doesn't jump very high and the double-jump ability he gets during the game makes him only jump slightly farther, not higher.

There are collectibles to find but out of a strange design choice they are only collectable after finishing the game at least once. I could definately see myself replaying some levels in order to get collectibles I missed but not the whole game (however short it is), especially as I already found a lot of the places where those collectibles appear the first time but couldn't pick them up then.\n\nAll in all Papo & Yo is probably more a piece of art than a game.

I have to say it does remind me a lot of what Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons does in terms of story, conveying most of it through the gameplay and what you see rather than dialog, but this game does have dialog occasionally so its a little more clear sometimes what is going on. Even then though this game isn't what it seems like at first, without ruining it you will find out what the real theme is about and the metaphor for the monster as you go through.\n\nYou play as a kid, Quinco who comes across at one point a big monster, who has an unhealthy appitite for poison arrow frogs and a very bad temper; he eventually becomes your companion on the story as well as your little robot protector Lula. You are following a strange girl who claims you are "cursed" and are on a journey to find out what is going on, and where you really are. Through out you need to platform and solve puzzles to progress through the areas of the game, many revolving around the monster himself. There are no real boss fights to speak of in the game.\n\nThe game has some pretty good looking visuals, nothing that is going to push your machine to its limits but its very nice and the world itself very interesting and somewhat surreal at times. The game also has some fantastic music in it to go along with the visuals and perfectly fits the tone of the game and what is going on.\n\nThe game controls fantastically with a controller and KB+M, however despite the game implying you to use a controller, I personally at least found it to play better and be more enjoyable with keyboard and mouse, so the port gets that right. In terms of perfromace there really isn't much to complain about, there are certain times where the frame rate will drop but quickly goes back.\n\nThe issues with the game unfortunatly come from the design itself: while it is part puzzle game, the puzzles themselves aren't very challenging and are very itterative and repetitve, on top of that the game is short, very very short. Four hours is the most you can expect out of it, that's on first playthrough, but given how linear it is on subsequent playthroughs and knowing what to do, you could get through it in under three potentially. There is little incentive to replay the game too, outside of 25 hats hidden around the game to find, of which unlocks upon beating the game the first time. Besides that there are no other kind of collectibles or distractions, the puzzles, gameplay and story are the only attraction here.\n\nThe story attempts to be emotional and moving, which it does pull off many times, but at the same time once you learn certain things it kind of falls apart and become predictable and that hold it has wears off, doesn't ruin the game though by any means.\n\nOverall, its a short, very easy, but enjoyable adventure through an interesting world and is charming at the same time. Its definatly worth playing through at least once, maybe twice if you are interested in collecting all the hats and achivements, but I cannot say I would recommend it at full price, but consider that part at your own discretion. All that said I did enjoy this game and I do recommend checking it out. None of the minor issues I mentioned are enough I think to deter from this nice puzzle/platformer.","November 1, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is great, the art design is wonderful, whimsical and fun. Has a mysterious sort of feel that is at the same time, fun and haunting. I found my first play feeling a bit of trepidation.  The opening has the creator thank those around him while growing up for helping him live through his childhood.\n\nIt's fantastic what this game is doing. It is enabling someone to share an important narrative that is often unheard. Not only through story, spoken or written words but in gameplay. Gameplay serves to communicate the feeling of fear, excitement, paranoia and hope.\n\nThis is an accurate portrayal of one persons difficult childood, dealing with abuse and loss. This game rings true and accurate with my own as well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is curious what it might be like to be scared when a parent gets home. I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzles and platformers that may be a bit on the simple side but serve to communicate something greater. I recommend this game to people who want more heart and sincerity in their game and less brown, gray and repetitive shooting.

It's a puzzle/platformer with emphasis on the platforming elements.\n\nThe puzzles are usually quite easy to figure out on your own, but sometimes quite difficult to enact. For instance, there's a level where you have to catch three frogs and destroy them before Monster catches you, and if you fail you start over from the beginning. It's the closest to dying you come in this game, but it's still quite frustrating.\n\nI expected the story to be heart-rendingly moving, and I was still caught off-guard by it. It's that powerful.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the setting. It looks like a favela if you look at it out of the corner of your eye, but if you explore and pay attention, you sink deep into the art and mood. It's one of the most fantastic and magical places that I've ever been in a game world. And just to emphasize this, you must revisit each level (except two of them) twice or sometimes three times, each time to do something different, and requiring a different perspective, which truly gives the city a sense of extent and volume. It's also so amazing the way nature and more magical eliminates insinuate themselves into the city, as if the city itself is invading something far older.\n\nThe mechanics of this game are also unique in a very well-thought-out way. For instance, most of the puzzles require you to rearrange the world itself, moving, stacking, and tipping the little shacks, and at one point, tipping the whole village on its side. This is the first game I've seen where you get the ability to make "long jumps" from another character (a rocket-propelled robot action figure named Lula) which can be detached from your character at will. Which means the game can take away your ability to jump far at any time, just to make the gameplay more interesting.\n\nWhile I will say that this world drew me in so far, I didn't want to leave, and so felt a bit of withdrawal when the story ended after four hours, I can't help but note that the story arc is so smooth and coherent, it could not have been longer than it was. It ended exactly where and when it had to end. Given how little gaming time I have these days, it's probably best that it didn't take longer than it did.\n\nPros:\n- Heart-rending story lovingly told\n- Beautiful sets and models\n- Clever game mechanics\n- Just the right amount of frustration\n\nCons:\n- The feeling of sadness slowly sinking into your soul the moment you beat the game and realize you must go back to real life now\n\nOut of five, I'd give this game at least a seven.","May 31, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are optional, so you're never forced to read a hint if you don't want to. On the whole the puzzles are a bit like Portal : you stop for a while trying to figure it out, and then you have an ha-ha moment and manage to move forward. So not complicated, but give you just enough pause to make it satisfying to solve it.\n\nI really enjoyed the game, but got slightly frustrated toward the end. The game almost overstays its welcome. The goalpost keeps moving forward, you often think "this is it, i'm gonna see the ending", but there is actually one more puzzle to solve, and then another one, etc...Still on the whole the game is short enough for its own sake, and it's really worth to go through all of it to see the well crafted ending, and understand exactly what the game was all about.","May 23, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obvious comparissons to Brothers: A tale of 2 sons are appropriate.  Both are puzzle, platformers set in imaginative worlds with fantastic music.  Brothers though I had a few problems with that this game doesn't.  This game does not force you to use a controller and while the single player coop was unique, this game opts for creative puzzles not ones that require adept controller work.  Also the camera here is pretty much free and the levels are less linear though the game is still quite linear.  Also the length is about 4 hours which is about the same i believe in both cases.  Also the levels in this game, as is the story is very imaginative and where brothers had some unique set pieces and puzzles, this game blows it away in imaginitive and non, done before fantasy setting, etc.\n\nThe story to me also excels.  I will say that i like morals, meaning in storys.  Brothers seemed to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off to no end in what the struggle and sacrifice of the story is all about.  In this game your father is the main driver though in a different way of saving him.  In the end sacrifices, etc are about your character and his progression, not the forced emotional &jY&$3# that was brothers.\n\nSo yes i keep bringing up brothers, and this is because the games are more alike each other than any other games i've played.  I would recommend this for a fan of that game or any player who likes a moving story, imagination, and non bang-your-head puzzles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turkeydipking/recommended/227080/","turkeydipking","Turkeydipking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turkeydipking/","415 products in account","I wish Papo & Yo was the first game I've ever played.\n\nThere's something about it which envokes a childlike wonder within players - the entire game is reminiscent to an interactive Pixar experience, the feelings we used to have as kids watching Toy Story or Monsters Inc. This lies in the wonderfully magical aesthetic of the game - the colours are vibrant, the music is playful, and the world feels magical, displaying a beautiful level of imagination.\n\nAt its core, Papo & Yo is a third person puzzle platformer, but I would never dare use this as a description for this game. The puzzles are all very well paced, providing the slightest challenge, which although may be offputting to some, the previously mentioned magic within the world makes up for it. Quico (the main character of the story), the young boy who travels inside his own imagination will be picking up boxes and causing houses to move on little legs. He will make staircases pop out of the side of houses, or rotate a building inside of itself to reveal a new path to further advance in his goal. Each time I found myself with a new interaction in the environment, my eyes lit up with glee as the Pixar effect of discovery, imagination and beauty played off on screen. Quico is accompanied by three other characters; Lula, Monster and Alejandra.\n\nLula is Quico's helpful pet/toy robot. She rides attached on his back, constantly hugging him and allowing Quico to do a double jump thanks to her rocket booster legs. Lula can also be used to flip switches out of Quico's reach. Alejandra is the first character we meet, and the only one we don't really get to interact with. She is a metaphor for Quico's growth throughout his journey, and not much can be said about her without spoilers.\nLastly, there's Monster. A giant, fat, bulky, horned creature who either sleeps, eats, or looses himself in rage attacking anything in sight. He brings a majority of the puzzle elements in the game, as Quico has to manouver Monster via the usage of fruit, which Monster loves and will run up to one if he sees one, in order to advance to the next area. Monster also loves to eat frogs, but upon doing so he will enter a state of rage, charging at Quico and attempting to kill him.\nThis brings me into the game's strongest point - the story.\n\nThe story in Papo & Yo is based on real-life experiences of it's director amd designer Vander Caballero. The Monster is a metaphor for an alcoholic and abusive father, and the world Quico finds himself in is his imaginary escape, picturing his father as Monster. Without spoiling much, you will understand the effect and impact of this metaphor especially towards the last 20/30 minutes of this game.\n\nThe game is rather short, as displayed on my profile it took me just three hours to beat, but I also haven't had the chance to explore every nook and cranny to find the collectible "hats" in game. When considering Papo & Yo, please don't let it's length turn you off the game. It is a beautiful, heart-touching, childlike experience unlike any other I've seen in video games so far. Due to Papo & Yo's easy difficulty, no deaths or death penalty, a story which is well suited for everyone - children will love the aesthetic; the characters; the environments; the puzzles, whereas older audiences will love the metaphor and the meaning behind the game, I simply have to recommend this game to everyone.\n\nTL;DR: Beautiful aesthetic, very deep and emotional story, envokes childhood memories and feelings 10/10 recommended for everyone.","March 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While some gamers may not appreciate this game for what it is, Would have a lot more to say, but the story and the experience make this game, and I do not know that I could do it justice without spoiling it. I highly suggest at least one playthrough.\n\nSo long as you can go more than 30 minutes without killing an alien/terrorist/animal/robot, you will find a unique experience.\n\nStoryline: 7/10 - the underlying story kept me intrigued\nMusic: 7/10 - the music added to the experience, and I enjoyed it, Walking away from the game I can't say that I remember much of the music, though.\nSound Effects: 8/8 - simple, non-obtrusive, but felt organic to a surreal scenario- especially the 'dialogue' sound effects.\nGraphics: 8/7 - A fairly charming visual experience.

Excellent presentation and beautiful Latin American-themed artwork/music make Papo & Yo both a visual and audible pleasure. While the puzzles aren't anything that'll test your mind, it's less about figuring out how to solve them and more about watching and admiring the solutions as they unfold. The way you can manipulate the world with the push or pull of a lever is a neat sight to behold and has a "child-like imagination" feel to it. There are a few technical issues present (noticeable framerate drops here and there), but nothing significant.\n\nOverall, an impressive game that does a great job of using metaphors and symbolism to tell a powerful story full of dark subject matter in an accessible manner.

Though the whole game is very easy and I could play it with my low-end Pc at high graphics, I still think it was a beautiful experience and I enjoied every minute of it. On the one side, those 4 hours weren't very much, but on the other I definitly think this is the better way of making games: If you don't have anything more to mention, just end it and let the gamer remember all the fun parts instead of repeating the same things over and over again and strech the game for profit.

Once you beat the game, you can play the game again in order to collect various hats scattered around the levels; collecting them all rewards an achievement. However, the collection itself quickly becomes your main goal, as while the first hat is fairly normal, the second hat is a soccer ball and it just gets crazier from there. You'll find yourself eagerly anticipating what Quico will next decide to place on his head.\n\ntl;dr disregard first playthrough, acquire hats","February 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This lies in the wonderfully magical aesthetic of the game - the colours are vibrant, the music is playful, and the world feels magical, displaying a beautiful level of imagination.\n\nAt its core, Papo & Yo is a third person puzzle platformer, but I would never dare use this as a description for this game. The puzzles are all very well paced, providing the slightest challenge, which although may be offputting to some, the previously mentioned magic within the world makes up for it. Quico (the main character of the story), the young boy who travels inside his own imagination will be picking up boxes and causing houses to move on little legs. He will make staircases pop out of the side of houses, or rotate a building inside of itself to reveal a new path to further advance in his goal. Each time I found myself with a new interaction in the environment, my eyes lit up with glee as the Pixar effect of discovery, imagination and beauty played off on screen. Quico is accompanied by three other characters; Lula, Monster and Alejandra.\n\nLula is Quico's helpful pet/toy robot. She rides attached on his back, constantly hugging him and allowing Quico to do a double jump thanks to her rocket booster legs. Lula can also be used to flip switches out of Quico's reach. Alejandra is the first character we meet, and the only one we don't really get to interact with. She is a metaphor for Quico's growth throughout his journey, and not much can be said about her without spoilers.\nLastly, there's Monster. A giant, fat, bulky, horned creature who either sleeps, eats, or looses himself in rage attacking anything in sight. He brings a majority of the puzzle elements in the game, as Quico has to manouver Monster via the usage of fruit, which Monster loves and will run up to one if he sees one, in order to advance to the next area. Monster also loves to eat frogs, but upon doing so he will enter a state of rage, charging at Quico and attempting to kill him.\nThis brings me into the game's strongest point - the story.\n\nThe story in Papo & Yo is based on real-life experiences of it's director amd designer Vander Caballero. The Monster is a metaphor for an alcoholic and abusive father, and the world Quico finds himself in is his imaginary escape, picturing his father as Monster. Without spoiling much, you will understand the effect and impact of this metaphor especially towards the last 20/30 minutes of this game.\n\nThe game is rather short, as displayed on my profile it took me just three hours to beat, but I also haven't had the chance to explore every nook and cranny to find the collectible "hats" in game. When considering Papo & Yo, please don't let it's length turn you off the game. It is a beautiful, heart-touching, childlike experience unlike any other I've seen in video games so far. Due to Papo & Yo's easy difficulty, no deaths or death penalty, a story which is well suited for everyone - children will love the aesthetic; the characters; the environments; the puzzles, whereas older audiences will love the metaphor and the meaning behind the game, I simply have to recommend this game to everyone.\n\nTL;DR: Beautiful aesthetic, very deep and emotional story, envokes childhood memories and feelings 10/10 recommended for everyone.","March 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first, you think this game is just a simple and bealtiful game, but after the end, you may see a diferent perception of it. The puzzles are great and challenging.

One of the strongest points of this game is the beautiful and ambient soundtrack that accompanies the game's storyline; on the outside, it appears to simply be an adventure/fantasy puzzle-solving game but on the inside, it holds much more as the subtle and beautifully laid out overarching background story fills in the cavities of why the protagonist, the boy, Quico is running around seeking a fantasised asylum. With beautiful visuals and relatively smooth controls, the only and main problem that Papo & Yo suffers from (within personal experience) is the frame-rate drops and lag that occurs quite a bit throughout the game. 9/10","January 14, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say it does remind me a lot of what Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons does in terms of story, conveying most of it through the gameplay and what you see rather than dialog, but this game does have dialog occasionally so its a little more clear sometimes what is going on. Even then though this game isn't what it seems like at first, without ruining it you will find out what the real theme is about and the metaphor for the monster as you go through.\n\nYou play as a kid, Quinco who comes across at one point a big monster, who has an unhealthy appitite for poison arrow frogs and a very bad temper; he eventually becomes your companion on the story as well as your little robot protector Lula. You are following a strange girl who claims you are "cursed" and are on a journey to find out what is going on, and where you really are. Through out you need to platform and solve puzzles to progress through the areas of the game, many revolving around the monster himself. There are no real boss fights to speak of in the game.\n\nThe game has some pretty good looking visuals, nothing that is going to push your machine to its limits but its very nice and the world itself very interesting and somewhat surreal at times. The game also has some fantastic music in it to go along with the visuals and perfectly fits the tone of the game and what is going on.\n\nThe game controls fantastically with a controller and KB+M, however despite the game implying you to use a controller, I personally at least found it to play better and be more enjoyable with keyboard and mouse, so the port gets that right. In terms of perfromace there really isn't much to complain about, there are certain times where the frame rate will drop but quickly goes back.\n\nThe issues with the game unfortunatly come from the design itself: while it is part puzzle game, the puzzles themselves aren't very challenging and are very itterative and repetitve, on top of that the game is short, very very short. Four hours is the most you can expect out of it, that's on first playthrough, but given how linear it is on subsequent playthroughs and knowing what to do, you could get through it in under three potentially. There is little incentive to replay the game too, outside of 25 hats hidden around the game to find, of which unlocks upon beating the game the first time. Besides that there are no other kind of collectibles or distractions, the puzzles, gameplay and story are the only attraction here.\n\nThe story attempts to be emotional and moving, which it does pull off many times, but at the same time once you learn certain things it kind of falls apart and become predictable and that hold it has wears off, doesn't ruin the game though by any means.\n\nOverall, its a short, very easy, but enjoyable adventure through an interesting world and is charming at the same time. Its definatly worth playing through at least once, maybe twice if you are interested in collecting all the hats and achivements, but I cannot say I would recommend it at full price, but consider that part at your own discretion. All that said I did enjoy this game and I do recommend checking it out. None of the minor issues I mentioned are enough I think to deter from this nice puzzle/platformer.","November 1, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Inside i found the controls clunky and a suprisingly annoying checkpoint system. My character seemed a little slow, although this is just a speed preference, and the turning didn't help. At parts it felt like it was aesthetically finished but still like playing a early access game. I remeber one point I got very stuk on a level and used hints to try to figure it out.

Not to take a back seat to aesthetic and theme, the action itself is very satisfying.\n\nPapo and Yo is brief, but it is so dense with symbolism and striking scenes that it seems much longer.

It's seems like he didn't have the patience for the simple puzzles and complained too much about the too few bugs, which were minscule.\n\nAnd then I read Kotaku's review, and it was spot on: This game is a must play. It's imaginative, graphically impressive, the narrative is strong, the gameplay is simple enough. There's not too much wrong with the game. In fact, the only thing wrong with it might be some PC optimization, but lowering the settings a bit fixes that.\n\nIt was clear what the story was going to be about from the opening message and intro scene from the creative director and writer, a story about a boy with an abusive, alcoholic father. It's heartfelt and means well, but wasn't as inspired or hidden like how the masterpiece, Braid, shocks you at the end.\n\nThe game acts as a puzzler/adventure with platforming mechanics, jumping and stuff. It's done well, but a bit on the easier side. The puzzles were....simple, I guess is the best way of putting it. But it came with enjoyment, which Mitch Dyer didn't find it to be. The soundtrack and audio design is well done, I mean really well done. I was in awe of the composition and layering of instruments. Animation was fantastic, as expected; animators in Montreal do tend to put extra effort in their work. The graphics are visually impressive, great texturing, modeling, lighting, the favelas of Brazil are a great sight and I wish I could have seen more. But when the game starts to get more fantastical, the favelas become less important. The magical houses were sweet though. Also, fantastic lighting and shadowing.\n\nI don't know what else to say, the game is great. Check it out.\n\n9.0/10","June 24, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Papo and Yo is the culimination of a son's experiences with his drunken and abusive father.\n\nDark stuff indeed, but Papo and Yo is very careful not to overplay its theme too hard.\n\nThe game felt to me as if it were borrowing from Miyazaki's Spirited Away at times. A young protagonist trying to cope with circumstances far outside their control. Dark at times, but careful to not to burn you out, feeding you just a small piece of the darker story before dropping you back into lighter fantasy.\n\nThe game features a lot of thought and consideration for the design of it's puzzles and mechanics. The platform elements are rarely frustrating. And, the game provides many shortcuts as you explore a given level to help you recover from bad jumps.\n\nThis game is just a great bit of fun and has great payoff of its theme.

This tells a meaningful and emotional story without having the main charcater wield a gun or act violent.\n2. The main charcater is not white or tasked with saving humanity (Not that these types of games are bad, its just they represent 99% of games)\n\nThis is story about a childs at first inability and then learning to overcome his alcoholic and abusive father (I wouldn't consideer that a spoiler, its obvious from the get go that these characters and ideas were metaphors) And you don't play this to find that out anyways, you play it because rather than like a book or movie passively consuming a story. You are actively pursuing its conclusion. In a way your helping the child overcome his fears and distorted memories.

This game left me shocked, silent and with a lot of thoughts to process. Our story opens with Quico, a young boy living in a Brazillin favela with his abusive alcoholic father. Retreating into his imagination, we follow his adventures through a surreal landscape as he interacts with his friend Monster as his means of coping with the real world. Beautifully written and and powerfully executed, more than once I felt on the brink of being physically ill at many of the implications and how they related to Quico's life.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's a fairly standard puzzle-platformer. As you travel through the favela you'll be pulling levers, hitting buttons, manipulating the landscape in surreal ways, and either coaxing Monster to aid you, or running from him. The puzzles are fairly simple and never frustrating, nor do they ever interfere with the game's atmosphere. In terms of music, the atmosphere is only boosted by a gorgeous soundtrack (which you can purchase along with the game). The game's only downfall is how short it is, as it can be completed in less than a day.\n\nThis is truly a masterpiece and a work of art. If you're a fan of heavily story-driven games, I highly recommend Papo & Yo.","May 5, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Got a little "upset" to see this game didn't get much attention, but i'm glad i played - and i did really enjoy it - and i hope some you will play it too.\n\nPapo & Yo  is something between reality and dreams, hope and escapes, is a little story about a boy named Quico that suffered from his abusive, alcoholic father, and on this case the father is the "monster" that follow us. The father is really gentle, kind person, but when drinks get super violent, but on this case when the monster eats frogs - and by frogs we change for alcohol - will get very angry.\n\nAbout this 'masterpiece', with has a lot of puzzles, not very hard our to easy puzzles, medium puzzles that you can solve in 1/2 min, it also has a very good artistic side, in almost every corner you will see some graffiti with excellent art.  Although the favelas are always empty you can "sense" some loneliness but is also here some people are happy.\n\nThe OST that follows is great, super calm, fits with the theme. Ths plot will suffer some huge twist, some happy twist and some SAD twist, and if you "connect" with the characters you will get a little sad - like i did - , but in the end is a explanation to all.\n\nWith no doubt is a EXCELLENT game, everyone should play it and enjoy the most!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/227080/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","Papo & Yo is a truly excellent 3d puzzle platformer has great gameplay, great visuals, and a great story.\n\nThe main gameplay sees you solving a series of puzzles using what's given to you by the environment. Each puzzle introduces some kind of mechanic and the 3D platforming gameplay gives you an interface to interact with that mechanic. Discovering what that mechanic does then figuring out how to manipulate it to progress is key and the game does an excellent job of letting you explore the mechanics without punishing you for trying something that doesn't work.  If you mess up, the game gives you a way to come back from what you've done and in the few cases where you can fail (such as falling off a cliff), you get put back in quickly so you can try again. This is a great way to encourage players to explore their options and try anything they can think of and is an example of how to do puzzles well. None of the puzzles are repeats, so each puzzle gives you something new to chew on without any filler. All of the challenges are really well designed and fun, while there were one or two puzzles that got a bit tedious, I wouldn't say any of them were unenjoyable. I did encounter one glitch where my character got stuck and couldn't move, but other than that everything was pretty solid.\n\nThe graphics of this game are excellent both artistically and technically. Unreal Engine 3 is being used in full force to create a game that looks nothing short of gorgeous. The game uses lighting and bump mapping to great effect, but this would be mean nothing without the creative visuals that the developers put on display. The game more or less take place inside the protagonist's imagination (that's not a spoiler by the way), so they get really creative with the environments. The color pallete is vibrant and absolutely beautiful to look at. The animation of the monster is also fantastic, although the player character's run cycle felt a little bit stiff.\n\nUnlike most indie games that run on Unreal Engine 3, this game is actually extremely well optimized, and my GT 440 (which is somewhat old and outdated by now) usually got around 40 FPS on max settings.\n\nEven though the gameplay and graphics are fantastic, the story just might be the best thing about Papo & Yo. I won't go into too much detail because that would spoil it, but the storytelling does a great job of telling a deep, emotional story in a mostly nonverbal way. What you see in the imaginary world of the character's imagination is allegorical to his life (and the life of the creator of the game), which makes the game feel the developer is opening up a very personal part of his life to you. It's emotional and beautiful there are some soulcrushing twists along the way.\n\nOverall, Papo & Yo is a must-play for anyone interested in puzzle games or great stories.","June 18, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Through the game you will meet a monster and while he seem like a great big friend, who jeats and sleeps a lot. He has an addiction for poisonous frogs, your goal is to cure this addiction and guide the monster through the weird world you're in. The story gets more indepth as you progress further, things get weird and out of control, with an really good conclusion.\nAs for the Gameplay, while there are a lot of switches, they only add up to unique, interesting, but easy levels, with some reused gimmics while most being used only once. Pressing switches is tied into the Plattforming, you'll be either getting a switch to get a plattform and get to other switches. The puzzles‚Äô while simple are mixed up and the plattforming only has a jump/double jump.\nOverall simple, but interesting gameplay, which turns into 'a journey' to cure your big 'friend' monster.\nThis gets a G for GOOD (A>G>O)\n\nNote: Shout out to postuumi for gifting me this game, I regret that I took so long to start playing it.","March 12, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is probably one of the very few games I'll tell players to FINISH IT. PLAY IT TILL THE END.\n\nThe game is short compared to other story driven games but you know what? It might be short but time well spent. Story telling in this game is subtle - it doesn't make any sense in the beginning but slowly everything will come together as you play. No plot twist, story just unfolds gradually and then BAM! Everything make sense at the end.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is just right for me, a couple of retries here and there but not to the point of throwing away my gamepad and bawling on the couch. Even if you're not the puzzle type of person, go play around with the puzzle and you'll be at awe at some of the designs. Manipulating buildings, terrain and my favourite - carrying big fat squishy frogs (I don't think anyone enjoy splatting the frogs though, they're too cute to be treated that way!)\n\nAnother thing that's worth praising are the the tutorial and hint system are very well done - unobstructive upon request-only tutorial and subtle hints pointing you to the right direction without giving it all.\n\nIf you're looking for a short, but meaningful game - this is the one.","February 28, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, these frogs turn the calm Monster into a violent and dangerous creature, so Quico sets out to find a cure for his friend - but is there any?\n\nWhile this sounds like your average game story, it gains a lot of emotion and intensity once you realize that the story is metaphorical for Creative Director Vander Caballero's troubled childhood. It's relatively subtly tied into the game and if you don't pay enough attention or don't care about it, you could very well miss the message of the game, so don't rush it, step back for a moment and let the impressions work.\n\nThe game has relatively simple platforming mechanics and you will mostly end up jumping over gaps to progress in the level. Due the general pace of the game, there hardly are any timed events where, for example, you have to press a button and then quickly run somewhere to move on.\n\nRelatively early into the game you also find your friend Lula, a toy robot who will latch onto your back and lets you double jump by launching his tiny jet pack. Additionally, you can also command him to flip switches that are out of your reach.\n\nWhile the puzzles present themselves in a unique and creative manner, they aren't really challenging at all and mostly just require simple combination skills. It's a shame because the puzzle design as such is wonderful and could've made for some fun challenges.\n\nPapo & Yo is based on the Unreal 3 Engine and while this engine isn't exactly the standard for visual fidelity these days, the game still looks pretty good and the lighting and level design add a lot to the overall atmosphere.\n\nWith roughly 4 hours of playtime, the game is fairly short, but if the game would've been filled with repetative puzzles in favor of playtime, the emotion and strength of the story would have suffered immensively and would've made this game just yet another average puzzle platformer.\n\nThere are dolls scattered throughout the levels and once you beat the game, those dolls will receive hats which you then can collect in a second playthrough. Other than that, the game doesn't provide you with anything else to do, which is fine - games like Papo & Yo aren't meant to be played for days, weeks or months. They want you to immerse yourself for a few hours, tell you a story and maybe even think about it a few days later.\n\nPapo & Yo is a prime example of how emotional and intense video games can be. Don't buy it for the platforming and don't buy it for the puzzles. Buy it for the story and let the emotions take over.","July 21, 2013","true","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While the idea is great, the potential is not fulfilled since the way the story is presented fails to make you really identify and care for the boy. It has some fantastic moments but it feels like the creator lost some immersion in an effort to avoid making it depressing.\nThe puzzles are not hard and the resulting animations are great but all of them feel like a variation on the same puzzle. The platforming part is not hard either but the controls are definitely lacking. It is not accurate in movement and in depth causing you to miss simple jumps and redoing the part again.\nThe art style is really great. The scenes are beautiful and deliver wonderfully the favela feeling, especially the wall drawings. The characters are inventive and well animated and the subtle graphical effects really enhance the magical felling of the game.\n\nI really liked the different direction this game is taking and I would very much like to see another title from this developer - hopefully with more attitude to the story and improvement to the technical side. Took me about 5 hours to complete the game.","November 6, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hopefully, like me, you'll won't care at all because it's some of the most clever and inventive platforming gameplay I've seen in years.\n\nLittle by little the symbolism in the game will start creeping though and you begin to realize exactly what is happeng to the main character, Quico. You start seeing what all the tiny pieces that make up this adventure really are to our hero.  Before you know it Papo y Yo is punching you in the feels.\n\nIt's not the saddest storyline I've seen in gaming, but it's presented in such a beautful way that I couldn't help but shed a few tears once the credit's were rolling.

One of the few games on the market aimed specifically to evoke an emotional empathy response from it's player, this is largely because the developer Vander Caballero found here... http://www.weareminority.com/ has decided to use the expression of game art to exercise his own personal demons.\n\nWhile it was largely inspired by the game 'ICO' there is a more larger similarity to the game 'Among the Sleep' and 'Brothers' in the way that the developer has chose to use cute characters and backgrounds to handle some adult touchy subjects such as alcoholism and physical abuse.\n\nThe story revolves around a young Brazillian boy named Quico who cowers in his bedroom closet while his father storms past. He then escapes into a magical slum world he creates where he finds a girl Alejandra who at first sees Quico as a threat, but who eventually aids him in his adventure. He is also joined by a robot toy named 'Lulu' which always has his back and a monster who is usually somewhat love-able who sleeps a lot and you can have fun bouncing off his belly, but when he ever has French Cuisine he launches himself into a rampaging devil. All set out on a magical journey which ends both bitter and sweet.\n\nThe amazing slum background which would have Salvador Dali jumping up and down on a cat in excitement is sheer magical and enchanting to explore. While the puzzles aren't that sophisticated, some can be challenging on the basis that they are slightly vague and will have you scurrying either for a hint box placed in the game which you can don on and run around in or for a youtube walk through. In truth you've probably just missed something obvious like the fact that you can move the buttons as well as press them.\n\nYour first run through will be greeted with a metaphor of what happened in the developers personal life, you will also be challenged to go through the entire game a second time, this time without the need of a hint box and the further realization that 25 collectible hats have been hidden in the game.\n\nSo what are the metaphors in the game? Unlike other games which often be coy about the matter and leave it open the gamer's digression. The developer here wants his story to be told. (Spoiler Alert) The developer (quico) grew up with an abusive father (monster) who was an alcoholic due to the fact that he had accidentally hit someone in his car and killed them. The developer's mother (lulu) always was there for Quico until one day when the monster seemed to have killed lulu (severe abuse) eventually she did get better though through the help of Alejandra (a mixture of the developers first love and his literal little brother) .They at first tried reasoning and hiding the frogs (alcohol) which was making the monster angry. But after one severe abusive bout which took the life of Alejandro Quico eventually realises that he cannot cure this monster and instead has to let this monster go from his life for good. As Quico grows up he drifts away from his dependance of Lulu and pushes the monster away from his life for good after what he witnesses with his attack on Alejandro.\n\nThe game is well made, because the puzzles aren't that difficult no severe feeling of accomplishment is ever made and so the moral of the story is some what less victorious in feeling. The monster in the game just tosses you about too and is not really that fearing enough to make you sympathise as much as you do in 'Among the Sleep'. The biggest enemy of the game though is it's price. With such a noble meaning and story to a game you would think that they would lower the price so that more could enjoy as the game is also hardly long enough to warrant a large sum. However it should be noted that making games can be a very expensive journey. When asked why he chose frogs to represent bottles of alcohol, the developer replied that it was largely to do with cost. They originally wanted chickens to represent bottles of alcohol in the game, but to put chickens in the game would have cost them $15,000. Since they already had frogs in the game they decided just to go with the frogs and scrap the chickens idea. I have many question marks with that last statement???\n\nAnyway the game is seriously worthy of a glance especially if it goes on sale...","June 20, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That alone makes Papo & Yo stand out. However actual gameplay consists of series of puzzles that are inventive and satisfying but never bring greater challenge as it is almost always obvious what to do. Jumping is imprecise at best and sadly there are few sections where you have to perform a double-jump in a very specific way which is not fun at all. I reccomend Papo & Yo for tackling with difficult topics and for creating a memorable experience.","January 21, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Papo & Yo fits squarely into this category ‚Äì it‚Äôs never bad, but it‚Äôs never more than simply okay either.\n\nFor positives, I can easily say that Papo & Yo is a very pleasing game, visually. You spend the majority of your game time in a favela in Brazil, solving Alice in Wonderland-esque puzzles with floating platforms and clever mechanics which change your landscape in interesting ways. It doesn‚Äôt take very long to progress through, and feels mostly tight with controls and camera movements.\n\nHowever, there seems to be just a layer of polish in all aspects that prevents this game from being better than average. The animations are choppy, and some game mechanics, such as jumping puzzles, may not feel as accurate as other platforming games.\n\nThe story is my main dividing point. Although the narrative is essentially a very dark memoir, everything that you really need to know about the tale is shown to you up front. When the curtains are pulled back for a big reveal, you are basically shown what you‚Äôve known since booting up the game ‚Äì the monster is your father, and the poisonous frogs that put him into an uncontrollable rage are bottles of alcohol. It almost seemed odd that they decided to spend so much time at the end of the game devoted to showing you this, as that is the outset of the game.\n\nTo be fair, Papo & Yo has its heart in the right place, it just could have used a little more time to shine up what‚Äôs already there. However, this game is entirely skippable. Not recommended, unless you can find it as part of a package deal or it‚Äôs on a steep sale.","December 8, 2014","false","3.0"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","0"

The gameplay of Papo & yo works in a similar way that Ico game, you get into areas, solved a couple of puzzles, turno on switches here and there and that's it. The game is simple, easy to go through and solved the puzzles. Now grafically speaking, the game is just BEAUTIFUL, the environment where the action takes place is just AWESOME, living in South America, in a awesome city with lots of hills and house build on them one above the other kinda feel like the action is taking place in mi city even thoug it's a mix of several architecture cities in South america (Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia) which makes it more awesome because it's the first time I saw this kind of environment in a game. I should also  mention  the awesome art/painting in the walls of some buildings, they're incredible, I realized that those painting were actually done by  chilean artists and that some with similar designs are painted  in huge walls around my city, I just love it!!! As for the game quality, it's all thumbs up, music, art/design of the game no complains here and the story is deep, you can notice that the director put a lot of efforts in telling his own personal story and putting it into the game, lot of emotions, I think you should be a grown up to catch the whole plot to understand it though. The music is also excellent, so much that I decided to get the  OST as well.  To sum it up, this game is an excellent story telling/puzzle  kind of game well worth your money.

Though the game might at first look seem like a fantasy story of a boy and a monster he befriends, it really is about growing up and coming to terms with your childhood. It is a game about how our imagination can help us cope with difficult times, until we are strong enough to take the masks off, see things for what they really are and accept reality for what it is.\nThe game itself isn't very challenging, but the platformer controls can be a bit finnicky from time to time. The environments of the game are well made and it is fun to see how the world shifts as you solve the puzzles. The game is fairly short but it definitely keeps you invested in it until its very appropriate and memorable ending.\nIn essense, Papo & Yo is not an extraordinary game, but it is a very good one. It has a strong and very personal message, one which I believe most people should be able to relate to one way or another.

Its basic controls and easy to understand mechanics allows its charm to shine through. The story is centered around Quico, a south american boy, that sets out to find why he is cursed. He follows a mysterious girl around in search of the answer to his quest. He comes to find that his curse is to be paired with a monster who is usually disinterested in him but will turn in a moments notice and attack Quico when presented with some mysterious tree frogs. Quico has the ability, or the task, rather of manipulating his world. The south american favela setting is both oppressive and beautiful; at times the world is vivid and imaginative. Traversing the various puzzles can drastically change them in ways you would never expect.\nAs the story unfolds you come to find that the metaphors run deep and will certainly hit hard. The only complaint I have with Papo y Yo is that while the story is superb, it ends too soon. I suppose for the underlying subject matters, no spoilers, its best for this to be a short experience.\nThe game is beautiful, and easy to pick up and play.

Traversing the various puzzles can drastically change them in ways you would never expect.\nAs the story unfolds you come to find that the metaphors run deep and will certainly hit hard. The only complaint I have with Papo y Yo is that while the story is superb, it ends too soon. I suppose for the underlying subject matters, no spoilers, its best for this to be a short experience.\nThe game is beautiful, and easy to pick up and play. It's a 4 to 6 hour romp that is worth its asking price. Go check it out.","January 25, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

How about THIS!"\n"Oh no I am undone!  HSSSSSS!"\n\nPapo & Yo is an extremely metaphorical game about a boy's relationship with his abusive, alcoholic father (I don't think that's really a spoiler, considering the trailer makes that fairly obvious), and it's based on the lead designer's own childhood experiences.  The game deals with the issue absolutely brilliantly.  It really perfectly conveys the mixture of love, fear, and pity Quico feels.  It's also a fantastic example of gameplay-story integration, one of the best I've played.  The gameplay of alternating between working with and running from Monster really makes you feel the themes, which wouldn't work in any other medium.  To top it off, the gameplay is actually quite fun, and the graphics and music are both gorgeous.  If you value games as a storytelling medium, play Papo & Yo.","August 3, 2013","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

It's a 3D puzzle game. It's interactive magical realism. It's a meditation on abuse and alcoholism. It's pieced together with a real familiarity with and affection for the assembled look of Brazilian favelas. And it has a autobiographical tone that's nearly impossible to find elsewhere in games.\n\nThe gameplay is decent. The setting and music are strong. But the real star of the show is Monster. The game couldn't exist without him. For a creature that says nothing and spends half the game sleeping, he's fascinatingly complex. You'll switch between trying to protect him and trying to escape from him at a moment's notice. You're trying to break his addiction, but sometimes you'll use that addiction to force him to do what you want. You'll find yourself clinging to the brief moments he shows some affection, even if it's nothing more than a half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• toss of football. You want to like Monster, though you'll repeatedly ask yourself if you should even bother. It's a juggling act, but you'll find yourself practicing quite a bit of cognitive dissonance as you go from puzzle to puzzle.\n\nThe game isn't subtle in its metaphors, nor should it be. Think of it as a children's story about abuse. It's like Where the Wild Things Are, except instead of wild creatures as stand-ins for the anarchy of childhood, Monster stands for a child's perspective of the physical power, aloofness, and cruelty of adulthood.","July 8, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is an okay game, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. It is incredibly accessible and heavily story driven so anyone can get through it with relative ease and experience the story.\n\nHowever, that is probably the root of my largest complaint. My main gripe comes with the fact that almost all the "puzzles" in this game are not very clever and feel more like a chore. I never once had an "aha!" moment because it was always incredibly obvious what one needed to do to proceed. This isn't necessarily a negative for all people, but for me it is. For the most part they are just repetitive tasks you must complete to advance to the next zone.\n\nMost people rave about the story, and I thought this would be enough to redeem the game for me. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The ending came as no surprise as I thought they were very in your face from the beginning about the identity of the monster. I did however find the meaning of the frogs and their effect on the monster to be used in a way that was well done.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't all bad. The game did a good job of easing you into the mechanics and slowly building upon them as the game progressed. I also liked how when the monster became enraged the whole environment shifted and the monster came at you at just the right speed, This was enough to build tension most times I was caught off-guard (not realizing there was a frog around).\n\nLastly I want to say I did enjoy the music and art direction within the game. And a few of the levels (especially towards the end of the game) did some very visually interesting things which made me wish that same creativity could have been used to increase the difficulty of some of the puzzles.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not recommend this game for the current price of $14.99. However, if you happen to find it dirt cheap (perhaps around or under $5) you might want to give it a go. It is certainly a little adventure, but not one that I would probably take again.\n\n","June 18, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Not complicated and nicely done. Aiming a jump was at times a bit difficult during the first playthrough. But during the second I was doing well, so I guess it was just a matter of practice.\n\n\nPuzzles\nMainly easy but every now and then there was one I had to spend more time on. It may get tedious trying to resolve a puzzle when you are in A and go to B to pick something, return to A only to discover that whatever you picked was useless, go to C, return to A and then go to B to continue to the next puzzle.\n\nThe puzzles also mark very clearly the different stages in the game, 1 stage // 1 puzzle. For me this was one of the things that impaired the pace of the game.\n\n\nCinematics\nDuring the game the cinematics are generally very well executed, meaning you can still control your character while watching them. I feel this is a very pleasant thing to be able to do.\n\nHowever, there are times where a short cinematic would have been welcomed instead of a long sequence of doing nothing but waiting (when going to see the shaman, in the floating isle ). It was pretty frustrating being able to do nothing but turn in circles and playing with the camera.\n\nThere were times also, where I had the impression that the use of cinematics was unnecessary. There's a puzzle composed of 3 parts near the end of the game (when reviving Lula ) and after each part there is a cinematic telling you that yes! I had beaten that part yay. I know I have done it, I've just did it. Tell me I did well the first time if you want, but not all of them please.\n\n\nCharacters\nQuico\nMain character, nothing much to say about him.\n\nLula\nQuico's favorite toy. Her (I'm going to assume she's female) first appearance presents her as a guide, she tells Quico how she can help him and how to make use of the new discovered abilities. But that is the only piece of dialogue she gets during the whole game and she becomes more of a tool than a friend.\n\nAlejandra\nGirl that teases Quico into following her and helps him to deal with Monster.\n\nMonster\nBig lumbering creature that burdens you throughout the game. You must make use of him in order to resolve most of the puzzles.\n\nThe death of Lula and Alejandra seemed forced, the character were killed because they acted stupidly, Lula could have dodged Monster and Alejandra shouldn't have stood jumping with and enraged Monster behind her. Although I feel those deaths were important, I believe they could have been implemented differently in order to appear more credible.\n\n\nAchievements\nHats, why?\n\n\nAlthough I gather the game has a lot of value I had not a great time playing it, and I'm sorry but a cannot recommend it.","January 1","false","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The sense will begin to reveal only when game will be finished.The destiny of the main character is hard and he goes from real life to the invented world. But there it is expected far not by easy tests.At first the monster kills him the toy robot (which is live in the world of imaginations), then it takes away the girlfriend whom the boy for the first time met in this world. Playing it is possible to understand that the monster personifies the father of the boy who did his life difficult.Speaking about a gameplay it is possible to tell that we should use only the left joystick and 3 buttons.Music in conclusion give us time to thinking about whole game, about all events.I suppose it`s important for the full impressions.This game isn't perfect, but 9.5/10.","July 3, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

This sounds great in theory... however the game itself is a mess. The art alone is wonderful and i would definitely recommend Papo Y yo as an art exhibiton rather than as a game. This is because the controls feels very clunky and slow and i personally feel that the lack of "ledgegrabbing" could be... mildly infuriating. Not only that, but the puzzles themselves could be a bit painful due to backtracking without any other mechanic than simply "walking", "climbing" or the painfully slow "getting a box  2 feet away to an adjacent square in the ground".\n\nHowever as i mentioned earlier, Papo & Yo wants to (i think) focus on story and immersion, not the gameplay. When i got the humble bundle, i also got another game that did the same thing and it was called "To the moon". To the moon had half the staff and budget (probably) that Papo & Yo had, but delivered in so many more ways in that.\nWhat im trying to say that Papo & Yo doesn't have a story good enough to "carry the game". It feels very rushed, and the immersion just isn't good enough because of it's poorly designed gameplay. There are so many other games (such as "To the moon") which does story much better than Papo & yo, so if your looking for that, i suggest another game.\n\nThat said, the game has some beautiful art and some great tracks. if you find a deal where you get the game AND the soundtrack, like humble bundle, it could be worth a dime. Buying the game solely on it's own? Not worth it.","March 3, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Lacking in Interesting Characters or Puzzles.Genre: 3rd Person Puzzle Platformer Title\nDeveloped & Published by: Minority Media Inc.\nPlatform: Windows Only\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts & Preamble\nI was rather interested in giving this a whirl when it came out a few years ago. Fast-forward to this past week and I finally got a chance to try it out. Well, this game makes two major mistakes to me. First: the characters are given very little backstory or personality. You could swap in any person to fill the role of these characters and it would come off as the same. The other problem is the puzzles themselves. They mostly range from really easy to unnecessarily frustrating. Not even the good kind of frustrating, just time-wasting frustration. So, let‚Äôs dig in and talk about Papo & Yo.\n\nStory Thoughts\nI've seen comments been made that the game‚Äôs story is subtle and full of meaning. I found that it was rather blunt and in your face with its themes about living with people that abuse alcohol. I mean, a shadow in the shape of Monster behind a guy, it‚Äôs just not that subtle. The toy getting destroyed by Monster wasn't all that subtle. I do recall that I wanted to know more about the main character, more about this mysterious girl who‚Äôs guiding you around. Instead, you‚Äôre given very little information. The story seems content to focus on one little part of the boy‚Äôs past. It's hard to get invested when you're not given any character to invest into. So, if I can‚Äôt get invested in the characters or story, all that‚Äôs left is the gameplay. And for the most part, it‚Äôs boring.\n\nPuzzles\nA lot of the puzzles consist of getting monster from one place to the other using what few items and environment puzzle pieces you have at your disposal. Most of the time though, it‚Äôs climbing up ladders, doing very basic platforming, puzzling with levers, switches and buttons. Each puzzle is overly long and unsatisfying to finish. I can‚Äôt help but get the impression they were put in to stretch the game out. Especially when one particular puzzle has you climbing all over rooftops and platforms to collect around 10 pieces of building in order to finish it. There isn't a lot of nuance, its figuring out the quirk of the puzzle you've stumbled upon and then sinking however many hours the puzzle decides you need to until you finish it.\n\nPC Settings\nIt‚Äôs got texture, shadow, AA, light shafts, motion blur, bloom, depth of field and all other graphic settings a 3rd person game requires to tweak. Most, however, are on/off switches but at least you have options to optimize your experience. Not that I think you‚Äôll need to tweak with them much, the game isn't very demanding. You may need to tune up the gamma settings as the game seemed really dark to me.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nFinishing the game isn‚Äôt tough. However, this is one particular journey that I didn‚Äôt feel better for having experienced. I think the main problem lies in the characters themselves. I felt no investment into them, no reason to find moments evocative when perhaps I should have. It feels like this subject has been handled better elsewhere. Add that problem to the other problem of the simple, time-wasting puzzles that were far more frustrating than they should have been. I don't recommend this title. This has been done better.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","February 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Christ, esquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesushchristesq/","614 products in account","Edit: It is amazing how many people dislike this review, simply due to the fact that it doesn't supprot their preselected bias. Whether you agree or not with another's point of view, it is something to be respected. That goes the same, for myself; just because I didn't find this game entralling, doesn't mean I don't have a major respect for the creative minds behind it.\n\nPoor mechanic/thin story. This was a game that had so much potential, however it ended up trying way too hard to be clever. What seemed to be puzzles were just annoyances. You are introduced to the mechanics early on, and you, as the player, assume that these are going to develop into larger, more complecated puzzles. Instead, it just becomes reheated corn-cassorole type "you need to do this before you can proceed to the next room". Some "puzzles" were literally repeated throughout the game - this wasn't rewarding as the player, this just furthered your frustration.\n\nAnd if you want to make the basis of your game completely story driven, then do that. I really enjoyed titles like "Gone Home" and "Dear Esther", because they did it right. They understood that in order to drive a story, you must do exactly that - drive the story. If you want to implement a mechanic on the players' way to discover the story, make sure it works. By that, I mean make sure that there is something about the mechanic that keeps the player interested in using it. A good example of mechanic working in harmony with story, is "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons". If you're just going to be repeating the same thing over and over and over, get rid of it or heavily limit its use. Otherwise, what you're really ending up doing, is wasting peoples' time.\n\nNow speaking directly to the story. The story was paper thin, and given clues that doesn't even take playing half the game to run into - and some of these clues are unavoidable. If you're paying attention, you can see what the allegory is behind the story the entire time. It does nothing to be subtle, but it gives the illusion of trying to be subtle, and that is where they fail. If you want to make one of those "everything will be explained in the end" kind of stories, make sure the player doesn't figure out the entire story before the end of the game.\n\nFinal point - if certain things don't make sense without some sort of external explaination, get rid of them. They have no point being there, and do not pertain to the actual story you're trying to contrive.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this game. It has potential, and if the developers ever try rebooting it, I'd give it a shot after listening to some reviews. If you want to try great story-driven games or great puzzle games, there are definitely better games out there that get the job done.","February 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It takes its abusive father metaphor and beats you over the head with it. I applaud what the creator is trying to do; even more so knowing its based on his childhood but, I think the game needs a better writer.\n\nPlot:\nThe plot is about you letting go of your abusive and alcoholic father. Its not a bad place to start but thats all the game has plot wise. Very little character building or reasons to get attached to the characters. The only other npc is a girl that helps/hinders you who may be your sister but is unliklely due to the lighter skin color and almost no resemblance to you. *spoiler* She dies... or just gets abused.\n\nI have to say, I hate ambiguity. Not that ambiguity itself is bad, but few people know how, and when, to use it. Papa and Yo uses it as a crutch because 'I guess' the writers could fill the gaps with something they thought was interesting? I dont think the ambiguity is needed as much as they used it.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay consists of puzzle platformers. They are very simple puzzles and it gives you hints if you get stuck. Pretty bog standard as far as these things go\n\nAesthetic\nThis is where I feel the game wins. Its damn beautiful with creative use of the environment to assist the puzzles. With the exception of a few technical pop ins, the game looked great.\n\nSound\nThe sound was... alright. It did the jobs but nothing really stood out. There were also moments, like at the temple when you make the monster angry, a short music piece plays over the normal music and it doesnt sound good.\n\nLength\nIts 2 hours. Im not sure if thats good or bad considering I wasn't really having fun, or an interesting experience. I feel like any more and I would have just stopped playing. At least I beat it because of its short length?\n\n\nIf you really like puzzle platformer and non subtle plot threads strewn with ambiguity, then this game is for you.

Anyone who has struggled with a troubled childhood will be able to relate to the themes of this game.  Just don't be put off by the slow and repetitive gameplay.  It's no good when a game reveals its most clever puzzles in the first 30 minutes...","January 19, 2014","false","3.4"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","11","28","0","0"

They're also pretty liniar and the puzzles don't require a brain surgeon to solve them. So why didn't I like Papo y Yo as much? Probably because it kept giving me hints where I didn't really need them, prolonged gameplay by making me run all over the place way too many times, gave away the story with its achievement list and kept moving the camera angle right when it was vital for the character to go where I wanted it to. Also, I felt like it was trying too hard to be a tearjerker but it didn't really find a way to get me connected enough to the characters so that I'd empathise with them.\n\nI feel like it'd be a shame to not recommend this game, but 11 ‚Ç¨ seems pretty steep to me; if childhood trauma based games with good music and pretty art are your thing, by all means get it, but wait for the sale.\n\nEDIT: My second playthrough was better as I avoided all hint and training boxes and I spent considerably less time running away from Monster - knowing your surroundings does come with a tactical advantage.","August 26, 2014","false","10.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It looks as though the major fans of this game are a little immature, downrating a negative review since it simply doesn't agree with their opinion.\n\nQuite honestly one of the most dull and lifeless indie games in a long time. The developer seems to think that the player needs each reference explained to them. The puzzles are way too easy, which isn't always a bad thing so long as there is a deeply enjoyable story to accompany them. In the case of Papo & Yo the tale is less than thrilling, and not just because it's about a topic that will appeal to very few people; it's because the story is executed poorly.\n\nBy the end of it all the gamer will feel no emotional ties to the Monster or Quico, Lula the robot toy is the only one with a personality that isn't as dull as a rock. This title is one to avoid, but if you insist then for the price of $14.99 USD you're better off waiting until this one appears in a Humble or Indie Gala Bundle, or is on a heavy discount. The game play only lasts for a maximum of 5 hours; I completed my playthrough in a little under three and a half hours.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0","April 7, 2014","false","5.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

So it came as a bit of a shock when the opening animation sequence  made it clear that child abuse was going to be a prominent theme of the game -- I had been expecting cheery, light-hearted fluff, and this was looking instead like a terrible downer.  Within a few minutes, however, the setting and gameplay had drawn me in so much that I played all the way through in one sitting, even though I knew the game was writing me a ticket on the feels train.\n\nThe setting is an appealingly surrealist dreamscape rendition of a South American favela, blending fanciful magic with rusty corrugated iron sheets.  The frequent puzzles are inventive and fun, if not particularly challenging.  But the puzzles aren't the true star of this game; story is the shining star here.   Monster, your companion through most of the game, is a very thinly veiled portrayal of an abusive alcoholic father, and what the game does brilliantly is lead you into the mindset of a victim.  You'll love Monster, fear him, hate him, resent him and even pity him, often at the same time.  You'll find yourself doing ugly, violent things without even thinking about it, because you desperately need to avoid triggering Monster's rage.  You'll make excuses for Monster; you'll blame other things; you'll blame yourself.  You'll allow yourself to believe that you're in control -- that if you just play the game well enough, you can keep Monster content and placid indefinitely.  And, inevitably, it will all come crashing down on you.\n\nThe majority of "game as art" projects I've seen have been gross, pretentious failures that abandon concepts of gameplay in favour of marching the player on a directed tour through the creator's personal vision, and the interactivity of the experience is reduced to token actions in what is otherwise a sort of animated film or ebook.  Papo & Yo is a high-art game that gets it right; there's a real game here, and it's the gameplay makes it immersive.  Once you've been drawn in through the puzzle game elements, and you really care about the characters and what happens to them, the harsh, wrenching story elements become that much more powerful.\n\nHaving such mature themes, this game is admittedly not for everyone, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's a masterpiece.","December 20, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved this game, its astounding ambientation, its nice puzzle nature.\n\nLet's try to be objective and methodic:\n-Story: 7/10\nThe story isn't that great, but it's a break from classic puzzles, it's entertaining enough, and the end packs a punch.\n-Longevity/Replay value: 4/10\nThis is the worst part: it takes 3/4 hours to finish it, and once you finish it for the first time, there is really nothing compelling\nyou to play it again.\n-Difficulty: 6/10\nPretty much all the puzzles are very straightforward and easy to solve, with the hint box it's even easier. Both on the mental side and the skill required to put it in practice. Failing has no real consequences, as you never really "die" and the worst case scenario is losing a few seconds to respawn, but in the game everything stays as it was, so you don't even have to restart the level. This can be a pro (no frustration) or a con (shorter longevity).\n-Aesthetic: 10/10\nThis is the strongest point of the game. The ambientation, some kind of favelas, and the effect that solving the puzzle has on it is simply amazing. It has something mystical mixed with some kind of visual poetry. I greatly enjoyed it. Also kudos to the creators for the cure put into every little detail. Just lovely.\n-Concept: 9/10\nPuzzles that change the conformation of the ambient surrounding you are not really so new, but not that common either.\nPlus, the implementation is brilliant.\n-Controls: 7/10\nPretty straightforward. Usual wasd + mouse, third person. The cam is usually fine, in some rare occasion can move awkwardly. But those occasions are very rare, and failing has no big consequences (see "Difficulty")\n-OST: 8/10\nThe soundtrack is not, strictly speaking, memorable. But it always fit the game, is easy to the ears, nice, and really helps feeling part of the game.\n\nAVG: 7.3\nIt's worth the 11‚Ç¨? I'm not sure. But I'm also pretty stingy.\nWhat I can say for sure is that it's worth adding to the wishlist and get on a sale.","July 9, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You see another kid who you immediately start trying to follow. Soon you meet up with monster. He is a friendly, hungry, and sleepy bugger. When monster eats frogs he goes into a fiery rage trying to chase down and hit you. If he does eat a frog you must give him a blue edible and he turns back to normal again. You must traverse the strange world by jumping around and solving chalk line puzzles.\n\nThe Good\nThe hidden story in this game about his father's alcoholism is done in a very suddle way. Don't worry about that spoiler it doesn't wreck the experience, but actually enhances it know whats going on. The platforming is done well and the world has great music and visual style coming off very innocent. The puzzles are well done and feel fresh throughout.\n\nThe Bad\nThough the story is touching and the world is done well the game is very short. I also feel like the story could have been more involved throughout instead of mostly at the very end. You don't really gain much in terms of new abilities other then the double jump. The world looks nice, but the resources used in it don't change up hardly at all.\n\nConclusion\nPapo & Yo has a bit of a limited world and limited amount of characters, but what it does do is real you in with cute charm while secretly telling you a story about a childs struggle with his alcoholic father. The emotion and visual style are very impactful, but the short length and scope of the game do hinder what it could have been slightly.\n\nValue\nThe game is more like a short emotional art game with no real replay value so I'd say $5","December 21, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a small game -- with only about 3-4 hours of gameplay -- from the even smaller Minority development team, based in Montreal. With an August 2012 release date, it's also relatively old by game standard; I bought it back in June on a whim, torn between rave reviews by people I knew and a few spectacularly bad ones by games journalists (although, if IGN still counts as games journalism by the time anyone's reading this, I will be well and truly shocked). I didn't touch it at all until very recently.\n\nBut Papo & Yo lives up to cult hype. Although relatively simple -- possibly too simple for anyone who doesn't struggle with puzzles and platformers the way I do -- the game's breathtaking environments, incredible soundtrack, charming cast and biting narrative are more than enough to compensate even the most "hardcore" of gamers. If you feel mocked by the quotation marks I put around that word, please feel free to send me one (1) mug of your tears, and possibly a signed Polaroid of you crying next to today's paper so I know that your pain is real, and that my general disdain for the "gamer elite" has found its intended target.\n\nPapo & Yo's lead protagonist -- Quico -- is a young boy buried in the depths of his own imagination, struggling to cope with the trauma of life with his alcoholic, abusive father. Based on the childhood experiences of creator Vander Caballero, Quico retreats from his father's abuse into a dreamlike version of (what is ostensibly) his own neighborhood. In Quico's mind, his Brazilian favela becomes a magical place where buildings can sprout wings and legs, and Quico himself can run across the rooftops and jump between them with ease, accompanied by his toy robot, Lula.\n\nAt first, Quico's dreamy paradise is a perfect escape; puzzles are quick and fun, and interacting with the world is a beautiful, uplifting experience. But it isn't long before the Monster that rules Quico's conscious life follows him into his subconscious one, and begins to color the once-tranquil world of Quico's imagination with violence and fear.\n\nTruthfully, it's impossible to talk about this game without talking about the nature of abuse. The narrative is squarely pointed at it and as an abuse simulator, Papo & Yo is unnervingly effective. Having been in several emotionally abusive relationships myself, I saw my experiences mirrored onscreen. Monster is visually intimidating, but -- when calm -- actually takes on a strangely charming demeanor. He seems nice; a little gruff and bumbling but protective, scooping Quico out of danger when he gets in over his head, blinking up at you when you crawl on his belly, and even throwing a soccer ball back and forth with you. He's dumb and single-minded, but sweet, for the most part.\n\nBut when Monster's temper flares -- when he comes into contact with anything that alters his mood -- he becomes a terrifying hellion, and anything in his way falls victim to his rage. When Monster gets angry, almost nothing can dissuade him from hurting you... and he WANTS to get angry. He pursues the thing that drives him into that fury more doggedly than he pursues anything else. Soon you're not just trying to avoid letting Monster get angry, you're bracing yourself for the inevitable. 'When will he get mad next?' you start to wonder. You become more vigilant -- both of Monster's behavior and your own -- because it isn't a matter of if something will set Monster off again, but a matter of when.\n\nAt a certain point, Monster's temper isn't just something you fear; it's a fact of life. You have to be aware of him at all times, and you can never leave him to his own devices for too long. It becomes tedious managing him all the time. Monster hurts you when he's angry; he hurts people you like, and destroys things you care about. You can't get rid of him, but he's becoming something you can no longer bear to live with.\n\nThere's something to be said for the way Papo & Yo brings you through this cycle: from meeting the person to meeting their insurmountable problem; to taking that problem on as your own and being weighed down and exhausted by it; to beginning to fear and loathe the person for all the harm their problem is doing to you; to eventually wanting that person gone more than you feel obligated to them. I've lived that cycle several times, and being brought through it again by the game felt organic and real. For this exact reason, I can't bear to play through this game a second time; there's a few achievements that can only be earned on a second playthrough, and due to the realness of what I experienced, I don't anticipate ever going back for them.\n\nThe narrative is clearly where this game sings; gameplay is where it often sighs. There were a few key moments where I felt railroaded into interacting with Monster and his anger. I personally liked how incredibly forgiving the gameplay was -- to my knowledge there are no failure/death states -- but jokes aside, I do understand why some players have found it less than engaging in the past. Puzzles are relatively easy to solve and sometimes a little tedious as a result. Platforming in 3D is, as always, a little clunky, especially when jumping between platforms. Gameplay is very obviously second fiddle to the story Papo & Yo strives to tell, and although the mechanics in interactions with Monster feel very cohesive and in service of the narrative, most of the platforming segments do not.\n\nBut, despite being less narratively resonant than desired, overall I found the platforming segments pretty fun. Part of this is that the platforming enhances my understanding of Quico as a child -- it's generally playful and inventive, combining both common, visible objects and imaginary, fanciful ones, something which is relatively common among children Quico's age. The world becomes his playground, even in moments of great peril at the hands of Monster; there's an emphasis both in gameplay and in narrative that Quico isn't mentally, physically, or emotionally equipped to cope with or retalliate against his father's abuse. His only choice is to make up a story where he can survive it more easily. It also drives home what I think is a very important point: abuse follows abuse survivors everywhere they go. Abuse affects you so deeply, that Quico's incapable of even imagining a world without it.\n\nUltimately, I think the mechanical/narrative discordance in Papo & Yo is minimal. It might be more noticeable if the game was longer, but if you sit down and marathon it in a single day (which is completely doable), I doubt you'll think twice about it. Papo & Yo is a bold, powerful game, and has a lot of incredibly important things to say -- I recommend playing it immediately.","December 23, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The way that the developers (Minority) managed to tie in mature and serious themes like alcoholism and domestic violence without using gratuitous violence or gore is commendable. In fact, Papo & Yo doesn't contain any gore at all! The story is truly captivating and you find yourself getting increasingly attached to the characters as time goes on, despite the minimal use of dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mainly a mix of casual puzzles and platforming. It's a simplistic way of bolstering the narrative, and was implemented amazingly. There are only a few achievements, but I had a lot of fun getting them all. A second playthrough of the game allows for collecting hats (which appear on dolls seen throughout the game).\n\nI'm not one for writing serious reviews, but this game is deserving of nothing short of a proper review. Completing this game felt like a spiritual experience, and I'll be sure to do it again soon. Whatever the price is for this game right now, it's worth every penny.","November 29, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't like jumping puzzles.  I especially don't like timing puzzles.  I'm not very good at any of those.  Because of that, I should not have liked this game.  But I did.  I liked this game a lot.\n\nThe gameplay was simple enough that I could play through it without getting seriously frustrated by my lack of skill; but still challenging enough not to be boring.   The puzzles that did not involve jumping and timing were very clever, but for the most part still logical and intuitive once you got into the flow of the game.  There were a few odd moments where the puzzles did not make a whole lot of sense, and I was force to rely on a walkthrough; but very few (unlike so many modern puzzle games, where randomness is used as a cheap and easy substitute for cleverness).  The mechanics of the game are very entertaining in themselves, particularly once Lulu is introduced.\n\nThe game design is beautiful; and the creators use of an uncommon setting was brilliant.  The third-world backdrop meshed very well with the fantastical elements; creating a seamless world with it's own unique and readily-identifiable logic.  The artwork is stunning, and the inclusion of works by actual environmental artists nothing short of amazing.  The similar use of third-world characters, rather than white Europeans or stereotypical fantasy creatures is similarly inspiring.  The music is beautiful, and in spots almost breathtaking, wonderfully blending traditional and orchestral sounds.  Atmospheric and fun at the same time.\n\nI would be hard pressed to find any flaws in the game.  If I did, I would say that parts of the ending felt a little out of place.  Some of the scenes and actions didn't make quite as much sense as they could have, and the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded; but that's still a fairly minor quibble.   The game is a bit shorter than most of its type; but too much longer and it would have started to drag.  The pacing never leave it feeling too long or too short.\n\nOne warning is that the background story that emerges from the game is disturbing, becoming increasingly so the closer it gets to the end.  This is ultimately a story of addiction and child abuse; and is accordingly dark and sad.  Fortunately, the writers do not beat the player over the head with moralizing; and manage to balance the darkness with a keen sense of human resilience.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.  I picked it up at a huge discount during one of Steam's big sales; but would can easily recommend getting it even at full price.","November 8, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe.\n\nLong story short, Papo & Yo is another one of those obtuse and vague story telling indie games that will appear pretentious and confusing to many gamers or groundbreaking and wonderful for others. While I largely enjoyed the games easy, but not handholding puzzles and "Mystical chalk" in a Central/South American favela art style, I ended up mostly confused and not very satisfied with the ending. The ending was abrupt, and like the entirty of the storystelling, all based on metaphors. Papo & Yo is a game built more for the types that enjoyed Dear Esther (ugh) and Thomas Was Alone (A pretty nice game actually) and a bit less for those that enjoyed Portal 2 or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom - the puzzles are nice, but hardly brain-teasing or super innovative. I will say that seeing how the world forms and deforms through puzzles solving is really interesting and neat, but like any pretentious indie game, it is never explained how or why parts of buildings can suddenly sprout legs to walk or wings to fly, or why entire towns can be split and connected like a jigsaw puzzle: You're just supposed to "understand" some nebulous meaning and interpret what is going on, like guessing "This is the kid's imagination or how he understand the world works because he is just a kid" or something like that. While it is also clear that this is supposed to be a story about a child and an unclear relationship to his father manifested in a frog eating monster representing an alcohol abusing father, the exposition is all metaphorical and based on the developer's artistic vision, It's less understandable like a good Pixar short or the "Kiwi!" film where you understand the actions and emotions.\n\nIf you need further proof of what I'm talking about, see the discussion thread about "What does it all mean?!" between players and developers, where the dev doesn't answer the question and instead thanks the players for debating what is going on: http://steamcommunity.com/app/227080/discussions/0/828936718797549690/\n\nPapo & Yo gets on my good side for being a short, easy to finish game with a good art style, world design and an overall solid game (fits my Ultra-wide monitor resolution and I had no glitches besides a few graphical glitches early in the game). It gets on my bad side for being another "Guess at what story I'm trying to tell you instead of me actually telling you" arty/farty indie game. The story may strike a cord with other gamers who have experiened child abuse from their parents. This is something playable for children as well, but I doubt they would understand all the real world paralells the game is trying to make, Papo & Yo is essentially an adults game.","September 30, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd challenge anyone who doesn't believe that video games can be art to play this game and still support that opinion.\n\nStop reading this and just go and experience this story.","August 27, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games plot is simple but engaging: the main character is a little boy on a quest to cure his companion, a giant pink "monster" who is friendly, helpful, even nurturing and fun-loving at times but becomes violent, angry and...abusive upon consuming a frog. The whole setup actually is one huge metaphor for the story of the Creative Director's father and his alcoholism problem. With its surreal and colorful art style and its uplifting music, the game creates a facade of juvenile fun, but if the metaphor is to be taken seriously, the entire ending act of the boy's 'quest' might well be the most disturbing thing ever put into such a deceptively jovial piece of work. The only blemish on this game's artistic vision are the collectible hats, unlocked only on a second playthrough. But the simple but elegant puzzles and the great story closure make it such that a second playthrough can only cheapen the experience. Ironic, given that the collectibles were there to increase its value-for-money given its high pice tag and short playtime.","August 4, 2013","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't like jumping puzzles.  I especially don't like timing puzzles.  I'm not very good at any of those.  Because of that, I should not have liked this game.  But I did.  I liked this game a lot.\n\nThe gameplay was simple enough that I could play through it without getting seriously frustrated by my lack of skill; but still challenging enough not to be boring.   The puzzles that did not involve jumping and timing were very clever, but for the most part still logical and intuitive once you got into the flow of the game.  There were a few odd moments where the puzzles did not make a whole lot of sense, and I was force to rely on a walkthrough; but very few (unlike so many modern puzzle games, where randomness is used as a cheap and easy substitute for cleverness).  The mechanics of the game are very entertaining in themselves, particularly once Lulu is introduced.\n\nThe game design is beautiful; and the creators use of an uncommon setting was brilliant.  The third-world backdrop meshed very well with the fantastical elements; creating a seamless world with it's own unique and readily-identifiable logic.  The artwork is stunning, and the inclusion of works by actual environmental artists nothing short of amazing.  The similar use of third-world characters, rather than white Europeans or stereotypical fantasy creatures is similarly inspiring.  The music is beautiful, and in spots almost breathtaking, wonderfully blending traditional and orchestral sounds.  Atmospheric and fun at the same time.\n\nI would be hard pressed to find any flaws in the game.  If I did, I would say that parts of the ending felt a little out of place.  Some of the scenes and actions didn't make quite as much sense as they could have, and the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded; but that's still a fairly minor quibble.   The game is a bit shorter than most of its type; but too much longer and it would have started to drag.  The pacing never leave it feeling too long or too short.\n\nOne warning is that the background story that emerges from the game is disturbing, becoming increasingly so the closer it gets to the end.  This is ultimately a story of addiction and child abuse; and is accordingly dark and sad.  Fortunately, the writers do not beat the player over the head with moralizing; and manage to balance the darkness with a keen sense of human resilience.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.  I picked it up at a huge discount during one of Steam's big sales; but would can easily recommend getting it even at full price.","November 8, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only progressed in little bits and pieces, but those were enough to make it something I will remember.

The way that the developers (Minority) managed to tie in mature and serious themes like alcoholism and domestic violence without using gratuitous violence or gore is commendable. In fact, Papo & Yo doesn't contain any gore at all! The story is truly captivating and you find yourself getting increasingly attached to the characters as time goes on, despite the minimal use of dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mainly a mix of casual puzzles and platforming. It's a simplistic way of bolstering the narrative, and was implemented amazingly. There are only a few achievements, but I had a lot of fun getting them all. A second playthrough of the game allows for collecting hats (which appear on dolls seen throughout the game).\n\nI'm not one for writing serious reviews, but this game is deserving of nothing short of a proper review.

This game dredged up memories of a time when I had to let go of a best friend of mine because of illegal drug use. It was alcohol specifically, that made me decide. In the moment when he broke into a liquor cabinet and began to get drunk, (while of course being underage.), I was afraid. I let him get drunker and drunker, and when he was stumbling around and falling down, I got in my car, (which had his stuff and the stuff of the people who were with us.) , and I left and drove to his parents house. I deposited everyone's stuff on the front porch and rang the doorbell and told his dad where he was and what he was doing. Afterwords, I never looked back. I haven't seen him in years now, nor do I want to, but I just know, if I saw him again I could become friends again with him easily. But I took the harder route of not forgiving him and simply letting him go. The ending of Papo and Yo was a metaphor for an actual moment in my life, and it was one of , if not THE most, moving ending to a video game I have ever seen. Millage may vary for other people, but at least for me, I felt very moved. It was just like revisiting that moment again, but this time, I was able to let go more easily.

It's a basic puzzle/platformer; it isn't too difficult skill-wise, nor will you likely get stumped by any of the puzzle elements. Mechanically it's actually a very easy game - even taking my time and messing up a bit here and there, I still finished it in less than 4 hours. Despite that, it was one of the most difficult games for me to complete on an emotional level.\n\nI really relate to the main character, Quico. What this game lacks in mechanical complexity it completely makes up for in emotional intensity and engagement. It will hit you right in the feels, over and over. It's not hard to tell that this was a very personal subject for the game's main creator, and I think he and the creative team tackled it very well. They have my utmost gratitude for making this game. Honestly, if anyone ever asks me about my relationship with my stepfather, rather than explain it to them with words I could just have them play this game. It definitely goes onto my favorites list, and although I can't say it's one I'll play again anytime soon, I'm very much grateful for the experience it brought me.","April 13, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it's a pretty standard puzzle platformer, Papo & Yo is dealling with some pretty interesting concepts. The setting is some sort of South American chanty town outside of reality, and the main character has to navigate the world by manipulating the landscape, and through the assistance of his little robot friend Lula, as well as a large placid creature called Monster.\n\nThe "arty" aspect comes to play when trying to use Monster to get to new places. Monster has three priorities, sleeping, eating coconuts and eating frogs. You can wake him up and lure him to places you need him using coconuts, but you want to keep him away from frogs. If he eats a frog he'll start rampaging and only care about eating more frogs and hurting you. This fact comes to play in the plot with various cut scenes that show there's more going on than it seems.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, the art style is pretty (I quite liked the landscape manipulation effects), the music is atmospheric and has an odd nostalgic quality to it, and the plotline is engaging. My only gripe is that it's a bit on the short side and a little too simple. Oh, I also wish the dedication made at the start of the game was made at the end of the game instead, and it was a little more subtle with its "plot twist". All in all I enjoyed the experience though, and feel it was a successful "arty" game that still managed to be fun.\n\nI strongly suggest avoiding trailers if you plan on playing it, so you can avoid spoilers.","August 13, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story hits all the right points, the music is always spot-on, and the platforming feels very nice. However, the puzzles aren't very challenging. At all. A kindergartener could figure them out. There are no invisible walls, which is good, but also leads to getting out of the map easily. Never to a point of breaking the game, it just feels awkward, if anything. I suggest this game completely. The good far outweighs the bad, and the bad is just nitpicking, honestly. Get this game.

It's a basic puzzle/platformer; it isn't too difficult skill-wise, nor will you likely get stumped by any of the puzzle elements. Mechanically it's actually a very easy game - even taking my time and messing up a bit here and there, I still finished it in less than 4 hours. Despite that, it was one of the most difficult games for me to complete on an emotional level.\n\nI really relate to the main character, Quico. What this game lacks in mechanical complexity it completely makes up for in emotional intensity and engagement. It will hit you right in the feels, over and over. It's not hard to tell that this was a very personal subject for the game's main creator, and I think he and the creative team tackled it very well. They have my utmost gratitude for making this game. Honestly, if anyone ever asks me about my relationship with my stepfather, rather than explain it to them with words I could just have them play this game. It definitely goes onto my favorites list, and although I can't say it's one I'll play again anytime soon, I'm very much grateful for the experience it brought me.","April 13, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this back to back with Portal 2 and at first I was a little disappointed with Papo & Yo's puzzles by comparison. As the game went on though I came to appreciate that Papo & Yo has different goals than Portal and as a result different puzzles. Papo & Yo, to me at least, is a metaphor for navigating family dynamics. Its goal is to put you in a child's shoes, to oscillate between the calm and terror of having an alcoholic father, not to offer arbitrary brain teasers.","June 17, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like a lot of indie games, it's meant to be experienced more than anything. But it's not really something that tries too hard to be overly deep and the symbolism is made pretty clear by the end. In fact, the second trailer pretty much spells it out for you before you play. The game draws inspiration from the creator's real life experiences with an alcoholic father. It's good, but you may want to take a pass if themes like alcholism and abuse are overwhelming to you.\n\nI'd rather not give away the ending, so I'll just say that if you want to see it, you'll have to play for yourself. I personally think it would be worth the $15, although I got it on sale. But since not everyone might agree with me, I'd say just get it on the next sale if you're not 100% sure. You might not feel like you're getting much out of it as a game. It's short and pretty simple.

The tone and art style gradually changes as the story progresses and grows darker.\n\nMost of the game involves using Papo to help you get around by lifting obsticals or tossing you to high ledges and then you need to manipulate the enviroment so Papo can follow.  There are also slugs that Papo really loves but cause him to go into a rage and attack anything near him including you.  Sometimes you need to keep him away from the slugs sometimes you need to let him eat them so you can solve a puzzle.  It's hear were your relationship with the monster begins to mirror your relationship with your abusive father.\n\nThe game does have some flaws.  its not the longest game, sometimes the physics are a little wonky and there could be a bit more variety in the game play but its not enough to be a deal breker\n\nThis is a fairly simple puzzle platformer with appealing visuals and does a good job of letting the narrative and charm bleed into the gameplay.

The monster likes bright orange coconuts and can be manipulated to go and stand at places that makes bright white magic happen.\n\nWhat's appealing about this experience is how this dream world is portrayed, and less so in how it functions.\nThe box city is vivid and playfully represented; cardboard boxes being picked up will make houses fly and move about to be placed in strategic places for our avatar to step on in order to progress.\nSome houses will grow legs and move like cockroaches, others grow wings and fly.\nI find these houses and what they mean to the main character more appealing than what the game tries to make me feel for the monster.\n\nThe monster is nothing but a tool for the main character to use in order to trigger bright white magic so that you can progress. I don't feel for the monster, and also with all this creative freedom that the kid has, why doesn't he make his way through without the monster? It means nothing to me as a player, there is no love.\nThe monster might just have been a ball and a chain locked to the kids foot.\nAnd then when the frogs enter the picture, making the monster go inte a fiery rage when he consumes them, the monster's tediousness just increases making me like it less.\nAnd liking it less would be fine if there just were some moment before that that established some kind of positive connection, but that never happens.\n\nIt would serve whatever narrative the game is trying to convey better if the monster was simply always there, following and being present without forcing me as a player to make it go places all the time.\n\nBut instead the game is tediously forcing the player to go through puzzles that after repetition loses what the game is trying to say about the relationship this kid has with the monster, the world, the girl, the robot and cardboard houses.\n\nThe movement felt when moving the character about is fluent and loose but comes to a chunky halt when the game demands you to yet again turn arbitrary levers in order to progress.\nOr to make the monster do more stuff for you. Again.\n\nI did enjoy what I played for the most part, with a little more thought put into what the puzzles could mean set to the context of what this boy is going through, it could've succeeded in saying something.\n\n'Papa & Yo' has heart and genuinely cares, but needs more thought on how to make the theme of the game correlate with the player's choices.","June 29, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At it's worst, it is very repetitive, frustrating and even boring. It also hosts a selection of glitches, that aren't that big of a deal, but do leave an unpolished impression.\n\nThe story had me intrigued at first, but lost me after a while because of it's slow progress. Also, it's really not well carried out tbh. I did however finish the game for I wanted to get to the predictable end. Seeing the credits scroll down on the screen didn't offer the satisfaction I thought it would, other than finally getting the game off my to-do list. It was a bit like finishing a mediocre book.\n\nStill, I won't advice to steer clear of the game. If you have the patience and are willing to forgive some annoyances (many that are due to budget) Papo & Yo delivers a different kind of gameplay experience that other game makers should learn from and improve on. It is good to see that more and more people like Vander Caballero (the creative director, who the story is based on) take the effort to get off their high horses at big game studios to go and discover their own path.","July 29, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics center around manipulating this setting in unexpected but mostly intuitive ways. The puzzles are not terribly challenging, but they're also not so easy that they become boring or tedious.\n\nThe real charm and heart of Papo & Yo is the story and the relationships between Quico, Lula, Alejandra, and Monster.

It's a really affecting story, about a real person's experiences dealing with an abusive parent. That's not something you see very often, and it's a really special experience. The gameplay doesn't always hold up as well as the story - most of the puzzles are reasonably easy, and don't always do as much as they could to establish the characters. But for the most part, it's very well done. An experience well worth having.\n\nThe following is all to do with stereo 3d support.\n\nIn terms of 3d, this game works really well with only a few minor problems. Probably less than 10 broken shaders in the whole game. You get great toyification effect with the depth and convergence tweaked, and while there are a few issues, they are all pretty minor and easily fixed. Convergence may seem locked at first, but you just need to hold the button down for 20s or so. Hopefully we can see some developer support on the couple of minor issues left. The problems are as follows:\n\nShadows must be set to low or very low. They do not render correctly on higher settings. Low setting gives "blob" shadows, very low turns them off. There is a brief cutscene fairly early on where you first become aware of Monster by seeing his shadow as he walks above you. Having shadows off kinda ruins that, but it's not a big issue anywhere else.\n\nInterface elements (prompts and speech bubbles) render at screen-depth. This isn't much of a problem, as there is no hud, speech is rare, and so are prompts.\n\nWorld detail must be set to medium. Anything higher and the depth-of field or fog effects cause serious halos. Not sure which effect is causing it, but medium and below disable it with no other noticeable quality loss.\n\nWhen Monster is in "angry" mode, his flames render differently for each eye, causing a flickering effect. Barely noticeable.\n\nWater shader has massive halos. Fortunately this game doesn't have much water.","April 19, 2013","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite short, the graphics are nice but they're not spectacular.\n\nOn the other hand it has an poignant very well told story though the ending is a little too blatant in that it just flat out states a lot of the subtext. That said the story is one of the best I've seen in a videogame, if not the best.

Papo & Yo will not only present you with interesting puzzles and fun gameplay, but also challenge you to look inward to the demons we all battle throughout life (and more importantly the places we go to escape them).\n\nThis is a game about a boy named Quico and his seemingly magical action figure Lula, as well as a giant - and normally docile - beast named Monster. As Quico, you will explore various facets of the dream-like favela he escapes to, where the laws of reality itself bend to the whim of one little boy.\n\nThe core gameplay focuses on solving environmental puzzles, many of which involve magic chalk-like drawings on the walls and floors of buildings that let you manipulate this strange and beautiful world in a variety of different ways. There is also some light platforming and some interesting mechanics which involve Lula, who straddles your backside like a knapsack and acts as a sort of jetpack that can also carry out some basic commands (such as flipping switches for you at a distance). Monster will also play a big part (no pun intended) in solving a lot of said puzzles and offers his own unique mechanics; when he is asleep his massive gut can be used as a trampoline of sorts and of course that brute strength of his also comes in handy! You have to be careful, however, as Monster also has an unhealthy addiction to poisonous frogs which cause him to burst into flames and go on a rampage!\n\nAll in all this is a refreshing take on 3D puzzle-platformers, that also reminds us just how beautiful and robust the Unreal Engine can still be when in the right hands.","December 20, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Papo & Yo.\n\nMy first attraction to the game came with its visuals. The bright, colorful design of the favelas instantly caught my attention in a market saturated by grays and sepias. It stood out, it was new, it was charming. I picked it up, played it for a short while, and then set it down for a week. This should not speak poorly for the game but, rather, for my lack of attention. It took a little bit to get started. But when it did get started, oh man. It got started.\n\nI have since finished the game, and I can now safely call it one of the most important games I have ever played. Not because of anything that it does in the gameplay that is new. The gameplay is only ever average, an affair of finding gears to push and plungers to pull. It has its difficulties - the frame rate will sometimes skip for no reason, and the platforming elements feel strange. Quico, the protagonist, has a strange weight to him, making jumping a bit of an unusual effort. The gameplay is the weakest part of this game.\n\nBut it is everywhere else that it shines. It can be terribly dazzling when it wants to be, offering a magically real landscape of favelas that twist and turn and defy gravity, and houses that walk on legs made of chalk, and an enormous pink monster with sun-cracked skin and a dangerous addiction to tropical frogs.\n\nAnd for every wonderful moment there is a counterpoint, a realization that this experience is inspired by Creative Director / Writer Vander Caballero's relationship with his alcoholic father. Later in the game Monster finally gets his hands on one of those irresistable little frogs, and gobbles it up. He is instantly wreathed in red flames, and he turns on you with a stomach-gnashing roar. Poor little Quico suddenly seems very small against the rampaging Monster, very fragile.\n\nThe story's focus is on Quico's quest to cure Monster. You go on a journey to find a shaman, aided by a mysterious girl and an endearing toy robot named Lula, and of course Monster. Sometimes things go quite well. Sometimes they go very wrong.\n\nThere are moments were Papo & Yo is absolutely childlike in its wonder.There are moments that are dark and threatening. And there are moments where you have to do things that are painful and liberating. This is a game of powerful, startling, painful moments, strung along to lure you deeper into its narrative.\n\nI feel Papo & Yo is best experienced in a single sitting. The puzzles never become inhibitingly difficult, and you can finish it in about 2 - 4 hours. Which, honestly, you should.\n\nIf you want to know more, read the reviews put out by Rock Paper Shotgun and the New York Times.","December 17, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The description makes the game sound like a bright, cheerful, Boy and His blob type game. It's not.\nWatch the launch trailer to get a better feel for what the game is about.\n\n*SPOILERS*\nI don't want to give too much away, but here's the jist:\nThe game is an intriguing and harsh look at alcoholism, anger, neglect, child abuse, and even murder, through the eyes of an innocent child who, being unable to understand these things, creates a fanciful world they can escape to and make sense of them in their own way.\nThe monster altogether ignores you throughout the experience, try as you might to interact with it, like a neglectful parent. When it's not ignoring you, it's eating or sleeping. It only pays you any attention when you have food, or when it is actively trying to harm you. Yes, it "helps" you solve puzzles and progress through the game, but you're not in anyway develping a friendship with the monster.\nThe world is breathtakingly beautiful, with some really innovative and engrossing level design. There's a lot of detail in the mystical favela landscape, and exploring it is equally as enjoyable as the controls are tight and responsive.\nThe game moves very fluidly with excellent pacing and hitting all the right emotional cues. The music is also top notch.\n\nOverall, this is a very polished game, and an excellent experience. The whimsical setting and levels juxtapose perfectly with the deeply emotional and dark subject matter. If I had any complaint, it's that the jumping is a little shoddy at times, and since the game has such an emphasis on platforming, that's a bigger deal than it should be. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience.\n\nDefinitely reccomend it to anyone who likes to play games with a good story, a lot of emotion, and a lot of layers. The fact that the controls are great and the graphics are fantastic is merely icing on this bittersweet yet delectable cake.\n\n9/10","December 18, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes on the main protagonist of Papo and delves into the true meaning of what the game is about. Its interesting as not many games are able to take on adult content such as this one and provide real impact especially one on an emotional level without just showing something in full blatant force. It feels like the game takes on adult themes in a very  subtle way which makes it more interesting as you play different parts of the game and wonder what each part truly means. The game is fairly short where I finished it in one day which feels really good as its not long enough to drag on and also shows the main focus which is a lot of story, puzzles and plat forming. For an indie game I didn't expect too much and so was pleasantly surprised to find out how great the game is. As a puzzle game its also quite interesting although can be quite simple at times. The best part of the simplicity of the puzzle is that it feels like you're always moving forward kind of like if you start a good run and you don't really want to stop. This creates a good flow to the game as I never felt that I had to just stop and think, or get annoyed and trying random things until something happened. I would definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you're looking for a fairly short and intriguing indie game.","January 12, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Different people will experience this game differently, if you want a game that is just about the action or puzzles, this might disappoint, but I found it to be an incredibly chilled out game, you can't die and the music is very well done, fitting the atmosphere without becoming repetative. The graphics on the trailer look really poor, but I was surprised by how nice it looked.\n\nWhen I finished the game I felt like it could have been longer with more puzzles, but at the same time, I played it through in one night and it was a cool little game that kept me entertained start to finish. In some ways, the fact that it's short makes it more enjoyable.\n\nIf you can get it on sale then I recommend it, it's very different and if you can think of it loosely like paying for a film, in this case a puzzle 'experience', then it's well worth ¬£8.\n\n","May 30, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its on a par with A Tale of Two Brothers, another meticulously crafted, emotional and beautiful adventure puzzler game.  I found both games evoked similar emotions when playing.   I'd rate TOTB as the greatest game I've ever played (from from all genres).  Its hard to explain why other than the powerful emotions it evoked.  This game nearly steals that title for the same reasons but not quite.   I would definately rate this as the most original game I've ever played. Worth every penny. Truly Stunning.  Basically you just have to play it!   Limbo and Machinarium, great as they are, have been bumped down the list.\n","May 11, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a really affecting story, about a real person's experiences dealing with an abusive parent. That's not something you see very often, and it's a really special experience. The gameplay doesn't always hold up as well as the story - most of the puzzles are reasonably easy, and don't always do as much as they could to establish the characters. But for the most part, it's very well done. An experience well worth having.\n\nThe following is all to do with stereo 3d support.\n\nIn terms of 3d, this game works really well with only a few minor problems. Probably less than 10 broken shaders in the whole game. You get great toyification effect with the depth and convergence tweaked, and while there are a few issues, they are all pretty minor and easily fixed. Convergence may seem locked at first, but you just need to hold the button down for 20s or so. Hopefully we can see some developer support on the couple of minor issues left. The problems are as follows:\n\nShadows must be set to low or very low. They do not render correctly on higher settings. Low setting gives "blob" shadows, very low turns them off. There is a brief cutscene fairly early on where you first become aware of Monster by seeing his shadow as he walks above you. Having shadows off kinda ruins that, but it's not a big issue anywhere else.\n\nInterface elements (prompts and speech bubbles) render at screen-depth. This isn't much of a problem, as there is no hud, speech is rare, and so are prompts.\n\nWorld detail must be set to medium. Anything higher and the depth-of field or fog effects cause serious halos. Not sure which effect is causing it, but medium and below disable it with no other noticeable quality loss.\n\nWhen Monster is in "angry" mode, his flames render differently for each eye, causing a flickering effect. Barely noticeable.\n\nWater shader has massive halos. Fortunately this game doesn't have much water.","April 19, 2013","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it's a pretty standard puzzle platformer, Papo & Yo is dealling with some pretty interesting concepts. The setting is some sort of South American chanty town outside of reality, and the main character has to navigate the world by manipulating the landscape, and through the assistance of his little robot friend Lula, as well as a large placid creature called Monster.\n\nThe "arty" aspect comes to play when trying to use Monster to get to new places. Monster has three priorities, sleeping, eating coconuts and eating frogs. You can wake him up and lure him to places you need him using coconuts, but you want to keep him away from frogs. If he eats a frog he'll start rampaging and only care about eating more frogs and hurting you. This fact comes to play in the plot with various cut scenes that show there's more going on than it seems.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, the art style is pretty (I quite liked the landscape manipulation effects), the music is atmospheric and has an odd nostalgic quality to it, and the plotline is engaging. My only gripe is that it's a bit on the short side and a little too simple. Oh, I also wish the dedication made at the start of the game was made at the end of the game instead, and it was a little more subtle with its "plot twist". All in all I enjoyed the experience though, and feel it was a successful "arty" game that still managed to be fun.\n\nI strongly suggest avoiding trailers if you plan on playing it, so you can avoid spoilers.","August 13, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's ok, however, because the real star of this game is the immersive experience of wandering through this fantastical favela, appreciating the colorful artwork, and dissecting the meaning and symbolism behind it all.\n\nI don't know if my interpretation behind some of the imagery was intended by the developers, but when a video game can rise to the level of having multiple interpretations, you know it's something special!  The shift from colorful and sunny to drab and rainy...  The graffiti so intentionally placed in each scene...  The act of moving great buildings and how it relates to both boyhood imagination as well as the main character's role in his troubled father's life...\n\nI experienced no bugs.  The visuals are stunning when using the highest graphical settings.  Look around, pause and enjoy the music, and take it in slowly to make the experience last.\n\nThe little gems of creativity, the perfect soundtrack, a story unheard of in the game industry, and the sense of wonder you feel as you explore this world simply cannot be missed by any gamer who believes that games can be art.","December 4, 2013","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzling and platforming is usually just this side of tedious.  Nevertheless I love this game as it's a perfect example of the interactive form being the correct choice for telling a particular story.  Fear, frustration, and the magical beliefs of a child thinking he can change what is through the few options available to him make for a near seamless intertwining of feeling, meaning, and gameplay.  There were times when I refused to do what the game asked of me; other times it gave me chills as I tried to process how I felt about what was happening.  The art and music are glorious.  Well worth the 3 hours it will take to play to completion.","September 2, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing that struck me about the game was the beautiful and changing landscape of the South American favela that is Quico's playground. The game mechanics center around manipulating this setting in unexpected but mostly intuitive ways. The puzzles are not terribly challenging, but they're also not so easy that they become boring or tedious.\n\nThe real charm and heart of Papo & Yo is the story and the relationships between Quico, Lula, Alejandra, and Monster. It's quite a short game, and the overarching metaphor is only thinly veiled, but the conclusion still left me stunned (and in need of an entire box of tissues). Papo & Yo is an example of how games have the power to do more than simply entertain.","July 15, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I HAD to review this.  A of hardcore gamer for over 30 years, this is the only one that warrents my time writing and promoting.  This game is beutiful.  It is really clever, artistic, imaginative, visually stunning, charming, wierd, warm, cold, gripping, mesmerising,  refreshing, and has a deep emotional story line like no other game before it  (or probably ever will ).  And on top of  this the gameplay is excellent,  the puzzles are clever, amusing and addictive.   A lot of care and thought has gone into this game.  Its a true escapist adventure.   Its on a par with A Tale of Two Brothers, another meticulously crafted, emotional and beautiful adventure puzzler game.  I found both games evoked similar emotions when playing.   I'd rate TOTB as the greatest game I've ever played (from from all genres).  Its hard to explain why other than the powerful emotions it evoked.  This game nearly steals that title for the same reasons but not quite.   I would definately rate this as the most original game I've ever played. Worth every penny. Truly Stunning.  Basically you just have to play it!   Limbo and Machinarium, great as they are, have been bumped down the list.\n","May 11, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't like jumping puzzles.  I especially don't like timing puzzles.  I'm not very good at any of those.  Because of that, I should not have liked this game.  But I did.  I liked this game a lot.\n\nThe gameplay was simple enough that I could play through it without getting seriously frustrated by my lack of skill; but still challenging enough not to be boring.   The puzzles that did not involve jumping and timing were very clever, but for the most part still logical and intuitive once you got into the flow of the game.  There were a few odd moments where the puzzles did not make a whole lot of sense, and I was force to rely on a walkthrough; but very few (unlike so many modern puzzle games, where randomness is used as a cheap and easy substitute for cleverness).  The mechanics of the game are very entertaining in themselves, particularly once Lulu is introduced.\n\nThe game design is beautiful; and the creators use of an uncommon setting was brilliant.  The third-world backdrop meshed very well with the fantastical elements; creating a seamless world with it's own unique and readily-identifiable logic.  The artwork is stunning, and the inclusion of works by actual environmental artists nothing short of amazing.  The similar use of third-world characters, rather than white Europeans or stereotypical fantasy creatures is similarly inspiring.  The music is beautiful, and in spots almost breathtaking, wonderfully blending traditional and orchestral sounds.  Atmospheric and fun at the same time.\n\nI would be hard pressed to find any flaws in the game.  If I did, I would say that parts of the ending felt a little out of place.  Some of the scenes and actions didn't make quite as much sense as they could have, and the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded; but that's still a fairly minor quibble.   The game is a bit shorter than most of its type; but too much longer and it would have started to drag.  The pacing never leave it feeling too long or too short.\n\nOne warning is that the background story that emerges from the game is disturbing, becoming increasingly so the closer it gets to the end.  This is ultimately a story of addiction and child abuse; and is accordingly dark and sad.  Fortunately, the writers do not beat the player over the head with moralizing; and manage to balance the darkness with a keen sense of human resilience.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.  I picked it up at a huge discount during one of Steam's big sales; but would can easily recommend getting it even at full price.","November 8, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be finished in about 3 hours, so the price tag is a little bit high if you pay full price.\n\nAnyway, the game is an environment based puzzle platformer with a story that both draws you in and screws with your mind. You think it's just a game that takes place inside a child's imagination, where everything is cheerful and happy, but it kinda isn't. I won't spoil it but by the end of the game, you realise that the environment the game takes place in actually reflects the rather  grim story. Definitely one to make you think.\n\nThe gameplay is quite inventive too. The environment itself pretty much bends (literally in some cases) to allow you to proceed. It is well and truly the product of a creative mind and the way you have to complete the puzzles may be simple in terms of what you have to do, but it sure as hell takes a level of thought sometimes. Thankfully, there are hint boxes for the more complex puzzles in the game. I did enjoy playing it.","January 15, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And if you'd leave the story-elements aside, Papo & Yo would be just that. The Gameplay is simple, the mechanics are easy and it is no challenge to beat the game. But Papo & Yo doesn't try to be challenging, it tries to tell a story. The story of a boy who escapes into his own imagination to seek shelter from his alcoholic father, the "monster" if you will. And in his imagination, still, he tries to "heal" the monster from its addiction to frogs.\nPapo & Yo tells this story in a metaphorical but so profound way, sometimes you just need to turn off the game and think about what just happened. As a game Papo & Yo is nothing special, but as a tool to express a story it is unique.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPS: The Soundtrack is superb.

Personally I'm glad I played it but if I hadn't got it on sale for ¬£8 my view might be different.\n\nIt's a very refreshing game, making a point while giving you some really cool puzzles. it tries to engage you in the 'story' and, for me, did this quite nicely with subtle metaphors and imagery. Different people will experience this game differently, if you want a game that is just about the action or puzzles, this might disappoint, but I found it to be an incredibly chilled out game, you can't die and the music is very well done, fitting the atmosphere without becoming repetative. The graphics on the trailer look really poor, but I was surprised by how nice it looked.\n\nWhen I finished the game I felt like it could have been longer with more puzzles, but at the same time, I played it through in one night and it was a cool little game that kept me entertained start to finish. In some ways, the fact that it's short makes it more enjoyable.\n\nIf you can get it on sale then I recommend it, it's very different and if you can think of it loosely like paying for a film, in this case a puzzle 'experience', then it's well worth ¬£8.\n\n","May 30, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
