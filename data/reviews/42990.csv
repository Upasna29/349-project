I considered this game to be the largest disappointment in 4X history since MOO3.\n\nAlso, be aware that there has been no updates since late 2013, which I think suggests that this game will not be getting any updates. From what I understand, the developers have no money to do so.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are some of the best ever seen for a 4X game, especially a space 1. The Mars 2 engine clearly was the centrepiece of their development.\n\n- They did try to make the game something other than a sequel with beefed up graphics and it does show. Certain aspects like the combat are now more sophisticated, with a damage "grid" and the concept of "critical hits" (very important). This is good.\n\n- If you've played SOTS 1, you'll know. There's a level of complexity here that you don't seen in other games, combining tactical and strategic combat. The problem is, a good deal of what made SOTS 1 outstanding is gone.\n\n- Game will run acceptably well on a low end system, despite the graphics. At time of this review, I am running this on a fairly high end system (overclocked 4.5 GHz CPU, an overclocked AMD r9 290, which as of 2014 is a fairly high end GPU, and an SSD).\n\n- Developers did make an effort to patch the majority of the issues and even offered a free DLC, the End of Flesh.\n\n- There was some effort to make the game modder friendly, but it appears to be incomplete.\n\nCons:\n- You still get crashes at times. Not often, certainly not as much as launch, but it still happens. Most bugs are gone, but you stilll sometimes get CTDs, so save often.\n\n- The UI at times is hard to use and sometimes lags, even on a high end overclocked rig (and yes, I have tested this rig extensively for stability in my CPU, GPU, and RAM overclocks). An SSD does help somewhat I find though. The bigger issue though is the way the UI was designed. I've worked before in computer programming.\n\nA good UI is one that requires as few clicks (or as few taps as possible for touch devices) to get things done. This UI seems to be the exact opposite. A long learning curve in and of itself is not a failure, but it must serve some purpose. I am unsure as to if the UI was left in this state due to lack of funds, or due to the design decisions made.\n\nAnother problem is that the game is very, very micro-intensive, particularly during late game. It's a much bigger issue than most 4X games.\n\n- The mission system is very controversial. I really, really hate it. It adds a layer of micro that makes managing large maps very hard, slows down the pace of the game without adding any depth, and causes other complexities. The problem is not so much that it added depth, it's that it did so without adding much to the gameplay itself. A huge step back from SOTS 1.\n\n- Certain features were poorly implemented or appear to be incomplete. For example, the private sector system was not very well done and adds micro problems at times. Given that there are no plans to patch this game, I fear that these features will remain this way. Another example of a feature that had to be axed was 64 bit (important I suppose for using more than 2Gb).\n\n- Autoresolve is in real time, so everything has to be played out in real time. Although imperfect, I would have liked an option to accelerate an autoresolve system.\n\n- There's a general lack of documentation with the game. You have to heavily rely on the wiki for information and to some extent the forums, although participation has since dropped since launch. I think that the wiki should be incorporated into the game somehow.\n\n- The AI is quite dumb I fear and at times, tends to mismanage their own empire into bankruptcy. Often times, what ends up happening is that you expand into the game and you encounter your first player, only to discover that they have really messed up empire management and will not be a challenge.\n\nIn effect, this means that multiplayer is the only real area for challenge.\n\n- Compounding the issue above, this game does seem to have issues with network connectivity. I am not sure why as other games seem to be stable. I have asked around and I am not the only person with these problems. I have also fairly extensively tested my network's speed, latency, and stability (works fine on other games).\n\n- Worsening the issue further, this game does not have a very large multiplayer base, so your opportunity to play online is at times, limited\n\n- Normally, I would not put this in a review, but I have found the attitude of the lead developer, Mecron to be highly unprofessional at times. Although I expect trollish behavior from some of the forum participators, it is completely inappropriate for the developer themselves to be acting in such a manner.\n\nThere's also a toxic atmosphere on the forums at times, where feedback, even constructive was not permitted and likely to be trolled. Essentially, I think what has happened is those who wanted to change the game for the better have been driven away by the cadre of people who believe the developers can do no wrong, and in effect you get this powerful "groupthink" mentality going on.\n\nPeople who recommend changes at times are attacked and portrayed as "too stupid to understand why this game is a masterpiece". I will admit the conduct of some of the feedback has been less than admirable. But at the same time, the conduct of those very loyal to this title has also been less than admirable. The critics though have recieved a disproportionate amount of the moderation.\n\n\nRecommendations: (Unlikely to be implemented due to the fact that this game is not getting patched and for reasons I have indicated above):\n\n- Give the player the option at the start of the game to go for a mission or a SOTS 1 system. I suspect the overwhelming majority of gamers will opt for the SOTS 1 system, save for a very vocal minority.\n\n- I get the impression that the developers did not understand why their first game, SOTS 1 was so successful. It was successful because it was intuitive, easy to play, had a reasonably good UI, but at the same time, a great deal of depth, particularly by the time AMOC and ANY was released.\n\n- Separate the tactical combat into something like Gratitious Space Battles from the strategic portion of the game and let people play "Total War-style multiplayer". This will probably make for a much more engaging game in multiplayer, allowing for shorter combat sessions to take place.\n\n\nConcluding remarks:\nThe biggest problem of this game, apart from the stability issues and the poor AI, is the fact that it was not fun to play for a very large percentage of the SOTS1 fanbase. As I indicated above, I think there's a total ignorance of what made SOTS 1 so well recieved.\n\nThe development team appears quite frustrated that their fundraising campaigns (they made a few additional efforts to raise money for development) have not been successful, but the issue I see is that they have demonstrated why they are worth additional funding to the majority. There has been a very hostile atmosphere towards feedback and an unwillingness to admit that certain problems exist, much less any indication that they will be addressed.\n\nComplexity in and of itself is not a problem. Neither is a very long learning curve. But the issue is that in this case, complexity never had anything to offer save in tactical combat. It feels like complexity at times was made ... for the sake of complexity. That in many ways detracted from the game experience.\n\nIt's very painful for me to have to write this review like this. I really wanted to like this game. I can even see how this game could have evolved into one of the most awesome 4X games ever. But it's clear that in its current form, this game is the largest disappointment since MOO3 in the world of 4X gaming.","August 24, 2014","false","94.8"," 355 of 372 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","355","372","3","5"

It's a shame because it would have been brilliant. currently, it's far from that.\nThis should have been the most complex, enjoyable and best looking 4X Game in a decade. Tactical real-time space combat! Deep lore! 3D star map!\n\nThen: Sword of the Stars II release...and it proved to be an unfinished, lacking kinda good-looking buglagcrashdesaster.\n\nSo, devs bowed their heads deeply to the ground and apologized. They promised to mend what was broken and to implement what was missing. To fix this mess. In the end all would be good. Fairy tale and all.\n\nI did believe them. They still had a large fanbase behind them that astonishingly enough held motly together and encouraged other people to buy this game, because Kerberos where devs to be trusted. They would do the job, finally. They must!\n\nTruth be told, I'm a cautious guy. I read the bad reviews. I read through the forums. No one said Sots II were a good game at this point. But it was highly promising So I decided to trust the devs. I bought the game, despite the state it was in. I knew this one would be finished. One day. I had time to wait.\n\nI played.  A lot.\nDid I enjoy this game? Yes, for some hours after mastering the steep learning curve. That's the good part.\n\nHonestly, I enjoyed a lot of the content. It still looks good for a 4X, sep. tactical combat. there's a feeling of scale watching your titans blowing puny Pirates out of the sky. There's a deep and meaningful lore behind the universe. A full 3D Star map. Very diverse species. Interesting tech tree with feasability studies, boost options and a chance to be stuck on projects, forcing the player to make choices and think ahead.\n\nBut...the whole game still feels dead. There IS no Immersion. the sound track is horrible. Despite being a 3d map, the star map is pretty ugly, most off all nebulas and gas clouds. Low res sky boxes. Why?\nThen the realproblems started kicking in: UI design is horrible, AI is horrible (massive starvation and recession on all its planets...ouch), all-out-war "diplomacy", game still lags horribly. It crashes,  freezes, bugs out. A lot. And...there's still stuff missing after all those years!\n\nI really tried to love this game. I just...can't. I can admire the original concept, the lore, the art-work. Sadly, it didn't work out well.\n\nSituation today: Last update to this game is years back. Sots II is left to rot. It's really rather tragic then annoying. Kerberos just couldn't pull off this one and condemned themselves to work on tiny hand-held casual stuff instead. What a waste.","July 12, 2015","false","158.6"," 222 of 228 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","222","228","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZlothX/recommended/42990/","ZlothX","Zloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZlothX/","116 products in account","Recommended for the hardcore 4X fan only.\n\nThis game had THE worst launch I've ever seen (and I was there for Anarchy Online's launch).  When this came out, nothing worked.  Even the game option menus were disabled!  It was a total and absolute rip-off where completing a game was downright impossible.  But the developers worked HARD on the game after launch and have gotten this game on its feet.\n\nThis is the most detailed 4X game I've ever played.  The star map is actually 3D and when battles happen you don't just roll some dice, you actually play the battles out in an RTS-style interface.  Ship customization is done by picking from different section types then selecting weapons and special equipment for those sections.  There's a pretty vast selection of equipment to pick from, too.\n\nThe big controversial part of this game for me is the mission system.  When you tell a fleet to go do something (scout, patrol, whatever) in most games the fleet will go, do whatever it's supposed to do, and stay there.  In SotS2, the fleet will go out, do whatever it's supposed to do for a few turns, then return home.  You can change where 'home' is for a fleet but you can't select unpopulated planets for that.  On the one hand, this makes sense to me.  There are only so many peanut butter sandwiches you can store on a ship so it makes sense that they need to come back and restock.  On the other hand, it slows the pace of the game down and adds complexity.  I still can't decide if the extra realism is worth it.\n\nThe most enjoyable feature of the old SotS game is, IMHO, the variety in races and that translates over to SotS 2 just fine.  You can't make custom races but each race is VERY different than the others.  The method of propulsion is different, technology strenghts and weaknesses are different, some races can mount more weapons than others, and so on.  When you get right down to it, switching between the Liir and the Humans in this game will give you much more different gameplay than building a custom race in most games.\n\nSo I recommend the game but only to the serious 4X enthusiasts looking for a lot of depth.  If you're new the genre then you should probably stick with Civilization or Endless Space.  If you come out of those games wanting a lot more detail then this might be your game.\n\nP.S.  Star Fleet Battles fans - you'll find your swordfish drones and plasma shotguns waiting for you.

When you finally get there it may also crash.\n\nThere are a lot of amazing ideas here, but they're not explained very well, tend to lead to opaque mechanics that have invisible causes and effects, and generally it's impossible to recommend... but you can see the shadow of a truly amazing game that just didn't quite make it, if you like exploring such a thing.\n\nIt also looks very pretty.  If you can cope with reduced graphics and not nearly as much innovative reach in exchange for understandable mechanics which actually work, you should play Sword of the Stars 1 - it is well polished and still the best space 4X I've played.","November 2, 2014","false","192.8"," 110 of 126 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","110","126","4","8"

I've logged hundreds of hours playing SotS1, pre-purchased this game, waited several months for patches and fixes, and the game is still a disappointment. Clunky, confusing (but beautiful) gameplay; consistent, early-game crashes-to-desktop; missing content... it's been dozens of months since initial release, and SotS2 is still incomplete.\n\nThe game still feels mostly unplayable, and the parts that feel complete, in my opinion, feel tedious instead of fun. I've given the game a chance, put over a 150 hours into playing the game, and I just can't find it worthwhile.\n\nI'd love to see a return to the spirit of the SotS1, and I fully recommend getting Sword of the Stars: Complete Collection if you're a fan of 4x games (or strategy games, in general).

It gobbles down memory and then leaks it back out in a hundred places.  As we all know it was released unfinished.  Now, years later, it is still not finished and clearly never will be.\n\nThe saddest thing is that even if all of these problems were fixed it still wouldn't be a good game.  Clunky interface, a UI that is more concerned with neon than functionality, and a plethora of just plain bad design decisions make you wonder how the same people who created the masterpiece that was the original Sword of the Stars could live with themselves after putting their names on this overpriced disaster.\n\nYou can forget about balance anywhere.  Races, ships, technology, pirates, the economy - everything in this is completely out of alignment in some way or another.  Tutorials?  What are those?  The manual seems to have been written for a different game and is more concerned with giving background fiction than any usuable information.\n\nWorst of all is that somehow, despite all the shiny new graphics and toys, they've made combat both look and play worse than the original (which was actually very good, by the way).\n\nMetaphorically speaking, SotS2 is someone looking at a sports car that was SotS1 and saying "You know what this thing needs?  A piano tied to the roof!  Yeah!  And we'll save weight by removing one of the tires!"\n\nNote that in sharp contrast the original SotS1 is a very good game, and I advise anyone considering this one to go buy that far superior product instead.  You won't regret SotS1.  You will regret this one, however.","November 6, 2014","false","100.2"," 120 of 145 people (83%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","83","120","145","36","2"

Sort of.\nI bought this at a steep discount years ago (less than 10 bucks), and have alternately loved and hated it ever since.\nThe game was originally released in a mid-alpha state, resulting in a lot of the rage evidenced  in some reviews.  After a free expansion, about 50 mid-sized patches and over a hundred micro-patches, what you have is basically a game in permanent mid-beta.\n\nMost of what could be fixed without a complete redesign has been. What remains is an extremely time-consuming, mostly rewarding game that will occasionally infuriate you.\n\nPut simply, the Mars2 engine is a paper tiger; anyone who's seen videos of a North Korean Parade knows what I'm talking about here. Yes, it can display some very pretty and entertaining visuals and doesn't do too badly handling most of the  strategic- or combat- layer graphics that make the game fun. No, it simply cannot handle the dataload imposed upon it by an eight-player game.\n\nSotS 2's real saving grace is that it is extremely easy to mod, tweak, break, or bend to suit your gaming style. All you need is a basic grasp of English, some logical thinking skills, and a text editor. Most of the .entity, .section, etc. files are simple xml-coded text files. A free sqlite database editor will allow you to change almost anything in your saved games, too. Want to research everything? about 15 mins. with the .techtree file and my bugs -and bugs only- can play with every tech that matters to a bug (and some that don't). *Spoiler* This and some creative finacing gets me every tech in about 250 turns.\n\nThe bad news: This game is never getting finished, is a resource hog, and crashes whenever it bites off more than it can chew. The multiple redundant autosaves are a lifesaver, but getting past some turn-to-turn crashes will require you to figure out which event was the straw that broke the engine's back. If we want this game to work perfectly, we'll have to redesign it ourselves, XML is easy to edit, but extremely wasteful coding (Micro soft-in-the-head designed xml). If Kerberos had gone with a more machine-centric scripting language, This game would be an all-time bestseller but would be much harder to mod.\n\nTech Specs:\nYou don't need a datashredder to play this game well (at least as well as it can be played). gen 3 core i3's in quad-core mode, or fm2-based quad cores are probably okay on data processing here, Sots2 cannot fully utilize 6 or 8 cores, so your best bets are a decent i5 or i7 from Intel (not necesessarily new), Kaveri-based quad core, or Vishera based CPU from AMD. My FX-8350 occasionally reaches 20% load, but I've modded the heck out of most game files to make battles more exciting. My A10-4600 laptop can run the vanilla game well.\n\nMy old GTX 480 video card is overkill for the vanilla game at 1920x1080 with max detail, but I sometimes get a little hitching with all the extra ships and weapons I've modded into some battles.  Integrated video on an Intel chip won't get you anywhere, but the mid-range gaming qualites of an A10 laptop iGPU or A8 desktop iGPU is okay if you have extra RAM -see next-\n\nMemory!!! This is why you must have 64-bit windows. Don't have 8gb? Don't bother!. Between the poor engine choice, the leaky and ineffecient coding, and the sheer amount of data that needs to be crunched, this game eats memory fast. At turn 200 on a medium-large map with 4 of 5 players still alive and about half the map occupied, I'm using 20% of the 32gb of DDR3 in my desktop. My modding has a role to play there, but years of trial and error have shown me that 8-player games are simply not practical on nearly any machine with this game engine, and 6-player matches  require a custom computer with about $1k worth of parts in them. An 8gb computer with dedicated graphics can run Vanilla okay most of the time with 2-4 players.\n\nThe Bottom Line-\nIs this an extremely time-consuming game? Yes! -though it's really not as bad as 90% of mmos- Is Sots 2 often frustrating? Yes!  Is it rewarding to play for 3 days, get to turn 220 and take a huge nap? Yes!! Is all of this really worth the hassle and a sizeable chunk of money? Probably not for 70% of  gamers who like consoles even a little. This is a great game for guys like me who've been gaming on semi-high-end computers since the late 90's. Getting the game into the state I have it in now is like owning the Millennium Falcon: You spend a lot of time now and then figuring out what's wrong with your mod, or if it's even your fault or the devs. You put some real effort into understanding and modifying this rustbucket of a game, have a lot of fun and get really frustrated when you spend an hour getting your empire just where you want it for turn 221 and it crashes just before you get around to saving. (Think Escape from Hoth in episode 5 here).  The real fun is taking a mostly functional scrapheap of a YT-1300 and trying to make it really fly (metaphorically speaking). Actual gameplay is a little better than the reality of war: Most of what you do during a turn isn't all that exciting, but it's pretty wild when space-lizards, telepathic dolphins and rat slavemasters all decide they want to cook you in your chitin just before you get the chance to nuke their homeworlds.   Thanks for reading my super-long post. I think it says something that I recommend this game to at least some people right after the metaphorical Falcon decided not to enter hyperspace with Rat Vader coming for me. (seriously, I stayed up all night playing with this thing only to have it crash around noon. 4hours later I've just finished typing a recommendation) :)","March 4, 2015","true","555.6"," 88 of 99 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","88","99","12","0"

Just beware of the devs and fanboys.\n\nSword of the Stars II is a 4X strategy game with turn-based empire management and fleet movement coupled with visually stunning real-time space combat with ships that you, the player, can design. Now, when I say design, I don't mean you determine the length and silhouette and window placement or any of that. When designing a ship you pick three sections (in game described as a Command [front] Mission [middle] and Engine [back] section). Once you have selected your sections you can place weapons of varying size and modules which provide bonuses like extra crew, increased range, and much more.\n\nBut what about the factions? Well there are 7, the Humans, Hivers (insect like), Tarkasians (reptilian), Morrigi (avian/bird), Liir-Zuul Alliance (Liir are dolphin/whale like while the Zuul are genetically modified slavers that are difficult to define), Suul'ka Horde (Suul'ka are giant telepathic terrors of war that are allied with some more extreme Zuul) and the Loa (Artificially Intelligent race). Most of the factions have a very distinct system of faster than light travel (Morrigi, Tarka and Liir are all very similar with only minor differences) and each race has its own technological advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe Tech Tree is randomly generated each game and most techs require you to perform a "Feasibility Study" during which you spend a few turns determining how likely you will be in achieving a certain tech. This is where alot of the faction specific technological advantages come into play (for example the Morrigi have a better chance of getting high end energy weapon techs than the Tarkasians). This "Feasibility Study" is a very divisive topic, however, I personally enjoy it as it means that you can't start a game and know that you don't have Shield techs despite playing as the Liir (the Liir have the best Shield tech chance, however, this still happened to me). This means that each game has an element of unpredictability that is maintained into the late-game whereas a simple tech tree where you could see all your paths would mean that at turn 1 you could plan your entire game.\n\nFleet Movement is also a divisive topic as ships cannot be moved unless they are in fleets with a dedicated command ship. I have personally had no issues with this system. You make a fleet and can then right click on a target, decide what to do and then select the desired fleet that is in range. Or, you can right click a fleet, select a desired action and then select a world in range.\n\nDiplomacy, unfortunately, is essentially non-existent. The AI behaves erratically and while it may accept a peace treaty on one turn it may declare war on you the very next turn. I always wanted to rule the galaxy alone anyways but it is still a major eyesore on the game.\n\nFinally, support for the game has, for all intents and purposes, ceased. The developers (which can be/are extremely difficult/stubborn) released a patch in August of 2014, however, there were no patch notes released and any comments on the patch were disregarded by the devs. As a result I cannot confirm or deny any of the findings, however, it is my suspicion that the AI was made more aggressive and everything else remained as it was before. But many people (fanboys?) will say that turn times are shorter and menus come up quicker and their cat came back from the dead after that "non-patch" as the devs deny any patch taking place.\n\nSo if you are looking for a grand strategy game with real-time space battles, stunning visuals, a handful of unique races and a learning curve that provides a sense of accomplishment then I recommend you give this game a try. It's come a long way from the opening day launch disaster.","October 15, 2014","true","296.0"," 74 of 100 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","74","100","0","0"

It was incredible, and every expansion just became more in-depth. Backstory, artwork, tech trees... load of fun, gorgeous, and engrossing.  It made me want to support this company in any way I could; even the spin-off The Pit is fun and cute while being challenging and demanding.\n\nThis...  I just can't get into it.  I tried, I really did. I even came in after the bugs were fixed and enhanced was out, because the world-building and story here is just so engaging.  But... the magic feels like it was gone in the gameplay.\nEverything is more complicated, micromanaging lots and lots of small space stations is now a core gameplay element. And now, half the tactics that were interesting in the old game are impossible (like parking Deep Scan picket ships in deep space to watch for approaching fleets). You can't send lone scouts anymore, you have to create a scouting mission first, make a fleet, maybe assign an admiral, and put a half dozen ships together. Some of those ideas (like automating missions and adding admirals) would have been INCREDIBLY interesting, and a great addition to another expansion of the first game (like how trade was expanded in aMoC), but now you're shoehorned into it, and the tense early game with a few lonely destroyers playing cat & mouse in uncharted space with unknown enemies is gone.

You have the campaign map where you buy ships, order fleets onto missions, and generally have a nice 4X time. When you encounter another player -> zoom into the tactical map for real time action.\n\nThe campaign map is beautiful, each faction gets a different movement mechanic from the standard warp drive of one race to instatanious gates and node lines of others. You really feel like a unique race not a re-skin. This keeps up with the ship designs, some races are hulking great beasts, slow and powerful, others are quick and fragile. Humans for instance have decent all-rounder ships, slightly less well armed than average but fast over the strategic map, unfortunately the drive section is very fragile and can strand your ships far from home.\n\nDid I mention that? Yeah your ships are distructable in nice modular chunks, from individual turrets to command/mission/drive sections. Add to that a 4-facing armour matrix, shields that are very well balanced IMO, weapons that all have a use (though you will rely on a few favourites if you don't have a special need), and the tactical combat will keep you entertained alone.\n\nTHE BAD:\nIt's shonky, no two ways about it. The campaign UI is a bit slow to respond, after about 200 turns it takes quite a while for the calculations to play out and ocationally crashes (but that has got much better since release, in fact no crashes for ~ 3 months). Sometimes stuff doesn't update or doesn't work for no particular reason, and last but not least: THERE IS NO IN GAME WAY TO LEARN.\n\nYes that annoys me, you spend countless man-hours making a great combat game with a slightly shonky campaign layer and don't tell anyone how to use it. Thankfully the community has stepped up to the challenge and fixed this, creating beginners guides and guides on individual races (start with the Tarka, they are the most straight forward - or Hiver if you like to turtle). The guides are good, use them.\n\nAnother area that needs attention is the AI, it's pretty bonkers. It will declare war on your massive empire and send colony ships to bombard your planets which get killed straight away by planetary missiles (did I mention missiles, yeah there are missiles, and point defence for your ships, and weapons platforms... I like the tech). It will also be bestest mates with you but be mildly miffed you "stole that tasty planet near me" for 100 turns and then declare a holy war to wipe the stain of your civilization from the galaxy with 10 Leviathan class ships when all you wanted to do was trade with everyone and be a mecantile hippy empire (still sore about that).\n\nWhen the campaign AI works it can be pretty impressive, I think it managed to plan an invasion once and pulled it off simultaniously against me and two other AI. That invasion was let down by the tactical AI (better but not exactly Sun Tzu) and a wall of torpedo platforms.\n\nTHE UGLY:\nThree words, randomised tech tree. Some people hate it, some love it. I am in the second camp. But, I also loved the randomised discovery in Alpha Centuari (I don't care if it's not balanced, that's how science works guys, sometimes you miss a really obvious idea). Certain techs are always available, like cutting lasers, and dreadnought ships. Others, well, it's the luck of the draw. The Zuul are having an energy weapon bonanza and enslaving your planets? If you're lucky just research the "♥♥♥♥ you energy weapons" shield (only covers the front, not quite as OP as at first sight). If you're not lucky, well hopefully the cash you save in equipping that shield will let you build more ships and the Zuul run out of light to put in their lasers. It's about rolling with the punches, but it is pretty galling when those punches are a fleet of heavy phaser drones and your stuck with the crappiest point defence. It's also pretty horrible when your home planet gets glassed 10 turns in by a ghost ship.\n\nYeah, ghost ship I hate the ghost ship. Like a '90s RPG you are subjected to random encounters (I think they are not completely random but it feels like it). This mechanic is at the same time absolutely horrible and absolutely brilliant. It's horrible when 10 turns in, your economy is trashed by a giant wandering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (built by the humans and then lost forever to wander the stars... the lore is actually pretty cool). It's brilliant when your struggling colony, with only that admiral you should retire because he got the shakes (yeah your admirals have stats, some are mass murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, some just like to grow flowers) - but can't quite let go because he won that battle that one time - and a couple of second rate ships for support, is being slowly worn down by slaver attacks. Admiral shaky holds his battered squadron together while the new guy from the academy is bringing reenforcements in the form of the newest (and cheapest) system defence craft.\n\nThe random encounters make you feel like starfleet command, an ancient derelict in one system, a hive of wasp-like silicon lifeforms in another, colony alpha-nine has an incoming metor shower. More variety would make it perfect, an option to turn off mr ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost ship would be sublime.\n\nTHE SHOWDOWN:\nWould I recommend this? Yes I would. Mostly because it deserves to do well. It improves on everything SOTS1 fell down on and expanded what it did well. It's not perfect by any means but it has ambition that alot of sequels lack. Paradox could have played it safe, they could have updated SOTS1, make a few fixes to the dodgy bits and called it a day. They didn't. They fixed the broken stuff and then said "You know what would be cool? Building science stations to observe pre-FTL aliens. Letting players build Bablyon 5. Treaties that real civilisations would make (re-create the treaty of Farixen). A ship that shoots asteroids at planets (actually in the first one but it's really cool)". Like I said some of it doesn't work, the science stations are better suited to sitting behind your lines researching important things, from what I can tell Bablyon 5 doesn't do much, the AI won't make interesting limitation treaties with me, but the asteroid gun is great.\n\nThe tactical combat is the best bit, the strategic map feels like a way to move ships to make fun battles happen. I really wish Paradox would release a single player campaign about a lost human exploration fleet, a load of linked missions with persistent officers who learned? Excellent. In the mean time, admiral shaky has some slavers to kill.","February 16, 2015","true","141.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","33","40","7","1"

I'm kind of weird in the fact that buggy games don't bother me too much, and I have a lot of patience for unfinished games or games with unrealized potential.  I also have to restart the game every few hours if I'm doing a long play session because of memory leaks, and I have 24 Gigs of RAM.  This game's a technical nightmare, and isn't receiving support from the publisher anymore.  The developer still exists, but is hanging on by a thread.\n\nI recommend, if you're even interested in this game, to check out the first game.  It is easier to learn, and very stable.  It would be awesome to see this game finished, but it won't happen anytime soon, if at all.\n\nI think one of the biggest tragedies of this game is simply the lore and the story.  This game has no campaign, only custom scenarios, like most other 4x games.  The game includes what's called a Sotspedia that's more in depth about things than other comparitve things like Mass Effect's codex.  The lore behind the major factions/races is inredibly deep.  In fact, I own a book that takes place in this universe.\n\nThis is also evident in how each faction/race has not just their own strengths and weaknesses, but they have completely different methods of FTL travel, which has a huge impact on the gameplay.  Things from the Tarka's standard warp drive, the Hiver's gate network for instant teleportation once they slowboat it to new systems and set up a gate, to the Liir's stutterwarp drives, using thousands of teleportations a second to move, increasing in speed the further away from gravity wells they get.  They're all pretty interesting.  And there's 7 of these factions.\n\nBut, again, I cannot recommend this game unless you're hardcore into this genre, and want to find what is, perhaps, both a hidden, yet flawed and tarnished gem.  I love this game so much, but I cannot just tell people to check it out.  I want them to consider this game, while informed.\n\nIf you're at all interested, I recommend checking out the wiki.

It may not work on some systems and it will require you to spend quite a bit of time messing with setting on your own system to keep it stable.\n\nThat warning being said, it is one of the best and most immersive 4x games I have ever played and unfortuantly probably ever will. This game's strengths lie in its nitch. If you like customization, detail and long term and large scale planning this game will scratch you just right. Here are the features which wowed me. Massive research tech trees, which improve and change the way you play, build ships, colonize and dominate. Arguably the games strongest feature is the modular ship system. Ships come in three scales, and each set allows for moduals of its basic parts, improvments from addons; to extra power generators, extra crew, more armor, better structural integrity etc.  If you like heavily customizing nearly every detail of your modular ships from replacing small cannon turrets to Point defence turrets (or anything inbetween) you'll like that.\n\nThe major aspect of this game which stands out to its peers? Meaningful Real time combat. Heavily tacticle, great graphics and impressive physics. Few things made me as giddy as watching one of my carrior ships launch dozens of fighter craft to swarm enemy supply ships. Or building a massive missle fleet dedicated to long range warfare of overwhelming the enemy defenses with missles barrages. Watch some youtube videos of its combat and you'll be stunned how well this game does it.\n\nUnfortuantly, this game as much as I love it. Is awful. LIttle to no tutorials; you'll need to rely heavily on trial and error and online guides and refrences. I fully didn't know what the heck I was doing until maybe twentyfive hours or so of game time.\n\nGame is unstable: keep to maps small and the amount of factions smaller. Turning on some features of the game such as a high amount of random encounters will simply make the game crash every couple of turns. There are known memory leaks and if you don't have a beefy computer you may have to close and reload the game after a couple hours to improve performance.\n\nElements of the game are just not there. The diplomacy is effectivly non-existant. You can do basic things such as, spy, ask for help/money and sue for peace and declare war and trade. It works as in it does just that and nothing else. All AI unless team setup at the beginning of the scenarios settings will eventually declare war on you and attack.\nSeveral factions are missing units or don't have fully implamented technologies.\nAI is weird: sometimes it is surpfisingly clever or even overwhelming. Other times its cripplingly dumb and easily beaten.\n\nMutiplayer is quagmire. Sometimes it works perfectly and some of my buddies and I will play a four hour sessions without one of us crashing or getting any bugs and we love it. Many times, we are unable to even connect to the host lobby: sometimes it simply does not appear, other times there are connection issues, some of us can see and or join the game while others can't. Weird problems like that. Luckily the game has save game for multiplayer and allows everyone to rejoin in case of crash or just done for the session.\n\nIn conclusion, this game had so much potential to be the best 4x hardcore game ever made. What is sadder still; in m any regards it actually is. The amount of detail and depth to this game is unparralled. So many factors and elements and so many diffrent ways to play and truely varied factions makes this game's ambition without equal. It is the only 4x game with an advanced combat engine which is both excellent in graphics and in gameplay. Ship designing, empire building and tech research are supurbly well done and will draw out the micro and macro manager of you. Unfortuanlty it was also never finished and severly suffers from its unfinished grand vision and pelthora of bugs, some being game breaking. Lacking core features such as diplomacy and scenarios (outside of open ended), I cannot recommed this game to the average player. If you are like me and actually like detail oriented games, grand strategy and tactics games, and with some patience, you may just find a gem here.","December 29, 2015","true","257.3"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","25","35","3","0"

However, it is still inferior to its predecessor. Much of the core game mechanics have become unnecessarily overcomplicated in an attempt to “deepen” gameplay. Fleet management is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and fighting across an entire solar system, while sounding cool in concept is very tedious in practice. What this game does have going for it though is space battles actually do look really cool. Watching neon lasers and missiles fly about especially between the bigger ships is quite satisfying. But of course pretty graphics doesn’t make the game. Gameplay does and for that purpose you should just stick with Sword of the Stars I. However, I would like to emphasize that Sword of the Stars II is not a BAD game in of itself. There are many other, far worse, strategy games out there and SoTS II is in fact about average. It’s just the fact that as a player and fan of the first game, the flaws are just that much more glaring and painful seeing an already proven formula get bogged down with some rather nonsensical mechanics and changes.","November 27, 2013","false","55.4"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","29","43","0","1"

The game was eventually brought into a playable state and some more content was added.Thus resulted the game we have today: Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Edition.I like complicated games.In general, the more complicated the mechanics are, the more involved I get.Paradox in particular is known for putting out these sorts of mega-games, where the learning curve is tougher than quantum physics and just playing the game is an accomplishment.The point of complexity, however, is to provide the player with meaningful decisions appropriate to their position in the game.SotS2 is a failure at almost every level in terms of making complexity fun. One can play this game for hours and simply have no idea what is going on.In a game like this your decisions should be meaningful.You should know you are making a decision, be clearly presented with all the relevant information, know what your options are, and understand how your decision will impact the game.SotS2 ruins any possibility of making meaningful decisions by completely confusing the player.It's hard to tell when a decision is being made in the first place.To a large extent this is synergistic with another problem: there are so many decisions to be made that it unclear when you are making an important decision and when you're not.The tech tree itself is misleading. Every game you get a different selection of techs, and even among those certain (random) techs will not be available to research this game.There are some very questionable design choices that make just playing the game a pain.The 3D star map is confusing and misleading.The distances between systems are difficult to determine.Rotating the display around to get a better idea of things is headache-inducing and leaves the player lost. Star maps should just stick to being 2D until 3D displays work.Is there anything good about this game?Well, the ships look cool.And the backstory is awesome.When I read the background material and skimmed the intro material this looked like such a cool game.I really, really wanted this to be good. In summary, Sword of the Stars 2: Enhanced Edition is a confused, sprawling mess of a game. The user will spend most their time confusedly clicking on buttons.

The fleet command interface is strange compared to the original SotS but once you get used to it it is quite reasonable.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game (besides some minor interface quirks) is the AI. As other people have complained, the AI has a tendency to just camp around its homeworlds for the entire game. But this, however, does not mean that the AI will be sedantary.

Something so devoid of functionality and entertainment it could only be called a game by the strictest legal definition. However I withheld my judgement and after an eternity away and countless patches here it is.\n\nPros:\n\nIn spite of its many flaws theres still some good to be found in this game. It was incredibly ambitious and attempted to expand upon its predecessor in every possible facet and had they done it correctly it would easily have revolutionized the genre. True to its predecessor you have several unique races that all certainly handle and feel different with plenty of customization in ship design far exceeding what was available in #1 with the addition of battleriders, psychic abilities, modules, new weapon mounts and ammunitions as well as commanders with their own traits and abilities it truly goes above and beyond as far as being able to micromanage your armies and strategy to perfection. The game is also pretty, for its genre, some people have managed to make some pretty sexy screenshots though its certainly not the game (or genres) selling point. Unfortunately this is about all they managed to get right.\n\nCons:\n\nFor starters, at launch it was buggy beyond all reason, to the games credit it seems to be all fixed now, I have not had even a single crash or bug in months, but your experience may (and probably will) differ. Along with all the cool new stuff added they also created a ton of needless, tedious addition, and draped it all in one of the most time consuming interfaces on the planet. Getting anything, even the simplest of things done in this game seems to take a minimum of 3 menus and at least 12 clicks. It's just insane. Combined with the new basing constraint on fleets and the 'mission' system which adds further unnecessary clicks and forces you're fleets to  return home for no real reason after literally every action they take is beyond monotonous. There's also the prototyping which is an abortion, costing tons of money and countless turns to redesign a ship from having a mass driver to a plasma cannon needs triple the time and all my money, even though I already have other ships using the plasma cannon. You can be an all intelligent dolphin thats mastered the art of space travel, can drop a plague on a planet turning all your enemies into zombies, and turn your opponents head into a blood pumpkin with your mind, but you're too friggin dumb to understand modular construction techniques. Lastly the game is just terribly optimized requiring a far more powerful machine than it should to run properly and even then at some point your still going to suffer massive slowdowns at countless load screens and menu transitions.\n\nOverall this game had tremendous potential but it just fails terribly at living up to its own ambition. It's like wiping with sandpaper. Sure it might get the job done, but it's slow, gritty, and just downright painful at times. I loved the first one, and I can still find a bit to like in this one, just not enough to recommend it to anybody. Anyone who is wanting to experience the Sword of the Stars, I highly suggest you look at the first game instead.","July 5, 2015","false","67.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It took me about three launches just to create a game, and returning to the game still nets the occasional crash.  Thankfully, these seem to be limited to the first few minutes of play, so it's not like you lose anything important.  Autosaving turn increments is highly recommended at this point.\n\nThere are considerable changes between Sword of the Stars and Sword of the Stars II.  The new fleet mechanics feel a bit frustrating, at first, but I believe they make for a positive change on the whole.\n\nHowever, I was able to figure out the first Sword of the Stars without many problems.  There were a few obscure little bits that I only figured out by randomly adjusting sliders... but it was all relatively straight forward, much of what you needed was already set.\n\nThat changes, somewhat, in SoTS II.  One of the most interesting and frustrating features I've found is the government type/style.  Being a Libertarian-leaning Conservative, I wanted to migrate my empire toward the virtues of free markets and individual liberty.  But therein lies a bit of a contradiction in terms.  What actions can I, as the supreme dictator, make to bring about free market economics within my -empire-?\n\nDoing nothing, oddly enough, causes nothing to change within your 'empire' ... or ... civilization?  ... Anyway - just clicking the 'end turn' button does what one would think.  The citizens of my little starter-centrist empire apparently need me to tell them to do things.  Since I don't particularly like seeing Hivers blow up my citizens - I set to work making things happen.\n\nWhich immediately migrates my empire towards being a bunch of communists.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that taxes mysteriously 'increase' during turns for a +3 to being a control freak and pinko.  Why, I've no clue.  I didn't touch the damned tax slider.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with colonizing a planet and it finally started generating revenue, or something.  But when I reduce taxes on my whole 'civimpire' - I only get credit for a -1 to my pinko-dictatorishness.  I suspect soviet engineered gremlins.\n\nI try building freighters.  That kind of helped move me away from socialism, but didn't really help with the whole control-freak issues.  Not that the frighters were any good for anything.  Fifty of the things and not a single credit of income from trade routes.  Perhaps I didn't have the research for trade (but then why could I build frieghters?).\n\nEventually - I noticed that my 'subsidies' slider simply didn't move.  Being a free market kind of person, I don't believe in subsidies... but, since I'm well on the way to being a communist, I may as well start throwing money at companies who ask for it.\n\nNext thing I know, civilians are colonizing planets and asking me for trade agreements.\n\nWhat a crock!  They needed me to take money from them (taxes) to give back to them (subsidies) so that they could start colonizing and doing other such things by themselves.  No wonder why I was so hopelessly confused.  While I still suspect there is a bug in how taxes and other such things are calculated, this shows much greater promise in being able to Wei Wu Wei my way into a Libertarian standing.\n\nThere was zero mention of this in the in-game guides.\n\nMost of those seem to be partial links to the wiki, which is a fantastic lack of anything relevant or important to actually playing the game.\n\nEvery game developer should look at the current state of Sword of the Stars II.  Then, they need to be told: "This is what a public beta looks like."\n\nWhy?  Because they are in the bad habit of releasing alpha builds under the guise of being 'pre access betas' then releasing a beta as a full game with the belief they can hot-patch over the following months.\n\nAnd it needs to stop.\n\nMany of SotS II's features are working, and it is in a publicly acceptable state as a beta.\n\nIt, however, lacks the necessary refinement and polish to be considered a full game.  Numerous features appear to be undocumented within the game.  There are still regions where text displays improperly.  Any time the computer switches to the desktop, the program returns to a windowed state (and will not return to a full screen).\n\nWhich is why I am conflicted in terms of "would I recommend this game?"\n\nCurrently, I don't think it should be offered as a full game.  It is still a beta.\n\nThat said - SotS II brings a lot to the table in terms of a gaming experience.  The only reason I would not recommend the game to others is because it is still an incomplete beta that could sour what would otherwise be a very enjoyable experience.\n\nSo - for someone who is experienced in turn based games and I expect would be tolerant of the beta status of the game?  Absolutely, I would recommend it.\n\nBut as a general recommendation?  I think it has a ways to come before it is ready for the general market.  Which is unfortunate given the fact that the game launched in a worse state over a year ago.","March 16, 2014","true","203.8"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","2"

But I will give that soon in Pros and Cons.\n\nThe game does lag a lot, even with lowered details, all special effects switched off and on lower resolution, you actually do need a lot of memory, even when you run the game on a quad-core System.\n\nThe player is factually drowned in information, you can do too much micromanagement of your empire - the same mistake that led to the downfall of Master of Orion III in public reviews. The Lore of your race can be looked up in the game 'cyclopedia, which actually is nice, because the information is given in digestible bits and pieces.\n\nI was just glad, not to hear the strange squeal of shot down SolForce ships, that annoyed me in the first part, the sound was slightly more polished - and I will try to play a bit more of the game, but it's not the game I expected, neither has it anything good and barrier free as the first part... Oh, and german players, you will have a lot better playing experience when you play in english - fully free of strange artefacts in the descriptions because there was some issue with our ö,ä,ü, and ß in some words.\n\nPros:Added Races."Online" Encyclopedia.Graphically more up to date.Multiplanet Systems instead of one world systems.Cons:Laggy, the game actually seems to have problems calculating the outcome of moves.Buggy, Immersion Empires have the tendency to crash.Too much micromanagement, which will grow into buerocratic tape, the killer of fun.Research is a bit of strange now, with first asserting the technologies success...Moderate issues with other topics like diplomacy, colonization, terraforming, production and stuff.\nNot Recommended\nEven though I am a great fan of 4X games and especially space empire simulators, I can't recommend this game in good conscience. Sadly some things were overdone, putting the player into a frightful tight between overmanagement and minutae details, very finely crafted especially for perfectionistic buerocrats. But the fun of the first part with breathtaking  battles between fleets will come a bit short, and aren't as enlighting as in the first part.\n\nFurthermore there are other issues, the lags, some of the bugs and of course the detailed aproach can scare off any newbie to the genre. I am quite the veteran in such games, but sadly, and as much as I first was very happy to have the game in my library, I am not quite accomodated with the game.\n\nThe only question that keeps me pondering, how would the game have fared if this one hadn't put Kerberos, the developers behind it, out of business?

It's at least been patched to a mostly stable build now.\n\nGameplay wise,  it has some nice innovations that are not found in Sword of the Stars I (SOTS 1).  It takes some getting used to but otherwise a nice new dynamic to strategic play.\n\nUnfortunately due to things (I would read the forums on both steam and Kerberos/Paradox) happening, the game is in quite the state.   There's a memory leak/optimization problem that crashes the game within 100 or so turns (sooner if you play on larger maps) which makes it hard to hit end-tier tech.  The AI is also somewhat gimped and diplomacy is basic at best.\n\nAs much as I love the game for all it's faults, I can't recommend others buy it unless it's both on sale and if you at least have a passing interest in the game.\n","January 18","false","240.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I love 4x space strategy games and I tried to really give this one a shot but after 14 hours of struggling with this thing I just can't bring myself to give this any sort of a recommendation. On paper this game seems amazing with loads of great and complex elements but in reality it's all just horrendously designed trash. The menus, the UI, the battles, the Manager screens, the mechanics... literally EVERYTHING in this game is broken. I've got a mid to high range PC and this game plays at a silky smooth 4-7 fps in the Fleet Manager screen when I'm arranging a 6 ship fleet ffs. I once made the mistake of attacking an enemy's planet and ended up having to sit through a 3 fps battle for 14 minutes because of how horribly optimized this game is and because there's a complete lack of menus and other VERY BASIC things that can be found in any RTS made over the past decade (like an ESC menu, a Load Game option in the Campaign Menu, or even some camera hotkey options). This game has some of the worst camera controls I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. No WASD or arrow key camera movement (everything is done using the RMB) which is literally the most basic thing in any game, let alone an RTS.\n\nThis thing is a rushed, buggy, poorly optimized, and completely half-♥♥♥♥♥ piece of sh*t. No tutorial, no explanations, no campaigns, and the list just goes on from there.

I loved the first Sword of the Stars, and had a lot of faith in Kerberos, even with the botched launch of this title. With that being said, though, even as someone who enjoys grand strategy games, I can just not seem to get into this particular game even after racking up almost 90 hours with it. From an ergonomic standpoint, there are just far too many clicks to do any one thing. Rather than just selecting a fleet and sending it somewhere, you have to use a mission system which can only deploy a fleet to a designated system for a few turns at a time. It's impossible to simply park a fleet in a system and have it keep things safe, without also owning that system. Even then... it's a little frustrating.\n\nI get what that's supposed to accomplish; I understand the mechanic of linking deployment patterns to a "real" military, but I prefer the more abstracted version in the previous game. On top of that, station construction is completely tedious; most turns I skip it completely because it's simply boring to click through dozens of systems with several bases each, trying to remember which system had the weapons lab and which had the power plant lab, etc.\n\nGraphically, it's stunning in space combat. The ship design option is nice, though again a little tedious in some cases. Combat, like I said, looks good, but is vary annoying to run through because of the user interface and the massive scope of planetary systems -- sometimes it takes several turns to even encounter an enemy, and yet the game makes the combat take quite a long time. Randomized research is nice.\n\nTurn times are awful, even on an i7 Ivybridge. Make sure you've got something on Netflix to keep you busy.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people will try to say that I'm just not hardcore enough to like this game, but... Well, perhaps that's true. I don't have the patience to sort through many, many menus to do simple tasks, and I'm frustrated by wait times and the AI's inability to pose a challenge, along with the developers' very poor documentation (along with a surly community manager...). I will give it to them, in terms of spirit -- they tried very hard. Unfortunately, I think we're just going to have to wait for SOTS III for them to get back to the glory of the original game.","December 1, 2013","false","88.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","1"

You can't just tell ships to go someplace, you have assign them to a fleet commanded by your limited number of admirals and generate a mission to go to a place. It's hard to describe exactly but it's very counter intutive and feels 'backwards'. You also can't ships in reserve on a fleet like in it's predecessor so even if you have a numerical advantage in ships since you're limited by what admirals can command. If you want to crush an enemy with your industrial might, the previously stated issues make it a logistical nightmare.\n\nIf it was possible to mod this game into something more resembling the previous Sword of the Stars it'd be a pretty good game, as it stands I can't recommend it because it is simply so tedious to play.","January 10","false","138.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Totally broken release.  They released a beta, no kidding.  The beta was the release version and the 'update' which was suppose to be the final is just a later beta version.  The options menu doesn't even work.  This game is beyond broken.  This is the worst game release I have ever, I mean ever, seen.  Stay away from this product.  It's horrible.\n\nMy Score: 0/10 (Unplayable)\n\nUpdated Review: Recommended\nWell, they fixed it.  A year after release it is finally beginning to be the title we all hoped and paid for.  It is entertaining, fun, and has strategic depth.  The best of the original SOTS has finally returned with much improved graphics and gameplay.  I have recently revisited playing this title after it has been fixed and can now honestly recommend this title.  It is fun for strategic junkies and should be worth the money now.  If you loved the first, you will easily get 100 hours of entertainment out of this one and that means it's worth it.\n\nMy Score: 7/10","October 29, 2011","true","381.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Changing this to a "Yes" from a "No".\n\nWhy did I start with no?  Well it has to do with threshold of pain.  Games shouldn't surprise players and then say 'well you should have read the manual' and you can read the full details of "No" way down there somewhere.\n\n\nReasons for "Yes"?  Because after you get past the surprises and understand the game - I think there's a good - maybe even awesome game in here.  Here are some pluses:\n\n+ Massive tactical star battles that are player controlled.  Take that GalCiv.\n\n+ Very deep and randomized tech tree.  This means some games will have more severe handicaps than others and you'll have to make due even when some tech isn't available.\n\n+ Customizable ships.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ancient reasons for "No" below ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis review was written to be sent on a time machine to the past to the "has not yet bought SotS2" younger, more innocent version of "huminado":  don't buy it.\n\nAnd it's not because this isn't a great game.  Don't get me wrong - I like this game.  I like what the game is good at doing.  But I can't recommend it.  It's only to prevent myself that painful moment of having buyer's regret and believing I've been ripped off.\n\nThis will happen to most people who buy this game.  It might not be justified.  If they read the manual or the forums they might find out the game is fine, or they might run into other issues.\n\nBut I know that feeling of buyer's remorse.  If I can avoid it, even at the price of never playing a great game which has confusing surprises - I will.\n\nTo sum this review up: this game does not meet current standards of quality for TBS.  There's a very good chance players will run into problems which could easily be avoided if the game were finished.  In my case, if I had read the whole manual, I might have avoided an issue.  But I don't expect anyone to ever read a manual - I expect games to be intuitive on their own.\n\nIf you want the details, read my blog post on the anti-wiener game design pattern here: http://clientserverhell.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-anti-wiener-pattern.html\n\n\n------ Further observation ------\n\nThe longer I play the more it becomes clear reading the manual is not optional.  And some details are missing in the manual.  For example, the term PD is never explained, neither in the game, nor the manual, nor the wiki.  If you don't know what that term is (and maybe some people don't) - then you'll have to ask around.\n\nI haven't played long enough to say, but this sort of missing detail doesn't mean bad game design, but it does mean assumptions are made about the player's level of expertise before they open the box.  It shouldn't discourage anyone from trying though.  I still have to give it thumbs down - at least until I see the game in a state that is more friendly to new players.","November 28, 2014","true","57.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The original came at me out of nowhere and hooked me deeply. I played through all the expansions and replayed it many many times greatly enjoying it. Then a sequel was announced. I was over the moon.\n\nSo rarely in recent years have i felt so eager to play a sequel as this one. Then came one of the top 3 worst pc releases i can recall in my long history of gaming. I wont go over it , lets just say all the love in the world was not enough to get me to keep playing it.\n\nI then periodically played it over the next year realising quite quickly this was not going to be a quick fix. I have recently played it with the free expansion and finally got something akin to what i was hoping for. There is one major letdown for me tho( many many small ones...) To play a 6 or more player map WILL result in unbelievable turn times, so much so that I took to reading an ebook between turns after a few hundred turns.  I was up to a minute plus after a few hundred turns, ie 60 mins of waiting per 60 turns... I had a black edition AMD machine 6 cores 3.8ghz, 16gb ddr3 1600mhz ram, ssd install drive and a £380 graphics card. In the top few percent of 6million steam users and yet this game was close to unplayable on large maps.\n\nWho the hell was it designed for? As the majority with dual core processors in the 3ghz range and 4gb ram must love 1v1 i guess.\n\nSo.. I very begrudgingly give it a thumbs up (Edit- see below for change) for the dedication shown in trying to patch it on an up until recently regular schedule. The potential for this game is outstanding, it has not sadly reached that potential. Ill still be checking back on this periodically which says something in itself.\n\nEdit 06/06/14 - Apparently as of January 2014 from what I can piece together from the bits and pieces on the kerberos forum, paradox are no longer funding development of this game and kerberos are directing all feedback/questions to paradox directly. I will therefore change this review to a thumbs down as it is unfinished and will never reach a finished state. What a tragic shame from start to finish.\n\nKerberos have stated that at this time they have no plans for a sots3....","November 28, 2013","false","117.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

I've played a ton of the original SotS, and actually stopped mid game to give this one a shot, which I picked up for cheap on the winter sale.  I've convinced more than a few friends to buy the original, but I can't recommend this.\n\nIts positives:\n\nTactical combat is better in many ways, worse in a few\nMultiple planets aren't the pain they usually are to have in a game like this\nBetter system of handling damage in the game\nNew tech\nBetter graphics\n\nThe negatives:\n\nThat nice new tactical combat is hopelessly mired in a bad combination of bugs and the fleet system, which basically makes you fight the interface to get stuff done.  You'll have interesting experience like not being able to send a fleet from the closest star system to colonize, but only from ones half way across the galaxy, or have you invasion, listed as lasting 30 turns, mysteriously stop after 4, and because of the fleet system, you can't order your ships to turn around.\n\nIt has a very steep learning curve, is not balanced in terms of things like random events, the AI isn't very smart, and the game does a poor job of communicating what is going on to the player.  I wish they'd fix the game.  It could have been great but for a couple of dubious design decisions, and lots of bugs.\n\nIt's fun for awhile, but eventually you'll get sick of fighting the game more than your opponent.  Also, if you love extra layers of micromanagement, play the Loa, where you'll be continuously creating and destroying fleets, than making tiny fleets to send all on the same turn and reassemble someplace else, and try to figure out how to navigate the semi-functional battle manager, which is very bugged at least with the them.","February 14","false","273.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

For some reason the game seems to crash if I start it from the shortcut, but if I start it using the play button in steam library and then shift tab in and then out of steam the game seems to run stable as a metronome. Don't know why; it just works that way for me. Played it 14 hours straight over the Australia Day long weekend without it missing a beat.\n\n2. THIS REALLY IS A GREAT GAME, I've been playing 4X since Supremacy - Your will be done and Imperium Galactic, both on Amiga 500 and this game is probably one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Actual it’s a thinking mans (gals)  game.\n\n3. The level of complexity and depth is amazing, it takes quite a while to fully grasp the mechanics of how this game works even after reading the manual/s cover to cover a couple of times and watching a boat load of YouTube.  Thank whatever deity you have, that the Devs didn't appear to go down the 'lets dumb it down for console path' like so many others have lately (Sid). For pity sake people PCs these days are so fast and can process so, so much that 4X SHOULD be about super micro management. I've been making spreadsheets like crazy, in order to track all the vessels in my fleets (by name, class, registry and assignment) my Fleet Admirals, my space station developments, OMG how amazing is this game.\n\n4. It's such a pity that this game was rushed out and got the absolute thumping that it deserved, but I can tell you that all the fix up work that went in to it finally turned out a really good game.  Unfortunately it still doesn't look as graphically polished as it could, (UI and all), but the ships are superb and look amazing in the ACTUAL tactical combat piece. This alone beats so many other space 4X hands down.\n\n5. Ship Micro-management Heavan :-) your ships have weapons, upgradable/exchangable (in real 3d not some 2d drawing/plan thingy), your ships have pods (marines, cargo, extra crew, extra energy etc) your ships have drive systems (upgradable with reasearch) and your ships have dorsal and lateral armour and shields (and forward facing deflectors if you research and build them). ALL these things are seen in tactical combat and you have to properly manage your ship's weapons, shields, direction that they are facing towards enemy (with spin and roll systems). ALL these things really, actually count towards not getting your backside handed to you in the few short minutes of (pausable) real tactical combat. [Love it, Love it, Love it]. Depth people, real depth.\n\nI do wish that there was an easier way to mod this game, as that can sometimes make up a lot of the shortfalls in the graphics department, but the Devs chose to alter the format of the graphics files and having to covert simple .tga's is a complete pain in the ar_e.\n\nI guess the lesson here is actually finish the game BEFORE release, make it mod-able from the get go and, at least have it pass a simple Beta testing before throwing it out to the unsuspecting public. If that had happened this game could have gotten the praise that it actually does deserve.\n\nLove this game, so happy that I didn't buy it years ago when it came out, but I am so pleased that I finally took the chance and found an absolute gem.\n\nDo yourself a favour; get Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Edition","January 27","true","450.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Without an SSD and modern CPU the time to process a turn will take a while on a large map once there is a lot of traffic. The game is built on a database like system so there is a lot of disk I/O. Run it from a RAM disk if you can.\n\nDeplomacy in AI games is completely missing for the most part. You might get a cease fire or even a non-agression treaty, but in a few turns they will declare war again. In my 200+ hour of game play I got an alliance once...and about ten turns after forming the alliance the AI declared war. So just keep that in mind...you will have no friends in an AI map.\n\nThe worst part of this game is the pirates. It takes a lot of infrastructure to reduce the chance of them occuring and even then they still will...and on large maps you might have ten pirate attacks to sit through in a game turn. That's at least 10 minutes of completely wasted game time and you can never do anything about them anyway. Even if you have defenses in range you only have 2.5 minutes so you will not likely be able to destory the ships and save your frieghter. Do your self a favor and edit your base chance for pirates to occur to -2.00 in the game's commonassets.xml file. You will also notice faster turn times and nothing of value will be lost.\n\nThe rest of the game is flat out awesome. I'd personalyl rate SoTS2 as the best 4x game on the market right now or the best modern one at least. The combat mehanics of ships not fighting as well when they take damage is really rare and makes it a cut above the rest of game alone. The weapons are ballanced pretty well...not perfect, but if your research options limts you one type you are not going to be dead in the water (though not getting point defense will make me just restart the game since you learn this early on, but that is it). The graphics are decent...better than they need to be. The fleet system isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. The only complaint I have is that you have to have a command ship in every fleet which is always a less combat capable ship. I am sure the Admiral could radio the rest of the ships in the fleet from any ship. The combat is some what 3D...this could be better, but it is still pretty good.\n\nSo yeah...that was a bit of a mixed review, but I am still giving this game a thumbs up. I'd recomend it to any one, though pay attension to my warning on the hardware.

Buy it on sale if you can't afford it otherwise or are wary of the reviews, but if you love epic 4x games with incredible detail, this game will blow your mind.\n\nPlay it as an adventure in discovering an immense and complex world. Play it to support the franchise, one of the most amazing 4x series ever conceived. Play it in hopes that this gem of a game, this monument to the dreams and vision of its developers, will continue to get the last 10% of development it needs to finally become the-most-amazing-4x-game-ever.\n\nUnique thingies:\n1. Dynamic Government Types, assigned based on economic, population, and military decisions, each government type with its own set of bonuses and restrictions\n2. Automated empire population behaviors, spurred on with indirect economic stimulation, cause your citizens to act independently to colonize and set up trade routes\n3. Fully rendered 3D ships with individually targetable sections, allowing advanced tactical warfare options (sniper weapons, heavy ballistic weapons, powerful beam weapons, drones, complex ordinance, you name it!)\n4. Unique races, each with their own different FTL drive types. Different FTL technology significantly affects exploration and strategic warfare.\n5. Random tech tree allows for a unique game each time\n6. Research an A.I. to help your empire, but beware, it can TURN AGAINST YOU!! (Whaaat?!)\n7. Randomized "Grand Menaces" (think "Borg" level galactic invaders) and encounters that make the game epic\n\nThere's a loooong back story on this game - an epic and confusing story of publisher vs developer. In the end, there were a lot of unhappy die-hard lovers of the original Sword of the Stars (an amazing game in its own right) who were severely off-put by what could only be called an unfinished game when it plopped out on release day. Because of this, you will no doubt be inundated by massive amounts of negative posts in forums and reviews. That being said however, from release forward, the developers continued to put out a fairly steady stream of patches and significant effort was made to bring this game up to "release" level by 2014. Unfortunately, this is where the story apparently ends as the publisher, after years slow improvement, decided to stop further progress on this game. Which is truly sad. Not sad, tragic. You can see the love for this game in the developers' forums, but politically (and I suppose somehow, legally) they no longer actively contribute to further patches. Some have hinted they will work on the product in their own time, unpaid, but very little has been seen to this end in recent time.\n\nSo where does this leave us? The game is lavish. It's complex. It's advanced. But you can feel overwhelmed because, simply put, the user interface just isn't where it should be. Tooltips are missing, documentation is limited (and in a game this complicated, detailed documentation is necessary to understand how things interact). Sword of the Stars seems to have always emphasized a fun-to-play engine on top of a complicated set of features. The player has (in the original Sword of the Stars game anyway) no immediate need to "understand" how all these factors work together to play - just set a slider or push a button and things "just work." That was okay in the first game, where your planet development and trade routes just made sense and were easy to understand graphically. But soooo much has been added to the sequel that it's mind bending to even try to guess what repercussions your actions might have. Browsing through the developer forums you will still get a sense that Kerberos intended things to "just work" and often you will see posts chastising users for asking detailed questions about mathematical formulas used to determine trade profit or population growth or morale, but without the necessary game feedback of what your choices in the game actually DO to your empire, it's hard not to want answers to the underlying logical questions of what's going on.\n\nStill, Sword of the Stars is a totally unique series in an often sterile world of 4x games. It's ability to successfully merge tactical and strategic elements, with micro and macro management, and truly glorious 3D battles is so amazingly singular that you owe it to yourself to try this game. Few games allow you to actually implement strategic warfare to the point that it's possible to win against a superior enemy by focusing weaker units on strategic enemy ship components (each 3D element, turret, engine, etc is individually targetable), hiding in asteroid shadows, or annexing by indirect political power that it's without hesitation that I earnestly recommend this game.\n","October 14, 2015","true","23.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","4"

You have to grow and run your empire, controlling trade, colonization, stimulus, research, ship design and fully 3D, fully controllable space combat. Ship design and weapon placement makes a big difference in combat, and tactics, direction etc is very important in space combat.  Those looking for a deep strategic game with fully controllable Space Combat will not go wrong here.\n\nPros: Very deep, lots of control over empire from stimulus, colonization, research, base construction and upgrades. Unlike many other in the genre, space combat is fully controllable.  You control everything and controlling if your ships focus on broadside or frontal attacks makes a big difference, as does how you outfit your ship and where you place your weapons.  Overall very satisfying. The inclusion of an ingame chat system that allows you to speak to other players is very useful for getting player advice.  Also, the game looks great graphically.\n\nCons: Complete lack of tuturial is a major annoyance.  I had to watch a (highly recommended) youtube tutorial to make heads or tails of the game.  Considering how complex it is, can be very hard for new players to get into it.  Also, the game still suffers from crashes.  Final con is that Diplomacy is not that well implemented, which is fine for those warmongers among us, but those that want to play a more diplomatic game might be dissapointed.\n\nSummary: If you want a deep, good looking 4x will excellent combat, then look not further than Sots2.","December 29, 2013","true","128.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

It's a very fresh new look on AI playable races)\n\nStory- 2/10 (there is no story, other than the lore you get from either the forums or within the encyclopedia their really nothing else.)\n\nTech Tree- 9/10 (the randomized tech forest with several branches and seven overall main weapon types, no matter what game you play against AI or other Human Opponents, the odds of running exactly the same weapon types is very slim after you reach turn 100)\n\nUnit Health vs DPS -9/10 (basically this mean how unit health is dealt vs the weapon damage that it\n\ntakes. Unlike most Turn Based Strategy games SotS 2 contains a Real Time combat, so it already starts off with an advantage verse other turn based strat games. However with the inclusion of the ship matrix system which mimics physical armor depth and resistance. The game surpasses even the most advanced real time strategy game. In fact I would have to say this is the first time I scene a videogame of anytype properly model a vehicle or units armor in a way that it actually makes logical sense. However there are some downsides, for starters I don't feel weapons do enough DPS to the armor matrix in many cases some high end weapons just wont kill an enemy unit. In fact their are very few weapons that do enough damage to completely penetrate a CR armor matrix in one shot even at end game. On the flip side their are tons of weapons that are left "obsolete" once you reach Leviathans or even Dreadnoughts with AA so all around the matrix system is amazing, but weapon balancing could be better. Battles really do feel slow in many cases unless your focus firing with all your units. Leaves a lot of strategy left in the background to pick up dust.)\n\nGame Length- 7/10 (It is a Turn Based Strategy Game, so it obvious that a single match could last\n\nseveral days if not weeks depending on size and level of strategy of both the player and the Ai. So if I go on just length this game will get a 10/10 in this category way to easily, just because of its genre alone. However the problem I run into is the "fun" factor, in fact I can't really blame this particular game for this, since so many turn based games run into this problem. "The Clean Up Turns" around turns 200 to 300 you should if you a modest player and your playing at 100% eco and research with standard starting systems and 4 players, you will run into the clean up turns within this turn bracket. Basically Clean Up Turns is when your literally doing nothing, you have overpowered your opposition and steamrolling through their systems, it just gets boring the AI makes no attempt at counter attacking and even on the off chance they do, they don't succeed. Now verse a human player you will generally run into the point during this process where the Human player just quits. This is a good thing as it completely eliminates the Clean Up Turns. The Ai really needs an option at some point where they just cant go on any longer and they succeed from the game, whether this should cause the Ai's systems to separate into their provinces and become multiple Ai players or not, just to make it more interesting and stop the boredom of this clean up turns or just have it end the game all together. Either way something needs to be done about this, because reaching this point to often is the reason why I left so many other turn based strategy games. Just finishing the match is not fun after a certain point.)\n\nTextures and Effects- 9/10 (the game is beautiful it really is)\n\nRe-playability- 8/10 (after 1000 hours into this game, yes it has a ton of re-playability. Otherwise I\n\nwouldn't have so many hours into the game. Even though it not being worked on 24/7 by its development team, it doesn't have to be. Randoms alone increase re-playability exponentially. On top of that modding "which I do a lot of" makes the game seem dynamic and different every time you change or add something new to its already complicated but fun dynamics which are in place and very solid. It could use some help though, like an expansion or two in order to mesh everything together and create a completely solid slap for modders to build from in order to create more dynamic events for the sandbox matches which are very much almost always enjoyable.)\n\nI would give the total score of this game....\n\n8/10\n\nthat would be my final verdict after factoring in everything I said above. The game is good in single player, its multi player can be a bit buggy still, but people do play it and have fun (although it can be a hassle)  so all around the game is worth its weight in USD (considering the USA economic issues though.... I think the game will always be worth its weight in USD... haha I make bad jokes)\n\n, but yea it is worth the buy. Pick it up if you like Turn Based Strategy games.. or just like ships with pretty lasers shooting each other, both are good reasons!","October 15, 2012","true","290.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You have to grow and run your empire, controlling trade, colonization, stimulus, research, ship design and fully 3D, fully controllable space combat. Ship design and weapon placement makes a big difference in combat, and tactics, direction etc is very important in space combat.  Those looking for a deep strategic game with fully controllable Space Combat will not go wrong here.\n\nPros: Very deep, lots of control over empire from stimulus, colonization, research, base construction and upgrades. Unlike many other in the genre, space combat is fully controllable.  You control everything and controlling if your ships focus on broadside or frontal attacks makes a big difference, as does how you outfit your ship and where you place your weapons.  Overall very satisfying. The inclusion of an ingame chat system that allows you to speak to other players is very useful for getting player advice.  Also, the game looks great graphically.\n\nCons: Complete lack of tuturial is a major annoyance.  I had to watch a (highly recommended) youtube tutorial to make heads or tails of the game.  Considering how complex it is, can be very hard for new players to get into it.  Also, the game still suffers from crashes.  Final con is that Diplomacy is not that well implemented, which is fine for those warmongers among us, but those that want to play a more diplomatic game might be dissapointed.\n\nSummary: If you want a deep, good looking 4x will excellent combat, then look not further than Sots2.","December 29, 2013","true","128.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

Sure they would have got flak for that, but as someone who really enjoys playing SOTS 1, I REALLY hate SOTS 2. When I have to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to move my fleet from star A to star B, let alone how to move it once I get into a battle, you know you have problems with the UI. I am a person who can start a game up, figure out how to play it as I go, and generally encounter no problems. It is RARE that I can't figure something out. In this game, like I havbe already said, can't even figure out how to move my fleets. The worst part is is that there is no tutorial!!!!!! So there I was, excited about the sequel, and spending over an hour trying to figure out the game. So when I got stumped completely I was like, "okay, let me save the game and then go to the main menu to start the tutorial, I am probably only making this harder than it has to be by completely missing some stupid button!". So I got to the main menu and discovered there was no tutorial. In frustration I quit and went to play SOTS 1 which is simple and intuitive. I mean how hard can it be to put a button in that says, move fleet?\n\nAnyways, this game was terrible, and I hate to say that because after I learned a few basic controls, the ideas they where trying to implement where actually pretty good.","February 23, 2015","false","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have rarely seen such a badly documented game. The description / explanation of critical features are either incomplete or totally missing (the official manual gets you started – but not more). A clear NO GO for an average gamer.\n\nHaving written that: why do I recommend buying this game at all?\n\nBecause after having spent really a lot of time to understand the game mechanics on my own (basically as part of a separate game), SoSt II (enhanced edition) turned out to be the best 4X Science Fiction game I have ever played. It even beats “Sins of a Solar Empire” (meaning a lot for those who know it). As far as the depth and complexity is concerned it can be best compared to “Hearts of Iron” (the latest versions).\n\nYes, the game crashes from time to time, but it is still playable thanks to auto saving before and after a combat. With my current HW configuration I can usually play around 10 – 50 turns without any issues – at highest settings. For beginners, the AI is absolutely sufficient. After you have achieved some game experience, I recommend playing primarily in a two player mode (without AI). Diplomacy is certainly not a strength of this game. However, the combat system with all the tactical possibilities is just awesome. Also, the fully 3D star map is unique with several different ways (drives) to explore. Designing ships and building up a reasonable economy is fun. In addition, the Tech tree is breathtaking (just note that a lot of technologies you find in other games from the beginning, have to be developed first – adding massive functionality and a lot of features you are not aware of at the beginning).\n\nBottom Line: an absolutely great game marketed in a very bad way. Only to be recommended for people who are willing to go the extra mile required to understand the undocumented features of the game (including some basic game mechanics).\n","December 7, 2015","true","165.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It is largely stable now and very much enjoyable, though probably not the easiest game to get into.\n\nFirst of all I'd like to mention one thing that drew me to this series of games: it's the great universe it depicts. It's a universe filled with races as detailed, likable and integral in their portrayal, as one could expect from an RPG. And it’s not simple the backstory from a manual: I liked very much how it seeped into little details in the game from drives to voices to event reports. It shows that the authors cared about their world and the species that populate it, and Sword of the Stars is the only game where I liked all of the different races.\n\nIt is also not a lifeless universe where only the major empires dwell. From silicoid swarms to grand menaces, there are always greater forces at work. Minor events influence your decisions early game, while aforementioned grand menaces may shape the entire match later on. I have witnessed everyone in a multiplayer game banding together to deal with a swarm of planet-sized self-replicating machines that have already stripped a good chunk of the map clean of all resources, and it’s the unexpected that makes many games memorable.\n\nThese events are also part of the story, with many of them heralding the introduction of new races over the years, and shaping existing factions.\n\nIt gets me to the third thing that I like about this game: replayability. It is paramount to 4x games in general, and Sword of the Stars goes further than most in this field. Besides events that I've talked about that help make each game memorable, there are different ways to travel among the stars for different races and randomized research tree. The latter may sound like a hindrance, but I found it to add immensely to the uniqueness of each game. It doesn't allow you to cherry-pick some kind of best combination and stick to it in every game, and when luck is not on your side, it provides for some challenge in overcoming your opponents despite the shortcomings of technology available to you.\n\nThe tech tree really links with the great ship customization. Beyond the great visual design of ships for different races, the game goes beyond three cannons that improve with new technologies. Further research provides a plethora of new options for each race in a system of soft counters. It means that a certain technology may be better against another, but not to the point where a fleet equipped with the former will curb-stomp a fleet built around the latter regardless of tactics employed. A clever selection of technologies provide you with an advantage, but rarely an overwhelming one.\n\nWhat I said so far may sound like I consider SotS2 the best game ever created, and I apparently hold it in rather high regard. However, the Achilles heel of this game as it is now is mediocre AI, which is not really surprising in a game like this. It does a decent job now in adapting to your strategy and keeping its empire going and expanding. However its behavior in tactical combat is not really diverse, and it choices in diplomacy sometimes seem awkward and inconsistent. As my experience with the game grew I found the need to arrange some serious odds against me to make up for AI mediocrity.\n\nMultiplayer can alleviate the previous concern quite a bit, and the game really shines online, but each game is so long you rarely can expect to finish it in one evening, and have to arrange for successive sessions which is not always possible. When a person leaves, AI takes over his empire, but like I said, it does mediocre job at best. Multiplayer also took a blow from GameSpy shutdown, so you have to arrange games through a global chat, which is nice, but not actually the most convenient way to handle multiplayer.\n\nAfter all is said and done, Sword of the Stars 2 remains one of the best space 4x games in my opinion, and definitely an unique flower that I hope will continue to bloom and give fruit.","December 25, 2013","true","352.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It is largely stable now and very much enjoyable, though probably not the easiest game to get into.\n\nFirst of all I'd like to mention one thing that drew me to this series of games: it's the great universe it depicts. It's a universe filled with races as detailed, likable and integral in their portrayal, as one could expect from an RPG. And it’s not simple the backstory from a manual: I liked very much how it seeped into little details in the game from drives to voices to event reports. It shows that the authors cared about their world and the species that populate it, and Sword of the Stars is the only game where I liked all of the different races.\n\nIt is also not a lifeless universe where only the major empires dwell. From silicoid swarms to grand menaces, there are always greater forces at work. Minor events influence your decisions early game, while aforementioned grand menaces may shape the entire match later on. I have witnessed everyone in a multiplayer game banding together to deal with a swarm of planet-sized self-replicating machines that have already stripped a good chunk of the map clean of all resources, and it’s the unexpected that makes many games memorable.\n\nThese events are also part of the story, with many of them heralding the introduction of new races over the years, and shaping existing factions.\n\nIt gets me to the third thing that I like about this game: replayability. It is paramount to 4x games in general, and Sword of the Stars goes further than most in this field. Besides events that I've talked about that help make each game memorable, there are different ways to travel among the stars for different races and randomized research tree. The latter may sound like a hindrance, but I found it to add immensely to the uniqueness of each game. It doesn't allow you to cherry-pick some kind of best combination and stick to it in every game, and when luck is not on your side, it provides for some challenge in overcoming your opponents despite the shortcomings of technology available to you.\n\nThe tech tree really links with the great ship customization. Beyond the great visual design of ships for different races, the game goes beyond three cannons that improve with new technologies. Further research provides a plethora of new options for each race in a system of soft counters. It means that a certain technology may be better against another, but not to the point where a fleet equipped with the former will curb-stomp a fleet built around the latter regardless of tactics employed. A clever selection of technologies provide you with an advantage, but rarely an overwhelming one.\n\nWhat I said so far may sound like I consider SotS2 the best game ever created, and I apparently hold it in rather high regard. However, the Achilles heel of this game as it is now is mediocre AI, which is not really surprising in a game like this. It does a decent job now in adapting to your strategy and keeping its empire going and expanding. However its behavior in tactical combat is not really diverse, and it choices in diplomacy sometimes seem awkward and inconsistent. As my experience with the game grew I found the need to arrange some serious odds against me to make up for AI mediocrity.\n\nMultiplayer can alleviate the previous concern quite a bit, and the game really shines online, but each game is so long you rarely can expect to finish it in one evening, and have to arrange for successive sessions which is not always possible. When a person leaves, AI takes over his empire, but like I said, it does mediocre job at best. Multiplayer also took a blow from GameSpy shutdown, so you have to arrange games through a global chat, which is nice, but not actually the most convenient way to handle multiplayer.\n\nAfter all is said and done, Sword of the Stars 2 remains one of the best space 4x games in my opinion, and definitely an unique flower that I hope will continue to bloom and give fruit.","December 25, 2013","true","352.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

When first released the game was unplayable yes but now it is extremely playable.\n\nMy only gripes are the radically changed command system lack of ability to change map sizes (without a third party program) compared to SotS prime.  My problem with the command system is that instead of just pressing “M” to move a fleet now you have to assign a “mission”.   My other issue is that when you “set up” a game you don’t have the ability to customize the maps like in SotS.  I really liked being able to set minimum distance between stars, star count etc but again with a 3rd party program you can do just that.\n\nHowever all is not bad.  The new Loa race is fun to play, especially considering I can’t think of another game that lets you play as an AI race.  Another bonus is now you start off with cruisers instead of destroyers, you can still have destroyers but they are now drones carried on special hulls and act as little more than a meat shield.  Another benefit of SotS2 is that the tech tree is full but your ability to research tech is dependent on feasibility studies.  But this means that even with a 1% chance of feasibility you still have a chance to research and get the tech. Some people complain about the "end turn" times. Trust me those will save you much headache later down the line as while you have that period of time of nothing it gives you a chance to reflect about overall strategy.\n\nThis game also has a throw you to the wolves learning system.  Many players have created guides though so you aren't completely screwed but If you enjoy learning by yourself it can be quite enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommended","September 30, 2014","true","307.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Like with any game and game upgrade, it's a learning process. SOTS II is a much more involved and complex game than it's predesesor, SOTS I. Still, I am learning the operation and control of the game as I go along.\n\nA few things I need to mention, the pluses. Of course, a lot better graphics goes a long way. I also like the variety of settings that  it comes with. The ship design function is great, at least to me. The possiility of colonizing multiple planets in a star system is a great concept as well. Another plus is the having a Squadron CnC direct control of the Fleets, commanded by an Admiral.\n\nYou may wonder what I would like to see added (again) or improved:\n\n1) I would like to see more Stellar systems (up to 350-like the old SOTS)\n2) I liked the way the trade software operated in the old SOTS: 1\n3) I liked the idea of sharing technology with allies.\n4) I liked observing my allies combat segments\n5) I would like my spies to be able to steal technology from the enemy.","September 3, 2014","true","214.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It had a bigger list of features that didn't work than those that did and was an unplayable mess.  All this and the company continued to push pre-release sales despite knowing the terrible state of the game, which left a very bad taste in the mouth of those excited by this sequel to a quite enjoyable first outing.\n\nTo their credit they did work on it for about a year and got it to a state they wanted on release, which still wasn't that great, but it was at least playable (though still quite crashy).  Now, it seems they have abandoned it and it still isn't really finished and you can't really blame them.  To continue to work on it wouldn't be a great financial decision.  Sometimes it is best to just cut your losses and move on.\n\nIs there a future for this game?  Maybe, but it is in hands of modders.  Maybe one day this game could come close to its potential and what was promised by the devs, until then I can't recommend anyone buy a game I myself don't have double figures in hours played and have no plans to ever reinstall.","April 3, 2015","false","4.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It has the basic foundation to become the best 4X military conquest game ever!And I have played this game many more hours (1000+) than what is recorded, as I usually play offline.\n\nI bought this game after buying and playing SotS complete (SotS I or prime), despite a lot of the negative reviews and I am so glad I did. For me totally worth $24.99.\n\nA lot of the negativity surrounds the unfinished nature and bugs upon it's initial release, which Kerberos Production "mostly" fixed over a years time.\n\nIf you were going to compare this game to others in the genre then it would be something inbetween Sins of a Solar Empire and Star Drive II...and more like Star Drive II than Sins.\n\nPros:\n1) Sjet modules, I mean C'mon! I don't care who you are, that Rocks!\n2) Best research Forest I have used. Some techs on one tree cannot be unlocked until other techs in other trees have been unlocked.\n3) Long range travel is different for each race adding a very important strategic element as well as replay factor.\n4) A very comprehensive yet intuitive ship/platform design system.\n5) Satisfying real time tactics battle engagement system in 3D space.\n\nCons:\n1) limited galaxy setup, no choosable starting locations.\n2) AI on hard, is very aggresive at beginning, and stays aggresive....but doesn't seem to max out it's fleet capacity or build leviathans that I have seen as yet.\n3) Somethings in the game can get a little tedious, although I think this is more often than not, just part of the genre.\n4) you might need a decent comp to get the most out of the game, probably 2x what the minimum requirements are.\n5) information on some controls and/or effects of research can be hard to find or cannot be found.\n6) 3D space is limited, no where near as expansive as HW or Shallow Space but since you can move your units up or down better than Sins.\n\nOther: Some what steep learning curve weather or not you have played Sots I or prime (and this game is deffinitely not Sots I). Very much recommended to read every guide on steam as well as much as the Sotsii wiki you can. Some of the information is outdated while some of it is still very relevant from any one author, so it is best to read all.\n\nI have not encountered any game breaking bugs, the game has crashed twice, maybe 3 times on me, and I just simply restarted and continued from where it crashed with no further issues. There does seem to be an issue if you leave the game paused for a certain length of time, like 20 min or more. In that case it seems to go into window mode (usually) or it looses the UI and you can't really do anything (rare). Again restart and resume.\n\nIf you love 4X military games but are somewhat skeptical from all the negative reviews, then I would definitely get it on sale. But if you like Star Drive 2, then you should love this game.\n\nDisclosure: I have only played as the Human Race in this game.

Sadly, SotS II overcomplicated the whole thing. Many new mechanics and commands were thrown in without sufficient explanation of how they worked. I was lost. Very little of my experience with SotS I was useful. I had to do research online just to figure out how to start playing.

It's difficult to figure out how to do things that should be simple. I can't always tell what can and can't be interacted with. I'll give you a tip there by letting you know that most of what you see cannot be interacted with. The more I played the game, the more convinced I became that the game was intentionally designed to make gameplay as difficult and confusing as possible.\n\nThe game runs slowly in different ways. Even the game menu feels sluggish. It's even worse when you're actually in the game. The first time I clicked "next turn" it took 5-10 seconds to process the turn, which gives me nightmares about how long it might take in the late game when the map is fully populated.\n\nThe combat is much less intuitive than SOTS 1. It was very noisy, but I couldn't really see what was happening. I couldn't see any of the little laser beams or plasma cannon shots flying around. Just missles graphics cutting in and out. I think they redesigned things to look more realistic, but the end result was that it looked like garbage compared to SOTS 1.\n\nBased on User Interface alone, I think the game developers should be ashamed of themselves. It's so bad, that I would actually rather do math homework.","February 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very ambitious of a game - 3d tactical space battles that don't feel like a cheese fest or "just get everything as close as possible and fire away". There's not much rock-paper-scissors stuff - though you can adapt your ships and tactics, there's no guarentee that it'll be a completely effective counter to your enemies. On top of that, even though the races share the same tech trees, each get a few 'race specific' techs, and you're not even guaranteed to be able to research every technology - some trees may be almost completely unobtainable without salvaging the enemy's ships.

The company basically had runned out of money to continue so they released the game as is to get money to keep developping the game! Well 2 years later, they kept their promise, which is a rarity in the games company world! and now the game is great! The bugs are pretty much gone, the new faction the loa is pretty original and well, if you like deep space strategy, this game is up your alley.\n\nThe only thing is that the learning curve is pretty steep for a newcomer. Put the game on EASY difficulty and don't worry if you still get beaten up the first or second game. Just explore the tek tree, which change each game you play and depends in part on the faction you play! No mini-maxing here, you have to play with the tek you got! Also, the tek description is often imprecise in indicating what it does It does not give you hard numbers. For example, you get a laser but is it better than bullets? The damage number says the laser is inferior but in an actual battle, against drones and missiles, the laser is more useful. Against ships, it hit like a wet noodle which is fun to eat but not so much to beat a ship with! ;-) Thats why you need a few games at first to feel out what the tek actually do, especially the combat ones. But you get the hang of it pretty fast unless you're brain damaged or something. If you are, then what the heck are you playing this game for?\n\nYou can customize your ships to your heart content, each faction has a unique mode of travel through space, which means a different strategy for each faction. They even got different toughness of their ship. Also different speed.\nThe ai is pretty tought. If you let it expand too much, you're going to get screwed pretty fast, but if you expand too much,  you're also going to be in a rough place! Hehehehe! The 'Hard' difficulty is for insane megalomaniac who micromanage the hairs on their butts to manage to eck out a win. It's THAT tought.\n\nThere are also a boatload of random encounters, that you can adjust how much of them you want, from none at all to one knocking on your door every turns! And they range from mere annoyance to mega dangerous crap in your pant system killer who basically eradicate your system from the universe! That one is pretty ouch! But how much you laugh when you see it go into your ennemies territory! hehehe\n\nSo all in all, now a great game to play.","December 2, 2013","true","117.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

For better or worse, this tier had bought much more complexity over the original sots1 as HOI3 compared with HOI2. With a much steeper learning curve, some people are bound to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and others intrigued.\n\nHaving read lots of negative review along the line, I was quite skeptical before buying this game. The main complain comes from the instability and bugs and the game looks like unpolished beta release. Well those were written a long time back and I realized that many of them were written by people who has never spent enough time to learn the game mechanism or even user interface. Sots franchise is a rather serious game despite what its stylish artwork might suggest. It has complex and detailed mechanism underneath and very distinguishing species perk for each playable faction. Like the Hearts of Iron franchise, you need to devote quite some effort to understand game mechanism but once you did you'll love it.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over old systems. The space station is greatly enhanced compared to sots1. It now has broad choice of station type, 5 level in its development stage and dozens of station modules. Trade system is replaced by a more specific one which accounts for amount of trade goods produced, number of freighters and available civilian docks. Star system is divided into suns and planets. Now you colonize planet instead of the entire star system. Colonized worlds are divided into provinces with its adminstrative benefit.\n\nStrategy turn pace is somehow slowed because fleet operations are mission-oriented now. Each fleet has its own base of operation and endurance capacity if operates outisde supply line. Fleet have to return base for resupply before another mission can be scheduled. Fleets which can't carry enough supply for a specific mission simply won't accept it in the first place. This is very much like how airforce works in Heats of Iron3. This makes a planet with advanced space station a natural strongpoint in the whole sector, able to respond rapidly in nearby systems and spend less time runing back and forth to the conflict system than the enemy. But then you must also time your missions carefully cause you won't be able to reassign another missions once dispatched with a few exceptions.\n\nAnother major improvement is the armor model and tactical control. Ship won't sustain damage unless armor layers are gone and rounds are applies directly on ship internals and also cause subsystem critical hit in the process. Armor is break down into four sides(top, button, left, right) for each of the section (bridge, mission, propulsion), and each side has its own specific layout consisite of width and depth of armor belt which must be penetrated to damage ship internals. And each weapon has its own unique damage profile. Laser will mostly dig a deep hole out of the armor matrix while a massdrive mostly chew out a wide but shallow chunk of armor. projectile with explosive warhead and penetration capacity will dig a narrow hole into armor matrix before detonate and create a large chunk of damaged blocks deeper down. General armor resistence is applyed depending on ship class to simulate better protection level on larger ships. One can now manually rotate ship to hide damaged armor away from enemy and limited vertical maneuver (upper, middle ,lower plane)\n\nSo for sure the dev didn't just put some eyecandy on graphic engine and make it a sequel. There is very serious work involved and based on words on its wiki page, scenarios are not yet published because the same staff is working on AI improvement and that's clearly of higher priority than a few scripted maps.\n\nSo the game is very much mutural at this stage yet with prospect of further update to push it even higher. It makes Sins of a Solar Empire like an arcade game. But since arcade is also fun on its own term, it again comes down to personal taste and preference.","May 4, 2014","true","66.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

No, I don't think so: the UI is clumsy, tool-tips are often misleading, it has many odd artifacts, the diplomatic system is impentrable, and SotSII slows down significantly late game.

In truth, I bought my copy from Bundle Stars (Steam key) and got the game for less than $1.00, and at THAT price it is a bargain.\n\nKerberos has stabilized the game significantly from it's initial release and I've played 1,000 turn games without a crash.  The battles are beautiful and tactically interesting, the tech tree is much improved over the original SotS, and the economics aspect of the game is virtually hands-free.\n\nIt appears that Kerberos made several player-requested changes to the game, but ran out of funding before all of them could be implemented (such as the post-it feature from the first game) and the instruction manual/tool-tips updated.  It would behoove any new players to visit the Kerberos website and browse the forums because many of the changes to the game are explained there.\n\nI recommend this game to any player who is a patient fan of the space 4X genre and is willing to devote some time exploring for its undocumented features.","April 28, 2014","true","758.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I loved, absolutely loved Sword of the Stars, amazing game and a great experience but this... this is just something else entirely.  Imagine a good game being assembling a car part by part (a part being the engine, frame, a door, ect.) and this game is assembling a car piece by piece. (all 57,000 pieces of the engine, ect.)  It's just ridiculously overly complicated and the UI is painful to get used to and just when you think you're getting the hang of things you find some obscure option that turned out to be critical for development and you should have done that 50 turns ago, oops.  I spent 6 hours in this game and never even made it to a battle, I spent all my time trying to figure out wtf to do and starting over a few times because I found out something that I crippled myself by not doing way sooner.\n\nI've seen videos and the graphics are awesome, the battles look amazing and I really wanted to experience some epic battles but I never made it that far because I couldn't bring myself to wade through the toxic wasteland of horrible interface and complex development to make it to a decent battle.  It really pains me how horrible this game turned out to be, I wanted it to be amazing, I had a dream... a dream which was utterly crushed when the game released.  My dream was restored when I saw the "enhanced edition" with "blah blah fixes ect ect" only to be crushed again by the fact that the game was awful.  By the time you can make it to a battle in this game you could completely finish any other decent game and actually enjoy part of that time.

I really wanted this game to be great. I payed for it, waited for the devs to patch it up, debug and finish it, so I could play.\nIt is broken. It may not crash anymore, but it is not playable. Almost everything great about the previous game is destroyed with the new design and this is not something you can patch away.\nSotS1 was dynamic. You could build 3 recon destroyers and send them every turn, a little later send some tankers so the recon ships could refuel and continue exploring. By turn 20 you could have 20 explored systems and a couple colonized worlds.\nIn SotS2 yo ucan't send destroyers, you have to send cruisers, which are about 3 times more expensive - so 1 per turn, not 3. You can't send a recon ship alone, you have to have a fleet with a mission vessel, tanker and command ship (which was optional before) - so fleets are sent every 3 turns. Lastly, due to the awful mission system you have to send the fleet, wait for it to exlore the system AND return bofore it can be sent again. No more chain-exploring. The game drags on like torture.\nSotS1 had great UI for its time. Since then there has been incredible progress in UI design, and the menu flow and information presentation could have been inproved, if the game designers had learned from the competition. They did not. The UI is a monster that has to be endured, not used.\nIt is all so frustrating, because beneath all this there is a game trying to shine. The battles are beautiful, the solar systems are big and complex.  If they make SotS Remastered with the design of SotS1 and the graphics and solar systems of SotS2 I'd buy it without hesitation.

I haven't received any updates on it for awhile, so it's probably somewhat stable, but the beginning left such a sour taste in my mouth, especially compared to the first game, that I cannot justify recommending this to anyone.\n\nPros:\nIt's pretty\nAdded some new content like upgradeable space stations\n\nCons:\nTremendous effort required after launch to make playable\nStill not optimized\nGameplay takes most of the good stuff from SotS and makes the graphics prettier, but also changes some functionality tremendously; ALL of the tech tree except for guaranteed techs for each race requires studying before you can even determine if it can be researched, which means you basically have to research a tech to find out if you can gain it, and THEN you can actually research it to gain it\nSpace stations require tremendous resources to use, but seem to be vital to a functioning economy\n"new ship class: Leviathan", except they removed the drones from SotS, and now destroyers are carried on larger ships, so they just shuffled names: drones are destroyers, destroyers are cruisers, cruisers are dreadnaughts, dreadnaughts are leviathans. That's not a feature, but they act like it is. That was the point of their first trailer for the game.\n\n\nJust avoid it.

Firstly, this game's bugs makes sonic 06 look like Mario Galaxy 2. Sometimes, the bugs make the game all out unplayable (as in I cannot even get to the title sequence). But let's take a look at the gameplay. It is also terrible. Right off the back, I can tell that they were either clueless about faction balancing or just flat-out didn't care. The Loa faction is capable of wiping out the entire solar system controlled by an enemy without even having to invade the system and that leaves the other factions incapable of responing to the situation (which is the last thing a strategy game should have).  I would love to tell you about the diplomacy section, but it doesn't work, so I can't tell you about it. The graphics are good, but the game has terrible lag and will often ruin your experience of emersion. The nail in the coffin, however, is the lack of feedback this game gives you. This game has alot of factors that influences your performance (aka. public opinion, economy, ect.) and virtually no way of telling you about it. You will easily find yourself fighting a powerful military with construction ships.

The game has had a year of patches and features are still non-functional, the AI is laughable, and there are still bugs and crashes.\n\nThe Nitty Gritty: The developers put out the game as a steaming mess, almost every feature in the game non-functional. Literally, every feature, from combat to building to trading to diplomacy. Everything was horrendous. After a year and a 'free' expansion, the game still has features and techs that don't function. Unfortunately, the rate of patches and updates released for it has slowed, as the developer has essentially run out of money to fund it, instead having to turn to other games to try and garner the neccessary funds to continue releasing patches.\n\nIn essence, the game is a traditional turn-based 4x, with a focus on combat rather than the micro-management of an empire. Credit given where it is due, the combat is pretty, with satisfying weapons and ships that look great when they go boom. The game uses an armor-matrix system instead of health to determine the damage ships take, with boxes of armor mitigating damage till weapons penetrate the hull, and even then you have to hit something critical to put the ship out of commision. Of course, its hard to tell what the critical hits actually do, because it provides little information in game, forcing you to go to an external wiki.\n\nThe tech tree is satisfying, with tons of different options and plenty of weapons, enforcing the focus on fighting. You can construct stations and devote them to each of the various trees to help you develop techs faster, giving you an edge on the opponent, but it can get expensive quick. Stations are also fairly easy to kill, so must be defended. For veterans of the original game, the tech tree doesnt go much higher than antimatter, but is diverse enough to make you want to see everything in it. The addition of battle riders, smaller ships carried into battle by larger ones, is welcome, though the interface for working with them is frustrating, making you assign them to each ship capable of carrying them, rather than just filling them up. Micromanagement where there should be an option to bypass it makes the game frustrating in several situations like this, especially when its in referance to a bunch of ships that are going to get blown away and have to be replaced every battle.\n\nThe UI is usable, with everything fairly clear and easy to understand. Everything is controlled by sliders, allowing you to easily dedicate your empire to production or research, while still allowing you to drill down and make planets do specific tasks for you. The Empire Overview is another section that could use some more explanation, as some of the sliders seem arbitrary but serve purposes, such as the ones relating to security. Most of the complexity in the interface could be easily served by a tutorial, which the game lacks, instead relying on an overlay which you can toggle which is supposed to point out how everything works.\n\nAs of this writing, most things are functional, with combat not crashing all the time, trade working as intended, and the interface being usable, if not sometimes cryptic. However, the AI is still lacking any challenge at all to a human player, end of turn times are still bad, and diplomacy is still in what essentially appears to be place-holder graphics, with little to no built-in explanation of what anything does. Several technologies are not working, with vague descriptions of what they should do. The developers have done a good job of making it playable, and for that I applaud them, but the state of the game at release  was unforgiveable and should not be forgotten.\n\nOverall, the game is playable and moderately fun, with combat being the highlight of the game. Lousy AI makes it rather repetitive unfortunately, because it forces you to fight over every single planet they own. Diplomacy is still cryptic, and turn times are still a little long, but you can now get through an entire game from start to finish. I recommend playing it with your friends if at all, because that is the only challenge you will get with it, and the only way the diplomacy makes any sense. The unfortunate reality of having to have the wiki open in another window at all times is frustrating, because all the information should be given in game, but is not.\n\nI still do not recommend buying it, even with the developers attempts to make good by their players, because it was unnacceptable to launch it in such a state, and judging by the rate of updates now, it will never be in a complete state. If you dont mind learning the interface and stumbling through things, then you can find some enjoyment in it.","December 2, 2013","false","227.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The turn-based 4x style brings things down to a more manageable fleet based system, giving a size limit on fleets that may be used at the tactical level; also letting you customie ships through module and turret hardpoints on ship hulls, as well as by arranging 3 ship sections together while balancing limiting statistics to help with the overall balance of the game.\n\nNothing that I have said will do justice to this ambitious work, which is in constant support from its developers.

The days of Masters of Orion, Stars! and Galactic Civilizations are long gone, and gamers have relatively few quality places to turn to in order to get their fix of eXploring the galaxy, eXpanding their civilizations, eXploiting resources to build up those civilizations and ultimately eXterminating their opponents. Currently, the genre is mostly represented by small studios, indie developers keeping the dream alive.\nSword of the Stars II seems to have a lot going for it, in that it has a lot of promise. The game is a pure, nearly traditional, entry into the space-faring 4X genre, whose staples include leading your race across the galaxy, colonizing worlds and researching new technology, designing and building your own ships to do battle and build up your civilization, and eventually making war upon your enemies, often with spectacularly cinematic space-battles. Sword of the Stars II embraces its 4X heritage, delivering on each of the X’s via deep and intricate systems of gameplay, including seven different factions, each with their own game-changing way of traversing the cosmos.","December 20, 2015","true","106.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, the combat is the worst thing I've ever had to sit through in my entire life. Ships move entirely too slowly, so most of the time spent on this game is waiting for ships to get in range. Yes, that's right - you will spend more time waiting for your fleets to engage than doing any other 4X-related things.\n\nThe mechanics of this game might be more cryptic than Dwarf Fortress (a game I love, btw) with very little help for new players aside from a few vague detail screens. This would be fine, but most of the game's systems are counter-intuitive and it takes so long to figure everything out that I constantly found my self asking "why am I doing this?"\n\nThere are some redeeming things about the game. The interface is pretty cool. The graphics are decent. Combat might be fun in the later stages if you can ever figure out how to get that far without punching a fist through the screen in frustration.\n\nThe game is worth a try if it's on sale, but don't expect this to be a game you'll constantly be going back to.","May 3, 2014","false","13.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It does an ok job at it.  Bottom line: If you're going to buy this game, purchase it during one of Steam's sales and don't pay the $19.99 asking price.\n\nThe real-time combat is very well presented, albeit somewhat frustrating.  The controls are wonky and imprecise.  The ships appear to "skate" across space, making the physics somewhat questionable.  The increasing levels of battle damage are nice to look at, but don't exactly give an accurate representation of your ship's status.\n\nThe turn-based strateg part is frustratingly complex.  The research tree takes entirely too long to work your way through with the possibility of not being able to research a technology a very real thing.  The economics of the game are probably the important aspect of it; requiring you to research that before anything else unless you want to be in debt up to your eyeballs.\n\nThe games themselves take entirely too long to load up once you start approaching the triple digit turn mark.  And once you finally do manage to get the game loaded, individual turns themselves take between 30 seconds and a minute to generate, even if you haven't explored the rest of the galaxy.

As with Prime SotS2 was as broken as it could on release with more features not working than did.\nKerberos made Prime into a great game with its DLC's (though kinda screwed over their initial customers). This seemed to be going into the same direction, but it isnt.\n\nSotS2 is a very nice looking game with a number of really interesting features. However, it still is a very unfinished product and it is very clear Kerberos stopped development. Which would not be that bad if the AI would be able to put up a good fight, specially late game. The AI however can only seem to be able to destroy its own economy.\n\nThe default routine for the AI when set to hard is sort of like the following:\n-Heavy on research, colonization second (you'll easilly outgrow the AI even if you allow the AI to start with 6 planets, even when playing as Hiver).\n-When the AI meets you, 1-3 turns later it will declare war on you.\n-AI goes into overdrive redesigning ships and kills its economy trying to build these redesigned ships.\n-As a results you'll find yourself spammed with small/halfbuild fleets even when you have Leviathans on defense.\n\nAlso, research is basicly the same as in Prime. No you dont have to research cruisers, but it is still the same as in Prime as now you just have an extra stage attached to the end. However the extra strage (Leviathans) are boring, slow, strategicly only usefull on defense. Specially so since you can build as many Flagships as you like and below the math:\nLeviathan: 54CP cost, can fit 2 in a fleet with 2 Dreads or add 5 Dreads.\nFlagship: 18CP cost, can fit an additional 6 Dreads in the fleet.\n\nSince the Flagship has better speed and is much more affordable you have the choice between a moderatly expensive 7 Dreads-Fleet (Flagship), or a hugelly expensive 1 Leviathan + 5 Dreads-Fleet.\n\nAll and all, as a game that should entertain I recommend you stay clear of this and try something else.\nIf you do not care about a (semi-)competitive game, or intend to only use it in MP, it sure is worth €15-ish.\nI sure do advice you turn of random events and mod out pirates .. boy are those annoying features!","February 21, 2015","false","167.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The economics of the game are probably the important aspect of it; requiring you to research that before anything else unless you want to be in debt up to your eyeballs.\n\nThe games themselves take entirely too long to load up once you start approaching the triple digit turn mark.  And once you finally do manage to get the game loaded, individual turns themselves take between 30 seconds and a minute to generate, even if you haven't explored the rest of the galaxy.  That's unacceptably long, in my opinion.","January 1, 2015","false","77.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They completely changed it compared to the original SoTS. If they would have just added a lot more features instead of changing it so much I would have felt that it was a better game. There is now way too much you have to do when trying to get your fleet together. I give this game a -5/10 since they decided to tarnish the title of SoTS with this junk heap.

However, that is not one of the problems this game has, rather I found it to be one of it's strengths, once you become accustomed to it, There's a wide variety of things to do, from managing morale to income to trading to ship design to exploration (basically everything you'd expect in a 4x game) but with so many modifiers that change or alter how you can go about these that it's overwhelming at first.\n\nIt's real flaws are mostly (I've found) in the technical department of the game. The menus can be a bit clunky at time, especially in the SotSpedia, but the game itself is also clunky. Most egregiously of all, however, is the undeniable fact that the game slows down more and more the higher the turns go. At around turn 200, the opening of any menu usually takes a 1-2 seconds, at least. Others may take upwards of five or six seconds and the gap between the end of one turn and the beginning of the next is a silent, motionless void of 15-20 second intervals where you're not quite sure if it's actually crashed or not until it begins your turn anew. And you might be thinking "Oh, well, 200 turns, that's near the end of the game isn't it?" I've only explored about 1/5 of the stars of the 8 player map I'm playing in that 200 turn game, and I havent run into more than 2 opposing empires. I cant even imagine how slow the game will be at turn 400, but I'm starting to doubt I'll get there.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a 4x game with an immense amount of depth and complexity and don't mind that it sadly falls a little short of good execution, give it a try. If you're a fan of the genre or the first game, get it while it's in a steam sale or something.","July 14, 2014","true","148.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As with Prime SotS2 was as broken as it could on release with more features not working than did.\nKerberos made Prime into a great game with its DLC's (though kinda screwed over their initial customers). This seemed to be going into the same direction, but it isnt.\n\nSotS2 is a very nice looking game with a number of really interesting features. However, it still is a very unfinished product and it is very clear Kerberos stopped development. Which would not be that bad if the AI would be able to put up a good fight, specially late game. The AI however can only seem to be able to destroy its own economy.\n\nThe default routine for the AI when set to hard is sort of like the following:\n-Heavy on research, colonization second (you'll easilly outgrow the AI even if you allow the AI to start with 6 planets, even when playing as Hiver).\n-When the AI meets you, 1-3 turns later it will declare war on you.\n-AI goes into overdrive redesigning ships and kills its economy trying to build these redesigned ships.\n-As a results you'll find yourself spammed with small/halfbuild fleets even when you have Leviathans on defense.\n\nAlso, research is basicly the same as in Prime. No you dont have to research cruisers, but it is still the same as in Prime as now you just have an extra stage attached to the end. However the extra strage (Leviathans) are boring, slow, strategicly only usefull on defense. Specially so since you can build as many Flagships as you like and below the math:\nLeviathan: 54CP cost, can fit 2 in a fleet with 2 Dreads or add 5 Dreads.\nFlagship: 18CP cost, can fit an additional 6 Dreads in the fleet.\n\nSince the Flagship has better speed and is much more affordable you have the choice between a moderatly expensive 7 Dreads-Fleet (Flagship), or a hugelly expensive 1 Leviathan + 5 Dreads-Fleet.\n\nAll and all, as a game that should entertain I recommend you stay clear of this and try something else.\nIf you do not care about a (semi-)competitive game, or intend to only use it in MP, it sure is worth €15-ish.\nI sure do advice you turn of random events and mod out pirates .. boy are those annoying features!","February 21, 2015","false","167.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is unfinished, and was left to die.  The combat isn't great or easy to learn, the ship design can crash often, and will be extremely annoying at times.  This being said, if you can get the game for $10 or less, it is a bargain deal, and you should immediately get it.  The research tree is a lot of fun, where you may research tech that has a % to go right, or wrong.  You could research that super weapon in 10 turns, 100 turns, or never.  And this changes EVERY match, some techs will be 100% one match, and you'll never research them another.  Faction diversity, ship diversity, battles, they are purely amazing.  You'll wonder why I recommend this game, and simply, the reason it failed isn't because of poor design values, but rather because of the developer losing faith.  The game itself has flaws, but is still fun and interesting.  Travel between systems changes depending on what faction you are.  The Hivers that have the slowest ship travel time, have gates, that take forever to move into positon, one per area, the reason for this is because they have some of the biggest mobility I have ever seen.  They can instantly transport from one side of the universe to the next, by taking a gate at their homeworld, they can repel an attack, or assault an enemy, instantly.  If you build a gate at your staging area (a system you mass troops in a strategy game), and then build a corresponding gate near your enemy base, will take forever to get there though, you can instantaneously mobilize your troops to attack, or defend any system with a gate, you can move reinforcements, or colonizing units, etc.  Each faction differs, the slave takers bore their way through space and leave a trail for their ships to follow, which is one of the fastest (minus Hiver teleport) if not the fastest method of travel, however their boreholes decay over time.  The humans are the most balanced, they can fly from system to system at a rather decent rate, and have no decay, but must follow the paths between the stars to do this (predetermined paths vs creating a path).  There are even more factions.   Planetary invasions are fun.  You can research a shuttle to invade (pretty much a must), design ships for firing on planets, or even research bio plagues (including zombie plague), equip them to a ship, and fire the plague onto the planet, and laugh as after the battle, their colony slowly dies.  Its definitely not going to win any game of the year awards, and has many issues, but if you can get it cheap enough on sale, then it is definitely worth a look.","April 20, 2013","true","45.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's massive. It's not overly complicated but there's an awful lot of depth. It had some bad reviews upon release but glitches have been ironed out and it works like a dream now. Never tried the multi-player though.  After 4 failed campaigns on single player I bit the bullet and sat down with some pop corn, red bull and some smokes, to watch a 6 hour play through that some guy had posted on youtube. That allowed me to make a better start, turn up the difficulty to max and plough onwards. I'm playing now as my second choice race and the differences are more than enough to want to play through as the remaining races at some point. Shelf-life-tastic!! I'm a big total war fan and this was the game i bought when i realised Rome2 was a bucket of ****. Rome2 still sucks.

The game also lacks a consistent UI (sometime one can click on planet names, sometime not) and overview lists (to look at all the potential planets for colonization one has to click through a list of systems and will only be shown the planets in each system).\n\nFinally, despite contrary claims by the developers, the AI appears to cheat. Otherwise some behaviour (such as sending a "Demand" on turn 14 which requires 25 diplomacy points for human players which is basically unachievable till then due to reseach and construction necessary to get them) cannot be explained.

I myself am moving to SotS 1 and unless I see a major update I doubt I will ever open up this game again\nedit, if you have played SotS 1 and therefore actually have a clue what you are doing and are willing to put up the bugs then I guess it isn't all bad but I would still say dont get this one as it isn't worth it, just get SotS 1 instead","May 14, 2015","false","126.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely amazing. All the ships look as unique as they did in the first. This is a true sequal. Sounds are good, battles are flashy. Feels good, looks beautiful.\n\nI myself, like this game.\n\nHowever, its not without faults. Although its really similar to the first title, the UI is definantly a bit clunkier. Even to someone who is used to all the UI options, its confuseing. But, one can learn it all rather quickly.\n\nCrashes, at random. Not often, but at times quite frustrateing.\n\nAs a fan of the series, I think its a good game. But not as grand as the first. There are fewer map options and even fewer map customization options. The game feels a bit more restrictive to the first. A gripe, but nothing you can't just look over.\n\n6/10 Only if you've played and loved the original. (Edit: I made this lower since ive been playing the first with some friends recently. As I told them about the second, it felt even worse than I thought and I had to re-think this score.)\n\n3/10 If you throw yourself into it.(Edit: ^ ^ ^)\n\nIf your interested in SOTSII, go play the first.","January 4, 2015","false","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
