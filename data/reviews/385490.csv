Such a basic idea, screwed up.\n\nSecond Review Below.\n\nAfter buying (Los) Minidrivers again, I have seen that, indeed the creators asking for a good review for 5000 in-game currency, Which seems desperate\n\nAnyway, In the races i've seen, If a AI driver gets ahead of you, they will win, not matter what you do.\n\nThe background is ALWAYS the same for EVERY track, Which is really embrassing to see. I assume (Los) Minibikers is the same,\n\nThe powerups are mario-kart esque, if you'd played mario-kart EVER you'll know what they do,\n\nYou need to BUY your way into the career mode, not joking, no F1 game ever, has done this, This is EA level of what the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSimply if you enjoy (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, You may find some enjoy of this game, If not I find it hard for a casual to enjoy this at all.\n\nPrevious review below.\n\n(OLD) Laggy, Unfinished, Minidrivers the game should be pulled untill the controls can be modified, Ditto for full screen. makes lag spikes less often and remove pay to win elements, I am a fan of (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, but this is garbage","September 15, 2015","false","13.6"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","34","41","3","0"

These games both have the same power-ups, tracks, racing modes and more. For that reason alone I can't in good conscious rate this positively.\n\nThis game did have a better feel than Mini Bikers I have to admit. I was able to hold the lead better and occasionally catch up to the racer ahead of me, so this added a positive element to the game... the illusion of possibly being able to win. If you buy this game though I honestly don't think you can win; you've already wasted $6 on a extremely basic, copied and low quality racing game. Sucks to be  You , Me ...

Repeat to acquire more money, upgrade your car or expand your collection. It is very much lacking by PC standards, but is pretty good for a mobile game.\n\nOnly thing I really hate about this game is the sound. Music is annoying, and sound effects are atrocious. Thankfully, you can completely disable them at any moment, and listen to whatever you want outside of the game.\n\nOverall, I give it 5/10 - average score for an average game.

Despite that, the game has several features, charms, and cutenesses that keep the fans of Adaco, the mastermind behind the original flash web video series, to enjoy themselves.\n\nMiniDrivers is, at a glance, a top-down, auto pilot racing game with superdeformed racing cars very similar to Table Top Racing and Mini Motors Racing. but the game is actually more adjustable than it appears. The options are rather simple yet effective. You can choose a different camera, steering sensitivity, and whether or not you control the pedels to fit your driving style. The control is simple and very easy, to the point it can be a hit or miss. Your car tends to have very responsive steering, so there's no real need to brake other than tricky tracks like Monaco and Japan where you'll spin like mad when overthrottling into uphill and downhill curves. especially when your car has become faster. Still, it's a decent control, and with over 20 track in over 500 events each with its own racing conditions, lap numbers, regulations, and surprisingly increasing difficulty, you can jump right into F1 with no experience, and drive for fun and challenge.\n\nThe races themselves are also "okay" in that it stimulates the F1 feel enough to enjoy. The game is on a fair balance between realism and fantasy, and the powerups are better balanced and easier to understand than F1 Race Stars, but comparing MiniDrivers to that, the game can be very lackluster.  First of all, the graphic is very, very bad. The lack of fantasy and bright color makes this game not very eye-catcing and in fact makes the game harder to play in the depressingly dark and rainy races.  The pace of the game can also be hurting, since you start very sluggish, and build you way up slowly due to how expensive the cars and upgrades are despite you having multiple ways to gain coins. The tracks can also become boring and repetitive after a while. which doesn't help in that there's variety in music at all except the flash series's main theme jingle, which is downright disappointing for this type of racing game. In most arcade racing games, each track tends to have its unique personality, in MiniDrivers, every track feels almost the same.\n\nOn the track, the powerup can be very helpful or annoying. In your hands, you can upgrades several weapons like boomerang, oil, Safety Car barrier, turbo boost, and streamroller boost to make it very effective to your races. In the hands of AIs, however, the race can be disasterious as they suddenly use them to annoy you, then crash themselves into you like idiots. Speaking of AI, they can be very frustrating. The opponents tend to run a racing line, yet go mad into corners, resulting them crashing into barriers, each other and, worst of all, into you and ruin your race. On the other hand, there's no rubberband, so AI will be left in the dust when you have an overpowered car, something which can be good or bad depend on your preference.\n\nDespite the gameplay problems, the selling point of this game is a fanservice, and they nail it correctly with the fanservice. Fans of the flash series will not be disappoint with the adorable sounds that the drivers make, and while there's only one real theme, it's catchy and enjoyable for fans. The delivery of the game is also superb, as it cutely parody all the inside F1 jokes and drivers' personalities in the ways you feel heartwarming and not offended at all. The selection of F1 cars are also very incredible. Included in the game are larger number of racers from the iOS game, mockoff F1 cars way back from the 50s to the 2000s as well as classic tracks and constantly updated car skins, tracks, and events. The problem, however, is that not everything is nice and dandy. For whatever reason, the game couldn't license the fictional catchy names like "Mini Rosso" or "Minicedes" like they used to do, and the beautiful stickers have been replaced with child's doddles. Buying a car is also rather difficult because the showroom constantly changes the selection and the cars are all very expensive despite that they're really just skin swaps with slightly different performances: a Manor can easily win against a Mercedes when fully upgraded.\n\n"Craziest races" are far from what MiniDrivers convey. The game is disappointingly lacking in graphic and sounds. Other than fanservice, there's not really anything new to add to the likes of tabletop racers, and the game simply isn't cute enough like its competitors. The gameplay, however, is rather decent and flexible, the fanservice and the delivery are very appealing, and it's in fact a rather cheap game. If you're F1 or Los MiniDrivers fan, this game should be enough to entertain you. If you're not either, then consider looking for something else.","September 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","6","15","3","0"
