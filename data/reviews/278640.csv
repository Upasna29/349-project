I started having SEGA Genesis and Super Nintendo flashbacks! :O\n\nThis game rocks! It's fun! You scoot and dash around as a little robot, shoot and blast your way through enemies (you even get a user guided homing missile) and even fly around with a jetback.\n\nOne level I found the jetpack and just start flying non-stop up in the air... going and going... and I found coins! (or whatever they are) xD. Now I'm exploring everything. :D And the controls are awesome with the 360 controller.\nThe 16 Bit style characters, backgrounds and details look great and the 16-Bit chiptune music is awesome. It's not repetitive and mixes up really well.\n\nIf you like playing old school retro style shoot-em up platform games like back in the days of Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16, then you should get this game.\nFor the price it costs, it is more than worth it. :D","July 10, 2014","true","2.0"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","30","35","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/278640/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Terrian Saga KR-17 is a mix of three genres which are action, platforming and puzzle solving. It starts off quite puzzle heavy but the later levels have a lot more action and platforming. Our protagonist is a robot that has gained sentience and goes off to take back a planet conquered by a terrorist. I learned the story via the Steam description, besides the intro the story in Terrian Saga is non existent. Accompanying you is a sentient missile which acts as your guide and is also briefly controllable when you summon him. All the dialogue is presented in text, there is no voice acting.\n\nWhen you first gain control of your character one of the first things you will notice is that the game is locked at 30fps. That is not a deal breaker but it does affect the game negatively. Your KR-17 robot comes equipped with your basic blaster and a grenade launcher. The grenade launcher uses up energy but it is a very small amount and kills most enemies with one hit. That's the weapon to go with unless you are out of energy and have to resort to the blaster. Energy is recharged via stations scattered about the level and they are usually close enough that you will rarely run out.  You can also summon your sentient missile friend but that does cost quite a chunk of energy.\n\nThe missile is controllable but once he starts moving he can't stop and if he crashes he will disappear causing you to waste more energy summoning him again. He is very useful to hit hard to reach enemies and is also used to go into places your character can't to destroy a certain object. These sections start off easy enough though they quickly become a pain as they demand further precision and add a lot of sharp turns. They are not short sections either, they take quite a while and simply scraping into something destroys you causing the missile to be summoned again from the start. Your hitbox being so large does not help either.\n\nKR-17 controls much better though he does also suffer from having a large hitbox which an be a pain when forced to avoid insta-death obstacles tiny areas. The game does start off very easy and you may think it is much more of a puzzle game than anything else. You'd be dead wrong. It won't take long for this game to get very brutal and you will need fast reaction speeds. You will be facing much more dangerous and numerous enemies as well as tougher platforming. That is when the game truly gets fun and becomes something in the veins of Mega Man. Though no where near as brutal as that since you have infinite lives and save stations are usually scattered close together.\n\nCertain levels sections do not have save stations and you have to beat it all in one go. One particularly troublesome section is one where you have to stand on a tiny log throughout a water filled level. The slightest touch of water will cause you to explode and that level dragged on far too long. Don't get me wrong it is fun but do not be expecting an easy laid back puzzle/platformer after the first couple of levels. One thing that is a problem though is that certain objects in the foreground can block view of your character which is problematic when facing enemies or jumping over hazards. It is not a common occurrence though. There are also some pads which will either drop down or bounce you up that probably will cause your death if you did not expect it. Changing the colors of the pad would have been an easy fix to be able to tell them apart.\n\nNothing about the environments feel felt memorable or unique, just random pieces of map sown together to form a level. The artstyle itself is very nice and is 32 bit instead of the usual 8 or 16 most indies use. Music is decent. Nothing special but it gets the job done. The hud is great and simple to understand though at times it can hide the view of enemies or obstacles and cause you to take damage due to it. You can take up to five hits from enemies or most obstacles and you refill it by finding a red floating crystal. Be careful though, the frames of invincibility after being hit are very few and you will likely get hit multiple times in succession if you are not able to escape after getting damaged.\n\nTerrian Saga KR-17 was a nice surprise. I believe it to be a hidden gem that is rough around the edges. It really does feels like this would have been a classic game if this was released back in the day. The 30 FPS cap was an odd decision that took some enjoyment out of it and other problems do bring it down from being great. Overall this is definitely a title to check out if you like platformers, puzzles and the action genre. If you don't like even one of those this may not be the game for you. All three genres are mixed very well and persist throughout the entire game. For those of you that do enjoy all three, Terrian Saga KR-17 is definitely a title worth considering.","June 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/recommended/278640/","wanderbot","Wanderbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/","1083 products in account","KR-17 is pretty obviously a retro-style platformer that harkens back to the good old days of the SNES. It plays very similarly to the 2D Duke Nukem Games or Megaman, but with some different twists. Really, if you like games from this genre, at $4- you can't really go wrong here. It won't knock your socks off, but it'll be a pretty good nostalgia trip.\n\nFeatures:\n* Gameplay is pretty generic, jumping shooting are standard faire.\n* You have 4 extra attacks, plus a guided missile, largely for enemy destruction, but sometimes for puzzle solving. They're largely unecessary, but can be useful in certain cases. The guided rocket is a bit OP if you can manage to control it properly.\n* The soundtrack is pretty solid, and while the songs can get repetitive, you won't be around a level long enough for it to get annoying.\n* Most levels are pretty simple: the only goal is to reach the exit. Unfortunately, most levels require you to flip a bunch of switches, and it's pretty easy to miss one or two. Doesn't take much time to go back and find them, but its still a bit annoying.\n* The controls are weird. Especially with the jetpack (you have to hold up on the right stick, and move horizontally with the left stick, otherwise you'll stop flying and probably die). Once you get used to that, it's pretty smooth.\n* The enemies feel more like traps/obstacles than proper opponents, which isn't bad, but it does make them feel a little slapped down on the levels.\n\nAlso, here are our thoughts in video form!\nhttp://youtu.be/_JNoi7KA-As","July 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","1"

The game is somewhat charming, has a decent soundtrack, ok controls, and a few different attack types, plus a controlled companion rocket to blast enemies. While playing the game i was thinking it was going to be priced at 10 or 15 dollars, and so i thought it might be not worth it, but seeing as it's 5 dollars (and less with launch sale) I'm going to go ahead and say get it. It has a lot of levels to play through and objects to finish through them. But here's why i was think it wasn't worth it, for me atleast.\nOne is that the some of the boss fights (like the first one) is a sort of a race fight where you run from imminent death, dodging attacks and not falling, that's fine but the level wasn't a good design, so i found myself frustratingly dying because of it, and there isn't any check points durring these fights so you would restart it from the begging.\nAnother problem is one of the levels where you have to stand on a moving platform moving to the end of that level, you have to keep adjusting your movement on that platform so you won't fall (left and right arrow keys) and sometimes jump, now that's fine, but when the controls aren't as responsive as you need it to be, you will find yourselft not preforming these tasks the way you would expect, also when you double-hit left or right arrow keys fast you would dash in the direction you pressed them, and since you press them fast to keep your balance on the moving platform, you would accidentally dash away from the platform and die, and also there is not check point for those kinds of levels too.\nSo the gist of it is, some levels are badly designed, and controls aren't as tight as you want them to be. But make your choice, i was going to not recommend it but seeing as it's 5 dollars, i say get it why not, just remember that some levels will frustrate you.\nI just hope the devs make a more tested, with more tight controls, and see things more clearly before they release their next platforming game if they ever make another one.","July 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","2"

Controls are tight and responsive, but the dash is too easy to trigger when trying to make precise corrections, and the game sort of forces you into that kind of situation from time to time. In some places distinguishing between background and foreground tiles is impossible and you end up face-planting into a wall, which is frustrating.\n\nOverall the game isn't really shaky, but it's still far from solid. I feel like someone decided to make a platformer, then at the 80% mark they said, "Ah, that's good enough."\n\nIt's not bad or anything, there's just nothing to recommend it when there's plenty of more polished platformers competing against it. If you're really hard up for a platformer then you may like it, otherwise you're probably better off looking for something else.","November 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","33","56","2","6"

Colors are mishmashed and thrown together (why are background objects as bright as foreground ones), the environments have WAY too much clutter, sometimes it's hard to tell what is a platform or ground from the background, and at too many times there is foreground foliage that blocks too much of your view (If this is unintentional it's an amateur mistake, if it's intentional it is neither fun nor challenging). The cutscenes look awful as well.\n\nThe controls are sometimes awkward and ANY area involving pushing moveable crates onto water is a headache. Why doesn't the robot simply move along with the crate? Why do I need to manually move him along with it? Again, this isn't fun and it's a terribly cheap challenge. There is a level in stage two where you need to do this for an extended amount of time without any checkpoints and it is unbelieveably frustrating (I have actually quit the game since this area and do not intend to come back).\n\nApparently no one tested the levels for collision either as far too many levels with the jetpack allow to move behind walls or enviromental objects you're not supposed to, some of which trap you or kill you or all around mislead you.\n\nIt doesn't help that certain enemies come in different sizes and are not easily destroyed by your guns. This is most noticeable in the spider boss level where you simply cannot shoot the green enemies blocking your path because they're at an awkward height. This would have been easily fixed simply by not having the grenade attack hurt you ala Metroid. And while you have multiple weapons at your disposal almost none of them are very useful outside of the grenade.\n\nAnd speaking of the spider boss, why is the boss level in the MIDDLE of the world? Why did the world just end a couple levels later when I went down a random sewer pipe? The pacing is just bizarre.\n\nI wanted to like the game, and I realize it's probably a first attempt at making a game, but this is just too unfinished and poorly thought out for me to enjoy. This could have easily used more time in the kitchen, first attempt or not.","July 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

But I can't give a very in-depth review since I haven't played long but thought I'd give a small criticism since it's still fresh in my mind. One issue with this game and some retro-ish games is that the distinciton between passive/background elements and active/foreground elements isn't always very distinguished so sometimes when playing, as a new player, I don't always know what blocks or objects I can interact with and what I can't.

Also , this might sound weird , but it looked better on a larger monitor.\n\nLet me start by saying I like this game but can not recommend it because of the following reasons:\n\nFirst of all: There are flying enemies AND YOU CANT SHOOT UP. Only way to kill flying enemies is to use the rocket ,which consumes like a third of your ammo.\n\nThe visuals are nice enough ,but the color and inconsistency of the sprites makes it hard to know which sprite is a platform and which is part of the background , and trying to jump on a piece of background is a pretty dumb way to die.\n\nThere have also been some poor choices in using said sprites , like for instance in the second area there was a level where you had to navigate a cave while riding a crate floating in water (water instakills you btw) and for some reason the dev decided it would be a good idea to put non transparent sprites in the foreground so they hide the crate you are supposed to ride. That wouldh nave been much of a problem if it weren't for the fact that when you ride crates , you dont really ride them like in most platformers , you have to move with them. if you stop pressing left every 0.5 seconds the crate just continues on its way leaving you to your watery death. Ok thats fine , but they had barrels (or are they wooden logs) that act the same way, which makes sense, as the water is flowing the barrel is turning so you'd have to balance on it. But why crates. In fact , why not putting barrels instead of crates . Jumping feels unresponsive compared to some other platformers , when you get to the spider boss thingy , you'll know what I mean. This appears to be fixed by turning vsync off\n\nSome sections where you need to control your rocket buddy can be frustrating as hell ,the gaps are way too small , the corners way too sharp and the rocket dude moves way too fast to be controlled adequately , especially with an analogue stick. Most of the longer rocket flying sections will probably take you a few tries to get right , which really breaks the game pacing for me.\n\nThere is a game section where you need to hack computer terminals. Hacking is ok except , the game does not pause while you hack. So if there are any enemies around they will attack you. And you cant stop the hacking too , the only way to get out of hacking mode is to mess up. Which costs you one health bar , so you might as well let the baddies hit you.\n\nOther things I just find odd:\n\nThe boss sprites look kinda out of place , like the art was made by a different person or even for a different game.\n\nThe "cinematics" (Im using that word for the lack of a better one) look weird too , for the same reason , in game sprites look nice and you can tell some work went into them , but the characters in the cinematics look iffy. Like they were drawn in a hurry and then pixelated a little to look more like they fit the whole 16 bit theme.\n\nOther than that its a nice game , with some challenge to it.","July 20, 2015","false","10.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/278640/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Never had a game I enjoyed so much at the start, that just kept worse and worse till it wasn't worth playing anymore. The game is initially awesome, with a megaman feel, being a platformer lite on story, with spunky music and 90's aesthetic. There are a few minor annoyances, like how much special the rocket takes, or how you can't aim to shoot people, which seems like a obvious addition these days since you take so much unnecessary damage from having to jump up in fire to shoot or not being able to shoot some one above you who is shooting down on you. These are minor problems. The game is also pretty long for a platformer, meaning you get good bang for your buck. It is obnoxious how many levels follow the same Doom format of having to find a set number of colored keys in order, unlocking doors forward or ahead to beat the level, or having to press a preset number of switches till you can leave the level. Many of the levels have similar vibes and feelings of being inside robotic facitilities, but once again all of these mentioned above do little more than hinder the experience. The game is also semi tough but not stupidly so, with no set number of lives to beat everything, and some mid-level save points. Jumping was also done very well, not too floaty.\n\nThe real problem is with a few TERRIBLE design, controls, and mechanic desicions that are then focused and reinforced so much so in later levels to a baffling degree. First off is the guided rocket. The control of this is absolutely awful. Instead of moving free in space as would make sense, it moves super fast along in a single square-by-square basis. The game then requires you to navigate tiny little mazes. If it were free range you would be able to use skill, reflexes, and aiming. This version is just stupid. It moves super fast and the response is delayed. Since it moves square to square sometimes you turn and you are too high or low to make a smaller tunnel, but you basically can't do anything because you stopped on that square. You cannot make minor adjustments as it moves too fast. The D-pad is too hard to move from horizontal to vertical for quick turns. The analog is also finnicky and hard to be consistent with, meaning neither controller options work. Then the game makes you do this long mazes that are super narrow, forcing you to make perfect turns and then 5 in a row. If you touch the wall you instant die, and some parts involve 20-30 seconds of this straight, and if you die you need to do it all again. This is frustrating being forced to replay parts of the maze you beat  just to play trial and error with a terrible system. Deaths never feel your fault.\n\nThen there is the jetpack. Once again, instead of just a natural free-flowing jetpack you move around, it is not intuitive. You hold up to move up, and let go to move down, and press side to side to move sideways. This is also supper finnicky and annoying to use. The analog stick is unusable by itself, as pressing up moves you flying up too quickly. The d-pad is also impossible to move because you have to slide from up to side back to up, and it is finnicky. This means the best option is using the d-pad to move up, while the other hand controls the analog to move forward. That is how terrible the controls are and the mechanic is implimented, you need to use both analog and d-pad at same time to work best. Again multiple parts later on have you navigate these areas covered on all sides with instant-death walls, which the game loves to overuse. So you will finally be moving well and suddenly the finnicky jetpack goes up too fast and you instant die, making you redo your perfect flying earlier, just to get back and past that part, only to die on a later part and do it again. The parts, like the mazes, should be shorter to not inflate cheap replayability. And some parts make you shoot guys while moving the jetpack through instant death spots, making the controls even worse.\n\nThen there is the moving platform/object mechanic. In every single platform game on any system ever, when you jump on a log moving in water, or stand on an object/platform that is moving, you move with it, because you know, science/logic. Well in this game for some stupid reason (to add unnecessary difficulty to something simple) the object moves but you don't. So this means each time you have to keep moving along with this moving object, randomly tapping forward for long periods of time, with any mistake meaning instant death. Then there is the dash ability. Instead of making sense and using one of the many unused buttons, so it is botton/simultaneous button dependent like megaman or other games, it relies on an unreliable double tap forward. The first problem is it only works like 2/3 of the time. It does not work with analog stick. Only arrows. So once again another mechanic that only works with 1 of the 2 possible directional controls, cutting down on options. Other times, since you have to press forward multiple times in parts, this can lead to you dashing when you don't want to when you were trying to move forward, leading to many unintentional deaths that aren’t your fault.\n\nThen there are certain level designs. Normally they have saves in most levels, but then there are levels that for some reason use tons of instant deaths/only instant death, as the sole way to die, and instead of using more saves as you would think, has ZERO saves, meaning you have to replay the entire level over and over again to beat a certain part you die on if you make 1 single mistake. For a game that stayed away from this so well, forcing entire level replays is something basic and cheap that games like super meat boy do, but I got the original impression this would be different. There will be levels that throw many of these terrible instances together. In one level you have to use a jetpack, to get through multiple instant kill areas, shoot guys, ride platforms where you don’t move with them, etc, and if you die you do it all over again. These lead to wasted time replaying terribly controlled segments because the game makers decided to stop using common sense and put any save spots in the level. Who would think it’s a good idea to suddenly have levels where you have to do the entire thing without getting hit or touched once or you restart it all.\nThe final nail in the coffin was a boss fight. First off, instead of a fair boss fight it is one of those stupid ones where the power is out of your hands and you can’t damage him until it decides you can at certain parts. Well you have to dodge tons of mines, bombs, bullets, and object forever. The boss makes 4 continuous trips of something, instead of what actually makes sense, 1-2. The spend the entire fight not being able to hurt him and dodge while he decides to keep attacking you. When you finally make it through that long drawn out repetitive phase, you then are forced to fly through smaller narrow different level spikes with a jetpack. You get to a spot in the air where he keeps shooting at you forever, while you get shot at by rockets. You have no idea what to do, and decide you must keep dodging for what seems like forever. If you die once during any of this you start the ENTIRE long drawn out dodging process on the ground, meaning you need to waste countless time to get back up to the sky. Why they make you waste time going through a mine field with the terrible jetpack is beyond me. But why they don’t save when you made it past a long boring dodging phase, only to make you restart it all, is beyond me. Why they force levels with no saves, long drawn out fights that don’t save between phases, the terrible jetpack, moving objects, rocket aiming, and inadequate spacing of saves, is beyond me. If you want constant irritation later on in a game because you are replaying parts because the develops made dumb decisions, is never fun  The game had potential, but fortunately shoots itself in the foot. 4/10.","June 22, 2015","false","21.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

As far as the level design goes, that isn't too far off base, although fortunately for most people this game controls loads better than the Commander Keen games ever did. This game's control scheme is pretty alright, even though I do have a few complaints. Movement is handled (and this will be written with respect to the 360 controller, as playing a platformer with a keyboard just isn't a good idea) with either the analog stick or the D-pad. Double tapping left or right will make you dash, which is one of my complaints. I would've much prefered a dash button as opposed to the double tap option, as I usually tap my directions a lot whenever I try to adjust my landing. Jumping is with A, shooting is with X... pretty standard stuff.\n\nAs far as the level design goes, the first three levels are pretty much exactly the same: go destroy the thing, get keycards, shoot enemies, exit level, rinse, lather, repeat. The fourht level inexplicably changes things up, playing more like a traditional Megaman-inspired game. Beyond that... well, I didn't get further than stage four. Why? There was a puzzle room in which you have to maneuver two blocks around a small room to hold down a switch. These blocks are insanely glitchy. I broke that room eight different ways, all while still having not found the "proper" solution to the room. The blocks would sometimes fuse together, rendering them unpushable; sometimes fuse with the ceiling, land on top of you... sometimes they'll just not even bother with colission detection whatsoever.\n\nThat's not really a good reason to not recommend the game, though. Why do I not recommend this game, then? It's not so much one huge terrible thing; it's more of a death by 1,000 papercuts, to where I was just looking for an excuse to not play it. For example, moving platforms do not have friction with your sprite, meaning that you've gotta tap a lot in order to stay on that platform (which can also lead to you dashing off said platform and into an arbitrary  one-hit kill zone). One section of a level completely obscures the platform, leaving you to just guess whether or not you're still on the platform. Another section with these platforms has you inexplicably changing direction every time you drop to another waterway, leading to some cheap deaths. There's also another section in which platforms are sent out to you entirely on RNG, which can lead to you just kinda dying sometimes. Then there's the boss of area one that runs, launches bombs and knocks things down on you, only to stand still and just kinda die at the end of the level for no reason.\n\nI could probably go on for at least another few paragraphs, but suffice to say I don't think I'll be coming back to this one. Even barring those problems, this game didn't really have enough there in the first place to interest me. It's not a bad game to give to a kid who doesn't really care what they play, and they'll almost certainly get their $5 out of it. As for someone who thinks in terms of game design, this game probably won't be for you. 4/10.\n\nStory: The store page says that this game is story driven. Well, I suppose it kinda is, but it's not really too big of a deal. Of course, since I never finished the game, assigning a point value to the story would be silly, so I'm just not gonna do that.\n\nGraphics: Well, the graphics aren't bad. In fact, this is where I dare say a lot of the effort in the game went to. For the first three levels the pixel art is pretty rad, although it does drop off a bit in terms of quality around level four. Again, beyond that I can't really say much more. One thing I can say, however, is that this game seems to like adding motion blur every now and then (or as I call it, Cataract Vision). There's no way to turn it off, and if you've got motion sickness, I could see this being a bit of an issue for you. Regarding the technical side of the graphics, it of course runs at a perfect 60FPS, and it launches at a resolution which is around 1280x720, to then fullscreen to your native resolution. There didn't seem to be any resolution options other than fullscreen or not-fullscreen, so take that as you will. Given that I try to play games fullscreen at my resolution as often as possible, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. The game performs well enough (as one would expect) and the pixel art is quite good; I just wish there was a way to turn off Cataract Vision. 3/5.\n\nSound: This is where the Genesis/Mega Drive comparison really comes into play. While it isn't exclusively using the Genesis/MD sound chip, it does borrow some samples such as the bass. Either way, if you're familiar with the Genesis/MD soundchip and enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. I'm impartial to the sound chip, so I didn't really feel that strongly about it. As for the compositions themselves, they're alright in the context of the stages, but it's not something I'd listen to particularly often outside of the game. Also, I do wish they had more than one song for stage four, as the stage doesn't have any level transitions, meaning that you get to hear the same song looping for about 30-40 minutes. As for the sound effects... it's a retro inspired game; what do you expect? I will say that the sound effects do have a tendency to stack and get a bit loud, which can be a bit annoying at times, although it happens pretty rarely, so it's not the biggest deal. Overall on the sound front, it's about average for an indie retro inspired platformer. People who go coocoo for chiptunes may find a lot to love here, but as for me, it's just kinda okay. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 4/0/3/2; cumulative score of 4.5/10. It's biggest problems for me are its smaller problems and that even without said problems, there's not much else going on here. Again, if you want to get it for a kid or something, they'll probably be alright with it for a bit, but if you know some things about game design, this game isn't really gonna interest you.","February 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Graphically, the game does draw influence from blue robot games of greater repute, however, the similarities, more or less, end there.\n\nKR-17 suffers from an overall lack of polish. Graphics I often found were stretch and scaled and sometimes it was difficult to tell which was foreground and which was background. The difficulty of the challenges seem to follow no particular pattern and much of the gameplay feels a bit like filler. The bosses I found to be incredibly weak and more than half of them involved running through a gauntlet of hazards while the boss destroys the level. The music, rather than employing catch chiptunes, assaults us with MIDI-esque synthesized music. Because of the overall lack of polish, rather than feeling like a classic, it feels like a bit like a b-list side-scroller downloaded from a BBS circa 1993. This game needs at least another 6 months in the oven before it's fully baked.\n\nThe game looks better than it actually is, however if you're a vintage gamer and in the mood for this sort of gameplay, dispite it's many flaws, it does offer some respectible challenges. If you're a particular fan of this genre, pick this game up, but don't expect anything life-chaning.\n\n5.5/10","September 19, 2014","false","6.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Sometimes, though, you just have to wonder if going retro was the best choice.\n\nWith Terrian Saga: KR-17, there doesn't seem to be any real defining feature. This is a game based on the likes of MegaMan or old Apogee MS-DOS titles. It's an action platformer with a greater emphasis on platforming. These levels will require you to search for keys to progress; just like the good-old-days.\n\nStill, there really isn't much to it. You find keys, shoot enemies and progress. The game routinely stops to give you frustratingly difficult boss battles, but even those end up being too short. The game breezes by without much of a care.\n\nI suppose that could be noted as a plus, but I never felt invested in this game. The sprite work is fantastic, but the art style puts me off. It looks like a 5 year old's drawings of a "cool" robot he saw. This is almost like if Wall-E got fed up with cleaning the Earth.\n\nThe choice of weapons is almost entirely moot, too. While you have access to a bomb, a remote bomb, a claymore and flamethrower, you really only ever need the bomb. It has the most use, deals the most damage and can be lobbed a great distance. Nothing else really matters, apart from a failed attempt at diversity.\n\nYour core blaster even works quite well against every enemy. One foe requires you to dodge when shooting it, but you could take advantage of the invincibility frames and mutilate him. Nearly all the adversaries are the same, too. Just shoot, shoot and shoot some more.\n\nDo I really find the game that unenjoyable? No, honestly. The music is excellent and the level design, itself, is solid. I love old-school style games that require you to remember routes and plan out a perfect path. KR-17 has that in spades. I just wish they lasted longer.\n\nI would also like it if the game would play by it's own rules. In most levels, you have access to a dash ability. Sometimes, within the same section of levels, you lose that ability. You also get a jetpack that carries over into some levels, but not all of them. It becomes confusing and infuriating when you go to dash and then fall into an acid pit.\n\nI also have to take points off for the lame final boss and horrendous cliff-hanger ending. I'm not certain that a sequel will be inevitable, but to end your first title on what basically is a "To Be Continued" screen is just mean.\n\nStill, for $5, you could do worse. Honestly, I'd just check out some of the other retro style platformers on Steam. This one doesn't do much that would differentiate it from the pack.\n\n6/10","July 23, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nI tried playing this game on the default "intermediate" difficulty and found myself struggling with way too many near-impossible sections, so I started over on "easy" difficulty.  Only it still wasn't anywhere near "easy".  There's one section where you must make multiple, carefully timed jumps through sparks that kill you if you touch them.  I literally tried 100+ times to get through it and could only get 2/3 of the way through.  I found a forum post showing an animated gif of someone making the jumps, and with that, it "only" took me another 10 tries or so to get through the section.  Did I mention this was on "easy"?  Honestly, I don't want games to be super-easy, challenging is fine.  But there's challenging and there's nigh-on impossible.  And you shouldn't run into the latter on "easy" mode.","July 7, 2015","false","7.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You have your main blaster attack, a selection of items such as grenades, mines and a cruise missile. Occasionally you are given a jet pack so that you just fly around instead jumping.\n\nI spent the first 5 minutes or so trying to figure out the controls. I got stuck at the very beginning because I didn't know what the jump button was or how to activate objects. I had go back to the main menu a couple of times and on returning to the game you cannot skip dialogue so it was a bit tedious. Also not all the controls are listed in the menu and I found that tutorial tips are easily missed or not clear. Anyway I eventually figured it out lol. Things turned to not be too bad. You really need to look where you are going to avoid hazards in this game, some are insta-death. I frequently died and had to start from the last checkpoint. But thankfully they are generously dispersed around each map. Controlling your cruise missile is basically like playing snake. It moves quite fast and easily clips into objects and explodes prematurely. The game has lot's typical platforming type of stuff e.g. jumping from one platform to another and avoiding dangers. I preferred using the jetpack to just fly most the time over jumping.\n\nWhile the game is not really bad. I didn't feel that it was special and I don't really have any urge to play it more than I did. I didn't really feel engaged in the story and the game tends to have characteristics which are potentially annoying that you typically get with old side-scrollers. I would only recommend it to those with a passion for these kinds of retro 2D side-scrollers.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 9, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leveltheshodo/recommended/278640/","leveltheshodo","Level The Shodo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leveltheshodo/","1302 products in account","Recommendation: Yes, but this game needs some more improvements though.\n\nPros:\n- Nails the 16-bit era graphics and feel right proper.\n- Good and solid platforming! (Maybe a little too much platforming in some parts)\n- Well done spritework and music.\n\nCons:\n- Unable to rebind the movement keys. I feel incredibly awkward playing this game without being able to rebind the movement keys from the arrows to a WASD format.\n- Controls somewhat clunky. A prime and infuriating example is how the dash is to double tap. Works in theory, but attempting to stay onto a box as it moves without accidentally dashing off of it and landing into the water is a frustrating endeavor. A better way of going about this is to have a button that one can press to dash in the direction the robot is facing, or holding down a button and moving either way to dash.\n- Some minor graphical errors here and there, such as the tops of trees inexplicably hovering above parts of buildings (Not game-breaking, just strange), and some platforming issues with the box jumping area within Valiant Forest (The part where you have to jump from moving box to box along the water), as some of the boxes are spread out a little too far to actually make the jump.\n\nConclusion: Get the game, it's a nice little indie title and worth the cash, just don't expect it to be perfect. Voting up as this game has alot of promise to it! Keep up the good work guys, looking forward to seeing where this little gem goes in terms of updates!","September 19, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game looks and feels like something you might have found at the games shop in the halcyon days of the Super Nintendo, or maybe the very early tenure of the Sega Saturn (since the music is decidedly not 16-bit). It holds all the trappings of games from that era - colourful, cartoony graphics, plenty of jumping-and-shooting, and an unforgiving difficulty level which should make lovers of games like Contra extremely happy campers.\n\nYou play the part of the titular KR-17, a Terrian attack robot separated from his fleet on the hostile planet Valiant. Now, along with your trusty missile sidekick, it is your goal to reunite with your peers, by traversing a variety of areas within Valiant looking for them. Along the way, a little story unfolds which, while not bad, can easily be overlooked or skipped - the focus of this game is on challenge and gameplay, and boy does it ever deliver.\n\nLet's start with the difficulty, shall we? This game is hard. REALLY hard. Even on Easy. It is so hard, in fact, that I am left wondering if anyone plays this on Hard. The trainyard zone will give you premature grey hairs, and later areas have me thinking of uninstalling the game from how frustratingly impossible-on-purpose they are. On numerous occasions, after getting past a particularly tear-inducing obstacle only to find a WORSE one right after it, I have yelled out loud at my screen 'ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME?!'\n\nAnd yet...\n\n...and yet the game keeps you playing. You never feel like you are being made to quit. Instead, your mind is constantly telling you to give it one more try, one more go, you will beat that part next time...and all thoughts of saying 'F-- this' and leaving the game to the wayside dissipate. This was a quality many old-school platformers also had, and KR-17 manages to capture the experience of playing one of those titles perfectly.\n\nAnother asset working in favour of this game is your arsenal. You have several types of weapons to choose from, from your standard pea-shooter to bombs and flamethrowers. You can also, at any time, send your sentient missile sidekick to ram against enemies or access otherwise unreachable areas, many of which are crucial to solving a puzzle or beating a section. While the level design itself is not the most varied, these different strategic options for disposing of obstacles lend a nice bit of diversity to the game, adding to the overall experience.\n\nIn short, this is not a game that will revolutionise the industry, or even satisfy the cravings of more sophisticated gamers. It is a nostalgia-baiting indie platformer with simple graphics and a focus on fun. But if that is the kind of thing you look for from your titles, this one will not disappoint. What it does, it does well, and it never aims to do anything more than provide a blast of challenging, quirky, retro-influenced fun. If you see it at full price, consider purchasing it. If - like me - you see it on sale for a pittance, do not hesitate to get it. You will not consider your money wasted.\n\nRecommended.","May 7, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On megaman x5, you get a laser firefly, that moves slowy, and is only required in one part of the game to get a BONUS thing, it also is expensive, like in this game, but at least it pays it by being slow, controlable. The missile spends too much, and goes too quick for a REQUIRED part of the game, if you don't like using it you better learn liking it.\n\nBosses, from what i saw, don't get me wrong i couldn't get far into the game, and bought this mostly for the cards, but man, the bosses are meatboy-like, at least from the part i played, i don't know if it goes into a real fight later, but well, i can tell you this meat boy sonic the megaman is going to annoy you, specifically early, and a little less late. Due to the whole " the world is falling behind you " side scrolling, you may get anxious and accidentally dash/not dash when you needed to. It's a huge trial and error, there are check points, but not really enough to make up the speed-paced character.\n\nI know this may be just me being bad at the game, but man, sometimes countering an attack on a moba, where your main tower is on 1 hp, seems to be more enjoyable and less frustating than this.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to who doesn't have enough reflexes to deal with this, i can recommend it, to who enjoys fast paced games of different kinds (I think even a touhou fan would like to try this)\n\nIf there is any grammar/spelling error, sorry, i'm not the best when it comes to english.\n\nThat is all, i have respect for this game, i like it overall, but those gameplay issues just seem too big for me.\n\nTL;DR : I recommend in case you like fast paced, almost pixel perfect games, but i wouldn't recommend if you are more onto the slow paced, later fast paced games.\n\nPersonally i like it, but i'm just not able to get much enjoyment out of it.","December 16, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/278640/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Terrian Saga KR-17 is a mix of three genres which are action, platforming and puzzle solving. It starts off quite puzzle heavy but the later levels have a lot more action and platforming. Our protagonist is a robot that has gained sentience and goes off to take back a planet conquered by a terrorist. I learned the story via the Steam description, besides the intro the story in Terrian Saga is non existent. Accompanying you is a sentient missile which acts as your guide and is also briefly controllable when you summon him. All the dialogue is presented in text, there is no voice acting.\n\nWhen you first gain control of your character one of the first things you will notice is that the game is locked at 30fps. That is not a deal breaker but it does affect the game negatively. Your KR-17 robot comes equipped with your basic blaster and a grenade launcher. The grenade launcher uses up energy but it is a very small amount and kills most enemies with one hit. That's the weapon to go with unless you are out of energy and have to resort to the blaster. Energy is recharged via stations scattered about the level and they are usually close enough that you will rarely run out.  You can also summon your sentient missile friend but that does cost quite a chunk of energy.\n\nThe missile is controllable but once he starts moving he can't stop and if he crashes he will disappear causing you to waste more energy summoning him again. He is very useful to hit hard to reach enemies and is also used to go into places your character can't to destroy a certain object. These sections start off easy enough though they quickly become a pain as they demand further precision and add a lot of sharp turns. They are not short sections either, they take quite a while and simply scraping into something destroys you causing the missile to be summoned again from the start. Your hitbox being so large does not help either.\n\nKR-17 controls much better though he does also suffer from having a large hitbox which an be a pain when forced to avoid insta-death obstacles tiny areas. The game does start off very easy and you may think it is much more of a puzzle game than anything else. You'd be dead wrong. It won't take long for this game to get very brutal and you will need fast reaction speeds. You will be facing much more dangerous and numerous enemies as well as tougher platforming. That is when the game truly gets fun and becomes something in the veins of Mega Man. Though no where near as brutal as that since you have infinite lives and save stations are usually scattered close together.\n\nCertain levels sections do not have save stations and you have to beat it all in one go. One particularly troublesome section is one where you have to stand on a tiny log throughout a water filled level. The slightest touch of water will cause you to explode and that level dragged on far too long. Don't get me wrong it is fun but do not be expecting an easy laid back puzzle/platformer after the first couple of levels. One thing that is a problem though is that certain objects in the foreground can block view of your character which is problematic when facing enemies or jumping over hazards. It is not a common occurrence though. There are also some pads which will either drop down or bounce you up that probably will cause your death if you did not expect it. Changing the colors of the pad would have been an easy fix to be able to tell them apart.\n\nNothing about the environments feel felt memorable or unique, just random pieces of map sown together to form a level. The artstyle itself is very nice and is 32 bit instead of the usual 8 or 16 most indies use. Music is decent. Nothing special but it gets the job done. The hud is great and simple to understand though at times it can hide the view of enemies or obstacles and cause you to take damage due to it. You can take up to five hits from enemies or most obstacles and you refill it by finding a red floating crystal. Be careful though, the frames of invincibility after being hit are very few and you will likely get hit multiple times in succession if you are not able to escape after getting damaged.\n\nTerrian Saga KR-17 was a nice surprise. I believe it to be a hidden gem that is rough around the edges. It really does feels like this would have been a classic game if this was released back in the day. The 30 FPS cap was an odd decision that took some enjoyment out of it and other problems do bring it down from being great. Overall this is definitely a title to check out if you like platformers, puzzles and the action genre. If you don't like even one of those this may not be the game for you. All three genres are mixed very well and persist throughout the entire game. For those of you that do enjoy all three, Terrian Saga KR-17 is definitely a title worth considering.","June 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/recommended/278640/","wanderbot","Wanderbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/","1083 products in account","KR-17 is pretty obviously a retro-style platformer that harkens back to the good old days of the SNES. It plays very similarly to the 2D Duke Nukem Games or Megaman, but with some different twists. Really, if you like games from this genre, at $4- you can't really go wrong here. It won't knock your socks off, but it'll be a pretty good nostalgia trip.\n\nFeatures:\n* Gameplay is pretty generic, jumping shooting are standard faire.\n* You have 4 extra attacks, plus a guided missile, largely for enemy destruction, but sometimes for puzzle solving. They're largely unecessary, but can be useful in certain cases. The guided rocket is a bit OP if you can manage to control it properly.\n* The soundtrack is pretty solid, and while the songs can get repetitive, you won't be around a level long enough for it to get annoying.\n* Most levels are pretty simple: the only goal is to reach the exit. Unfortunately, most levels require you to flip a bunch of switches, and it's pretty easy to miss one or two. Doesn't take much time to go back and find them, but its still a bit annoying.\n* The controls are weird. Especially with the jetpack (you have to hold up on the right stick, and move horizontally with the left stick, otherwise you'll stop flying and probably die). Once you get used to that, it's pretty smooth.\n* The enemies feel more like traps/obstacles than proper opponents, which isn't bad, but it does make them feel a little slapped down on the levels.\n\nAlso, here are our thoughts in video form!\nhttp://youtu.be/_JNoi7KA-As","July 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","1"

The game is somewhat charming, has a decent soundtrack, ok controls, and a few different attack types, plus a controlled companion rocket to blast enemies. While playing the game i was thinking it was going to be priced at 10 or 15 dollars, and so i thought it might be not worth it, but seeing as it's 5 dollars (and less with launch sale) I'm going to go ahead and say get it. It has a lot of levels to play through and objects to finish through them. But here's why i was think it wasn't worth it, for me atleast.\nOne is that the some of the boss fights (like the first one) is a sort of a race fight where you run from imminent death, dodging attacks and not falling, that's fine but the level wasn't a good design, so i found myself frustratingly dying because of it, and there isn't any check points durring these fights so you would restart it from the begging.\nAnother problem is one of the levels where you have to stand on a moving platform moving to the end of that level, you have to keep adjusting your movement on that platform so you won't fall (left and right arrow keys) and sometimes jump, now that's fine, but when the controls aren't as responsive as you need it to be, you will find yourselft not preforming these tasks the way you would expect, also when you double-hit left or right arrow keys fast you would dash in the direction you pressed them, and since you press them fast to keep your balance on the moving platform, you would accidentally dash away from the platform and die, and also there is not check point for those kinds of levels too.\nSo the gist of it is, some levels are badly designed, and controls aren't as tight as you want them to be. But make your choice, i was going to not recommend it but seeing as it's 5 dollars, i say get it why not, just remember that some levels will frustrate you.\nI just hope the devs make a more tested, with more tight controls, and see things more clearly before they release their next platforming game if they ever make another one.","July 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","2"

In some places distinguishing between background and foreground tiles is impossible and you end up face-planting into a wall, which is frustrating.\n\nOverall the game isn't really shaky, but it's still far from solid. I feel like someone decided to make a platformer, then at the 80% mark they said, "Ah, that's good enough."\n\nIt's not bad or anything, there's just nothing to recommend it when there's plenty of more polished platformers competing against it.

Colors are mishmashed and thrown together (why are background objects as bright as foreground ones), the environments have WAY too much clutter, sometimes it's hard to tell what is a platform or ground from the background, and at too many times there is foreground foliage that blocks too much of your view (If this is unintentional it's an amateur mistake, if it's intentional it is neither fun nor challenging). The cutscenes look awful as well.\n\nThe controls are sometimes awkward and ANY area involving pushing moveable crates onto water is a headache. Why doesn't the robot simply move along with the crate? Why do I need to manually move him along with it? Again, this isn't fun and it's a terribly cheap challenge. There is a level in stage two where you need to do this for an extended amount of time without any checkpoints and it is unbelieveably frustrating (I have actually quit the game since this area and do not intend to come back).\n\nApparently no one tested the levels for collision either as far too many levels with the jetpack allow to move behind walls or enviromental objects you're not supposed to, some of which trap you or kill you or all around mislead you.\n\nIt doesn't help that certain enemies come in different sizes and are not easily destroyed by your guns. This is most noticeable in the spider boss level where you simply cannot shoot the green enemies blocking your path because they're at an awkward height. This would have been easily fixed simply by not having the grenade attack hurt you ala Metroid. And while you have multiple weapons at your disposal almost none of them are very useful outside of the grenade.\n\nAnd speaking of the spider boss, why is the boss level in the MIDDLE of the world? Why did the world just end a couple levels later when I went down a random sewer pipe? The pacing is just bizarre.\n\nI wanted to like the game, and I realize it's probably a first attempt at making a game, but this is just too unfinished and poorly thought out for me to enjoy.

But I can't give a very in-depth review since I haven't played long but thought I'd give a small criticism since it's still fresh in my mind. One issue with this game and some retro-ish games is that the distinciton between passive/background elements and active/foreground elements isn't always very distinguished so sometimes when playing, as a new player, I don't always know what blocks or objects I can interact with and what I can't.

Also , this might sound weird , but it looked better on a larger monitor.\n\nLet me start by saying I like this game but can not recommend it because of the following reasons:\n\nFirst of all: There are flying enemies AND YOU CANT SHOOT UP. Only way to kill flying enemies is to use the rocket ,which consumes like a third of your ammo.\n\nThe visuals are nice enough ,but the color and inconsistency of the sprites makes it hard to know which sprite is a platform and which is part of the background , and trying to jump on a piece of background is a pretty dumb way to die.\n\nThere have also been some poor choices in using said sprites , like for instance in the second area there was a level where you had to navigate a cave while riding a crate floating in water (water instakills you btw) and for some reason the dev decided it would be a good idea to put non transparent sprites in the foreground so they hide the crate you are supposed to ride. That wouldh nave been much of a problem if it weren't for the fact that when you ride crates , you dont really ride them like in most platformers , you have to move with them. if you stop pressing left every 0.5 seconds the crate just continues on its way leaving you to your watery death. Ok thats fine , but they had barrels (or are they wooden logs) that act the same way, which makes sense, as the water is flowing the barrel is turning so you'd have to balance on it. But why crates. In fact , why not putting barrels instead of crates . Jumping feels unresponsive compared to some other platformers , when you get to the spider boss thingy , you'll know what I mean. This appears to be fixed by turning vsync off\n\nSome sections where you need to control your rocket buddy can be frustrating as hell ,the gaps are way too small , the corners way too sharp and the rocket dude moves way too fast to be controlled adequately , especially with an analogue stick. Most of the longer rocket flying sections will probably take you a few tries to get right , which really breaks the game pacing for me.\n\nThere is a game section where you need to hack computer terminals. Hacking is ok except , the game does not pause while you hack. So if there are any enemies around they will attack you. And you cant stop the hacking too , the only way to get out of hacking mode is to mess up. Which costs you one health bar , so you might as well let the baddies hit you.\n\nOther things I just find odd:\n\nThe boss sprites look kinda out of place , like the art was made by a different person or even for a different game.\n\nThe "cinematics" (Im using that word for the lack of a better one) look weird too , for the same reason , in game sprites look nice and you can tell some work went into them , but the characters in the cinematics look iffy. Like they were drawn in a hurry and then pixelated a little to look more like they fit the whole 16 bit theme.\n\nOther than that its a nice game , with some challenge to it.","July 20, 2015","false","10.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/278640/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Never had a game I enjoyed so much at the start, that just kept worse and worse till it wasn't worth playing anymore. The game is initially awesome, with a megaman feel, being a platformer lite on story, with spunky music and 90's aesthetic. There are a few minor annoyances, like how much special the rocket takes, or how you can't aim to shoot people, which seems like a obvious addition these days since you take so much unnecessary damage from having to jump up in fire to shoot or not being able to shoot some one above you who is shooting down on you. These are minor problems. The game is also pretty long for a platformer, meaning you get good bang for your buck. It is obnoxious how many levels follow the same Doom format of having to find a set number of colored keys in order, unlocking doors forward or ahead to beat the level, or having to press a preset number of switches till you can leave the level. Many of the levels have similar vibes and feelings of being inside robotic facitilities, but once again all of these mentioned above do little more than hinder the experience. The game is also semi tough but not stupidly so, with no set number of lives to beat everything, and some mid-level save points. Jumping was also done very well, not too floaty.\n\nThe real problem is with a few TERRIBLE design, controls, and mechanic desicions that are then focused and reinforced so much so in later levels to a baffling degree. First off is the guided rocket. The control of this is absolutely awful. Instead of moving free in space as would make sense, it moves super fast along in a single square-by-square basis. The game then requires you to navigate tiny little mazes. If it were free range you would be able to use skill, reflexes, and aiming. This version is just stupid. It moves super fast and the response is delayed. Since it moves square to square sometimes you turn and you are too high or low to make a smaller tunnel, but you basically can't do anything because you stopped on that square. You cannot make minor adjustments as it moves too fast. The D-pad is too hard to move from horizontal to vertical for quick turns. The analog is also finnicky and hard to be consistent with, meaning neither controller options work. Then the game makes you do this long mazes that are super narrow, forcing you to make perfect turns and then 5 in a row. If you touch the wall you instant die, and some parts involve 20-30 seconds of this straight, and if you die you need to do it all again. This is frustrating being forced to replay parts of the maze you beat  just to play trial and error with a terrible system. Deaths never feel your fault.\n\nThen there is the jetpack. Once again, instead of just a natural free-flowing jetpack you move around, it is not intuitive. You hold up to move up, and let go to move down, and press side to side to move sideways. This is also supper finnicky and annoying to use. The analog stick is unusable by itself, as pressing up moves you flying up too quickly. The d-pad is also impossible to move because you have to slide from up to side back to up, and it is finnicky. This means the best option is using the d-pad to move up, while the other hand controls the analog to move forward. That is how terrible the controls are and the mechanic is implimented, you need to use both analog and d-pad at same time to work best. Again multiple parts later on have you navigate these areas covered on all sides with instant-death walls, which the game loves to overuse. So you will finally be moving well and suddenly the finnicky jetpack goes up too fast and you instant die, making you redo your perfect flying earlier, just to get back and past that part, only to die on a later part and do it again. The parts, like the mazes, should be shorter to not inflate cheap replayability. And some parts make you shoot guys while moving the jetpack through instant death spots, making the controls even worse.\n\nThen there is the moving platform/object mechanic. In every single platform game on any system ever, when you jump on a log moving in water, or stand on an object/platform that is moving, you move with it, because you know, science/logic. Well in this game for some stupid reason (to add unnecessary difficulty to something simple) the object moves but you don't. So this means each time you have to keep moving along with this moving object, randomly tapping forward for long periods of time, with any mistake meaning instant death. Then there is the dash ability. Instead of making sense and using one of the many unused buttons, so it is botton/simultaneous button dependent like megaman or other games, it relies on an unreliable double tap forward. The first problem is it only works like 2/3 of the time. It does not work with analog stick. Only arrows. So once again another mechanic that only works with 1 of the 2 possible directional controls, cutting down on options. Other times, since you have to press forward multiple times in parts, this can lead to you dashing when you don't want to when you were trying to move forward, leading to many unintentional deaths that aren’t your fault.\n\nThen there are certain level designs. Normally they have saves in most levels, but then there are levels that for some reason use tons of instant deaths/only instant death, as the sole way to die, and instead of using more saves as you would think, has ZERO saves, meaning you have to replay the entire level over and over again to beat a certain part you die on if you make 1 single mistake. For a game that stayed away from this so well, forcing entire level replays is something basic and cheap that games like super meat boy do, but I got the original impression this would be different. There will be levels that throw many of these terrible instances together. In one level you have to use a jetpack, to get through multiple instant kill areas, shoot guys, ride platforms where you don’t move with them, etc, and if you die you do it all over again. These lead to wasted time replaying terribly controlled segments because the game makers decided to stop using common sense and put any save spots in the level. Who would think it’s a good idea to suddenly have levels where you have to do the entire thing without getting hit or touched once or you restart it all.\nThe final nail in the coffin was a boss fight. First off, instead of a fair boss fight it is one of those stupid ones where the power is out of your hands and you can’t damage him until it decides you can at certain parts. Well you have to dodge tons of mines, bombs, bullets, and object forever. The boss makes 4 continuous trips of something, instead of what actually makes sense, 1-2. The spend the entire fight not being able to hurt him and dodge while he decides to keep attacking you. When you finally make it through that long drawn out repetitive phase, you then are forced to fly through smaller narrow different level spikes with a jetpack. You get to a spot in the air where he keeps shooting at you forever, while you get shot at by rockets. You have no idea what to do, and decide you must keep dodging for what seems like forever. If you die once during any of this you start the ENTIRE long drawn out dodging process on the ground, meaning you need to waste countless time to get back up to the sky. Why they make you waste time going through a mine field with the terrible jetpack is beyond me. But why they don’t save when you made it past a long boring dodging phase, only to make you restart it all, is beyond me. Why they force levels with no saves, long drawn out fights that don’t save between phases, the terrible jetpack, moving objects, rocket aiming, and inadequate spacing of saves, is beyond me. If you want constant irritation later on in a game because you are replaying parts because the develops made dumb decisions, is never fun  The game had potential, but fortunately shoots itself in the foot. 4/10.","June 22, 2015","false","21.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The Spider & Bridge senario was rather difficult and I had to run it a few times, but I was more upset with myself, not the game, the challenge itself was good.\n\nDefintely a fun game to screw around with on a lazy afternoon.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with the game is how the background and foregrounds seem to meld together, and as you're racing along, suddenly you hit a wall, because it's a single shade darker but you didn't notice at first. Or this will happen where you're flying along and you see a white or light background tile and as you get close to it, you MIGHT notice the DEATH block hiding inside it.... or you won't and will have to restart from your last save point.\n\n7/10","July 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As far as the level design goes, that isn't too far off base, although fortunately for most people this game controls loads better than the Commander Keen games ever did. This game's control scheme is pretty alright, even though I do have a few complaints. Movement is handled (and this will be written with respect to the 360 controller, as playing a platformer with a keyboard just isn't a good idea) with either the analog stick or the D-pad. Double tapping left or right will make you dash, which is one of my complaints. I would've much prefered a dash button as opposed to the double tap option, as I usually tap my directions a lot whenever I try to adjust my landing. Jumping is with A, shooting is with X... pretty standard stuff.\n\nAs far as the level design goes, the first three levels are pretty much exactly the same: go destroy the thing, get keycards, shoot enemies, exit level, rinse, lather, repeat. The fourht level inexplicably changes things up, playing more like a traditional Megaman-inspired game. Beyond that... well, I didn't get further than stage four. Why? There was a puzzle room in which you have to maneuver two blocks around a small room to hold down a switch. These blocks are insanely glitchy. I broke that room eight different ways, all while still having not found the "proper" solution to the room. The blocks would sometimes fuse together, rendering them unpushable; sometimes fuse with the ceiling, land on top of you... sometimes they'll just not even bother with colission detection whatsoever.\n\nThat's not really a good reason to not recommend the game, though. Why do I not recommend this game, then? It's not so much one huge terrible thing; it's more of a death by 1,000 papercuts, to where I was just looking for an excuse to not play it. For example, moving platforms do not have friction with your sprite, meaning that you've gotta tap a lot in order to stay on that platform (which can also lead to you dashing off said platform and into an arbitrary  one-hit kill zone). One section of a level completely obscures the platform, leaving you to just guess whether or not you're still on the platform. Another section with these platforms has you inexplicably changing direction every time you drop to another waterway, leading to some cheap deaths. There's also another section in which platforms are sent out to you entirely on RNG, which can lead to you just kinda dying sometimes. Then there's the boss of area one that runs, launches bombs and knocks things down on you, only to stand still and just kinda die at the end of the level for no reason.\n\nI could probably go on for at least another few paragraphs, but suffice to say I don't think I'll be coming back to this one. Even barring those problems, this game didn't really have enough there in the first place to interest me. It's not a bad game to give to a kid who doesn't really care what they play, and they'll almost certainly get their $5 out of it. As for someone who thinks in terms of game design, this game probably won't be for you. 4/10.\n\nStory: The store page says that this game is story driven. Well, I suppose it kinda is, but it's not really too big of a deal. Of course, since I never finished the game, assigning a point value to the story would be silly, so I'm just not gonna do that.\n\nGraphics: Well, the graphics aren't bad. In fact, this is where I dare say a lot of the effort in the game went to. For the first three levels the pixel art is pretty rad, although it does drop off a bit in terms of quality around level four. Again, beyond that I can't really say much more. One thing I can say, however, is that this game seems to like adding motion blur every now and then (or as I call it, Cataract Vision). There's no way to turn it off, and if you've got motion sickness, I could see this being a bit of an issue for you. Regarding the technical side of the graphics, it of course runs at a perfect 60FPS, and it launches at a resolution which is around 1280x720, to then fullscreen to your native resolution. There didn't seem to be any resolution options other than fullscreen or not-fullscreen, so take that as you will. Given that I try to play games fullscreen at my resolution as often as possible, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. The game performs well enough (as one would expect) and the pixel art is quite good; I just wish there was a way to turn off Cataract Vision. 3/5.\n\nSound: This is where the Genesis/Mega Drive comparison really comes into play. While it isn't exclusively using the Genesis/MD sound chip, it does borrow some samples such as the bass. Either way, if you're familiar with the Genesis/MD soundchip and enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. I'm impartial to the sound chip, so I didn't really feel that strongly about it. As for the compositions themselves, they're alright in the context of the stages, but it's not something I'd listen to particularly often outside of the game. Also, I do wish they had more than one song for stage four, as the stage doesn't have any level transitions, meaning that you get to hear the same song looping for about 30-40 minutes. As for the sound effects... it's a retro inspired game; what do you expect? I will say that the sound effects do have a tendency to stack and get a bit loud, which can be a bit annoying at times, although it happens pretty rarely, so it's not the biggest deal. Overall on the sound front, it's about average for an indie retro inspired platformer. People who go coocoo for chiptunes may find a lot to love here, but as for me, it's just kinda okay. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 4/0/3/2; cumulative score of 4.5/10. It's biggest problems for me are its smaller problems and that even without said problems, there's not much else going on here. Again, if you want to get it for a kid or something, they'll probably be alright with it for a bit, but if you know some things about game design, this game isn't really gonna interest you.","February 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Graphically, the game does draw influence from blue robot games of greater repute, however, the similarities, more or less, end there.\n\nKR-17 suffers from an overall lack of polish. Graphics I often found were stretch and scaled and sometimes it was difficult to tell which was foreground and which was background. The difficulty of the challenges seem to follow no particular pattern and much of the gameplay feels a bit like filler. The bosses I found to be incredibly weak and more than half of them involved running through a gauntlet of hazards while the boss destroys the level. The music, rather than employing catch chiptunes, assaults us with MIDI-esque synthesized music. Because of the overall lack of polish, rather than feeling like a classic, it feels like a bit like a b-list side-scroller downloaded from a BBS circa 1993. This game needs at least another 6 months in the oven before it's fully baked.\n\nThe game looks better than it actually is, however if you're a vintage gamer and in the mood for this sort of gameplay, dispite it's many flaws, it does offer some respectible challenges.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/278640/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Old-school style platformers seem to be all the rage with indie devs. They don't require massive teams of people to create and their low CPU usage results in a wider audience getting to experience the game. Sometimes, though, you just have to wonder if going retro was the best choice.\n\nWith Terrian Saga: KR-17, there doesn't seem to be any real defining feature. This is a game based on the likes of MegaMan or old Apogee MS-DOS titles. It's an action platformer with a greater emphasis on platforming. These levels will require you to search for keys to progress; just like the good-old-days.\n\nStill, there really isn't much to it. You find keys, shoot enemies and progress. The game routinely stops to give you frustratingly difficult boss battles, but even those end up being too short. The game breezes by without much of a care.\n\nI suppose that could be noted as a plus, but I never felt invested in this game. The sprite work is fantastic, but the art style puts me off. It looks like a 5 year old's drawings of a "cool" robot he saw. This is almost like if Wall-E got fed up with cleaning the Earth.\n\nThe choice of weapons is almost entirely moot, too. While you have access to a bomb, a remote bomb, a claymore and flamethrower, you really only ever need the bomb. It has the most use, deals the most damage and can be lobbed a great distance. Nothing else really matters, apart from a failed attempt at diversity.\n\nYour core blaster even works quite well against every enemy. One foe requires you to dodge when shooting it, but you could take advantage of the invincibility frames and mutilate him. Nearly all the adversaries are the same, too. Just shoot, shoot and shoot some more.\n\nDo I really find the game that unenjoyable? No, honestly. The music is excellent and the level design, itself, is solid. I love old-school style games that require you to remember routes and plan out a perfect path. KR-17 has that in spades. I just wish they lasted longer.\n\nI would also like it if the game would play by it's own rules. In most levels, you have access to a dash ability. Sometimes, within the same section of levels, you lose that ability. You also get a jetpack that carries over into some levels, but not all of them. It becomes confusing and infuriating when you go to dash and then fall into an acid pit.\n\nI also have to take points off for the lame final boss and horrendous cliff-hanger ending. I'm not certain that a sequel will be inevitable, but to end your first title on what basically is a "To Be Continued" screen is just mean.\n\nStill, for $5, you could do worse. Honestly, I'd just check out some of the other retro style platformers on Steam. This one doesn't do much that would differentiate it from the pack.\n\n6/10","July 23, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I literally tried 100+ times to get through it and could only get 2/3 of the way through.  I found a forum post showing an animated gif of someone making the jumps, and with that, it "only" took me another 10 tries or so to get through the section.  Did I mention this was on "easy"?

You have your main blaster attack, a selection of items such as grenades, mines and a cruise missile. Occasionally you are given a jet pack so that you just fly around instead jumping.\n\nI spent the first 5 minutes or so trying to figure out the controls. I got stuck at the very beginning because I didn't know what the jump button was or how to activate objects. I had go back to the main menu a couple of times and on returning to the game you cannot skip dialogue so it was a bit tedious. Also not all the controls are listed in the menu and I found that tutorial tips are easily missed or not clear. Anyway I eventually figured it out lol. Things turned to not be too bad. You really need to look where you are going to avoid hazards in this game, some are insta-death. I frequently died and had to start from the last checkpoint. But thankfully they are generously dispersed around each map. Controlling your cruise missile is basically like playing snake. It moves quite fast and easily clips into objects and explodes prematurely. The game has lot's typical platforming type of stuff e.g. jumping from one platform to another and avoiding dangers. I preferred using the jetpack to just fly most the time over jumping.\n\nWhile the game is not really bad. I didn't feel that it was special and I don't really have any urge to play it more than I did. I didn't really feel engaged in the story and the game tends to have characteristics which are potentially annoying that you typically get with old side-scrollers. I would only recommend it to those with a passion for these kinds of retro 2D side-scrollers.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 9, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","0"

(Maybe a little too much platforming in some parts)\n- Well done spritework and music.\n\nCons:\n- Unable to rebind the movement keys. I feel incredibly awkward playing this game without being able to rebind the movement keys from the arrows to a WASD format.\n- Controls somewhat clunky. A prime and infuriating example is how the dash is to double tap. Works in theory, but attempting to stay onto a box as it moves without accidentally dashing off of it and landing into the water is a frustrating endeavor. A better way of going about this is to have a button that one can press to dash in the direction the robot is facing, or holding down a button and moving either way to dash.\n- Some minor graphical errors here and there, such as the tops of trees inexplicably hovering above parts of buildings (Not game-breaking, just strange), and some platforming issues with the box jumping area within Valiant Forest (The part where you have to jump from moving box to box along the water), as some of the boxes are spread out a little too far to actually make the jump.\n\nConclusion: Get the game, it's a nice little indie title and worth the cash, just don't expect it to be perfect. Voting up as this game has alot of promise to it!

This game looks and feels like something you might have found at the games shop in the halcyon days of the Super Nintendo, or maybe the very early tenure of the Sega Saturn (since the music is decidedly not 16-bit). It holds all the trappings of games from that era - colourful, cartoony graphics, plenty of jumping-and-shooting, and an unforgiving difficulty level which should make lovers of games like Contra extremely happy campers.\n\nYou play the part of the titular KR-17, a Terrian attack robot separated from his fleet on the hostile planet Valiant. Now, along with your trusty missile sidekick, it is your goal to reunite with your peers, by traversing a variety of areas within Valiant looking for them. Along the way, a little story unfolds which, while not bad, can easily be overlooked or skipped - the focus of this game is on challenge and gameplay, and boy does it ever deliver.\n\nLet's start with the difficulty, shall we? This game is hard. REALLY hard. Even on Easy. It is so hard, in fact, that I am left wondering if anyone plays this on Hard. The trainyard zone will give you premature grey hairs, and later areas have me thinking of uninstalling the game from how frustratingly impossible-on-purpose they are. On numerous occasions, after getting past a particularly tear-inducing obstacle only to find a WORSE one right after it, I have yelled out loud at my screen 'ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME?!'\n\nAnd yet...\n\n...and yet the game keeps you playing. You never feel like you are being made to quit. Instead, your mind is constantly telling you to give it one more try, one more go, you will beat that part next time...and all thoughts of saying 'F-- this' and leaving the game to the wayside dissipate. This was a quality many old-school platformers also had, and KR-17 manages to capture the experience of playing one of those titles perfectly.\n\nAnother asset working in favour of this game is your arsenal. You have several types of weapons to choose from, from your standard pea-shooter to bombs and flamethrowers. You can also, at any time, send your sentient missile sidekick to ram against enemies or access otherwise unreachable areas, many of which are crucial to solving a puzzle or beating a section. While the level design itself is not the most varied, these different strategic options for disposing of obstacles lend a nice bit of diversity to the game, adding to the overall experience.\n\nIn short, this is not a game that will revolutionise the industry, or even satisfy the cravings of more sophisticated gamers. It is a nostalgia-baiting indie platformer with simple graphics and a focus on fun. But if that is the kind of thing you look for from your titles, this one will not disappoint. What it does, it does well, and it never aims to do anything more than provide a blast of challenging, quirky, retro-influenced fun. If you see it at full price, consider purchasing it. If - like me - you see it on sale for a pittance, do not hesitate to get it. You will not consider your money wasted.\n\nRecommended.","May 7, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game for $1 and it is easily a $20 purchase. It plays like it should be on Sega Saturn, and that's a great thing. Terrian Saga does not feel like it tries to cash in on the retro game thing which is happening right now, but rather that it is a labour of love from a developer which has a great love of the 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up subgenre. The game hasn't copied any gameplay elements from other games as far as I can tell, it just does its own thing with its own mechanics and nails nearly everything. I look forward to a future with more Wonderfling games.","June 18, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing you haven't seen before, nothing you won't see again. You play a small robot (with some story, but I admittedly skipped through to play the game) who has a warhead for a buddy. He gives you exposition, and tips as to how to move around in the world. Platforms, elevators, guns, bombs, grenades... Lots of stuff to go boom.\n\nPROS:\nIf you like platformers, this is well worth it for the price. I think I paid around 42 cents, and that's always worth a game to me. The level designs are interesting and harken back to the golden age of 8 bit things jumping onto 8 bit things. The music is 8 bit as well, and pretty good (although gets a tad repetitive, and feels a bit like I'm stuck in a Pokemon battle). The weapons are interesting, as your three weapons do three different things. Controlling your missile buddy is a game in itself, having to manuever him through quick turns at fast speeds through maze-like structures. It feels rewarding, too, if at times too easy.\n\nCONS:\nEven without skipping the intro, I don't think there's enough telling you what you can and cannot step on. Maybe it's a little obvious, and I a little too drunk, but there seem to be several areas where you learned where NOT to jump only after jumping. Sure, the save points are frequent enough, and the gameplay itself easy enough, but still... a little direction goes a long way. The music is a bit much, especially if you're just stuck on a part and it's there thumpin' along in the background, but it's pleasant initially.\n\nShould you get it? If you like platformers and 42 cent indie games, yeah it's worth it. I got about a half hour out of it, and I'll most likely come back to it. I consider that worth the money I paid for it, and it's not a bad little platformer.","July 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On megaman x5, you get a laser firefly, that moves slowy, and is only required in one part of the game to get a BONUS thing, it also is expensive, like in this game, but at least it pays it by being slow, controlable. The missile spends too much, and goes too quick for a REQUIRED part of the game, if you don't like using it you better learn liking it.\n\nBosses, from what i saw, don't get me wrong i couldn't get far into the game, and bought this mostly for the cards, but man, the bosses are meatboy-like, at least from the part i played, i don't know if it goes into a real fight later, but well, i can tell you this meat boy sonic the megaman is going to annoy you, specifically early, and a little less late. Due to the whole " the world is falling behind you " side scrolling, you may get anxious and accidentally dash/not dash when you needed to. It's a huge trial and error, there are check points, but not really enough to make up the speed-paced character.\n\nI know this may be just me being bad at the game, but man, sometimes countering an attack on a moba, where your main tower is on 1 hp, seems to be more enjoyable and less frustating than this.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to who doesn't have enough reflexes to deal with this, i can recommend it, to who enjoys fast paced games of different kinds (I think even a touhou fan would like to try this)\n\nIf there is any grammar/spelling error, sorry, i'm not the best when it comes to english.\n\nThat is all, i have respect for this game, i like it overall, but those gameplay issues just seem too big for me.\n\nTL;DR : I recommend in case you like fast paced, almost pixel perfect games, but i wouldn't recommend if you are more onto the slow paced, later fast paced games.\n\nPersonally i like it, but i'm just not able to get much enjoyment out of it.","December 16, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/278640/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Terrian Saga KR-17 is a mix of three genres which are action, platforming and puzzle solving. It starts off quite puzzle heavy but the later levels have a lot more action and platforming. Our protagonist is a robot that has gained sentience and goes off to take back a planet conquered by a terrorist. I learned the story via the Steam description, besides the intro the story in Terrian Saga is non existent. Accompanying you is a sentient missile which acts as your guide and is also briefly controllable when you summon him. All the dialogue is presented in text, there is no voice acting.\n\nWhen you first gain control of your character one of the first things you will notice is that the game is locked at 30fps. That is not a deal breaker but it does affect the game negatively. Your KR-17 robot comes equipped with your basic blaster and a grenade launcher. The grenade launcher uses up energy but it is a very small amount and kills most enemies with one hit. That's the weapon to go with unless you are out of energy and have to resort to the blaster. Energy is recharged via stations scattered about the level and they are usually close enough that you will rarely run out.  You can also summon your sentient missile friend but that does cost quite a chunk of energy.\n\nThe missile is controllable but once he starts moving he can't stop and if he crashes he will disappear causing you to waste more energy summoning him again. He is very useful to hit hard to reach enemies and is also used to go into places your character can't to destroy a certain object. These sections start off easy enough though they quickly become a pain as they demand further precision and add a lot of sharp turns. They are not short sections either, they take quite a while and simply scraping into something destroys you causing the missile to be summoned again from the start. Your hitbox being so large does not help either.\n\nKR-17 controls much better though he does also suffer from having a large hitbox which an be a pain when forced to avoid insta-death obstacles tiny areas. The game does start off very easy and you may think it is much more of a puzzle game than anything else. You'd be dead wrong. It won't take long for this game to get very brutal and you will need fast reaction speeds. You will be facing much more dangerous and numerous enemies as well as tougher platforming. That is when the game truly gets fun and becomes something in the veins of Mega Man. Though no where near as brutal as that since you have infinite lives and save stations are usually scattered close together.\n\nCertain levels sections do not have save stations and you have to beat it all in one go. One particularly troublesome section is one where you have to stand on a tiny log throughout a water filled level. The slightest touch of water will cause you to explode and that level dragged on far too long. Don't get me wrong it is fun but do not be expecting an easy laid back puzzle/platformer after the first couple of levels. One thing that is a problem though is that certain objects in the foreground can block view of your character which is problematic when facing enemies or jumping over hazards. It is not a common occurrence though. There are also some pads which will either drop down or bounce you up that probably will cause your death if you did not expect it. Changing the colors of the pad would have been an easy fix to be able to tell them apart.\n\nNothing about the environments feel felt memorable or unique, just random pieces of map sown together to form a level. The artstyle itself is very nice and is 32 bit instead of the usual 8 or 16 most indies use. Music is decent. Nothing special but it gets the job done. The hud is great and simple to understand though at times it can hide the view of enemies or obstacles and cause you to take damage due to it. You can take up to five hits from enemies or most obstacles and you refill it by finding a red floating crystal. Be careful though, the frames of invincibility after being hit are very few and you will likely get hit multiple times in succession if you are not able to escape after getting damaged.\n\nTerrian Saga KR-17 was a nice surprise. I believe it to be a hidden gem that is rough around the edges. It really does feels like this would have been a classic game if this was released back in the day. The 30 FPS cap was an odd decision that took some enjoyment out of it and other problems do bring it down from being great. Overall this is definitely a title to check out if you like platformers, puzzles and the action genre. If you don't like even one of those this may not be the game for you. All three genres are mixed very well and persist throughout the entire game. For those of you that do enjoy all three, Terrian Saga KR-17 is definitely a title worth considering.","June 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/recommended/278640/","wanderbot","Wanderbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderbot/","1083 products in account","KR-17 is pretty obviously a retro-style platformer that harkens back to the good old days of the SNES. It plays very similarly to the 2D Duke Nukem Games or Megaman, but with some different twists. Really, if you like games from this genre, at $4- you can't really go wrong here. It won't knock your socks off, but it'll be a pretty good nostalgia trip.\n\nFeatures:\n* Gameplay is pretty generic, jumping shooting are standard faire.\n* You have 4 extra attacks, plus a guided missile, largely for enemy destruction, but sometimes for puzzle solving. They're largely unecessary, but can be useful in certain cases. The guided rocket is a bit OP if you can manage to control it properly.\n* The soundtrack is pretty solid, and while the songs can get repetitive, you won't be around a level long enough for it to get annoying.\n* Most levels are pretty simple: the only goal is to reach the exit. Unfortunately, most levels require you to flip a bunch of switches, and it's pretty easy to miss one or two. Doesn't take much time to go back and find them, but its still a bit annoying.\n* The controls are weird. Especially with the jetpack (you have to hold up on the right stick, and move horizontally with the left stick, otherwise you'll stop flying and probably die). Once you get used to that, it's pretty smooth.\n* The enemies feel more like traps/obstacles than proper opponents, which isn't bad, but it does make them feel a little slapped down on the levels.\n\nAlso, here are our thoughts in video form!\nhttp://youtu.be/_JNoi7KA-As","July 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","1"

The game is somewhat charming, has a decent soundtrack, ok controls, and a few different attack types, plus a controlled companion rocket to blast enemies. While playing the game i was thinking it was going to be priced at 10 or 15 dollars, and so i thought it might be not worth it, but seeing as it's 5 dollars (and less with launch sale) I'm going to go ahead and say get it. It has a lot of levels to play through and objects to finish through them. But here's why i was think it wasn't worth it, for me atleast.\nOne is that the some of the boss fights (like the first one) is a sort of a race fight where you run from imminent death, dodging attacks and not falling, that's fine but the level wasn't a good design, so i found myself frustratingly dying because of it, and there isn't any check points durring these fights so you would restart it from the begging.\nAnother problem is one of the levels where you have to stand on a moving platform moving to the end of that level, you have to keep adjusting your movement on that platform so you won't fall (left and right arrow keys) and sometimes jump, now that's fine, but when the controls aren't as responsive as you need it to be, you will find yourselft not preforming these tasks the way you would expect, also when you double-hit left or right arrow keys fast you would dash in the direction you pressed them, and since you press them fast to keep your balance on the moving platform, you would accidentally dash away from the platform and die, and also there is not check point for those kinds of levels too.\nSo the gist of it is, some levels are badly designed, and controls aren't as tight as you want them to be. But make your choice, i was going to not recommend it but seeing as it's 5 dollars, i say get it why not, just remember that some levels will frustrate you.\nI just hope the devs make a more tested, with more tight controls, and see things more clearly before they release their next platforming game if they ever make another one.","July 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","2"

In some places distinguishing between background and foreground tiles is impossible and you end up face-planting into a wall, which is frustrating.\n\nOverall the game isn't really shaky, but it's still far from solid. I feel like someone decided to make a platformer, then at the 80% mark they said, "Ah, that's good enough."\n\nIt's not bad or anything, there's just nothing to recommend it when there's plenty of more polished platformers competing against it.

Colors are mishmashed and thrown together (why are background objects as bright as foreground ones), the environments have WAY too much clutter, sometimes it's hard to tell what is a platform or ground from the background, and at too many times there is foreground foliage that blocks too much of your view (If this is unintentional it's an amateur mistake, if it's intentional it is neither fun nor challenging). The cutscenes look awful as well.\n\nThe controls are sometimes awkward and ANY area involving pushing moveable crates onto water is a headache. Why doesn't the robot simply move along with the crate? Why do I need to manually move him along with it? Again, this isn't fun and it's a terribly cheap challenge. There is a level in stage two where you need to do this for an extended amount of time without any checkpoints and it is unbelieveably frustrating (I have actually quit the game since this area and do not intend to come back).\n\nApparently no one tested the levels for collision either as far too many levels with the jetpack allow to move behind walls or enviromental objects you're not supposed to, some of which trap you or kill you or all around mislead you.\n\nIt doesn't help that certain enemies come in different sizes and are not easily destroyed by your guns. This is most noticeable in the spider boss level where you simply cannot shoot the green enemies blocking your path because they're at an awkward height. This would have been easily fixed simply by not having the grenade attack hurt you ala Metroid. And while you have multiple weapons at your disposal almost none of them are very useful outside of the grenade.\n\nAnd speaking of the spider boss, why is the boss level in the MIDDLE of the world? Why did the world just end a couple levels later when I went down a random sewer pipe? The pacing is just bizarre.\n\nI wanted to like the game, and I realize it's probably a first attempt at making a game, but this is just too unfinished and poorly thought out for me to enjoy.

But I can't give a very in-depth review since I haven't played long but thought I'd give a small criticism since it's still fresh in my mind. One issue with this game and some retro-ish games is that the distinciton between passive/background elements and active/foreground elements isn't always very distinguished so sometimes when playing, as a new player, I don't always know what blocks or objects I can interact with and what I can't.

Also , this might sound weird , but it looked better on a larger monitor.\n\nLet me start by saying I like this game but can not recommend it because of the following reasons:\n\nFirst of all: There are flying enemies AND YOU CANT SHOOT UP. Only way to kill flying enemies is to use the rocket ,which consumes like a third of your ammo.\n\nThe visuals are nice enough ,but the color and inconsistency of the sprites makes it hard to know which sprite is a platform and which is part of the background , and trying to jump on a piece of background is a pretty dumb way to die.\n\nThere have also been some poor choices in using said sprites , like for instance in the second area there was a level where you had to navigate a cave while riding a crate floating in water (water instakills you btw) and for some reason the dev decided it would be a good idea to put non transparent sprites in the foreground so they hide the crate you are supposed to ride. That wouldh nave been much of a problem if it weren't for the fact that when you ride crates , you dont really ride them like in most platformers , you have to move with them. if you stop pressing left every 0.5 seconds the crate just continues on its way leaving you to your watery death. Ok thats fine , but they had barrels (or are they wooden logs) that act the same way, which makes sense, as the water is flowing the barrel is turning so you'd have to balance on it. But why crates. In fact , why not putting barrels instead of crates . Jumping feels unresponsive compared to some other platformers , when you get to the spider boss thingy , you'll know what I mean. This appears to be fixed by turning vsync off\n\nSome sections where you need to control your rocket buddy can be frustrating as hell ,the gaps are way too small , the corners way too sharp and the rocket dude moves way too fast to be controlled adequately , especially with an analogue stick. Most of the longer rocket flying sections will probably take you a few tries to get right , which really breaks the game pacing for me.\n\nThere is a game section where you need to hack computer terminals. Hacking is ok except , the game does not pause while you hack. So if there are any enemies around they will attack you. And you cant stop the hacking too , the only way to get out of hacking mode is to mess up. Which costs you one health bar , so you might as well let the baddies hit you.\n\nOther things I just find odd:\n\nThe boss sprites look kinda out of place , like the art was made by a different person or even for a different game.\n\nThe "cinematics" (Im using that word for the lack of a better one) look weird too , for the same reason , in game sprites look nice and you can tell some work went into them , but the characters in the cinematics look iffy. Like they were drawn in a hurry and then pixelated a little to look more like they fit the whole 16 bit theme.\n\nOther than that its a nice game , with some challenge to it.","July 20, 2015","false","10.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/278640/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Never had a game I enjoyed so much at the start, that just kept worse and worse till it wasn't worth playing anymore. The game is initially awesome, with a megaman feel, being a platformer lite on story, with spunky music and 90's aesthetic. There are a few minor annoyances, like how much special the rocket takes, or how you can't aim to shoot people, which seems like a obvious addition these days since you take so much unnecessary damage from having to jump up in fire to shoot or not being able to shoot some one above you who is shooting down on you. These are minor problems. The game is also pretty long for a platformer, meaning you get good bang for your buck. It is obnoxious how many levels follow the same Doom format of having to find a set number of colored keys in order, unlocking doors forward or ahead to beat the level, or having to press a preset number of switches till you can leave the level. Many of the levels have similar vibes and feelings of being inside robotic facitilities, but once again all of these mentioned above do little more than hinder the experience. The game is also semi tough but not stupidly so, with no set number of lives to beat everything, and some mid-level save points. Jumping was also done very well, not too floaty.\n\nThe real problem is with a few TERRIBLE design, controls, and mechanic desicions that are then focused and reinforced so much so in later levels to a baffling degree. First off is the guided rocket. The control of this is absolutely awful. Instead of moving free in space as would make sense, it moves super fast along in a single square-by-square basis. The game then requires you to navigate tiny little mazes. If it were free range you would be able to use skill, reflexes, and aiming. This version is just stupid. It moves super fast and the response is delayed. Since it moves square to square sometimes you turn and you are too high or low to make a smaller tunnel, but you basically can't do anything because you stopped on that square. You cannot make minor adjustments as it moves too fast. The D-pad is too hard to move from horizontal to vertical for quick turns. The analog is also finnicky and hard to be consistent with, meaning neither controller options work. Then the game makes you do this long mazes that are super narrow, forcing you to make perfect turns and then 5 in a row. If you touch the wall you instant die, and some parts involve 20-30 seconds of this straight, and if you die you need to do it all again. This is frustrating being forced to replay parts of the maze you beat  just to play trial and error with a terrible system. Deaths never feel your fault.\n\nThen there is the jetpack. Once again, instead of just a natural free-flowing jetpack you move around, it is not intuitive. You hold up to move up, and let go to move down, and press side to side to move sideways. This is also supper finnicky and annoying to use. The analog stick is unusable by itself, as pressing up moves you flying up too quickly. The d-pad is also impossible to move because you have to slide from up to side back to up, and it is finnicky. This means the best option is using the d-pad to move up, while the other hand controls the analog to move forward. That is how terrible the controls are and the mechanic is implimented, you need to use both analog and d-pad at same time to work best. Again multiple parts later on have you navigate these areas covered on all sides with instant-death walls, which the game loves to overuse. So you will finally be moving well and suddenly the finnicky jetpack goes up too fast and you instant die, making you redo your perfect flying earlier, just to get back and past that part, only to die on a later part and do it again. The parts, like the mazes, should be shorter to not inflate cheap replayability. And some parts make you shoot guys while moving the jetpack through instant death spots, making the controls even worse.\n\nThen there is the moving platform/object mechanic. In every single platform game on any system ever, when you jump on a log moving in water, or stand on an object/platform that is moving, you move with it, because you know, science/logic. Well in this game for some stupid reason (to add unnecessary difficulty to something simple) the object moves but you don't. So this means each time you have to keep moving along with this moving object, randomly tapping forward for long periods of time, with any mistake meaning instant death. Then there is the dash ability. Instead of making sense and using one of the many unused buttons, so it is botton/simultaneous button dependent like megaman or other games, it relies on an unreliable double tap forward. The first problem is it only works like 2/3 of the time. It does not work with analog stick. Only arrows. So once again another mechanic that only works with 1 of the 2 possible directional controls, cutting down on options. Other times, since you have to press forward multiple times in parts, this can lead to you dashing when you don't want to when you were trying to move forward, leading to many unintentional deaths that aren’t your fault.\n\nThen there are certain level designs. Normally they have saves in most levels, but then there are levels that for some reason use tons of instant deaths/only instant death, as the sole way to die, and instead of using more saves as you would think, has ZERO saves, meaning you have to replay the entire level over and over again to beat a certain part you die on if you make 1 single mistake. For a game that stayed away from this so well, forcing entire level replays is something basic and cheap that games like super meat boy do, but I got the original impression this would be different. There will be levels that throw many of these terrible instances together. In one level you have to use a jetpack, to get through multiple instant kill areas, shoot guys, ride platforms where you don’t move with them, etc, and if you die you do it all over again. These lead to wasted time replaying terribly controlled segments because the game makers decided to stop using common sense and put any save spots in the level. Who would think it’s a good idea to suddenly have levels where you have to do the entire thing without getting hit or touched once or you restart it all.\nThe final nail in the coffin was a boss fight. First off, instead of a fair boss fight it is one of those stupid ones where the power is out of your hands and you can’t damage him until it decides you can at certain parts. Well you have to dodge tons of mines, bombs, bullets, and object forever. The boss makes 4 continuous trips of something, instead of what actually makes sense, 1-2. The spend the entire fight not being able to hurt him and dodge while he decides to keep attacking you. When you finally make it through that long drawn out repetitive phase, you then are forced to fly through smaller narrow different level spikes with a jetpack. You get to a spot in the air where he keeps shooting at you forever, while you get shot at by rockets. You have no idea what to do, and decide you must keep dodging for what seems like forever. If you die once during any of this you start the ENTIRE long drawn out dodging process on the ground, meaning you need to waste countless time to get back up to the sky. Why they make you waste time going through a mine field with the terrible jetpack is beyond me. But why they don’t save when you made it past a long boring dodging phase, only to make you restart it all, is beyond me. Why they force levels with no saves, long drawn out fights that don’t save between phases, the terrible jetpack, moving objects, rocket aiming, and inadequate spacing of saves, is beyond me. If you want constant irritation later on in a game because you are replaying parts because the develops made dumb decisions, is never fun  The game had potential, but fortunately shoots itself in the foot. 4/10.","June 22, 2015","false","21.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

As far as the level design goes, that isn't too far off base, although fortunately for most people this game controls loads better than the Commander Keen games ever did. This game's control scheme is pretty alright, even though I do have a few complaints. Movement is handled (and this will be written with respect to the 360 controller, as playing a platformer with a keyboard just isn't a good idea) with either the analog stick or the D-pad. Double tapping left or right will make you dash, which is one of my complaints. I would've much prefered a dash button as opposed to the double tap option, as I usually tap my directions a lot whenever I try to adjust my landing. Jumping is with A, shooting is with X... pretty standard stuff.\n\nAs far as the level design goes, the first three levels are pretty much exactly the same: go destroy the thing, get keycards, shoot enemies, exit level, rinse, lather, repeat. The fourht level inexplicably changes things up, playing more like a traditional Megaman-inspired game. Beyond that... well, I didn't get further than stage four. Why? There was a puzzle room in which you have to maneuver two blocks around a small room to hold down a switch. These blocks are insanely glitchy. I broke that room eight different ways, all while still having not found the "proper" solution to the room. The blocks would sometimes fuse together, rendering them unpushable; sometimes fuse with the ceiling, land on top of you... sometimes they'll just not even bother with colission detection whatsoever.\n\nThat's not really a good reason to not recommend the game, though. Why do I not recommend this game, then? It's not so much one huge terrible thing; it's more of a death by 1,000 papercuts, to where I was just looking for an excuse to not play it. For example, moving platforms do not have friction with your sprite, meaning that you've gotta tap a lot in order to stay on that platform (which can also lead to you dashing off said platform and into an arbitrary  one-hit kill zone). One section of a level completely obscures the platform, leaving you to just guess whether or not you're still on the platform. Another section with these platforms has you inexplicably changing direction every time you drop to another waterway, leading to some cheap deaths. There's also another section in which platforms are sent out to you entirely on RNG, which can lead to you just kinda dying sometimes. Then there's the boss of area one that runs, launches bombs and knocks things down on you, only to stand still and just kinda die at the end of the level for no reason.\n\nI could probably go on for at least another few paragraphs, but suffice to say I don't think I'll be coming back to this one. Even barring those problems, this game didn't really have enough there in the first place to interest me. It's not a bad game to give to a kid who doesn't really care what they play, and they'll almost certainly get their $5 out of it. As for someone who thinks in terms of game design, this game probably won't be for you. 4/10.\n\nStory: The store page says that this game is story driven. Well, I suppose it kinda is, but it's not really too big of a deal. Of course, since I never finished the game, assigning a point value to the story would be silly, so I'm just not gonna do that.\n\nGraphics: Well, the graphics aren't bad. In fact, this is where I dare say a lot of the effort in the game went to. For the first three levels the pixel art is pretty rad, although it does drop off a bit in terms of quality around level four. Again, beyond that I can't really say much more. One thing I can say, however, is that this game seems to like adding motion blur every now and then (or as I call it, Cataract Vision). There's no way to turn it off, and if you've got motion sickness, I could see this being a bit of an issue for you. Regarding the technical side of the graphics, it of course runs at a perfect 60FPS, and it launches at a resolution which is around 1280x720, to then fullscreen to your native resolution. There didn't seem to be any resolution options other than fullscreen or not-fullscreen, so take that as you will. Given that I try to play games fullscreen at my resolution as often as possible, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. The game performs well enough (as one would expect) and the pixel art is quite good; I just wish there was a way to turn off Cataract Vision. 3/5.\n\nSound: This is where the Genesis/Mega Drive comparison really comes into play. While it isn't exclusively using the Genesis/MD sound chip, it does borrow some samples such as the bass. Either way, if you're familiar with the Genesis/MD soundchip and enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. I'm impartial to the sound chip, so I didn't really feel that strongly about it. As for the compositions themselves, they're alright in the context of the stages, but it's not something I'd listen to particularly often outside of the game. Also, I do wish they had more than one song for stage four, as the stage doesn't have any level transitions, meaning that you get to hear the same song looping for about 30-40 minutes. As for the sound effects... it's a retro inspired game; what do you expect? I will say that the sound effects do have a tendency to stack and get a bit loud, which can be a bit annoying at times, although it happens pretty rarely, so it's not the biggest deal. Overall on the sound front, it's about average for an indie retro inspired platformer. People who go coocoo for chiptunes may find a lot to love here, but as for me, it's just kinda okay. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 4/0/3/2; cumulative score of 4.5/10. It's biggest problems for me are its smaller problems and that even without said problems, there's not much else going on here. Again, if you want to get it for a kid or something, they'll probably be alright with it for a bit, but if you know some things about game design, this game isn't really gonna interest you.","February 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Graphically, the game does draw influence from blue robot games of greater repute, however, the similarities, more or less, end there.\n\nKR-17 suffers from an overall lack of polish. Graphics I often found were stretch and scaled and sometimes it was difficult to tell which was foreground and which was background. The difficulty of the challenges seem to follow no particular pattern and much of the gameplay feels a bit like filler. The bosses I found to be incredibly weak and more than half of them involved running through a gauntlet of hazards while the boss destroys the level. The music, rather than employing catch chiptunes, assaults us with MIDI-esque synthesized music. Because of the overall lack of polish, rather than feeling like a classic, it feels like a bit like a b-list side-scroller downloaded from a BBS circa 1993. This game needs at least another 6 months in the oven before it's fully baked.\n\nThe game looks better than it actually is, however if you're a vintage gamer and in the mood for this sort of gameplay, dispite it's many flaws, it does offer some respectible challenges. If you're a particular fan of this genre, pick this game up, but don't expect anything life-chaning.\n\n5.5/10","September 19, 2014","false","6.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/278640/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Old-school style platformers seem to be all the rage with indie devs. They don't require massive teams of people to create and their low CPU usage results in a wider audience getting to experience the game. Sometimes, though, you just have to wonder if going retro was the best choice.\n\nWith Terrian Saga: KR-17, there doesn't seem to be any real defining feature. This is a game based on the likes of MegaMan or old Apogee MS-DOS titles. It's an action platformer with a greater emphasis on platforming. These levels will require you to search for keys to progress; just like the good-old-days.\n\nStill, there really isn't much to it. You find keys, shoot enemies and progress. The game routinely stops to give you frustratingly difficult boss battles, but even those end up being too short. The game breezes by without much of a care.\n\nI suppose that could be noted as a plus, but I never felt invested in this game. The sprite work is fantastic, but the art style puts me off. It looks like a 5 year old's drawings of a "cool" robot he saw. This is almost like if Wall-E got fed up with cleaning the Earth.\n\nThe choice of weapons is almost entirely moot, too. While you have access to a bomb, a remote bomb, a claymore and flamethrower, you really only ever need the bomb. It has the most use, deals the most damage and can be lobbed a great distance. Nothing else really matters, apart from a failed attempt at diversity.\n\nYour core blaster even works quite well against every enemy. One foe requires you to dodge when shooting it, but you could take advantage of the invincibility frames and mutilate him. Nearly all the adversaries are the same, too. Just shoot, shoot and shoot some more.\n\nDo I really find the game that unenjoyable? No, honestly. The music is excellent and the level design, itself, is solid. I love old-school style games that require you to remember routes and plan out a perfect path. KR-17 has that in spades. I just wish they lasted longer.\n\nI would also like it if the game would play by it's own rules. In most levels, you have access to a dash ability. Sometimes, within the same section of levels, you lose that ability. You also get a jetpack that carries over into some levels, but not all of them. It becomes confusing and infuriating when you go to dash and then fall into an acid pit.\n\nI also have to take points off for the lame final boss and horrendous cliff-hanger ending. I'm not certain that a sequel will be inevitable, but to end your first title on what basically is a "To Be Continued" screen is just mean.\n\nStill, for $5, you could do worse. Honestly, I'd just check out some of the other retro style platformers on Steam. This one doesn't do much that would differentiate it from the pack.\n\n6/10","July 23, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have your main blaster attack, a selection of items such as grenades, mines and a cruise missile. Occasionally you are given a jet pack so that you just fly around instead jumping.\n\nI spent the first 5 minutes or so trying to figure out the controls. I got stuck at the very beginning because I didn't know what the jump button was or how to activate objects. I had go back to the main menu a couple of times and on returning to the game you cannot skip dialogue so it was a bit tedious. Also not all the controls are listed in the menu and I found that tutorial tips are easily missed or not clear. Anyway I eventually figured it out lol. Things turned to not be too bad. You really need to look where you are going to avoid hazards in this game, some are insta-death. I frequently died and had to start from the last checkpoint. But thankfully they are generously dispersed around each map. Controlling your cruise missile is basically like playing snake. It moves quite fast and easily clips into objects and explodes prematurely. The game has lot's typical platforming type of stuff e.g. jumping from one platform to another and avoiding dangers. I preferred using the jetpack to just fly most the time over jumping.\n\nWhile the game is not really bad. I didn't feel that it was special and I don't really have any urge to play it more than I did. I didn't really feel engaged in the story and the game tends to have characteristics which are potentially annoying that you typically get with old side-scrollers. I would only recommend it to those with a passion for these kinds of retro 2D side-scrollers.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 9, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","0"

(Maybe a little too much platforming in some parts)\n- Well done spritework and music.\n\nCons:\n- Unable to rebind the movement keys. I feel incredibly awkward playing this game without being able to rebind the movement keys from the arrows to a WASD format.\n- Controls somewhat clunky. A prime and infuriating example is how the dash is to double tap. Works in theory, but attempting to stay onto a box as it moves without accidentally dashing off of it and landing into the water is a frustrating endeavor. A better way of going about this is to have a button that one can press to dash in the direction the robot is facing, or holding down a button and moving either way to dash.\n- Some minor graphical errors here and there, such as the tops of trees inexplicably hovering above parts of buildings (Not game-breaking, just strange), and some platforming issues with the box jumping area within Valiant Forest (The part where you have to jump from moving box to box along the water), as some of the boxes are spread out a little too far to actually make the jump.\n\nConclusion: Get the game, it's a nice little indie title and worth the cash, just don't expect it to be perfect. Voting up as this game has alot of promise to it! Keep up the good work guys, looking forward to seeing where this little gem goes in terms of updates!","September 19, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Nothing you haven't seen before, nothing you won't see again. You play a small robot (with some story, but I admittedly skipped through to play the game) who has a warhead for a buddy. He gives you exposition, and tips as to how to move around in the world. Platforms, elevators, guns, bombs, grenades... Lots of stuff to go boom.\n\nPROS:\nIf you like platformers, this is well worth it for the price. I think I paid around 42 cents, and that's always worth a game to me. The level designs are interesting and harken back to the golden age of 8 bit things jumping onto 8 bit things. The music is 8 bit as well, and pretty good (although gets a tad repetitive, and feels a bit like I'm stuck in a Pokemon battle). The weapons are interesting, as your three weapons do three different things. Controlling your missile buddy is a game in itself, having to manuever him through quick turns at fast speeds through maze-like structures. It feels rewarding, too, if at times too easy.\n\nCONS:\nEven without skipping the intro, I don't think there's enough telling you what you can and cannot step on. Maybe it's a little obvious, and I a little too drunk, but there seem to be several areas where you learned where NOT to jump only after jumping. Sure, the save points are frequent enough, and the gameplay itself easy enough, but still... a little direction goes a long way. The music is a bit much, especially if you're just stuck on a part and it's there thumpin' along in the background, but it's pleasant initially.\n\nShould you get it? If you like platformers and 42 cent indie games, yeah it's worth it. I got about a half hour out of it, and I'll most likely come back to it. I consider that worth the money I paid for it, and it's not a bad little platformer.","July 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're a good way to break up the hard sections.\n* The music is pretty cool, so are the graphics.\n* The game does a really good job of combining simple elements and working the player up to harder and more elaborate challenges.\n\nBad things:\n* Dash is permently assigned do double tapping in a direction. Sometimes I dash when I don't want to; sometimes I don't dash when I do want to. This is doubly frustrating since you need to dash to long-throw grenades.\n* Sometimes there are long sections with no saves. meh.\n* Basically all of the levels are "go press these buttons and proceed to the exit." It works, but it's a little lame, and sometimes I missed a button at the start of a room and had to go all the way back to get it.\n\nI'm super hyped for the sequel!","September 23, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some parts remind me of VVVVVV. When people complain about the barrells in an early level being difficult to stand on, they didn't warn me of the crazy parts where you have to fly through thin lanes of single hit death areas. Or the part where you have fight to struggle to stay on a moving platform while simultaneously fighting enemies and avoiding some more single hit deaths.\n\nAside from that the game plays well and looks great with a fun little story on the side.

On megaman x5, you get a laser firefly, that moves slowy, and is only required in one part of the game to get a BONUS thing, it also is expensive, like in this game, but at least it pays it by being slow, controlable. The missile spends too much, and goes too quick for a REQUIRED part of the game, if you don't like using it you better learn liking it.\n\nBosses, from what i saw, don't get me wrong i couldn't get far into the game, and bought this mostly for the cards, but man, the bosses are meatboy-like, at least from the part i played, i don't know if it goes into a real fight later, but well, i can tell you this meat boy sonic the megaman is going to annoy you, specifically early, and a little less late. Due to the whole " the world is falling behind you " side scrolling, you may get anxious and accidentally dash/not dash when you needed to. It's a huge trial and error, there are check points, but not really enough to make up the speed-paced character.\n\nI know this may be just me being bad at the game, but man, sometimes countering an attack on a moba, where your main tower is on 1 hp, seems to be more enjoyable and less frustating than this.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to who doesn't have enough reflexes to deal with this, i can recommend it, to who enjoys fast paced games of different kinds (I think even a touhou fan would like to try this)\n\nIf there is any grammar/spelling error, sorry, i'm not the best when it comes to english.\n\nThat is all, i have respect for this game, i like it overall, but those gameplay issues just seem too big for me.\n\nTL;DR : I recommend in case you like fast paced, almost pixel perfect games, but i wouldn't recommend if you are more onto the slow paced, later fast paced games.\n\nPersonally i like it, but i'm just not able to get much enjoyment out of it.","December 16, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
