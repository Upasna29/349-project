Crushed dreams aside, let's try to be objective and put this as simply as possible:  Some of you may actually enjoy this, but I can't in all honesty say that I did.\n\nIt's...well, for starters, it's a "deathmatch" game.  And a really simplistic, limited, super-repetitive one at that.  With only one "map", as far as I can tell.  It also has the usual complete lack of storytelling logic which practically all such games have...I mean really, who's honestly going to be out harvesting corn when they know full well that there's a homicidal, demonically-possessed tractor roaming the fields?  Sure, there's a half-arsed attempt at justifying said premise on the Store page, but there really is "clever", and there really is "dumb".  Not that any of this lunacy would greatly hinder my enjoyment if there was actually some to be had...but it's mostly just a frustrating experience, in which you can never quite tell what direction the bloodthirsty farm equipment is barrelling down upon you from, and I also could not for the life of me work out why I ran at a perfectly good clip at certain times, and at a snail pace at others.\n\nI'm sure I could persevere and suss the game out some more, but that would require time.  And patience.  And given that I'm a dole-bludging university student who's only got one assignment to go before he's on three-and-a-half months' worth of holidays, I frankly don't have either.  I have other, BETTER games to play, darn it!  Having said that, there's always the remotest chance that the devs will make significant enough improvements and/or embellishments to render this a worthwhile buy...but at the moment, I'd say it's a wait-for-98%-off proposition at best, and even then mostly 'cause it's got cards.  Nice gimmick, but not nearly amusing enough in execution, I'm afraid.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","October 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","29","48","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/375040/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Death Tractor is a short and simple corn harvesting simulator with a twist; you're endlessly hunted by possessed, demonic tractors and fellow harvesters. The game is essentially one giant death match, and the one who gets out with the most corn and manages to stay alive wins.\n\nThe developers have displayed their obvious sense of humor towards this obvious novelty game right within the store page description. Death Tractor is not a title meant to be taken seriously, but there is a fine line between decent and awful joke games. Unfortunately, this title is one that falls right in the middle. A few factors have caused me to press the dreaded thumbs down button.\n\nMaps, there is an incredible lack of them. By lack of maps, I mean there is only one that comes with different flavors of the fence that houses the large rectangular patch of corn field. You'll run around in a giant square most of the time as you harvest your corn, daring only to venture into the middle if you're feeling particularly lucky enough to avoid the tractors of death. This stale, repetitive pattern grows old quick and yet there is so much more potential to maps that could be created.\n\nSound effects are minimal and music is non-existent, except for when you die. You'll be hearing the same hum of the tractors, their beeping horns, and your sickle for the entire five minute duration of each match that you play. These minimalistic attributes only further push the mundane factor up on the scale of "growing bored, quickly". Although on a positive note, the game only has three button functions; left click to use your hand-held agricultural tool, ESC to return to the menu after death, and space bar after you've been knocked down by an opponent.\n\nThe mechanics are equally as simplistic; the more corn you carry, the slower you become. The slower you become, the higher chance of you ending up as tractor food. So how does one get rid of the corn they've harvested, you ask? Why, by dumping it into the back of pickup trucks lined around the outside of the map. The more corn you harvest, the higher your score will go. However, the opponents around you can also dump their corn into these trucks, and once a truck is full it leaves for an amount of time. If no trucks are present, and you're loaded down, you're pretty much screwed.\n\nYou're also screwed if you spawn in the wrong place at the beginning of the game, as tractors spawn just as randomly as you do. You can be dead before you even begin. Usually, one can tell when a death machine is nearby due to the headlights and honking of its horn; this is not always the case, and you may die without ever having seen a giant 20ft tractor coming for you. Also, if an opponent knocks you down, it takes about 5-10 seconds to recover, during which time a tractor may just run you over. In short, you're going to die... a lot. On the bright side, you can also screw over opponents by knocking them down with your sickle; this in turn steals an amount of their corn. This may also cause them to become tractor chow.\n\nDeath Tractor kept me entertained for all of an hour and a half until I got supremely bored with it. This is also with getting a good majority of the achievements, and only playing to farm them. As you may have guessed, online is deader than you will be in this game. Luckily, the developers have implemented bots so that you can still get that full Death Tractor experience. I got this in some bundle, but there's absolutely no way this game is worth $4.49 CAD, $1.09 at best. Buy if you wish, but don't say that I didn't try to warn you of the monotony ahead.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 2","false","1.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashbro722/recommended/375040/","smashbro722","SmashinSomeBlunts420","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashbro722/","308 products in account","I will be fair: the premise alone is actually a clever idea. Having to collect things while being chased by a demonic tractor is a decent prospect; that is, if you were making something that gave off more of an arcade feel to it, and if the tractor was actually menacing, not Hot Topic's cheap remodeling of a John Deere product.\n\nThe game is incredibly repetitive with very little to actually collect. It's just corn. You're just swiping at corn. That's it. No other special vegetables you could look for, no real points system, no powerups, no rotten plants you should avoid, etc. Those are things I would have imagined with some creativity, but I couldn't find any of that here. Just corn.\n\nThe sound design is dreadful. I could not differentiate any sound based on distance or orientation. It's just noise coming from you, or the center of the map (do not go near the center, you will go deaf). Noise pollution is not scary. It's just really frustrating to put up with.\n\nMultiplayer is just a host-or-join setup, but you can only join YOUR friends. And even if you know someone else who paid for this, you have continuous voice-chat with eachother. No push-to-talk, no keyboard options, no exceptions. You have no selection for the levels, but they're all the same map size, so it doesn't matter. You have different player models, but you can't select them, and they're all the same in-game, so it doesn't matter.\n\nVERDICT:  I think there are plenty of games out there that are less than $4 that are worth your money more than this. There's really nothing interesting here after 20 minutes. If more content was here to play with, it would be a different story, but I doubt anything will be added to this game anytime soon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUnRGrFY3-Y","November 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It's becoming a guilty pleasure of mine, if you will.\n\nWith a name like  "Death Tractor"  I was already capitvated. I was expecting a sort of B-movie charm, and even though this was never truly an apt description of the thing, it certainly isn't entirely without its pros.\n\nPros\n-  Original concept:  You're being chased by an increasing number sentient killer tractors spawning in your cornfield. Though the story is lacking, the atmosphere is tense and engaging.\n-  Arcade style gameplay:  Entertaining, leaves you wanting to beat your highscores.\n-  Price:  Cheap.\n-  Design:  The tractor's designs are pretty damn cool. Even though the environment isn't particularly varied in the game, it makes the most of the little details it can put in.\n\nCons\n-  Tractor AI:  Buggy. The tractors often pull sudden violent turns, which can end up having them unfairly drive straight into you. Other times, the tractors lose focus chasing you and wander off.\n-  Lack of content:  There's no story mode, just a single player and an online mode, which are the same thing. The games are 5 minutes long, and you have to rack up as high of a score as you can. That's it.\n-  Hit detection:  There are AI bots that harvest corn in competition with you in single player, however, when it comes to attacking them, landing a hit is seemingly random, yet, those same bots'll hit you with ease.\n-  Optimization:  For a game with graphics certainly not "cutting edge", it could run better.\n-  Pause button:  It says you can pause. You can't.\n\nNeutrals\n-  The corn itself:  It's difficult to see anything through the corn, which is good and bad, creating a claustrophobic environment, heightening tension, whilst being irritating at the same time.\n\nOverall, the game's entertaining enough for me to recommend it.\n6/10","January 31","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
