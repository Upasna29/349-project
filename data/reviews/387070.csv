If you like doing nothing but looking for keys, this game is for you.  This game actually had some promise in the early stages.  The demo they released for the Kickstarter campaigns was actually not bad.  In fact, you played the beginning of the game without having to find any keys at all.  Why they decided to turn it into an ugly version of Pineview Drive I'll never know.  Looking for keys is not acceptable gameplay in my book.\n\nIn other news, this dev is toxic. Here's a rundown of their behavior:\n\n1) They ban you for negative comments on their forums.  I got a permanent ban for pointing out that they had run 5 kickstarters for this game (2 successful).  They said it was a false accusation, but you can go to Kickstarter and see it for yourself (although they've changed the names around to make it harder to find).\n\n2) They delete all negative comments on their Greenlight submissions.\n\n3) They have a UnitZ asset pack in the Steam store.\n","August 27, 2015","false","1.2"," 122 of 130 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","122","130","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/387070/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","I'll start off by saying this review is in no way influenced by the developers decision to not give steam keys to people who purchased the game in the groupees bundle...  Even though I went ahead and purchased the game, I still think the Developer has an obligation to people who already purchased the game to provide them with a key.... enough on that subject...\n\nWhere to start with One Final Breath, it looks in the trailers to be your prototypical First person horror experience..  The graphics are decent, not the most impressive but very passable.  The game play is your typical search the random dark place to answer some burning questions or solve some type of question.  This game isn't an exception as you are tasked with finding your daughter who has run away from home.\n\nAs you explore the abandoned St. Mary's school, you'll find scattered notes left behind to help you piece together the history and get some back story on the building.\n\nThe first part in what will eventually be a five part episodic game.  So my review could change as future episodes are released (if they are released)  Ultimately it still remains to be seen what the developer has to offer in the future with this game.\n\nSome negitives I've taken from the game... it's too dark with no options available to brighten it up.  Dubious audio quality with no option to turn on Subtitles.  Seems to be a key hunting simulator thus far.  In fact when it comes to in game options non exist..  Prior to starting up the game you can alter a few settings but for a game like this you should really be able to have on the fly changes.  The audio is either missing or needs to be made more clear/ or turned up as my character made numerous references to sounds which I didn't hear from my speakers or headphones..  The spelling, well this one isn't a deal breaker but still.... what is a WONG key?\n\nAlso about 40 minutes into my playthrough the screen became transparent, then slowly went dark, the mouse cursor was stuck in the middle of the screen and I couldn't control it, attempts to move the mouse were meet with the cursor thrashing back and force in a one inch hidden square.  I was unable to do anyting at all, I eventually had to ctl, alt, del out of the game then manually close it out..  It wound up costing me the 39 minutes I had played...\n\n\nThe positives..  the atmosphere is fairly unnerving, even with the above mentioned sound issues.  The art style is rather unique and sets it apart from alot of the other FP horror games flooding the market.. The story seems engaging and interesting for the most part.  Provided you care to seek it out from the various scraps of paper which lay around.  The map layout is fairly simplistic to remember (not overly complicated to increase)  the puzzles are simple.\n\nI would have to not recommend this game currently, this may change provided the developer goes back and attempts to fix some of the bugs and glitches I mentioned above, and at the bare minimum includes some type of settings in the game menu.  Subtitles would also be very beneficial, especially for people who are hard of hearing like myself...","September 9, 2015","false","3.9"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","52","58","5","2"

March 2, 2016\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!  I was part of the Kickstarter that funded this game.  There have been no updates since November/December of 2015!!!  No release of Episode 2.  No fulfillment of the KS rewards and would appeare to dead development wise.\nBUYER BEWARE!!! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS UNFINISHED PIECE OF ****!!!!\n\n\n\nPosted: Aug 16, 2015 @ 11:34pm\nSo I've played episode one....  I will "hold my breath" for episode 2 to make a final call, but as of right now I can't really say that I would recommend this game to anyone just yet.  But there is a lot of potential here and hopefully that opinion will change after Episode 2 comes out.  That said, so far this is what I have to say about episode one...\n\n\nPros:\n=Lots of potential for good complexe/twisty plot\n=Decent starting (as in for episode 1 out of 6) "BOO!" and creepy crawly skin moments\n=Ok puzzles (I'm not good with word puzzles so the combination one took me a bit, but the rest were easy once I found the clues.  Finding the clues was the hard part.)\n=Ok atmosphere\n=Decent layout (though I saw no or any kind of access to a "third floor" yet it was mentioned in a diary note on the first floor.)\n=Nice "little touches" (graphitti, desks, chairs, junk, diary notes, etc.)\n\n\n\nCons:  (Some of this is just my experience with the game and, your milage may vary!!)\n=Some of the keyboard controls don't match in game listing such as:\n- use F to turn on Flashlight.... Not mentioned\n- In-Game, on screen action description reads "E or LMB to Observe" Sometimes it's E... Sometimes its LMB... But never do both/either work for the same thing.\n=Unrealistic lighting for given environment (I mean come on, there are overhead flourecent fixtures THAT ARE LIT all over the place and it's this dark??? Also getting occasional light bleeds from the ambient "blue" lighting)\n=Borked flashlight (try walking up to a wall and watch the spot DISAPPEAR before you get there.  Plus it's a spot only. does not really do much if any vacinity/spill flood lighting at all. i.e. standing in front of same wall, not only does the spot disapper but the rest of the room/wall is dark... With the flash light ON... whether the spot is visible or not.)\n=Mouse controlls (in-game look controlls) do not stop responding while in inventory screen.\n=Some models seem unfinished/incomplete (wheel chair that moves with non-rotating wheels, phonograph with no moving parts while playing music, obviously round doors that are octogon/decagon shaped, etc.)","August 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","32","36","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/387070/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Ugh, where to start. One Final Breath is another piece of Unity garbage that's labeled as "horror" when in fact it's yet another key finding simulator.\n\nYou're an alcoholic father who's divorced because of your alcoholism and you have to go find your daughter. The story is basic and fairly typical in this day and age. You look for keys to unlock doors to get further into being able to find your daughter.\n\nThe controls are insanely clunky. Sometimes you have to be really spot on if you want to interact with something. Do you want to strafe while sprinting? Good luck with that. Do you want to sprint at all? Keep hitting shift and hope for the best. By the way, your flashlight has a limited battery life; who knew? Certainly not I until it suddenly stopped working, because there is no battery indicator or mention of this anywhere within the game.\n\nThe emblematic problems that come along with Unity of course plague this game. Consistent FPS? Nah, who needs it, even on high end gaming rigs such as mine (specs in profile). The achievements don't even work right. But hey, that's what you get when you use an engine that costs $50 to learn and own for life. Unity will be the death of horror games.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 1, 2015","false","1.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","26","28","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/387070/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","Unity horror games are a dime a dozen. For a lot of them, a dime is also all they’re worth. One Final Breath is yet another Unity-based horror game. It shows promise, but isn’t there yet.\n\nAs a divorced alcoholic, your ex-wife calls to tell you that your daughter has run away, and because you’re a divorced alcoholic, you’re clearly a great father, and decide to go track her down and bring her back home.\n\nYou head to St. Mary’s School, where “believing in kids, gods gift” is apparently their poorly worded and grammar lacking motto, and your journey begins. You must find a key to open a door, which will give you another key to open another door, and once in there, you’ll get a keycard, nah just kidding, another key.\n\nEventually, chapter one ends. And you’ll be scratching your head.\n\nWhat is annoying is that Episode 0, which I imagine would’ve been a quick prelude to the game, was a cutscene that was about 90 seconds long. Why was this considered an episode? Why couldn’t the cutscene play at the beginning of episode one, like the vast majority of games?\n\nProsMusic. For an indie game with what I’m assuming is a small budget, the music is fairly decent. There’s not much variation to it, but it isn’t grating enough to become annoying.\n\nActing. The acting is surprisingly good. The protagonist definitely sounds like he’s an alcoholic, and has that gruff, harsh voice of someone who no longer really cares.\n\nConsGraphics/animation. The graphics are okay. I’ve seen worse. While they get the job done, there’s a fair amount of artifacting, with objects popping or weird lighting effects that defy the way lights fall. Your character’s animation is also very stiff, the worst being when you answer your phone, and your arm slowly raises from your side like some sort of battery powered animatronic that’s in need of a battery change.\n\nControls. They’re horrible. Strafing is absolutely atrocious. If you try to combine walking or running while strafing, good luck with that. There are no options to change sensitivity, either.\n\nPsychic protagonist. All of the keys you pick up are what appear to be unmarked metal keys, as shown in your inventory. Yet when you open your inventory, most of the keys have a description of what they’re for. “B1 Bathroom Key” or “Office Key”. With no markings on them, and we’re assuming this guy isn’t part of the staff, because he clearly isn’t, how does he know which key opens what? Any sort of suspension of disbelief is shattered.\n\nJournals. Throughout the game, there are many journals to read. When you see one, it’ll have the exact same text and be labeled the same, yet when you actually use it, it’s different text. That text is also very small, and it’s actually much easier to read what’s on the paper before you interact with it. Odd design choice and/or lack of…\n\n…attention to detail. It doesn’t exist. A wheelchair that rolls across the hall in front of you, yet the wheels don’t actually move. Story notes that are identical. Music that doesn’t always sound positional (such as the gramophone in the gym). Also, at some point for no reason, my flashlight went out and I couldn't turn it back on. Does the flashlight have a limited battery? If so, that should be portrayed somehow, perhaps with him banging the side of it, hoping it doesn't go out, or just flat out say you have limited time with it. If it's not intended, then it's a very odd bug.\n\nConclusionIn its current state, the game is a bit below average. It’s not horrible by any stretch, and there’s definite promise, but it has a way to go. Controls should be updated to be less clunky, some proofreading wouldn’t hurt, and most of the design decisions need to be fleshed out.\n\nTry it if it’s in a bundle, or a giveaway. As there’s currently only one episode available (as of this review), which can be completed in about 40 minutes or quicker, there’s not much here for your money (ignore my play time; I finished it before cards unlocked, and it sat idling for a bit to finish). Once all episodes are released, if all episodes are released, it might be worth a second look.","November 5, 2015","false","1.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Than I was stuck in front of first door because game says to simply press LMB to open it. Ok, after 30 minutes of struggle I found a key in a closet, equied it in inventory - but still can't open a door. In videos I clearly see people just open it and go through. So I can't even tell if the game is bad or good. I asked my friend who completed the game already to test it - and he just walked through the door. So I guess "First Door Puzzle" difficulty differs from player to player.\n\nAnd loading times even in menu - really? 20-30 seconds to go back to previous menu? I remember games were loading slow back there. Yeap, 20-25 years ago. But menus were fast.\n\nStill want to enjoy the game so will try to at least re-download it.\n\nEDIT: Two weeks later, 01.12.15. Developer is aware current game build is broken and unpayable and doing nothing. According to other reviews problem appeared at least in august. Which is very strange because earlier builds were playable. What stops him from downgrading to earlier build - I don't know.

Graphically One Final Breath might look rough and unpolished but the developers have done a great job at keeping it that way capturing the creepy atmosphere with dark fuzzy and sometimes hard to see spots in the environment where you will need your flashlight to help guide your way.\n\nThere is a lot of searching and a bit of puzzle solving but most to move through and progress you need to find keys to unlock doors, quite a little too many keys in my opinion but hopefully in the episodes ahead the developers will try and mix it again and move away from getting player to look for keys and come up with other ways to progress through the level/story.\n\nOne Final Breath has the making and potential to be a great creepy horror game, with pretty good voice acting and the controls not too annoying, hopefully with the coming episodes the devs can iron out any bugs and come up with more interesting ways to progress through the story.\n","October 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

First of all, there's the rather wacky "detective"-style monologue of our booze-happy protagonist, which while a little on the "inappropriate" side for a game whose primary aim should be SCARING us, is at least...er...yes, "different", I suppose.  Secondly, the slightly cartoon-ish graphics are...well, again, DIFFERENT!  You may be getting the impression by now that I'm not necessarily using the word "different" to imply "genius", but points to the devs for vaguely trying and all that jazz.\n\nThen there's a lot - and I mean a LOT - of things in this which are all-too-familiar to those of us who buy every second first-person horror game that comes out.  A lack of a flashlight*, which doesn't so much add to the atmosphere, but makes searching around for keys and what-not a bit of a chore.  And did I say KEYS?  Yup, lots of THEM in this game, too.  You know you're in for a key-heavy game when you attempt to open the door to a public bathroom and are told, "I need to find a key to open this bathroom".  Thank ♥♥♥♥ it isn't that hard to gain access to a public toilet in the REAL world (unless you're in France).  What else?  Well, the sound effects drop in and out and seem unfinished at best; some of the "animations" (e.g. our character raising his phone to answer it) are lifeless and robotic; there's oodles of doors which you not only can't unlock, but indeed can't seem to interact with any more than you could a perfectly featureless brick wall; keypad panels next to doors which are almost impossible to successfully interact with...and so on and so forth.\n\nThere's some other distinct lacks of originality which I noticed, but these are really more observations than complaints, as I generally eat this kinda thing up for breakfast in all honesty.  How about a school with weird "overhangs" from a hospital, such as wheelchairs with ghostly spinning wheels...sound familiar?  How about said hospital crossing over into an asylum?  Spooky little girls with black hair?  No...none of that rings any bells for you?!  Man, you really don't watch too many horror movies or play too many horror games, do you?!?\n\nAlas, almost everything that I've stated thus far might be eminently forgiveable, if this game didn't commit perhaps the cardinal sin of any self-professed "horror" game...that is to say, it just ISN'T THAT SCARY.  Sure, it's a tiny bit "spooky", and yeah, there's a couple of very minor and faintly effective "jump scares" up its worn sleeves, but nothing even remotely inspired.\n\nI guess it goes without saying that this game isn't QUITE as good as it looks in the screenshots.  But really, what should I expect at this stage?  We should all know by now that any game whose Store page makes you go "♥♥♥♥ me, that looks ♥♥♥♥ing AWESOME!" is probably going to fall substantially short of expectations, unless it has words like "Outlast" or "Amnesia" in the title.  I only have myself to blame, really.  I really should know better.  Oh well.  No doubt there'll be another game just like this in the Store by this time next week, and unless the price is suitably outrageous, I'll probably be a ♥♥♥♥ and buy that one too.  Sigh.\n\nNow, I see you're waiting anxiously for the PUNCHLINE to all I've said thus far?  C'mon...you know it already.  You've looked at the Store page.  You've heard my testimony thus far.  And you've had a glance at my playing time.  What you maybe DON'T know is that I have a tendency to pause things for short periods whilst I go off and do other (quite possibly more productive) things, like visit the toilet (the one in my flat, which I definitely don't need a key to gain access to).  So yes, sure enough...IT'S A VERY SHORT GAME.\n\nNow, granted, it still has a few "episodes" to go, and I believe I'll get these for "free" down the track as part of my mighty four dollar expenditure.  But unless future episodes are substantially longer, it's still going to be only a few hours in length, tops.  In all sincerity, such things affect my opinion of games very little, as long as they're high quality games for whom the short length seems more than justified given the narrative being told (see "Among The Sleep" for one such example).  Now, I honestly can't see the limited charms of this game improving THAT much over the course of subsequent episodes - should said episodes even appear - but I'm nothing if not over-generous, so I'm going to give it a thumb-up anyway.  A very WEAK thumb-up.  Like, say, a HALF-SEVERED thumb at best?\n\nONLY BUY IF YOU'RE DESPERATE OR A HORROR COMPLETIST, LIKE MY IDIOT SELF.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nVerdict: 5/10.\n\n(* Yes, I too can see a flashlight in the screenshots and video.  But I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I could actually find it IN THE GAME.)","August 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 20 of 57 people (35%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","35","20","57","6","4"

The environment is good I feel like I was in the school/hospital myself. rooms and corridors are gloom with total darkness in the far end. without a flashlight, there was a few times I paused, just to regain some courage to turn around, or simply go to the next corner since I was so afraid to see "things". So imagine I almost throw my mouse away when I saw a scary girl come out of no where, let along a wheelchair moved by itself lol. The puzzle is fine, graphic is acceptable and the music fits as well.\n\nThe first episode is bit short I'm definitely looking for the next one. And I had a glitch while playing, my corsor flicks all the time and the E button is not working properly. (So I clicked instead). And I  saw an achievement about open a bathroom...I didn't get this one which is a bit odd. Well hope you could fix them in the near future and again, I quite enjoyed the game just hope the next chapters are not too scary!","August 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 5 of 26 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","5","26","2","0"

This game is very simple to pick up, anyone can jump right in a figure out how to play.

This makes for a compelling game that keeps you engaged and coming back for more.\n\nThe game runs in Unity, which is a great game development architecture which allows for a rich and deep gaming experience.\n\nThe graphics of the game are nothing to boast about (in comparison to a triple A title), but that’s a positive – especially as it means that you could run this game on almost any given rig. The frame rate is a constant 60 fps, the controls are simplistic and suitable and the game itself runs well and bug-free in my experience.\n\nThe game features an involving storyline, with a rich narrative told through good voice acting and cinematic to match. This is perhaps the strongest element of the game and is carried through well into gameplay. The episodic nature of the game is an interesting choice and keeps you coming back for more content, especially if you like playing narrative games in long bursts (like me)!\n\nI would love for a more in-depth graphics options being built-in to the game’s menu, and a general expansion of options – for example subtitle options, key rebinding and so on. This would make more sense being made accessible in-game rather than through a launcher. It’s more of a convenience thing.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great game for those who love dynamic storytelling and compelling gameplay. Definitely recommended!","August 10, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 55 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","5","55","2","2"
