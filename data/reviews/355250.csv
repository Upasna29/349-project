Arguably the best version of this game by far. That being said, the "classic" version seems to run flawlessly. The game is fun but the graphics are limited to 320x480. The 1995 version had VESA support and doubled it to 640x480.\n2) The 1998 version doesn't work properly. The intro/cutscenes stutter, the UI doesn't work properly, and there appears to be a mouse emulation problem. (And if you try to use hardware mode, the game just crashes entirely on startup.) Not sure why as this same exact release of this game was put out on GoG six months ago without these issues. Does Valve even test these things before they ok them for release? Hopefully, they will resolve these issues at some point, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nThe price also seems high, but I thought it would totally be worth it if the 1995 collector's cd version had been included, just to have these in my Steam library. I still have the original CD and it works flawlessly with DosBox. That may change later on as well. For now though, I would stay away from this.","April 30, 2015","false","1.3"," 143 of 164 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","143","164","2","0"

If you have a joystick, then by all means: buy it! Otherwise... well, see below.\n\nIf you buy the game you get two separate games installed onto your computer: the Classic Version and the Collector's Edition- which has voice acting and immeasurably better graphics. The Collector's Edition will not even run unless the game detects that a joystick is connected to your computer- I don't know if it will register a USB controller as a joystick or not. The Classic version- meanwhile- runs on a hideously glitchy version of DOS Box. I played for twenty minutes before 95% of the keys on my keyboard stopped working. I had to Ctrl-Alt-Del out of the game because the Abort Mission button wasn't working. Playing the classic edition I don't believe you can adjust the mouse sensitivity and you turn so friggin' slowly using the mouse that any kind of hectic mission is unplayable.\n\nOn the bright side: if you can actually play it, this game is one of the greatest flight sims ever made. Plenty of missions, an immersive story, energy management and targetting computer systems that keep the gameplay ever-changing, and a great variety of missions.

Trust me, I've played nearly all of them. I've played the good ones (Jedi Knight/Dark Forces, Knights of the Old Republic), I've played the bad ones (Rebel Assault, Super Bombad Racing), and I've played the ones no one has ever heard of (The Gungan Frontier, Droidworks). TIE Fighter stands alone as the greatest Star Wars game ever made, and one of the great classic old-school PC games.\n\nStar Wars: TIE Fighter is a flight simulator game. Remember when that used to be a genre? Where have all of those games gone? So if you're looking to play this game, you need to fight a USB joystick. Remember when those used to be a thing? Ahh the 90s... But seriously, get yourself a fight stick. This game DOES NOT play well with a mouse or keyboard. I haven't tried using a controller, but for the optimal TIE Fighter pilot experience, you're probably going to want a joystick.\n\nStar Wars: TIE Fighter is a sort-of sequel to Star Wars: X-Wing, which was released a year earlier in 1993. I say "sort-of" sequel because it's essentially the same game, but you play as the Empire instead of the Rebellion, which is way, way cooler. Star Wars fans know what I'm talking about. There's also a few game engine upgrades, mechanical tweaks and graphical enhancements in TIE Fighter which make it slightly more polished than its predecessor. You'll start as a lowly trainee pilot, given the Imperial standard TIE Fighter at the beginning of the first campaign. The first levels start you off doing routine cargo inspections and escort missions while teaching you the controls for the ship, which are surprisingly complex. Nearly every button on the keyboard is mapped to one ship function or another. As you progress through the campaigns, you gain access to additional ships, progressing from TIE Fighter, to TIE Interceptor, to TIE Bomber to eventually experimental prototype craft like the TIE Advanced. The mission types vary as well, from cover missions to bombing raids, to starfighter dogfights, even full on epic assaults as in the movies.\n\nWhile piloting your craft, you'll usually need to pay attention to several systems at once. You need to watch the recharge rate of your lasers/ions. If there's not enough energy in the cannon bays, you won't be able to fire. Increasing the recharge rate of your cannons draws power from other systems on the craft, like shields or engines. You'll also need to watch the energy level of the shields. If there's not enough energy in the shields, you're defenseless. But increasing the recharge rate of the shields similarly draws power from other systems like engines and cannons. So there's a little power balance subgame you'll be constantly playing throughout the mission which usually gets pretty frantic while your trying to keep one enemy ship in your sights while two or three others are on your tail. Some of the power balance is situational as well. For instance, cannons are not as important when attacking a stationary defense platform with no starfighter support, so cannon power can be redirected to engines or to boost shields. And shields are not as important as the speed to keep up and maneuver with faster targets, like the Rebel A-Wing. Here, shield power should be redirected to engines. The loadout of your craft can be customized as well. Equip the fast, ship seeking concussion missiles when expecting heavy starfighter resistance. Bring slow, but heavy damage dealing proton torpedoes when on a bombing run. Like any good game, there's a good bit of strategy mixed in with the skill required to succeed.\n\nThe game does the movies such great justice. Seemingly every measure was taken to try to deliver the experience of piloting a starfighter just like in the movies. The little details like what systems and weapons and speeds each of the Star Wars craft should have are perfectly replicated here in the game. Concessions are not made. For instance, TIE Fighters, TIE Interceptors and TIE Bombers have no hyperdrives. They need to return back to the star destroyer or space platform from which they launched at the end of the mission. They also have no shielding systems, so they can be destroyed in two or three shots. Just like the movies. It's the little details that give this game so much credit with me and probably with other Star Wars fans as well. The game is even voice acted, and acted surprisingly well considering it was 1994. Most of the missions take place between The Battle of Hoth and The Battle of Endor, but for the super hardcore Star Wars fans, there's a whole set of missions that has you serving for Grand Admiral Thrawn, from Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire books. There's lots of really awesome Star Wars references and homages like that throughout the game.\n\nSummary:\nKOTOR and Jedi Knight/Dark Forces come close, but this is definitely the best Star Wars game ever made. Don't believe me? Check this game out. It's fun, fast, requires a good mix of skill and strategy, and is very true to the movies.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","April 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 100 of 114 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","100","114","0","2"

I spent so many hours in High School playing this game over and over and never getting tired of it. This game, Jedi Knight, and the KOTOR series are the best Star Wars games to date, masterpieces in their own ways, that leave you begging and coming back for more.\n\nA few things before I review it, this does include the updated version of the game with the better textures and also the DOS classic. I prefer the remake because it immerses me a lot more than the polygon DOS version. Not to say DOS games are bad (love Dark Forces and Betrayal At Krondor) but with the updated textures, you can see you're really going after a Gold A-Wing or a freighter and the like. Also, USB controllers do work for this game. My Logitech Dual Action (Looks like a PS2 controller if you're unsure) is USB and works perfectly for this game.\n\nEverything about this game is perfect. You get a decent plot moved through by cutscenes between battles and missions, a pre-mission briefing and debriefing with a flight officer and a servant of the Empreror himself, and great in flight orders and notifications from the flight officer and other wingmen.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, making you feel like you are a pilot for the Empire. You have many options for combat and defense in terms of matching speed with targets, ion cannons to disable ships, warheads for extra punch on small fighters to capital ships, scans to see what ships are carrying, even balancing weapon to shield to engine recharge rates. This flexibility gives a great element of strategy, do you need shields more or will you sacrifice them for speed and so on.\n\nCombat is extremely fun. A-Wing pilot dogfighting is my favorite since they are fast and programmed to dodge you well. Taking down capital ships and surviving, what can I say? A great thrill watching a frigate blow up from your heavy rockets.\n\nShips range from the classic TIE, Bomber, Interceptor, Advanced, Defender (my personal fav), and two specialty ships, the assault gunboat for heavy combat with fighters to capital ships and a Missile Boat used to intercept warheads fired at capital ships. The combat simulator allows you to play with the different types to get a feel for them before trying them in the campaign.\n\nMusic,I hear the MIDI system on DOS is a lot better than the updated. I will admit, the music loops, but it's classic Star Wars John Williams crystal clear tracks. It is repeatitive, but hey, put on your own tracks on iTunes or turn the music off. My fav part with the music, however, is when you accomplish an objective, the Imperial March plays, making you feel like a boss for taking out some Rebel Scum.\n\nAs for downsides to the game...it's really hard for me to find any outside of two petty issues. One, it can get repeatitive. Fly and target this ship, defend this ship, take this capital ship out, etc. The story and flow and immersion make up for that. Game tasks can be repeatitive, but I know some people can get bored with that sort of thing. It's nothing to the point of boredom, however. You may feel you're doing the same thing, but the plot flow and mission flow easily make up for that. Second, I want more missions. I want to fly between episodes 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and beyond. I wanna see new ships on both sides. Either than that, this game has no real downsides imo.\n\nEven if you're not a Flight Sim fan, you will love this game, especially if you're a Star Wars fan. X-Wing was the start of magic, TIE Fighter took X-Wing and blew it out of the water taking X-Wing's excellent ideas and multiplying them by a thousand. This is a must own for new gamers, old gamers, and a great chance to reclaim a classic that is compatible on modern OS (I have 7, works fine. Heard issues for 10, hopefully will be fixed). Get this game, you won't be disappointed.\n\n10 out of 10","November 21, 2015","true","13.1"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","49","56","0","0"

I first played it at a friend’s house, and then went home to beg my parents to buy a 386 computer so I could play it at home too (this was during the 486 era).  I spent 100's of hours fighting for the empire in this game, and I don't regret a single moment of it!  Granted, the graphics are a bit dated by today's standards, but the gameplay is still unparalleled!\n\nWhen this showed up on steam I wanted to buy it, but with reports of errors, and a missing 1995 Collector's CD-ROM (IMHO the best edition), I couldn't justify the purchase.

The 1994 floppy disk version works perfectly too! But the 1998 'Special Edition' version had some issues.  It required me to download some direct draw files to play in 3D mode, and add a startup switch to hide the mouse cursor, which is all covered by 'Solution 1 - XWA Wrapper' in this community post.  It was a small hastle, and still crashes when a song finishes every once in a while, but not bad when you take into account the fact that this game is over 20 years old.  As an added bonus for doing this, the 'Special Edition' version can then be played in stretched widescreen with a very simple config edit to the above XWA Wrapper solution!\n\nSteam controller owners have access to a community binding that sets the controller up so you won't ever have to use the keyboard for any in-flight function!\n\n10/10 + 1 point for widescreen = 11/10","May 3","true","6.8"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","3"

I guess if you want to use the work arounds that even allow the game to run on any modern system it can be fine but what's the point.  I cant imagine using the included DOS version with no voice.  The included 98 version will 100% refuse to run on anything from Windows 7 to Windows 10 unless you modify the game yourself with assorted DLL files.  However doing this will cause multiple graphic problems, kill the in game music and cause mouse duplication in some cases - well it did in mine.\n\nJust by looking in the discussion forum and in the threads, its painful to see how little (read: none) support is given from the people who are actually selling the game and taking your hard earned money.  Ultimately I cannot recommend this on a purely technical level - I cant imagine veterans wanting to have the nostalgia ruined by this technical mess and I cannot fathom anyone new to the series to even dare try this for the first time.\n\nTo end, this is also a statement on Steams quality control - all games really should be tested on basic operating systems and if you try to sell a game from 1994/1998 and it doesnt run, or even guarenteed to run, on a modern system of anything in the last 5 years please explicitly say this in the memos.

I have fond memories as a child playing, both this game and X-Wing, dogfighting, chasing ships, scanning freighters, and carrying out secret missions for the Republic/Empire.

So I can't recommend them enough to you and anybody that likes space simulators as this is one of the best there is! Every version is compatible with gamepads (though with the DOS versions it doesn't seem like you can really remap controls so you need to play in conjunction with a keyboard, but the controller is intuitive enough).\n\nPlease play both this and X-Wing.

Many people claim that the collector's edition is the best version of this game, and chose to not recommend this game because it doesn't come with that version. Well, your mileage may very, but I found I preferred the special edition version.\n\nOther than that, my favorite thing about this game is that it gives you the ability to adjust the difficulty so you don't get too frustrated. Unlike the previous X Wing game, you have difficulty settings and you can turn on cheats without losing the ability to progress in the story. This makes this game MUCH more playable and fun - and it still gives you some incentive to play with the harder settings by penalizing your score if you use cheats or play on easier difficulty settings.\n\nOverall, though, it's really immersive in the same way (though not QUITE as spectacular) as Republic Commando. There's voice acting in missions which makes it easier to keep track of what is going on and adds to the feeling that you're actually there.\n\nI don't know what it's like if you don't have a joystick, though, so I can't comment on that.","June 13, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I still have my cd's but prefer playing through Steam.\nHopefully Lucas arts/Disney will release a new version of these games someday. Could you imagine XWA in modern graphics? I cannot relate to the people who are whining about not being able to add the XWAU or comparing it to the GOG release My entire time on this game has been unmodified on the standard vanilla game. I think the game was fantastic as a release and it does not need playing with.\n\nThank you Steam!\n\nTie Fighter. This game is incredible, the only reason I rate XWA higher is the combat simulator and updates are just fantastic. But TF was immense for its time and I still enjoy it now. The story is fantastic, the whole treachery with Admiral Harkov and Zaarin is awesome.

I love this game and it isn't just nostalgia: on replay I find it not only holds up but it excels in an oversaturated market.\n\nPerfectly immersive.  Craft feel fundamentally different as you fly them.  Enemy pilots exhibit ranges of skill and courage.  Missions are varied, with great in-universe briefings to set the scene.  The main plot is an exercise in show-don't-tell which casts the player as a peacekeeper on the side of order in a galaxy torn apart by piracy.  A secretive figure brings secondary mission objectives which  reveal subplots and the favour of the Emperor himself to those who dig a little deeper.\n\nIt's hard, but (unlike its predecessor X-Wing) it rarely feels unfair.  I find myself leaping back into missions I've failed to give 'em another go.\n\nThis Steam version is the definitive version of the game, including the two expansions, touched-up (comparatively) hi-rez models, and the fully voiced audio track of the Special Edition.  If you bought it on GoG, buy it again here.\n\nIt might be hard to get into it if you weren't a fan of Star Wars' space battles, but - to me at least - it's as close as you can get to a perfect game.","May 7, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're gonna need a joystick.  An XBox controller will work, but remapping the controls is confusing, and some controls are not remappable.  For example, on the XBox controller, you're not gonna be able to steer the ship with the right analog stick...but who'd wanna do that?  I highly recommend using GlovePIE to create some custom controller layouts, as remapping buttons in-game is like pulling teeth...\n\nBUT.  Once you find a reliable, comfortable way to control the game, you're in for a treat.  The missions are fun, and they're much more than "Fly here, destroy this thing", the story is engaging, and managing your ships power levels while dogfighting is...well surprisingly engaging.\n\nThis game is all kinds of great, but could benefit from some streamlining of controls, because no matter how you slice it, you're gonna need to keep your mouse and keyboard handy, and you're gonna have to memorize a ton of keyboard shortcuts.  That's not this game's fault though, it's just how PC games were in 1994.","May 25, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I hope that one day we will see this amazing genre revived !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","November 29, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mostly came down to the Star Wars games or the Wing Commander series if you wanted a first person space combat sim... and flying a Tie Figher (or an X-Wing, depending on game) was far too much of a drawcard not to give it a go.\n\nUnfortunately, it really has dated very badly. It can still be a lot of fun, but the clumsy interface and horrible resolution leaves a lot to be desired in this day and age.  The missions are heavily scripted, but challenging. You can be blown up almost right at the end of a very long mission, and will need to start again from scratch.  At first this is fine, but maybe I've been spoiled by the quick-save generation of games... but having to repeat the same scripted missions over and over really started to feel like a grind.\n\nIn short - it's a great game that hasn't aged well. If you love the early Star Wars universe and don't mind a bit of antiquation, then this could well be the game for you.  If you're wanting to re-live the space combat sim of your youth, however... have a long hard think about how rose-tinted your nostalgia glasses are before you buy it.","September 6, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I expect excessive troubleshooting from a pirated copy of the original DOS version of the game, not from a "remastered" edition that you're buying from a modern digital distributor. The "classic" edition is emulated via Dosbox (i.e.: something you coud've found for free on abandonware sites), and the remastered edition doesn't want to launch at all unless you jump through endless hoops. Steam dropped the ball on this one, unfortunately. Given how this is genuinely one of the best Star Wars games ever made, that makes things all the more disappointing.","March 1","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As of 5/3/2016, the 1 year exlusive deal GoG had on CD Collector's edition is over with.  Patched to include this on steam.  Now this release has parity with the GoG version and is a big thumbs up.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT2: This is greatest game for PC ever, don't be confused.  However, the thumbs down is for this particular Steam version.  Note, though, that despite its failure to include the Collector's CD, it is possible to MOD that stuff in.  This will remain a thumbs down to inform would-be buyers of the deficiency, however.\n\n\nRecommend purchasing the version on GOG and not this one.\n\nThis does not currently include the Collector's Edition CD version, commonly regarded as the best version of this game.\n\nThis one gives you an option between launching the Classic version (1994 DOS) and the Remastered (1998 Windows).\n\nThe Classic lacks the rather atmosphere defining voice files for the briefings and the graphics upgrades that is included in the Collector's Edition CD.\n\nThe Remastered kills the ambiance by lacking the dynamic music system and old school MIDIs and other penchants of the DOS/Collector's Edition.\n\nMeanwhile the Collector's Edition CD version is included seemingly exclusively in the GOG version (announced today, 4/28/2015).\n\nEDIT: Recommend purchase on GOG IF GOG's advertising claim that it has the Collector's CD is true... you'll have to see GOG's website and its user comments about that one.\nEDIT3: Folks are saying it is true. Users may just have to refresh account to get it on their list.\n\nEDIT4: I had emailed Disney support regarding the Collector's CD absence inquiring about its inclusion in the future.  I received a somewhat cheeky response: "we are not sure what kind of content could be coming out for this game in the future.
