Let me be the first non lazy person to write a bad review.\nThis game was for a dollar the first 1-2 hours it came out on steam. Devloper decided to make it free-to-play, possibly to introduce more people into this game, for future buying of the next episodes. Everyone with a high point-n-click games standards may avoid this without further reading. Everything in the game is a HUGE BORE. Story is really nothing special to keep you playing. Characters are so uninspired. The art style is dull. Humour is very lacking. Everything else is too simple. Like, flash-game-style simple.  I know this game is indie, and you can't have high expectations on this type of genre, but i've seen games better than this on flash-portals for free. This game is free too, but you will have to pay for future episodes (possibly). So i don't see a point of this being on steam, maybe on the mobile store, but not here. Steam is turning into another google play very quickly, but that doesn't mean you've got to help him suffer. Have mercy.","June 11, 2014","false","0.6"," 194 of 270 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","194","270","0","2"

The voices were terribly done, and the main character complains too much. There are some moments where you really do need to use hints, like when you have to talk to the bad tempered guard and ask him "What's with you" 3x - Come on, how are we supposed to know that his response is going to change after asking the same question multiple times? Well atleast most of the characters in this chapter don't have different responses. The voice of the girl is really cheesy and annoying, and the guard voices are terrible too, especially the "Muscular guard". Also, the game takes too long to get around, there should be a run option or something to speed up movement. If you want a game that's like this but is a lot better - try The Silent Age on iPhone or Android. Hopefully the next chapters of this game will be decent, but this game was just awful.","June 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 82 of 119 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","82","119","0","7"

Alright, now what? There are no immediate clues as to what you should do at any point in the game. If you aren't used to thinking outside the box, then this game will give you a problem. The constant, "Hey, are you there?" after standing still for 10 seconds waiting for a hint was annoying. The voices weren't that great, either - they all sound computer generated. Although, according to the credits, different people played each character.\n\nThe main character doesn't give many clues to what you have to do, either - he just says, "Why?" or, "Umm...no." or, "I don't think I need that." If you don't know that you have to throw the newspaper in the garbage can, grab some leather and matches, and start a fire, then you're stuck standing there until you can use your next hint. Fortunately, you only have to wait 2.5 minutes in between each one. But, as I said before, the constant, "Hey, are you there?" is annoying.\n\nAlso, the storyline - it is intriguing as to what happened to the city and why/how he lost his memory, but the game doesn't give you any clues to that, even after completing it. Yes, it is the first chapter, and yes, I know more will probably be revealed in future chapters, and that is why much isn't revealed, but after finishing the game and still not knowing close to anything, I really have no desire to play the future chapters, especially if they are as bland as this one. I know you can't expect too much from the point & click genre, but this looks like it was made more than two years ago. The artwork is pretty bland, even for a two dimensional game, and I got tired of looking at it after a while.\n\nIf you keep the audio in the default settings, you're likely to notice that there are times when the music is way too loud when characters are talking. However this can be adjusted in the settings menu.\n\nIf you're looking for a short game to pass some time, then this will keep you entertained for a bit. But if you're looking for an intriguing game that will always keep you on your toes, with good artwork and sound, then this isn't for you.\n\nOne final thing....why is hypnotizing a rat an achievement? It does absolutely nothing to help you progress in any way. Just why.\n\nI'm sure someone will completely disagree with me and everything I said, but this is a review, and so it is my opinion. If the next installments are the same as this, I definitely won't be playing them, although I'll probably give the next one a try just to see.\n\nTL;DR - bad art, bad voices, too short, no clues for what to do next, bland storyline\n\nEDIT: I noticed the second chapter is available, however it isn't free. I would never pay for it especially considering how uninteresting the first chapter was. So going off of that I won't be trying it.","June 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 53 of 75 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","53","75","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeyourexit/recommended/270570/","makeyourexit","amok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makeyourexit/","296 products in account","The best word to summarise this game is "amateurish". While it's ok at its core, I can't recommend it while respecting your time, because it doesn't add anything to the genre while failing on some basic levels:\n\nThe English voice acting is bad. And I mean really bad. It's literally the worst I've ever heard in my life. It's so bad that it's funny. They actually made the game worse by adding this content. This shouldn't be considered a show stopper, as you can just disable it, and I've recommended adventure games without voice acting before. But it's the first thing you'll notice and it does taint the experience unless you turn it off.\nUnfortunately, you'll be falling back on dialogue which is not much more believable than the voice acting. People just don't talk that way. There is also some English translation weirdness, but it's relatively minor.\nThe UI breaks de facto adventure gaming standards. You have to double click to open a verb dial. You can also double click to navigate to the next screen, so single click is literally not needed in the game, making me wonder why they didn't just use single click everywhere, like virtually all other adventure games. This takes some getting used to. Breaking convention for no good reason is one thing, but breaking it while making things more awkard suggests no thought was given to this at all. Another example: rather than spacebar to highlight hotspots, the shortcut is ctrl-tab. CTRL-TAB! Fortunately there's also a button on the toolbar to do this, so no biggie.\nFor the most part, the puzzle design is pretty good, but this is undermined by some classic design shortcomings: (a) One puzzle requires asking the same person the same question 3x until his answer changes. (b) Often, you won't be able to interact with an object until you examine it first, so I found myself trying [use] then [examine], and walking away fruitless, when [examine] then [use] would have produced a result. (c) The game suffers from the character having to learn things the player may already have thought of before an action can be taken, and it feels a bit patronising being forced to jump through hoops to do what you intended all along. The industry has long since moved on from these very oldschool design choices, as they increase the likeliness of needing a walkthrough to complete the game while adding no enjoyment, and it's disappointing to see them return in a modern game.\nOn one playthrough (there is an achievement for completing the game twice; the only reason anyone would), an item I needed to complete the game never appeared in the inventory. This game is only 1 hour long, and that's a pretty horrid bug. Another time I was massive and walking on the ceiling, but exiting the screen fixed that.\nI guess to be fair I should speak to Reversion chapter 1's good points:\nThe puzzles are generally interesting (though frequently undermined as summarised above).\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some humour including breaking the fourth wall.\nThe art is decent enough, and suits the games often comical tone (but your walk animation is kinda amateur/hilarious).\nIt's free (but it's really only a demo for the proceeding commercial chapters, and chapter 2 has a worse community rating than this).\nI honestly can't think of anything else. Does music which is just passable enough to not get on my nerves as it loops every 55 seconds count as a positve? What the hell, it does now.","September 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","1"

It was the same, click on everything to see what it is, talk to people you meet, put items in an inventory & use them to interact with other items or parts of the enviroment (you know, the same stuff as usual).\nThe story is pretty simple, you wake-up under guard in a hospital, with a minor case of amnesia. The aim of this episode is (as the title sugests) to escape. The writting was good, with a (very) few ok jokes.\nThis was a very short game, i finished it in about 1hr, but i had fun the whole time. I'll get the 2nd Episode if it's on sale, just to see what happens next.\nI'll re-play it to get the "Finish Game Twice" achievement, & then i'll have another 100% Perfect Game\nConsidering this game is free, i don't think there's much reason not to play it.

Does the developer not have any idea how other point-n-click adventure games work?\n\nExamples of what I mean:\n\n1) Your character has to walk up to any object before he will comment on it, regardless of whether your chosen action is "look" or "interact". Such a completely pointless waste of time! This is made extra irritating by the fact that your character walks slower than a snail and there is absolutely no way to control walking speed!\n\n2) Why make your character walk if the walking animation is ugly-looking as hell?! He actually "overlaps" the doctor when he walks towards him! Even 8-bit pixel adventure games have better walking animation!\n\n3) To look at or use any active object in the playing screen, you have to double-click on that object, wait for that object's menu to pop up, then select "look" or "interact". As if the double-clicking isn't bad enough, each time you double-click, your character starts to walk towards the object, even though you haven't selected an action to perform and may not ultimately select one! Bearing in mind how ugly-looking and painfully SLOW the walking is (see point #2 above), this just makes doing simple things like looking at stuff a painstaking, tedious affair.\n\nI just didn't have the patience for this one.\n\nI would suggest that the developer look at and play other good adventure games, then follow their example in terms of controls and interactivity.","January 13","false","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

To me, those storylines are a total copout of trying to tell a suspenseful plot by ‘discovering’ your past. Yet some have done a reasonable job like Stalker and XIII. This game Reversion – The Escape is a difficult one to state whether this amnesia copout plotline holds up as it forms part of a trilogy. Being the first one, there’s not much to say as your main goal is to escape the hospital and because it only last one hour, its best-selling point is that it’s free, and there’s nothing wrong with that unless you want to continue on with the saga then you have to pay for them (I think it’s around $AUD 6 each).\n\nThe game plays out as your typical point and click adventure game. Double left click to get the menu where you can talk / grab or examine or right click to access your inventory. You can also join items by dragging / dropping two items to make a third and some items are simply red herrings. So there’s nothing new presented here as far as adventure games are concerned.\n\nThe puzzles presented are not challenging at all as the clues are quite obvious. Examples like ‘…for the moment’ triggers that you are missing some sort of action and so forth. Also there’s not a lot happening as it plays on one event leads on to another so you won’t be juggling many puzzles in one go. Thankfully the puzzles are all logical so it shouldn’t be too difficult to resolve them. Just examine and talk to everyone and you cannot fail.\n\nThe game advertises that it plays homage to the old school adventure games. You can see this via the visuals as it all renders in 2D and actually does look nice. The character’s walking animation are quite stiff however you won’t be suffering from pixel hunting here. The musical scores are very pleasant to hear with sombre scores when doing some investigations and the title screen has an upbeat tempo. Sometimes I wonder if the game is an afterthought from the music itself. The voice acting is pretty decent too yet it has its odd moments of that ‘emotionless’ speech however nothing to cringe about.\n\nBecause this game is free, you cannot argue how good / bad it is however because it forms part of a trilogy, I guess you can say you are getting an entrée before the main course. Yet the strongest feature for any adventure game is its storytelling however there’s nothing really thrilling about this one. If developers 3f interactive can pull it off with the next two and increase the length, then it would be a decent purchase overall. However time will tell if this is the case and as for me, the game wasn’t thrilling at all yet enjoyable enough to finish it off with all sixteen achievements earned.\n\n5 / 10","November 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

After playing this one -as a demo- I would totally buy the rest of the game... BUT only if Chapter 2 isn't as short as this one.\n\nWhat I liked about this gamedemo (besides the beautiful Buenos Aires):\nThe Argentinian mood: we don't really get to see the city of Buenos Aires (other than a glimpse of the Obelisc at the end), but the tango-inspired music and the Argentinian accent in the Spanish version are perfect. I haven't played the other languages, but even the casual cockyness of the characters is very Buenos Aires.\nThe illustrations are nice and simple.\nThe voice acting was quite good (again, I can only vouch for the Spanish version), with the participation of a well known Argentinian actor. Only a line here and there sounded a bit forced, but in general it was great, sounded natural and authentic. EXCEPT for the laughter. The two characters who laughed were awful at it, at least in Spanish.\nThe little bits of humor, including Argentina as World Champion for the 6th time, which made me laugh in pain.\nThere isn't pixel-hunting for that one item that kind of mimics with its background and gets you stuck in the game for ages. There aren't ridiculous combinations of items. Things are pretty logical.What I didn't like about this gamedemo:\nThe gameplay becomes somewhat annoying. To interact with anything/anyone, you have to double-click on it, rather than the usual single click, and then decide if you want to look, use/take or speak.\nThe only reason the gameplay doesn't get to be too annoying is that it's over before you get annoyed. However, if I consider it a demo, that's fine.\nAll the puzzles are "inventory based" or just a series of actions, like asking more questions or using X on Y. These are all quite easy to figure out in this game. That's not so bad, but in the end it's not very challenging.All in all, I recommend anyone who likes classic point-and-click games to try this demo.

I must say that this is the first game I've played for which I needed to check a guide at almost every step.\n- Sometimes you need to repeat the same action several times until it unlocks the next step - which I find very annoying.\n- The mouse cursor doesn't change when you hover an object of interest or a person to talk to them. There are options to inspect objects, take them and talk to persons but those are enabled only if you click the right item.\n-  The inventory is opened in a separate window that covers almost entirely the game area. Every time you need to use an item from the inventory, you need to select the item, close the screen and only after that use the object with the desired target. I consider this to be a very bad design decision since the objects that are ment to be used together (from the inventory or from the scene) need to be visible all the time.\n- There is no option to skip the dialogues.\n\nOn a positive note, it's a short game (around 1h of game play) with very easy achievements - in a single walkthrough you can collect all the achievements except one (that requires a second play through); although keep in  mind that some of them are known to be bugged. Nevertheless it's a very easy game to max out for the achievement collectors.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","July 11, 2014","false","1.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Let's also not forget it's incredibly bad dialogue that just adds even more horribleness to the voice acting.\n\nThere is a bit of good about this game, other than it being a freebie. You can get achievements rather easily, and the artwork of the game, although cartoony,  doesnt make me want to rip my retinas out with a spoon.

The game system is very poorly designed: basically, you need to double-click something and choose what function to enact with it, walking slowly over to it, to do anything. This tends to get rather tedious, to a far greater extent than most such games, but fortunately the game is short enough to make such bearable. Also, the voice acting is particularly bad too. It has a sequel, which costs money, but I'm not sure yet if that one is any better. Still, for a free point-and-click game, it's not too bad.

Inspired by classics of the genre. You will be propelled to a desolate future, robbed of your memories and looking desperately for a clue to understanding your predicament. Well, you're in a hospital, woke up facing an ugly doctor, a redhead woman, a broken window and a terribly voiced set of guards.

From what I have seen there is only one other episode currently released (2/6 episodes out).\n\nThe point and click element of the game works well, and its pretty much the standard of how they play out. The item combinations make sense, and shouldn't stop you for to long. Some bits of dialogue or options should be taken out however when you complete certain sequences because at that point it becomes pointless.\n\nExample: Distracting the doctor after getting the sedative from the closet is the only time you need that option.\n\nWhat is weird in the example is that you do not need to distract him from the syringe however when it comes to the vial you require it. Why is it that you can steal a doctor item right in front of him thats on the tray, he does not react. When you go to the back to open the closet, open it and want to take a vial you suddenly stop because you suspect he will catch you. Seems rather inconsistent.\n\nTreat this game as a demo of how the rest of the game will play out (chapters) and see if the story is interesting enough to warrant purchasing or downloading the rest of the chapters.","June 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

At one point, you have to bother someone a few times before you have the clues to move on.

The game is not intuitive at all. Also, there seems to be only one way to successfully finish the chapter. Nothing else seems to work. The dialogue is contrived, monotonous, and repetative. Also, unless you do things in a certain order, you won't succeed. 3FInteractive should have had multiple ways to finish the story, with varying levels of success/completion, and have that affect what's available/doable for the next chapter.

Because even if you don't like it, you get those from it so it doesn't feel like you've wasted the whole time you were playing it.\nThe voice acting is grating, but you can get around it by turning off the sound and putting on some subtitles. One other annoying thing was that there were so many interactable objects that did nothing (the broken window on the ground, etc.) that I thought could be used to actually do something. I mean, in point and click games, usually if you have the option to use something, it's because you need to use it, but there were a lot of things it implied you could more than look at but never could do anything with (or the cables in the toilet stall). That and having to wait for a hint made me feel like I was playing a facebook game. Also the hints don't recharge if you've switched tabs, which again is annoying. I'm pretty rubbish at point and click games so it might just be me that needed all those hints anyway. Which meant a lot of the time I was just clicking randomly, trying to kill time while I waited for the next hint to become available. Also if you're re-playing it for an achievement, you're gonna wish the text was skipable faster.\n","June 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The following parts will cost you 6 bucks each.\n\n2nd: Keep in mind that there are tons of better adventures out there, for less money.\n\n3rd: This is work in progress and an indie game. It's not close to be finished and never might be. So only invest in the other parts if you can stand cliffhanger for a long time, because every chapter seems to end with one.\n\n+ Professional dubbing...\n- ... that seems slightly out of place, mainly because there are no proper background noises. Developer is using  a really annoying background music, it is not befitting the mood/atmosphere.\n\n+ Nicely drawn pictures...\n- ... that are soullessly animated.\n\n+ Most objects/npcs have 3 different ways to interact with: talk to, look at, and take/use...\n- ... but most of the time you don't need all that options for the game. Clicking them is not entertaining and you have got to use double click, to open the interaction menue.\n\n+ Most riddles have different stages, which need a variety of items or input from other npcs...\n- ...sadly you won't get any feedback at all on how to use your items or how to interact with static objects or persons.\n\n+ There is a hint option...\n- ... with a cooldown.\n\nConclusion: This fraction of a game is quite boring. That is quite harsh, bearing in mind that this first chapter is used as advertisment for the steep priced other parts.\n\nYou'll probably need more time to download it, than to play it through.\n\nImho there are two good types of adventures: The funny ones and the ones with tension/ a deep story. This on lacks the entertaining fun, the monumental narrative and an satisfying ending.\n\nThe developers should have done their homework, before charging 6 bucks per following episode.\n\n61/100  for this foiled attempt.","July 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

In Reversion you play as Christian. You wake up in a hospital with no memories what so ever. You know that its a war in Buenos Aires and the year is 2035. You find out that youre locked in the hospital and you have to escape the soldiers that keep you locked up. So how is Reversion ? Its quite decent if you can look past its flaws. Now for the pros. The game art looks great and the writing is quite charming. The puzzles are simple and quite easy to figure out. The game also has funny jokes in it and also a pretty good soundtrack. The game also has a few flaws. Even though the game has simple puzzles there are also a few illogical ones too. The game also has abysmal Voice Acting which sounds weird. The game has a few bugs that ruin the game they need to fix as soon as possible. And also the game is FREE only the first episode. Overall Reversion Episode 1 is a decent game and i can see myself buying the second episode.

I found the voice acting annoying, so I turned off all voices near the start of the game.\n\nAlso, some sections of puzzles seem a bit extraneous. Like the fact that I have to click on a person's name (next to a picture of a key) on a sheet of paper to realize "Oh, this person has a key!", and hence advance the game by opening up dialogue choices. I can SEE that the person has a key; don't take me for a blind idiot.\n\nFar too many places one can click on, but most of those places merely provide flavourtext and are not related to the story.\n\nPerson walks WAY too slowly. If it were presented in 1st-person mode (like the Submachine series or ALMOST EVERY OTHER ESCAPE GAME), it would be a vast improvement.\n\nFar too short for a game I need to download. This would do much better on a Flash game site, like Kongregate.\n\nIn any case, as others have mentioned, the only reason I downloaded it was because it was free. If it had even cost 50 cents, I likely wouldn't have bought it based on the reviews, and I don't regret the decision to not buy it if it had cost money.","November 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters.\n\nAs you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck.\n\nIt's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally.\n\nThere are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.\nIt depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.\n","July 31, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/270570/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Reversion: Chapter 1, is the first of many chapters in the game series Reversion, by 3f Interactive. In this game you will be taking on the role of a character who has no memory of his past. All he knows is that mysteriously 20 years seem to have disappeared, and he has no idea what his name is. You will find yourself in a hospital that has seen better days, and it appears that there is a group of mercenaries determined to keep you right where you are.\n\nGraphically I think this game looks solid. The characters all have that unique feel and look. The cast of people you interact with is small, but that doesn't mean that this game falls flat when it comes to variety. Sure this chapter takes place solely in the hospital and you are only going to be able to interact in eight different scenes, but they are all very well crafted, and they look polished. It is also refreshing to see that you are going to be dealing with characters that are not all the same body type of height.\n\nOne that I thought was not close to what I would have expected was the voice acting, or should I say the almost monotone variations of voices. It was not the easiest thing to get through, and there was definitely some missing context in some of the conversations. Now I fully understand that this is not a game that was first created for English speaking individuals, and perhaps they didn't have anyone who really knew English grammar all that well, but for an English speaker, it was a bit difficult.\n\nThe controls were your average mouse adventure game. You are going to click to move, hold the click to find out what type of interactions you can have with what you have chosen (touch, look, talk). The right mouse button opens up your inventory. There's also a button that kind of looks like a radar screen that when clicked upon will highlight all the objects that you can in some shape or form interact with.\n\nAlright so lets get into this game, you are a person who knows some stuff, but doesn't know the important stuff, such as name, or the actual year. Something big has happened and the city of Buenos Aires is not only in chaos, but it would appear that there is no true leader. You were found unconscious and were brought in for examination and interrogation. You start the game before the second part. Now knowing that this chapter was free I was not expecting much, and to that end when the first chapter did end at the 45 minute mark, I was a little confused but at the same time I let it slide. There was definitely some depth to the game, there was some combining of items to defeat a puzzle or obstacle, I just wish that there was more to this chapter.\n\nSo if you are looking to see what those developers outside the US are capable of I would recommend taking a look at this game. If you are looking for an episodic point click adventure game with a strong first chapter, you are going to be left wanting when in one sitting you have already conquered the entire chapter. Sadly because of lack of content I have to give this game a 6.5 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakemun/recommended/270570/","jakemun","Literally Everyone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakemun/","257 products in account","Reversion is a point-and-click "escape" game (as indicated by the sub-title). If you were around in the dark ages of the internet you're probably more than familiar with these, being the go-to "hello world" genre of choice for flash developers.\n\nOK, awkwardly phrased intro done, let's get onto the real review. This game is horrible for a veritable smorgasbord of reasons.\n\nWe'll start with the plot. You play as "Straight White Male" (hereafter referred to as SWM), a character completely devoid of personality who wakes up in a hospital room with amnesia. Yes, apparently we're still doing amnesia. After establishing SWM's amnesia we go on to learn that a civil war has broken out and that it is 20 years later than SWM thought it was. Apparently he's a time traveller too or something stupid like that. There's also a doctor, a love interest (sorry, "woman") called "Victoria" and a soldier, though everyone seems to be avoiding the word "soldier".\n\nSince I got bored of the game very early on, I'm just going to guess the rest of the plot.\n\nSWM and Victoria escape the hospital and join up with "The Resistance". Through a series of misadventures they work hard to bring down whatever the other faction is, as Victoria's heart warms to SWM (possibly due to his charismatic blandness), Eventually they kill Hitler or whatever and fall in love.\n\nThe voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting. Everything is flat and emotionless, the doctor being the worst offender. The pacing of the lines is horrible as well, there's no pause in between them so everything has this weird rushed feel, despite the lines themselves being slowly paced.\n\nThe dialogue itself is pretty horrendous as well. It's fairly obvious that it wasn't written natively in English : not in itself a bad thing but the translation has been done poorly. There are odd quirks in the subject matter as well, where it is painfully obvious that the characters are speaking around the plot in order to hide information from the player, so that they can find it out later on and be surprised.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes: it's a traditional point/click escape game. The puzzles don't make any sense so you have to just wander around all the areas at a painfully slow pace, clicking everything and combining everything with everything else. So in that respect it's pretty faithful to the genre.\n\nIn conclusion, don't.\n\nDespite being free, I'd still advise you to spend your money elsewhere.","August 5, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And now, at this moment, I'm gonna give the game a thumbs up...\n\nLet's first talk about bad stuff, then the good, then I'll try and explain the overall impression and why I've given it positive grade.\n\nThe game has many things against it - the voice over is bad. The char's are flat and lifeless, and translation is abysmal with lots of non-sequiturs and seemingly butchered meanings, but which uninterrupted went on to voice actors, to sound mixers, to testers. Easily it could have been done far more satisfactory. The graphics are simple and remind me of late 2000s flash animation style. There is no option for full HD resolution. Even in my full HD full screen, there are black borders, the game doesn't scale up. There's not much music, nor sound effects. UI is clunky with option wheel which has to be pressed for a second to open, and no way to change default function (there's only three - look, talk, use/take) and always use the same click for it.\n\nBut what's good with the game? The setting is unique in more than one way - not just that it's set in Argentina, Buenos Aires, but in the future of the city where some cataclysm devastated the city and supposedly made an independent militia controlled city-state of it. Even in this golden age of indie development, it's extremely rare to experience something which isn't centered in standard circle of western culture in adventure games. It's either some traditional western(ised) setting (say US, New Orleans for Gabriel Knight, Paris for Broken Sword), or some extremely exotic setting like dungeons, far future, or jungle temples. Usually it's completely ignored that there are millions, if not billions of people living in some different urban settings which aren't either New York, or, say, far east. This game allows me to experience different culture. So that's a great plus in my books.\n\nThe standard adventure gameplay mechanic flows nicely. There is a hint function, so I was never stuck for long. Usage of objects is logical, there's no "use brick on tin can to squish it open and then use antique wig to gather the tomato sauce"* nonsense, even though actual intentions and objectives could have been expressed better. As said, hints keep the game going nicely. And it's short and sweet having no delusions of grandeur. It's an indie game through and through. More importantly, even with that about shortness said, the sense of mystery and adventure hits the precise spot I had from the days of the Curse of the Monkey IslandTM. I want to explore further, I want to learn the story and the world. I want some answers goshdarnit! Big plus there!\n\nBut what's the most positive sign, and the reason I've started this review with a date of all things - is the price. The first episode is free on Steam. Second episode is out and I got it in a humble sale. I started playing it, but quickly the same sense of mystery forced me to download this one and find out how the story started. There are lots of negative reviews, here on Steam, but now, at this date, with these conditions, there's no reason why you shouldn't try the first episode. It's an adventure snack. I actually waited for some other game to download and ended playing it till the end in 66 minutes.\n\nI remember the time not so long ago people said adventure games are dead. This isn't the game that will singlehandedly save the genre - it's the proof it's actually so much alive that the games are vital enough to develop in non-standard settings and tell non-standard stories from small developing teams who don't even bother to translate their official game blog to english.\n\nIt is what it is. And, considering the price, yes. You should try it.\n\n*NOT an actual example!","September 14, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the overall concept and story engaging enough that I went ahead and bought Chapter Two, which is available for six bucks from the publisher's website.  Also, I happen to be a fan of old-school point-and-click adventure games.\n\nHowever, I have to be honest: the voice-acting is terrible, the animation is mediocre, and the plot is extremely thin.\n\nReversion was created in Argentina, so what you're getting is a subbed-and-dubbed version (although it does come with numerous language options, which is a plus).  The result is that you have conversations which sound very much like the actors are reading directly off a script, without once hearing each others' lines.  Inflection and tone are painfully awkward at times, and to top it off, it looks like nobody proofread the subtitles, which are rife with basic spelling errors.\n\nThe artwork itself is gorgeous, presenting an immersive feeling of post-apocalyptic (at least for Buenos Aires) adventure.  And while the story is, as I said, thin, it's competently presented with no bugs or plot holes.  There's also a built-in hint system which will dole out tips only after some time has passed, requiring you to at least mull things over before trying to cheat your way through the game.\n\nAll in all, I give it six Havanas out of ten... it would be seven, had the voice acting and subtitling translations been up to par.","June 17, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now for why I would not recommend this game to anyone who shares the same love as I do for escape games.\n\nNow just looking at the story itself is decent, but the face that it is so short is enough to make this game bad. On my frist playthrough of this game it took me maybe 100 minutes where I got all the achivements but two. Then I played it the secound time it only took me 8.\n\nNow time for for me to tell you something else why I do not recommend this game. Half the time you don't even know what to click on or let alone even do, because the game does not give you any information on what you need to do next.  Some thing else that makes me not recommend this game is the mostiure radar. The mostiure radar is used for absolutely nothing besides showing you what you can click on.\n\nOne more reason that I don't like this game is because this is only good for one playthrough.","January 24, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, for the most part, the puzzles are easy to piece together and require little out of the player except for a little bit of short term memory, making the game extremely short (about one hour on the first playthrough, without hints, and twenty minutes on my second). Some of the puzzles are oddly specific, though, requiring you to click on specific things, things that the player can figure out without the narritive aid of the character, which can be irritating.\n\nAs for the animation and graphics, I kinda liked the visuals, as I liked the emphasis of things on characters, such as a large gut, but it was obvious that the animator had little work when it came to walking, as most of the time, the character slides across the floor. Also, some of the animations just look silly or are just cut out, maybe to spare the animator from animating something a little harder.\n\nThe voice acting is horrid. The main character has little expression in his voice and after a first playthrough, it grates against your ears, at least in English (the game was made in another country, most likely Argentina, so Spanish would likely sound a lot better).\n\nThe sound design is pretty alright. There weren't any out of place sounds, and I kinda sorta liked the main menu theme, though it sounds a little out of place at first.\n\nOverall, the team could have done a lot more polishing to their game, but I would be willing to pay for another chapter of this series if they stepped it up a notch in all departments. For the modest price of free, and considering that you are intrested, check the game out.","July 7, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got all of the achievements very quickly in two full playthroughs and was completely uninterested in the characters due to their flat personalities, the narrator's annoying narcissism, and the obviously bad voice acting (which I waive slightly because the game was made by someone who wasn't English). The plot was alright but way too vague. I guess that's what the next chapter is for, but it didn't seem very clear even with the exposition-spewing doctor.\n\nI did enjoy the art style, although the dim colors made it a little unengaging.\n\nOverall, the game is alright but not star quality by any standard.

Most of all, the actions you take all make sense. I've played several point and clicks where you had to mix things or do things that were ridiculous and tooo far fetched...but so far this isn't one of those games.  I'm honestly suprised someone complained that they didn't know what to do from the start. Most of it was pretty intuative for me. I was only REALLY stumped at one part and had to look up a walkthrough. Stupid angry guard.  (I'll add some tips below for those who are interested)\n\nThe Mediocre\nThe voice acting and script was a little flat...but my native language is English, and I'm thinking that it might sound better in spanish, which is how it was originally intended. With that in mind, I'm pretty happy that they took the time to record an english version and I didnt have to just read what everyone was saying. Don't worry about the translation...the english is fine, everything made sense. It was just...flat..especially compared to more polished (and more expensive) games like Jack Keene, or The Walking Dead.\n\n\nHINTS\nI've added some hints for parts that were difficult for me. To read the full hint, just hover over the blocked text. I will try not to give a full spoiler, just the best tip I can for the handful of things that took me a little longer to figure out.\n\n\n- Can't figure out what a certain medicine is for?  (Try asking a doctor)\n\n- Can't steal something easily?  (Ask someone to distract the doctor)\n\n- Can't to get out of the room?  (Give the guard a good excuse!)\n\n- Can't get rid of the guard?  (You can still see his feet when in the bathroom)\n\n- Can't get to the lobby?  (Make SURE the guard wont move if he wakes up)\n\n- Can't get any info from the angry guard?  (Ask him "what's wrong" a few times)\n\nOkay...with these hints, you should now have access to all the rooms in the chapter. If you get stuck, find a full walkthrough just for a quick hint to get the game moving.

First off, it was just that: too short. There's an achievement you get for your profile for finishing the game in less than four hours, but I finished in less than half the time (then again, I think it's for the entire game and not just for this first chapter.).\n\nAnother thing was how the description said it was "science-fiction" but the game itself gave little, if any, indication of any sci-fi element. Maybe we'll see more as we go along, but I wish they'd have given me more than just half a picture with a (mad?) scientist.\n\nThe graphics were...what can I say? Too simple? Childish? If the main conflict of the game is against an totalitarian, oppressive military government in the middle of dystopian Buenos Aires, don’t hire the guy who makes Team Umizoomi to animate it! Seriously, it looks like something I would read to my little brother after tucking him in bed.\n\nThere was nothing about the plot that hooked me. Way too generic, way too cliche. Guy wakes up in a hospital with no memory, hospital taken over by insurgents, must escape. The characters are also very generic, uninspired, and sometimes even unrealistic. For example: early in the game, Cristian has to ask Victoria (the redheaded girl) to distract the doctor so he can steal some sedative. She distracts the doctor by pretending her ankle is hurt, but I'll tell you right now that NO REAL DOCTOR will ever believe you if you say, "Ow. Ow. My ankle is in pain" in such a monotonous, unfeeling voice. The guards sound way less aggressive than they should be, and Cristian is so uninspired. I know this is just an indie game, but at least you'd put more effort into the voice acting. And what’s with the evil laugh coming from the guards and the little bald guy in the end? If you’re going to go that route, at least put some effort into it.\n\nCristian does some really stupid things for a guy in his situation. Like when he finds the newspaper on the floor and whines about Argentina losing the World Cup. OH COME ON, you’ve been in a coma for twenty years and lost your memory, but when you finally get the chance to read concrete information about what happened while you were unconscious, you only care about soccer scores!?!\n\nIf you're the type of gamer who likes to find several different ways to solve a problem or objective, this game is NOT for you. There is literally only ONE way to get out of the hospital (which is, SPOILER, climbing down a rope from the room you woke up in), and it makes the game a lot more boring than it could’ve been. I know point-and-click games are sometimes like that, but the game presented itself with so many other options without letting me. I could’ve climbed the bathroom stall and pulled the cords hanging down from the ceiling to turn out the lights and at least get some time to distract the guards, or I could’ve just cut the wires in any of the exposed light switches. I could’ve sedated the other guards with the syringe. I could’ve climbed down the giant tree or the pipes that were right next to the window. I could’ve gotten the other guards to put out the fire while I escaped. You also have to use the hint button a lot because some of the next steps are really obscure. How was I to know that you ask the bad-tempered guard the same question three times before you get a different answer? And as you’re waiting for the next hint to come up, Cristian gets really annoying when he groans, "Booooring!!" or "Are you still there?" every five seconds.\n\nLastly, there are some parts where I laughed out loud because they were just so RIDICULOUS. Such as when Cristian switches his clothes out with the guard after he knocks him out―one of those folding wardrobe things where people change clothes behind (sorry, the name escapes me) magically appears and disappears when he's done. Also, when he's taping up the guard,   the guard actually looked up and gave him this BIG SMILE like he was having the greatest time in his life.\n\nOne more thing...why is hypnotizing the rat considered an achievement? Where the heck were you supposed to get the flute, anyway?\n","June 18, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are quite a Flash-style - pretty, but the animation is lacking.`Musical themes aren't much to write about, but used well, with some silent moments nicely placed. Control aren't as intuitive, having to double click everything to interact.\n\nThe thing is, it's a drag. You get to click on stuff and all the usual offer, but there isn't much of motivation to keep pressing on, story doesn't try to excite. The thing that it payes most tribute toward this genre is that you are most often will have no idea what you should do next, with a lot of "blank" objects to click on scattered around. At least this game has hint system. Well, the puzzles by themselves make sense, so at least it's not on the "Russian quests" level of game design. Can't really complain about free stuff either.\n\nAlso, those who want to try some other free quest episode should look for Episode 4 of Sam and Max on Steam.","July 28, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said I wouldnt compare it to Broken sword 1 or 2 (probably my favourite games on PC) But you should definitely give it a go as its completely free, doesnt use much space, and it isnt frustratingly hard but keeps your mind working, especially the paper part ;)","July 29, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obviously to me Reversion - The Escape's language is not primarily english and it was translated, albeit poorly. The logic in the game is hardly intuitive and the puzzles are boring. The game will not run full-screen in a Intel 4400 mobile chipset without ridiculous flickering constantly so it has to be played windowed. The voice acting is absolutely horrible, how did you get a monotone news reporter to play the doctor? It pains me to say this but after struggling to comprehend this poor game for the past half hour, it's going to be deleted and not finished.

Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters.\n\nAs you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck.\n\nIt's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally.\n\nThere are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.\nIt depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.\n","July 31, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Boy am I glad that I did not pay a cent for this game because it would've been a huge waste of money if I'm to be truthful. You start in a broken down, war torn, old hospital as a man who has lost his memory of the passed 25 years and wakes up in the year 2035. There is little insight as to what has happened other than that this war broke out in Buenos Aires and a group of people took over. From there, you must go through a series of challenging but boring tasks to escape the hospital before the General can "interrogate" you. However, once you escape the hospital with your fellow patient Victoria....the game ends. That's it. There's no detail as to when the next episode will be out and no new details as to what the heck is even going on in the storyline itself. After playing through the first time, I played through it a second time having known what to do, and found that it took my under five minutes. Quite frankly, I don't even care when the next episode comes out because if this one was any indication as to what the next one will be like, I don't even want to play it. If you're looking for an indepth point&click game with an addicting storyline and beautiful graphics, this game definitely isn't for you.

Voice acting is middling with a few glaring oddities (the main character badly mispronounces Buenos Aires at one point-- really?). I was going to excuse this, and switch the game to Spanish to sharpen up my language skills, but this apparently is not an option (at least on linux). It's a shame they dropped the ball here, because I like the music, art, gameplay (and hint system), and direction the story seems to be headed. It's definitely a casual game. This is an extremely short first chapter. It made me want to keep going (just barely), but with the flaws and probable brevity of future chapters, they need to be priced at about $1 for me to continue.","July 13, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was really smart how the makers made this free to play in order to get  it out there, you can't really complain about having to pay for the 2nd part if you hated this. It's FREE, you aren't losing anything. This part is basically setting up parts 2 and 3, it's introducing the cast of main characters, setting the plot and\nstory. The point and click system works fluently and has a very handy hint box on stand by whenever you get stuck. My very first playthrough I used this all the time. 1 thing that bugged me was some of things you had to do, you had to keep selecting the same option in order for the lieutenant to tell you that he had a sore head. Who actually knew to do that 1st time through? Or that you had to burn the paper + the tyre..? I honestly think given the chance, Reversion would really hit home with most people but having to ask straight up for help just to be put in the right direction in order to pass the game is silly. We should have the hint box for easter eggs or secrets.\nIn all I've become a fan of Reversion, I hope 3f Interactive realease part 3 on Steam. One of my favourite games at the moment.","July 13, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of all, the actions you take all make sense. I've played several point and clicks where you had to mix things or do things that were ridiculous and tooo far fetched...but so far this isn't one of those games.  I'm honestly suprised someone complained that they didn't know what to do from the start. Most of it was pretty intuative for me. I was only REALLY stumped at one part and had to look up a walkthrough. Stupid angry guard.  (I'll add some tips below for those who are interested)\n\nThe Mediocre\nThe voice acting and script was a little flat...but my native language is English, and I'm thinking that it might sound better in spanish, which is how it was originally intended. With that in mind, I'm pretty happy that they took the time to record an english version and I didnt have to just read what everyone was saying. Don't worry about the translation...the english is fine, everything made sense. It was just...flat..especially compared to more polished (and more expensive) games like Jack Keene, or The Walking Dead.\n\n\nHINTS\nI've added some hints for parts that were difficult for me. To read the full hint, just hover over the blocked text. I will try not to give a full spoiler, just the best tip I can for the handful of things that took me a little longer to figure out.\n\n\n- Can't figure out what a certain medicine is for?  (Try asking a doctor)\n\n- Can't steal something easily?  (Ask someone to distract the doctor)\n\n- Can't to get out of the room?  (Give the guard a good excuse!)\n\n- Can't get rid of the guard?  (You can still see his feet when in the bathroom)\n\n- Can't get to the lobby?  (Make SURE the guard wont move if he wakes up)\n\n- Can't get any info from the angry guard?  (Ask him "what's wrong" a few times)\n\nOkay...with these hints, you should now have access to all the rooms in the chapter. If you get stuck, find a full walkthrough just for a quick hint to get the game moving. It's better than just giving up on the whole game.","June 19, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was going to excuse this, and switch the game to Spanish to sharpen up my language skills, but this apparently is not an option (at least on linux). It's a shame they dropped the ball here, because I like the music, art, gameplay (and hint system), and direction the story seems to be headed. It's definitely a casual game. This is an extremely short first chapter.

I thought it was really smart how the makers made this free to play in order to get  it out there, you can't really complain about having to pay for the 2nd part if you hated this. It's FREE, you aren't losing anything. This part is basically setting up parts 2 and 3, it's introducing the cast of main characters, setting the plot and\nstory. The point and click system works fluently and has a very handy hint box on stand by whenever you get stuck. My very first playthrough I used this all the time. 1 thing that bugged me was some of things you had to do, you had to keep selecting the same option in order for the lieutenant to tell you that he had a sore head. Who actually knew to do that 1st time through? Or that you had to burn the paper + the tyre..? I honestly think given the chance, Reversion would really hit home with most people but having to ask straight up for help just to be put in the right direction in order to pass the game is silly. We should have the hint box for easter eggs or secrets.\nIn all I've become a fan of Reversion, I hope 3f Interactive realease part 3 on Steam.

For a free game this is really good, I love the art, the idea and the dialogue within the game.

This is a really funny and and relaxing game, that even though its a free game was really good and a lot of effort was put into this game and I cant wait to play chapter 2. I would give this a 8/10 because of how short it actually was and it only took me 40 minutes to complete without hints, because honestly I just clicked everything and it all came together pretty fast, though it took me an hour to replay it and get the acheivments. I also loved the art style of the game though the faces of the characters were pretty creepy the background and the items as well as the mercanaries there looked really good.","November 14, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it IS a free game, at least for this first chapter. The voice acting is decent, and the story itself is pretty interesting, although the characters' dialogue concerning the story itself can get tedious, especially if/when you get stuck and have to listen to the same long spiel multiple times. However, once they get going you can usually click through most of it quickly if you've heard it before.\n\nMy main issue with the gameplay was that it was linear, but set itself up to look like you could gather any piece you found and complete things as you encountered them. This leads to a fair amount of clicking on things, being told they're unusable or not helpful rather than that you can't used them right NOW, and then overlooking them later when it's actually time to do what you were trying to do before. That being said, there are hints available, for free, and they were always very clear, so while it was frustrating to learn that you were supposed to go back and fill something that you couldn't fill until you read that unrelated name on a paper, for example, it isn't an impossibly difficult game. And again, it's free.\n\nHowever, this is also ONLY the first chapter, and apparently the second is $5.99...which I'm not sure is a great deal, unless the clarity of the gameplay itself has been polished up somewhat. But for this FIRST chapter, I would recommend it for as long as it remains free.","June 5, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know it's free but both the graphics and the English voice acting are very amateurish. Also the 3 minute forced waiting time between hints is frustrating, as I only used that function when I was really stuck which meant waiting a potential full 3 minutes trying randomly clicking at things I already tried before just to pass the time. I had to use the walkthrough for the game, as waiting 3 minutes multiple times got way too boring. Also I know the game will have multiple chapters, but the story is far from getting anywhere (the amount of plot was about as much as reading the first 10 pages of a book) and the thought of similar quality sequels fills me with dread, not excitement. Overall it's a tedious and unrewarding game. Honestly I only played it through (twice!) to get all the Steam achievements for it and be able to finally uninstall it.","June 18, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
