I do not know if the problems I list in this review are still applicable. I'll update my review when I feel like playing through the game's content again. Until then, don't assume my review to be 100% indicitive of the game's current content.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen they say early access, they really mean early.\n\nI really hate to give this a thumb down, especially since I love the character art. But that's really the only thing I've enjoyed with this game so far.\n\nPros:\n-Cute characters.\n\nCons:\n-So many typos. They use 'your' instead of 'you're' three separate times. 'Nethermind' instead of 'nevermind.'  I was willing to forgive the first few mistakes but when you hit five text boxes in a row with typos it really detracts from the experience. I don't like to be a grammar nazi, but I make an exception for games based around reading. One of the characters actually says '1st' instead of 'first.'\n\n-The backgrounds are mostly uninteresting. No real sense of space or location. Most feel like static backdrops without much atmosphere, and cramped. The characters don't seem like they're standing in the environment so much as in front of it.\n\n-The dialogue is boring. The personalities come across as very shallow. "This one's the ♥♥♥♥♥y angry one, this one's the horny drunk soldier, this one's a doctor who likes to ramble." I will admit though I did find Alicia very cute, and her personality was enough to interest me, but only just (and mostly because she was cute).\n\n-The story is boring. Towards the end of the prologue, which is as far as I've played, I found myself skipping most of the text, because I didn't care about what they were saying, or even really what was happening. There are a few reasons for this. Like I said, the dialogue is flavorless and uninteresting. Most things the characters do seem to be decided on a whim, rather than given a proper reason. I found a lot of the in-universe logic didn't make much sense. The whole thing comes off as rather unpolished and it broke immersion.\n\n-Music seemed pretty placeholder, which it probably is seeing as this is all early access. Not to mention the music cuts off after twenty minutes of playtime and never comes back.\n\n-There was an error that turned the whole screen grey, and I had to press the 'ignore' button to move on with the story.\n\n-It gets hard to pay attention to who's talking, since eventually it's only the captain's portrait that shows up when she (or he) speaks. This could be fixed by showing the npc's portraits when they spoke, or assigning their names a color so you could easily grasp who was speaking, rather than the same-colored text for every name.\n\nAll this is to say, I don't think this game is worth a buy at this time.\n\nIf I were the developer(s) of this game, reading this review, I might be properly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or at least hurt. That was not my intention at all, and it really does pain me to give it a thumb down. I see this game for what it can be, rather than what it is. As of this time, it needs a lot of tlc, and I'm sure the developers are aware of that, thus the early access. However, even for early access I feel this game is too bare-bones to warrant a purchase. But you got the character art down pretty well! At least, I think all the girls in it are cute and / or sexy.\n\nI do hope my criticism was more constructive than hateful. I won't be refunding my purchase because, with a lot of work and passion, I believe this can become a great game. So if you've read this far, and you want to invest in the game as it is, then yes, buy it. If not, then steer clear until it's been given a major tune-up.\n\nGood luck developers! I hope you make something great out of this game.","May 18","false","1.2"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","44","50","3","3"

Consideration has to be given to a story's length, content (censored or not), grammar and spelling, and artwork. Many tend to excel in one department and drop off the face of the Earth in others, making it somewhat difficult to properly review. Starlight Drifter is no different, but Dharker Studio is very familiar with visual novels and brings back a stellar crew with this epic space adventure. Will this adventure take viewers into the furthest reaches of a mysterious galaxy or accidentally detour into a black hole from which none return?\n\nArtwork is usually what makes or breaks a visual novel, but this time around it clearly makes it. Character design and backgrounds are rife with robust curvature and prominent attributes. Voluptuous color pallets and well used animations for some of the backgrounds add a special and unique display that reminded me of the artist previous work, Highschool Romance (which I still gush over for it's very distinct and beautiful artwork.) Music is present, but only a couple of tracks seem to be available at the moment. What is present, however, works well to keep the reader focused and in depth with the story. I could go on for hours about the lovely art design in this piece and have to admit it is the strongest part of this visual work.\n\nOnce a character's gender and name are chosen, the story kicks off full blast from the starting line. Terms and character motivations are flung about at every turn and the intrigue continues to rise throughout the introduction. Characters are stereotyped as you would expect in most visual novels, but they fit well for what is happening. The world building sparked continued interest with each new crew member including world events or territorial disputes. It absorbed me in with a deep craving to learn more. Dialog between characters felt like a non-stop banter with each person taking pot shots at one another like it was taking place at dinner with your in-laws.\n\nIt was enjoyable to read even with the plethora of spelling errors, grammar issues, punctuation problems and even code markers showing up. I also had two occasions where an error page popped up requesting rollback, which I needed to quit and reload the section to fix. There is also several times the game would mention to make your choices carefully, but honestly so far I had yet to encounter anything with consequences. (Played through the introduction twice and made different choices.) These are just minor grips though for the biggest issue I had with the game: content.\n\nIt took me roughly 45 minutes both times I played through the introduction to complete what was on offer with the game on release. Once you complete the introduction the ship opens up to exploration and the galaxy map is unlocked to be viewed. I was excited, eager and willing to explore further with this rag-tag assortment of space dwellers and clicked on the array to see what it offered. I was quickly greeted with a statement saying relationships and exploration would open up in June. I shrugged and then clicked on the Comms room where I was met with the same thing. I switched over to the galaxy map and tried every single selection only to find them mentioning the script was finished and it would be added by the end of May. I was annoyed at this point, but it is indeed Early Access and I just went ahead and played the introduction again.\n\nIn hindsight I should have expected this, but for the starting price of $13.49 I thought it would have offered more on the start. It probably would have been a better idea to wait on releasing the game until the stated parts of the game were added, which would have really added to the content value. I absolute love the artwork and dialog for this game so far. The characters can be seen as stereotypical, but I enjoyed reading their playful banter. I was invested, interested and hungry for more. As it stands with the current price, however, I cannot recommend this visual novel. The bang for the buck is just not at the level it needs to be to justify the cost. I will be checking back often to see how this story progressing, because while I am not recommending it, you can damn well believe I am eager to change that.\n\nPros\n\n- Beautiful character designs and background artwork\n- Interesting world building\n- Dialog - wise cracks and bickering are enjoyable to read\n\nCons\n\n- Very limited on content\n- Grammar and punctuation errors\n- Random error pages\n\n","May 18","false","1.8"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","25","33","2","2"

My understanding of the purpose of early access is to allow those people whom may be interested in a project to help support that project.  Yes a small part of that support is financial, but the much bigger part of that support is in play testing the game.\n\nMy positive review is based upon the developer’s clear dedication to this project, and active solicitation of feedback from fans.  That being said, there are typos, there are lapses in proper grammar, and there will be bugs.\n\nI’ve noticed that the negative posts thus far criticizes said short comings.  I would recommend that if you are a person who has adverse visceral reactions to either spelling or grammar errors, that you wait until release before making a decision to purchase this game.\n\nAs a graduate student, I understand the need for proper syntax.  I have lost the occasional percentage point for a misplaced comma or dangling participle.  But there is a place and time for everything, and frankly I care more about whether a game is fun than if it meets the APA standard for writing.\n\nThat being said this game is fun, it is engaging, the characters are interesting, and most importantly the game feels original.\n\nI have high hopes for this game.  However, I will expect some of the writing to be tightened up over the course of early access.  For now I can definitively say that this game does not deserve the mostly negative rating it has!","May 21","true","1.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

The art so far is of good quality, even though there's a lot still missing.  I've come to -really- like the characters, and the artstyle\n\nThe game's got a sci-fi setting,\nSo far it has a number of characters / recruitable crew-members for the starship "IES Starlight" .  The characters are quite likable (in terms of writing), of course there are some I like more than others, this of course boils down to personal tastes.\n\nThe VN genre has grown a lot, and there's a lot more of them now than just a few years back, though they have evolved as well.  We've got RPG / VN hybrids (devs like Winterwolves specialize in those)  , "stat-raisers",  card-game / VN hybrids.  Starlight Drifter brings new elements as well, in that it's pretty open (a little further in at least),  where you're allowed to pick missions in the order you wish .\n\nAt the time of this (p)review, those missions are still pretty much under construction, yet you're allowed a "taste" of risk/reward features in the first mission you get after bringing (most) of your crew on board.\n\nThe music? It's chipper, happy, upbeat and makes me feel happy about playing the game too.\nYou get this "we're off to adventure" optimism I often find lacking in other games.\nYour captain, is an adventurer for sure and when playing I felt I slipped right into said captain's shoes.\n\nIn short? I love this game, the only thing I want to "criticise" is that ...it's not done yet...  'Cause I can't wait to play the rest.  That said? I sincerely hope the developer (AJTilley/Dharker Studios) don't rush this game, it's already shaping up to be a real gem, I don't want it to be a -tiny- gem, but a big one with -lots- of hours worth of play.\n\nMy perhaps favourite thing about Starlight Drifter? Choice!\nYou're allowed choice, where many many VN's are more linear.\nWe're allowed say of who our Captain is (name / gender) , like many (but not all) VN's there's branching, storylines, (usually boils down to 2 choices) over time all these choices heap up making each play different, you get to try different thngs, you get ....REPLAY VALUE.\nThis is something you don't see in every VN, which is why I don't fail to reckognize and commend those that do give you these choices.\n\nChoices like these make the games more complicated to write, but all the more rewarding to play.\nAt least as long as your choices and decisions matter.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up, for what I've seen so far?

I would like to make a disclaimer. I backed this game on Kickstarter, and have not been a fan of several decisions the developer has made, specifically multiple changes in art style - at least four times since the project's inception - and the decision to put the game on early access even after it was crowdfunded. The art style isn't that big of an issue, albeit the choice to change it the final time without addressing backers beforehand, and then releasing the game incomplete are points that left me very bitter towards the dev, and may color my opinion negatively.\n\nCompared to the demo version I played around two years ago, the quality of the game has vastly improved, but the characters feel extremely flat and so far I don't see any motivation other than gathering a crew for what purpose I don't know. So far all of the decisions you can make are related to whether or not you add a new crewmember to your ship, and you are more or less obligated to make the choice to add said crewmember or go without them unless they are added later regardless of your choice.\n\nThere are some typos and grammatical errors in the script, which seem to be getting fixed in frequent patches. I've noticed an issue where after a certain point character sprites stop appearing on screen, but this too might have been patched out by the time I finish writing this. I stopped playing the game after this – perceived – issue emerged.\nThis is without a doubt the developer’s most ambitious project after Echo Tokyo, especially considering the only experience their studio has is in creating relatively simple erotic visual novels, and based on what I have seen so far of Starlight Drifter it may be for the better if they stick to what they are good at.\n","June 1","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
