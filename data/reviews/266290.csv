I saw people asking in the discussions about things like trackIR, pedals and joysticks. This really isn't that sort of game so definitely don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. This is a search and rescue game that basically gives you a helicopter with basic controls (which are okay to handle but I found it a bit difficult on the landing) and gives you a number of missions where you must go and save people in various conditions.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic, and really feels quite dated. In the first mission I played it had strange requirements that made no sense. Why do I have to be at a certain height for a man to go down a rope to pick someone up? It's like artificial difficulty because the game would otherwise be rather mundane. Sadly it had the opposite effect as it just made it needlessly annoying.\n\nThe draw distance for detail on the ground is very poor so you have to be pretty much crashing into the trees below to see them appear at the same detail you'd have when you were on the helipad. The models are simple and textures are relatively low quality. The cockpit view was a definite disappointment. It didn't run all that well either, and didn't feel at all optimized. The loading screens were also abnormally long.\n\nIn comparison to the detailed and thoughtful "Car Mechanic Simulator" title they released recently, this is a huge drop in quality. I'm not saying you should steer well clear of this game, but I wouldn't recommend it either.","February 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 407 of 468 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","407","468","11","5"

A better use for the ten bucks I spent on this game would have gone to buying a second copy of Arma II, a game which I believe very nearly nailed flight physics.\n\nTHIS game, however, took everything that 5 year old game had, and threw it out the window. I bought this game expecting to be able to fly, not flounder in the air in a physics-defying "helicopter simulator"","February 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 134 of 173 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","134","173","2","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackmeow/recommended/266290/","Blackmeow","Black Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackmeow/","355 products in account","An incredibly poor game. One can only wonder where Simulator word in title comes from, probably from MFS sounds like "Pull up". The quality of the game is incredibly low, barely any animations, no physics to speak of. Helicopter feels like a rubber ball that can bounce off the ground. Cocpit is a static texture, only horizon works. Save your money and don't buy this game, it's incredibly booring and bad. All misisons come down to "Fly there, pick this up, transport it here", not to mention that there are no weather effects at all. The only sounds in this game are one and same soundtrack, 60-seconds loop 'radio chatter' and engine sound that is same for all helicopter models.  People you need to pick up can't walk few meters to the helicopter and only way to trigger 'boarding' or 'unloading' script is to shut down your engines. Most of 'disasters' in this game are hilarious! First mission requires you to rescue people from a crashed airplane... That lies 800 meters away from the hospital... I suppose it was easier to cal for a rescue helicopter than, say, drive an ambulnce across flat green field... Or mission to rescue people from an oil platform after a ship crashed into it. Ship is a tiny boat, there is no damage, no fire, people just stand on the landing pad, looking bored, and wave their hands either greeting you or begging you to look at them... Anyway, this game isn't worth your time or money.","March 2, 2014","false","1.2"," 88 of 106 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","88","106","0","0"

This is more for the people who are unsure if they should invest time and money into flight sims or not.)\n\nThis game has received a lot of flak in the reviews and some of it it really do deserve. However at this time there are only two helicopter sims on steam - not counting plane flight sims - that have helicopters so you are not exactly having too much to choose from.\n\nSo why the positive review? This game is at this time the best entry level heli sim on Steam. Better than a certain other more known game.  Yes i know THAT game has got tutorials too but it is not so good for newbies. This game does not waste too much time on tutorials and you get into action fairly quickly and get a semi-realistic engine to play with. For a newbie that is enough. Pointless to discuss 'realism' if the potential crowd is not even sure they want to be here in the first place.  I am still doing training on that other game after 2hours and that is critical if you are not entirely sure you like the genre.\n\nTurns out i like this but i did not know it until i played this game.\n\nI am currently in the process of getting myself a HOTAS setup so i guess this means i want moar of this stuff and will move on also to plane flight sims.  Now a little while ago i was overwhelmed by the stuff in certain other sims and i was not getting anywhere. Then along came this little game with training wheels on.\n\nGame does not carry you very far as the missions get really annoying but you do have some fun for awhile and the free flight mode helps. Therefore i say there IS a place for this game on Steam. Just know what you are buying. Advanced players will not get anything from this.\n\n7/10\n\nedit: Played the game with a simple Logitech 3D pro joystick.","April 27, 2015","true","6.2"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","25","39","3","1"

I find the controls are odd at first, but then again I've never flown a helicopter. While I do not have a joy stick, the keyboard controls are completely customizable are becoming much easier with play. In my opinion they do not inhibit gameplay at all. Besides its comic relief when you accidently blow up from hitting a tree because you put too much deceleration while trying to land. The blury graphical "problem" that I've seen mentioned can be easily fixed in the options menu by turning off depth blur and movement blur. All in all, I think this is a fun simulator that is worth giving a shot. I would suggest waiting to pick it up on while it's on sale though.\nP.S. you get to pick up a beached whale in the third mission","August 21, 2014","true","2.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I've been waiting for a game like this. This game is lots of fun, entertaining and you can spend many hours of interesting tasks to solve. Helicopter Simulator 2014 Search and Rescue is entertainment, fun and excitement for everyone, but not for the hardcore flight simulation player. You can not save during the play, but that is not negative, because the missions get thereby a higher voltage and you have to stay on task. You can pause at any time by pressing the ESC key. The maps are freely accessible, you can fly around everywhere or walk around. It has many different camera views, from inside cockpit and from outside and zoomable. First Person and Third Person. The missions and objectives are imaginative and exciting. While it is not a simulation in burlap sense, nevertheless one must always be careful how and where you fly. Transport rack system can alter the flight characteristics. You have sent the helicopter control as obstacles such as houses, trees, cranes, etc. are available.\n\nI can recommend this game each of you with helicopters performing work orders such as search, rescue, transport etc. Most Helicopter simulations are either primitive and boring or have a very complicated and complex mechanism in the control. In this game, you have to not torment with complicated skilled technical details. The keyboard is completely configurable. I like to play with mouse and keyboard but you can also use the joystick. With the latest update, many problems have been solved and I have found no more bugs. The sound of the helicopter is acceptable. The graphics quality is not comparable to modern expensive high-end games, but for the pure helicopter jobs, it is sufficient. An increase of the development potential in the graphic quality would be desirable, because who does not fly like a beautifully designed landscape. ;-) I play with a resolution of 2560x1440 and the game runs very smoothly. For this game, I would have gladly paid more. Compared to other helicopter games it is more than worth the money.\n\nMy personal opinion, the negative reviews of the hardcore simulation players, the game does not do justice. it's not a arcade game but also no real simulation. It is for those players who want to play the exciting helicopter missions like, who like to carry out support orders and a challenge in solving complex and tricky requirements with the atmosphere and the thrill of a helicopter, but their playing time do not want to invest in complicated technical manuals and control.\n\n","March 9, 2014","true","27.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

It is not fully realistic, but still you'd better have a Joystick with some axles for it. It is somewhere in between of Simulation and Arcade.\nCompared to Sim copter this title is more simulation and more serious. Where in Sim copter you flew around in a city and things happened which you had to clear, in this game you can fly around on different Island maps and things only happen, when you start a mission with a specific objective each. For each mission you can choose one of the helicopters that can do the job (not every Helicopter is available in every mission). There is no career mode where you get better Helicopters after some time of playing. At least there is no career mode, yet.\n\nWhat makes it absolutely worth it's money is the feedback of the devs and the overall communication between customers and developers. Main Problems that people had with the release version already are solved a few days after release. Other things are going to be implemented soon to improve the game experience.\n\nThere's a lot of crappy simulators out there, but it seems like the devs of SaR do everything for this game not to be one of them. And so far, they're doing a good job.\nA few improvements here and there, and in my oppinion this game could be worth more money.\nGraphic junkies might be a little bit diasppointed, but for everyone else the graphics are absolutely appropriate.\nThe music is annoying after a while, so I already set it off.\n\nAll in all, If you want to extinguish fires, carry stuff around and rescue people with a helicopter, this game is for you.\nCould it be better ? Yes\nIs it still fun ? Yes\nIs it worth its money ? Yes\nIs there support ?

I thought I could get  enough out of it to be worth the small price, but I don't feel like It's even worth that.\n\nThe absolute primary problem with the game is the awful controls of the helicopters. The worst part is that they couldn't be bothered to add joystick controls. You're forced to use the keyboard, and lack good references to how your cyclical stick is positioned. This makes hovering a massive pain, and given this is most of the game .. well, most of the game is a massive pain too. The game also interprets a couple of quick button hits as a desperate need to do something extreme, so you could end up dropping out of the sky or shoorting far away from your mission target. It happened far too easily and far too often that I'd be just about complete when the helicopter would suddenly shoot upwards and I'd ahve to work my way back down to the target again.\n\nDon't bother. Without joystick controls it doesn't feel like a proper helicopter simulation. The graphics aren't fantastic. The whole thing is sadly uninspired. There are plenty of other games out there far better than this for the same price.","April 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Thanks guys for the update which fixed what ever the initial problems were :)\n\nAs for gameplay it's actually fun. Graphics were decent. As for controls I played with keyboard and mouse and that worked nicely. You can either use keyboard only or mouse only or even both at the same time which I thought was nice. Sadly I wasnt able to configure and assign the proper buttons and axis on my hotas joystick and throttle, and the throttle didnt work at all. Aside from that it wasnt too bad. The game just flat out refused to recognize my combat rudder pedels and it seemed to intergrate it all into the joystick. Also tried an xbox controller and it was ok for the most part except on the right thumbstick where it seemed a bit too sensitive or something cause it would pan the camera views by itself when I tried to pan around, even a little touch would set it off wandering around the screen. And yes I did calbrate it in windows before I played. This usually dosnt happen in other games when using the xbox 360 controller. I might suggest to add settings to adjust sensitivity.\n\nAll in all I'd definately recommend this game as it has a lot of potential. The tutorial and missons were fun, the controls were easy to learn and intuitive using mouse and keyboard. It's not too easy but not too hard either like alot of other flight sims I've played, you know like the kind that might turn off newer players to the genre. So it strikes a good balance between realism and ease of use with a not so steep learning curve.\n\nDefinately looking forward to playing all the missions and flying all the helicopters now. And this is coming from a hardcore flight sim fan who has played them all.","March 6, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The problem is that it isn't really that type of game. It's not as broken and silly as other simulators, but It's also not a very good representation of flying an actual helicopter and saving people. The game is exceedingly average I think. The flying controls are rather basic and a few automations that the game gives you (auto hover comes to mind) destroy whatever fun the game can offer. Once you realize this the game is just a repetitive mess. It has maybe two songs in it, some rudimentary character models and animations. The environment is pretty bland, generic, and muddy looking, and to top it all off the game has an unnecessarily annoying depth of field that is too blurry and shifts focus too often.\n\nThe game is quirky in these regards as the animations, voice acting, and character models are laughably pathetic, but that can only really carry the experience a half an hour at most. The rest of my playtime was spent looking for a way to find utility in such a bland game.  Needless to say, I never found it.","January 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As both a fight sim enthusist as well as someone who has flown helicopcters in the past (both sim and real) I have been impressed with search and resuce series. however I can can firmly state that this is one of the worst helicopter sims that I have played. The joystick support is beyond reduculious. For example to use the collective (or thrust if in the chinook) you can only be in one small quadrant of the full up position, yet that still does not stop the collective from just dropping you into full down. Also no aerodynamic principals are considered. there is a large airfoil in the rear called a verticle fin this is designed for stability during forward flight allowing your helicopter to fly straight and effectivly reducing the ability of the yaw pedels to effect flight. Again this is not the case in this game. cyclic controls bank and direction only pedels control yaw only. perhaps this game is best suited for the mouse and keyboard however it is not very good and simulating real flight.","March 26","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feeling that the game gave so far as I can fly these coffee-mills is more important for me.\nThe only annoying thing for me is the music, as it didn't match the picture I get when I was flying over the woods or the coastline, so I switched it off completely. The last thing a pilot needs is a nerve shocking tune while performing fine aerial maneuvre.\nControls are almost like controlling an RC helicopter, takes some time to practice, and then you can even hover in a brain surgeon to perform a lobotomy through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥... on a space slug.\nAs it is not an arcade style copter game - when you push forward, the heli goes forward -  I can understand why people are freaked out on this, but still there is the "simulator" word that has to be interpreted well. And seriously, people, crash a couple RCs before bashing the controls of this game. ;)\nI love the office-menu concept, it also gives some extra to the feelings, also that you can choose a variety of helis, and not have to wait for some XP based unlock to happen; you get to choose those which are fitting for the mission.\n","May 28","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
