Every game in the series is distinct and has its own identity, which is something I really appreciate. I'll avoid going into too much detail about the rest here, but they're all a good time with individual strengths and weaknesses that form a satisfying whole.\n\nUnfortunately, the defining characteristic of game number three, The Cartel, is that it's an utter shambles. The classic Wild West setting of the previous games was ditched for a staggeringly uninspired modern-day Los Angeles/Mexico counterpart, which is exactly as appealing as it sounds (i.e. not at all). Likewise, the hole left by the entertaining and likeable cast of the first game and Bound in Blood (like legendary gunslinger Ray McCall) is filled with some of the flattest caricatures to ever spout tired one-liners. Once all the character and charm of Call of Juarez has been stripped away, what you're left with is a medicore first-person shooter that is an absolute chore in single-player and probably not much better in the new co-op mode. Solo players be warned: your AI partners are incompetent, and they will make no effort to hide it, though they will continually belittle your performance as you carry them for the game's entire duration.\n\nLackluster AI, boring gunplay, dull visuals and an uninteresting plot combine for eight hours of unmitigated tedium. The only saving grace is the way the game ends, which could have been a pretty cool conclusion to a much better game, but is of course held back here by being part of The Cartel. In retrospect it's good that the series had one final outing after this, though The Cartel remains a testament to how quickly good games can go bad. It's almost worth playing just for that lesson, though I'd suggest you try any of the others over this rubbish.","August 16, 2015","false","8.7"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","62","69","0","0"

So far so good. I would love to give it thumbs up. But unfortunatelly i will have to do the opposite.\n\nI cannot continue.\nOn first day everything was fine. Uplay and steam worked fine together. Accounts were conected and i have seen no problems.\nDay after - Uplay doesn't allow me to log in. "Too many log-in attempts". Rubbish. If 0 is too many then f*** you ubisoft.

The Cartel is the worst game in the Call of Juarez series, but it does have a few features that other games in the series (and even many co-op FPS games in general) don't have and make this game unique and somehow enjoyable to play. I would recommend this, but only when it's heavily discounted and you've got one or two friends to play in co-op with.\n\nPROS+ Good campaign mode with an intriguing (and underrated) storyline and characters, 4 endings and amazing soundtrack. It includes co-op mode, which is required for the full experience.\n+ Replayable: 3 playable characters each with their own objectives, roles and dialogues (e.g. talking with different characters on the cellphone). Playing the story once with one character, in fact, may lead to plot-holes.\n+ Varied levels with car chases, nightclub shooting, highways and more.\n+ Random challenges mid-game (e.g. kill X enemies before the other players). It kinda kills the teamwork sometimes but I find it to be a nice addition, also because the main characters, plot-wise, don't get quite along with each other.\n\nCONS- Unfinished: the game got released when its development wasn't finished yet. It is technically horrible, with dull graphics, many bugs and audio issues. Expect frustrating moments.\n- The main menu and the first levels are dull (luckily the game gets slightly better and more interesting afterwards).\n- The gunplay, the driving and grenades.\n- No drop-in joining (players can only join your co-op match at the start of a level).\n- Multiplayer is dead.\n\nPersonal rating: 58/100\n\nThe game as-is, is MOSTLY technically horrible, but if you can get past its technical issues and focus on everything else, you might enjoy it in co-op with one or two friends.\nIf only Techland had more time to develop this it could have probably been a masterpiece; co-op mode is good and unique, the story is decent with memorable moments, but the rest is heavily unpolished. Dead Island, which is made by the same devs, got released in the same year.\n\nTip before you play: don't tell your friends what you're doing and what your character says in certain moments for the full experience!","December 10, 2014","true","26.9"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","38","54","5","1"

Disappointing gunplay, terrible driving segments, paper thin characters and plotting, only play it if you're desperate for a gritty crime shooter and you've literally played everything else on your backlog.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/33420/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Call of Juarez is a western-themed FPS game series released by Ubisoft. The Cartel is the "odd one out" in this series as it is the only one taking place in a modern day setting instead of the good old Wild West. Interestingly, the concept works and it makes for a good - albeit somewhat mediocre - game that fans can feel free to pick up as it becomes, after all, an important part of the franchise.\n\nThe game is best played cooperatively. For some reason the developer decided to pick not two (remember Bound In Blood?) but 3 protagonists. When playing alone they are controlled by the A.I but they are not exactly sharpshooters; however, the upside here is that you do not need to revive any of them.\n\nThey all work for a different organisation serving their country - Ben is an LAPD cop (he wears a cowboy hat and his surname indicates he is the descendant of Ray McCall from the 1st game), Kim is from the FBI and Eddie represents the DEA. They are all after The Cartel and during gameplay each of them receives a phone call asking them to complete a secondary objective. This is pretty funny as with each player you are to pick up various things and the rest cannot know about it. If noticed, you lose the opportunity. These are all illegal activities (such as stealing money) as to a certain degree all of them are dirty.\n\nThere are some driving sequences, too. One player drives while the rest do the shooting. The mechanics are similar to the one experienced in Dead Island (another Techland game series): it is pretty easy to navigate but the camera is positioned behind the dashboard so you do not exactly have the chance to change the view. There's also levelling up that unlocks newer and more powerful weapons throughout the game but it is pretty generic. Multiplayer is also available and while it does not offer anything new it is pretty entertaining.\n\nLike I said this is the odd one out in the series but it does not mean it is a bad game. At the time (2011) the Chrome engine already looked outdated and while there is a handful of cinematics the game's story is not exactly very original. Still, The Cartel is an entertaining game and if you liked Call of Juarez you might get fond of this, too.\n\nJust remember: beside McCall's character and the slow-mo shootouts and the available revolvers nothing really makes you remember its predecessors. Perhaps it's best to wait for a discount so as not to be disappointed very much.","February 21, 2015","true","15.8"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","30","43","2","0"

But then Bound in Blood changed my mind! But then The Cartel appeared and strenghtened my first feeling! But then Gunslinger appeared and gave me that nice nostalgic feel of the 2nd one! Boy, those are a lot of "But then"s :P\nAnyways, The Cartel Is an average FPS that lets you play as 1 of the 3 agents at your choice, each one with it's unique abilities (but those abilities/skills are pretty boring, like faster reload for pistols with one guy, the other reloads faster with SMGs and can Dual-Wield them and the female agent reloads rifles faster, aaaand that is it...)\nGoing to the graphics, they are below average, bad texture pop-ins here and there and offline lag! YES! The campaign lags when you play (framerate drops and lag, actually), when you run to be specific, same issue that I had previously with Dead Island (same engine BTW).\nCharacter models are just awful and the dialogue is f*cking laughable.\nGameplay wise, the guns all feel pretty much the same, and they all feel bad! Except the pistols, so I just used the pistols the whole game, except during Concentration mode (slows down time and increases accuracy for a short period of time) that you get by killing people, and also used rifles and smg's during the car shootout and car chases, because pistol kind of suck in those situations. There are also pretty ugly bugs here and there and some glitches, but Techland just doesn't give a sh*it and instead of patching it up, they just decided to move on to another sh*tty project called Dead Island: Riptide, and that worked out pretty well, didn't it? Huh...\nMultiplayer is your standard rack up kills, get XP, new level, YAY! Here's a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon, have a blast!\nNoone plays it anymore btw, so if you want to get it, buy for the SP Campaign (with a bad story as well, pretty bad and nonsensical and uninteresting and many more bad adjectives) which is decently long (around 7 to 8 hours) and the collectibles are an interesting mechanic as well as they work like side missions and you kind of have to do it discretely so that the other 2 agents don't catch you. It makes things a bit more tense and spices up things, making the campaign interesting enough until the end.\nCo-Op is also pretty fun with friends. It's a standard 3 player maximum co-op mode where each plays one of the in-game characters.\nThere isn't much more to approach to this game but an extra fly in the soup: an extra DRM known as Games for Windows Li...AH! Just joking! It does NOT use GFWL, thankfully, but it does use UPlay, which is Ubisoft's DRM for their games, I haven't had any huge issues with this DRM, it's just annoying but I can live with it...\nit doesn't deserve more than a 4.5/10, save you 10 € for something better like Kane & Lynch 2 or Counter Strike: Global Offensive.\nI paid 4,99€ at a retail shop for this and honestly, I feel like it was worth it, but don't pay much more than that...","June 30, 2013","false","9.5"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","1"

If you're looking for a good western game, don't touch The Cartel, instead check out the original or CoJ: Gunlisnger among others.\n\nJudged by its own merits this game still lacks everything to be enjoyable - movement, gunplay and gameplay in general are below average. You might laugh once or twice the things the character says in concentration mode but overall this game offers nothing of interest. It also has a multiplayer mode which no one plays.

The first levels are as dull as they can get, but as time goes on, there are multiple scenarios that are quite engaging: car chases through cities, shootouts in rainy docks...\nThe only link to the other CoJ games are the police officer (a relative of Ray McCall) and some levels set in Juarez.\n\nThe gameplay is really mediocre: the guns are recoil-less and they feel all the same. There isn't the dynamic cover like in  "Bound In Blood", and the special ability is your typical bullet-time. The three characters are identical, if not for tiny little differences (again, unlike "Bound In Blood"): McCall has more accuracy with pistols, DEA with shotguns, FBI with rifles.\n\nThe graphics are okay, but the worst parts are the FOV that can't be changed and the Depth of Field that works like ♥♥♥ (and can't be turned off).

Turns out even the coop mode couldn't bring back any replay value. Is this is a broken game? Well, it's not entirely broken but it's not a good game either. I had 1 playthrough and I felt like deleting it off from my HDD. Unfortunately, I wanted to get Upoints from for completing all of the character's campaign. It was suffering since all of their campaign were pretty much playing the same levels again.\n\nThe good thing is that each character has their own perspective view. For instance, when your character is on the call, you can hear the conversation while others can't. This applies to coop mode where your friends can't hear what you're listening from your phone call.  Let's get straight to the point.\n\nThe graphics is awful. It's very blurry. When you aim, anything apart from your center of your aiming scope gets blurred. Sometimes when the enemies are running around and your aim focused on the tree, everything gets blurry. It's hard to aim at the enemies. Using the directX 11 doesn't seems to have any difference. This game graphics is bad.\n\nI gave the sound average is because of the voice acting. Anything else felt like low quality sound effects. Your gun sound effects doesn't feel powerful. The soundtrack isn't memorable. At least they tried to use back the cowboy soundtrack. Very weak in this department.\n\nGameplay is just a typical shooter game but feels very boring. You have multiple car chase, multiple gunfights and multiple enemy chasing on foot. Yes, they are repeating those same events through the 3 campaigns. It gets buggy like enemy pop out of no where. Enemies disappearing. The game gets broken where the event doesn't start. As for gunfight, you fight 4-5 enemies, then done, next area, 3-4 enemies, then move on, 3-4 enemies again. Very repetitive and very boring gunfight. Even in coop, it's nothing interesting about this except the challenge like who gets the 1st 5 headshots within the time limit. There are some other challenges but it's just competing with your friends That's it, nothing else. For public game, good luck finding one.\n\nStory is about the corruptions. The only reason you want to replay is because you wanted to know everyone's perspective. There are multiple ending as well. I spent so many hours on this game is because of that and the U points. Nothing much to say about this.\n\nI can't recommend this game as it is very weak. I got this game from promotion sale so I don't get much loss.\n\nMy Rating:\nExcellent\nGreat\nAverage\nBad\n\nGraphics: Bad\nSound & music: Average\nGameplay: Bad\nStory: Average","November 1, 2014","false","20.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

The point is that you have 3 protagonists who follow the main story but have unique side objectives. Although this is a good idea in theory (3 different games), they mostly just follow the same damn story and the only difference is what items you steal and the phone calls you get. Not worth 3 replays (not even 1). The story is hideously complicated with 3 different motivations and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of characters that you don't care about that it all merges together into crap. The levels are very linear and the weapon choices don’t really matter at all.\n\nThe only pros are that the controls are pretty good and the cover does shred forcing you to move.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeUFC/recommended/33420/","MikeUFC","MikeUFC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeUFC/","888 products in account","Let's be straight. Call of Juarez: The Cartel is not really a good game. It take the wild west setting of the previous installments and brings them to the modern day. The game is buggy, it's incredibly linear, the gunplay is mediocre, the enemies are on the bullet sponge side and the AI is nonexistent as your partners are absolutely worthless at times. That said, I had an absolute blast playing CoJ: The Cartel. It is the video game equivalent of playing a B-Movie, and I love B-Movies. You see all the "twists & turns" in the story a mile away in a cliche ridden script filled with stereotypes and eye rolling dialogue,  But like a trainwreck I just couldn't take my eyes off of it. You play one of the individuals from different agencies (FBI, DEA & LAPD) put in a task agency meant to take down the Mendoza Cartel who is responsible for drugs, gun running, human trafficking, domestic terrorism blah blah blah and then off you go. I really liked the level variety. You from the Sequioa National Forest to the Streets of L.A. to Arizona and finally to Juarez, Mexico. All very nicely realized. Gameplay wise, you don't have much to do other than going from point A to point B while killing lots of dirtbags along the way. Sometimes you'll get a side mission but those pretty much consist of finding an item on the level somewhere. One escort mission where you are being chased through the streets of LA and up the freeway deserves special mention. An absolute blast. I also felt the voice acting was excellent. Like I said, CoJ: The Cartel is not really a good game but I enjoyed the hell out of it.  If you're looking for political correctness, mind blowing set pieces & a leap forward into the FPS genre look elsewhere. But if the positives I've mentioned are up your alley, well here you go. 7/10 from me.","July 28, 2014","true","10.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fritzpud/recommended/33420/","fritzpud","Fritzpud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fritzpud/","1842 products in account","So for starters, I have NOT played the co-op or multiplayer, in fact, from what I played of the singleplayer I think it would be majorly improved by playing with 2 other people rather than horrible AI partners.  The driving sections in particular, as well as the sequences where you're seperated (though few and far between) would be pretty epic playing with friends.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's start with the cons.\n\nUplay\n\nVery dull, repetitive gameplay for the most part, in fact, you know how most people rag on call of duty for being 6 hours long?  I kind of wish this game was done by 4 hours, but for whatever reason I powered through.  The full time for one playthrough (on hard) for me was about 12 hours.\n\nLow rez textures ect, only good looking texture in the game is really the bull revolver (from my point of view) though this is from like 2010 so mabye I'm just nitpicking\n\nSeriously, I didn't think uplay was a thing back then, only bought it because I thought it didn't require uplay\n\nReally common scripting bugs, from having the ai chars just not move (when you literally can't play the game without them moving to you meaning you have to restart the checkpoint) to scripted sequences where you're forced to literally slow down to a crawl, put your gun away, and sit infront of your cell phone screen for 30 seconds (often in the middle of a ***ing gunfight) "NOT NOW DADDY I'm SHOOTING BAD GUYS!"\n\nReally unlikeable chars, I mean the only likeable main char was the sherrif I guess, and all the other chars are just really shallow (as in badly written, not just bad people), the story was awful, or at least awfuly portraied.  I think they were trying to fit together some kind of tv show thing where each level would be an eppisode, and had breaks from fighting to do other things (like harrass strippers, yes that's a pro).  Also, at least the ending I got was pretty terrible, though there's really about 2 endings.\n\nAnd I mean seriously, are these blood goggles?  "Don't do drug violence kids, you'll have to wear blood goggles for 10 seconds till you heal!"\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=273988393\n\nuplay plz...\n\nThe gunplay is kind of awful most of the time, but with that in mind, it's also fairly decent sometimes, it seems to be contextual.  It might be better if you're not the only one shooting *stares at ai who are shooting at a brick wall*.\n\nOk, now for the pros.\n\nThere's a suprising ammount of vairety in guns, though not in the right ways unfortunately.  There're 2 snipers (one you get halfway through the game, the other you get at the end), and yet there's like 12 standard pistols and 5 revolvers, the pistols seeming to be the main focus on gameplay.\n\nDurring the 12 hours I played this game, I may have had a mental break.  Between boredom and frustration, and who knows what else, I actually got nostalgic for the 2nd worst part of the black ops 2 campaign...  Yes, that awful horse.  Or at least for me it was awful.  I spent an hour and a half on that mission, that was supposed to take at most 30 mins, trying to deal with how broken that horse was (at launch).  I was actually getting nostalgia pangs for that part of black ops 2, I'm not sure if this is a pro for the game, but it's a pro for black ops 2 at least.  That horse section was less borring than this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108100465\n\n9:08 PM - Fritzpud: So yes, call of jurez: the cartel, was so bad that I became nostalgic for that hour and a half of my life, that's how bad i t was\n9:10 PM - aPurplePanda: thats like a -1\n9:10 PM - aPurplePanda: on a 1-10 scale\n\nWith all this in consideration I'd give this game...  A 6/10, only purchase it on a sale, it would be pretty fun with 2 other people, if you could convince them to buy it / play it with you, otherwise the single player is majorly boring, and I doubt anyone's on the multiplayer.\n\nBut one more crucial piece of information is required.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274005956\n\nI have feet!  10/10!","June 22, 2014","true","12.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It's not as good as Call of Juarez: Gunslinger; it's not a game to be taken seriously or to carry any real expectations for, whether you're a fan of this developer or not.  As action shooters go, it's definitely more of the same.  It did provide me a brief bit of fun & includes a potentially decent cooperative experience.\n\nThe Dead Island series & Dying Light are by Techland too, so if you liked those you'll be at home with The Cartel, which looks and feels similar in a number of ways.  Level design, enemy AI, linearity of missions, visuals/art, side tasks involving item collection, gun aiming & handling, driving & playable characters with unique personalities & combat characteristics all felt familiar.  What you shouldn't expect much of in The Cartel is homage to the CoJ series itself, 'cuz there ain't much.  You do get to play as a modern day McCall, dual wield revolvers, take a brief jaunt through a familiar place & hear a schpeel from a guy who's obsessed with the treasure of Juarez.  None of that gives this a real connection to the rest of the series, however.  In my opinion it lacks the flair that makes the others entertaining.\n\nBy 2011 standards The Cartel is decent, & I'd say by today's (2015) it's mediocre but worthy of purchase on the cheap.  I got it on sale and can't imagine anyone doing otherwise, by now.  It's a very brief campaign consisting of 15 missions; took me about 7 hours to finish on Medium difficulty, with the AI companions rather than real teammates.\n\nThe AI teammates worked out well enough, although I regrettably didn't play it with anyone else & thus missed out on what looks like a fun three player co-op.  You can breach rooms together, provide covering fire allowing allies to advance & also engage in some friendly competition via the Secret Agenda feature (each law enforcement agent has an ulterior motive & they each mistrust each other, so you try to catch the other two red-handed while being sneaky & accomplishing your own hidden objective unnoticed).\n\nI tried doing some multiplayer action online but was unable to find anyone for the Cops vs. Criminals mode or the online campaign mode.\n\nThis game is published by Ubisoft & requires their client, Uplay to run alongside Steam.\n\nThere were some (sadly not too) farfetched news clip cutscenes and a lot of interagency bluster between the LAPD, FBI & DEA that I found entertaining.  The entire game is pretty much a sensationalized portrayal of the Mexican Drug War.  Each character & most of the dialogue was cliche.  I feel like I'm describing a Hollywood blockbuster film.\n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't recommend Call of Juarez: The Cartel to anyone; it was okay.  It just doesn't merit recommendation unless you're looking for a quick bit of shoot-em-up action & don't have better alternatives - or if you're a big fan of this dev & just crave that experience.","July 27, 2015","false","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You almost can't set up the graphics at all, there's a motion blur and a depth blur that can be annoying at first, but you'll get used to them pretty soon. And it freezed a couple of times, but this happens with every Ubi game, so no big deal.\n\nBut for the rest? It's a simple action fps like tons of others, with badass characters "maxpayneing" their way against an army of bad dudes, a lot of gunfightings, explosions, car chasings, a story that's maybe a bit confusing but overall good, great voice acting, the same easy controls as every fps... It may not be the most original fps of all times, it's pretty easy and very linear and doesn't allow you to explore anything, but.. who cares?\nIt's fast paced, funny and entertaining for all its length, and never bored me.\n\nGive it a chance if you can, I heard awful things about it and had no expectations at all, but I was actually pleasantly surprised.","January 5, 2014","true","41.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Call of Juarez The orignal, bound in Blood, and Gunslinger are all woulderful games.\nThe game could use more settings, but that is juat an improvment. Also your companions are praticly invincable two year olds with toy guns. Also, you are not allowed to "harm too many civilans." If you don't want any innocent byatanders, Instead of failing the player and making them restarting from their last autosave (because you can't quicksave), and having them retrack their progress, just remove the option to harm any civilans. Like in Bound in Blood.\nYou shouln't buy this game if it is your first Call of Juarez game you play. you will probably end up never playing another Call of Juarez title again. And if you put the series down from this game, revisit the other three titles. I REALLY don't want this to be the game that killes the series.\nThe only reason I recommened this game, is if you have played all three other games, and are couious to see the life, and story of Ben Mcall.

Do you like intense gunplay and interesting characters ? Do you enjoy playing good games  and having fun ? - If yes then stay far away from this game!\n\nEven Modern Warfare 2 from 2009 has a lot better graphics than this game...and MW2 graphics were mediocre at best for 2009.\nHow's the gameplay ? Bad. Real bad. One of the worst gameplays i've seen in a FPS and i've played A LOT of FPS games.\n\n- The AI is simply braindead. If they don't stand still then they walk into you like zombies...how fun is that ?\n- Guns feel like...well they don't feel like anything. Even a water pistol has more impact and feel into it than these weapons. There's no recoil. Weapon sounds are pretty much none-existant and bad...just bad. Hitting a desk with your fist makes a more realistic weapon sound than firing the ingame weapons.\nWeapons also lack detail. They're just bland and they all feel the same...they feel like...like nothing.\n- Sprinting is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it makes the screen jump/move weirdly and it gets annoying fast. SPRINTING GETS ANNOYING. This right here should tell you how bad the game really is.\n- Voice acting is out of sync. It's not bad but it's just out of sync.\nOh and you get a cutscene after every 5-10 minutes of gameplay.\nThe first 15 minutes of the game is pretty much just cutscenes and they're boring.\n\nNo recoil, childish sound effects, dumbes zombie AI in FPSs, cutscenes...a lot of them, annoying sprinting, bad graphics. - Just avoid this title. You know a game is bad when you only spent 2.49 on it and you still regret buying it.\n\nI'm not a blind hater who just follows the mainstream. I watched the reviews and i was like: "Oh cmn, it can't be THAT bad". Boy was i wrong. It's even worse. I went into this game thinking that "Yeah, it's not as good as other CoJ titles but i bet it isn't that bad. It's probably mediocre but i still get a lil' kick out of it." - NOPE.

The Cartel was the natural next entry to try because other than Gunslinger (2013) it was the most recent (2011).\n\nIt's awful.\n\nI can only imagine that ads for this game claimed it was "high-octane" or contained "explosive firefights" and while there is the occasional fun moment, for the most part it is a boring, bland affair.\n\nDespite some cool concepts and set pieces, the graphics are subpar, even given when it came out. The animations are choppy, textures low-res and flat. The skyboxes are particularly grainy, like they were JPG compressed.\n\nThe sound is even worse, with horribly repetitive dialogue delivered by some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.\n\nThe menus are especially painful because of a terrible font choice and the fact that the mouse speed there is not affected by the sensitivity setting. It crawls across the screen and turns anything you want to do in a menu into a belabored chore.\n\nAnd the story is a jumbled mess of cliches.\n\nWhere a run-of-the-mill FPS normally shines when it falls flat in other areas is the gameplay. As you might expect, that's not the case here. The enemies are predictable and easy to outmaneuver even on the highest difficulty. The weapons and controls are very standard. And there are driving sections that are more frustrating and annoying than they have any right to be.\n\nUnlike all the other games in the series this one takes place in modern times instead of the Wild West. The only thing it has in common with a Call of Juarez game is the name and a concentration mode. It's like they were trying to boost sales on a project they knew would fail by randomly attaching it to this pre-existing franchise.\n\nSo if you want to play a Call of Juarez game, you're better off with Gunslinger. If you want a better FPS from 2011, then go play Homefront.","July 7, 2015","false","11.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Weeeelllll, this is not one of them. This game is filled with 2 partners that talk you down endlessly even if you miss just one shot (admittedly they praise you as well when you do a headshot but that doesn't weigh up to the endless nagging), the fact your partners talk you down all the time but them being useless whilst talking you down and often walking in your way makes the game dreary to play, then there's the gloom of death which hangs over the levels like an endless fog making it almost impossible to spot enemies at times, not to forget the terrible cutscenes which are incredibly cliche/unimaginative most of the time. I guess I could go on about little things like shooting being a bit dodgy sometimes but the above should be enough to put you off.\n\nDoes this game have any redeeming features you might wonder and surprisingly yes I can actually think of two things, ocassionally shooting can feel nice specifically when you make a vehicle explode killing some enemies around it. The only other positive, and this is really the best thing you can do in the game, was watching a stripper do her thing for a minute just to get the achievement ... oh wait I just needed to watch her for 30 seconds.\n\n4/10 and that's me being generous.","February 27","false","14.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sergeisarmory/recommended/33420/","Sergeisarmory","Sergeimosin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sergeisarmory/","269 products in account","Glitchy, poorly paced, and with attrociously frustrating driving mechanics, this game really is the low point of the Call of Juarez series.\n\nI generally try not to hate on games too hard, but in this case, they completely threw the concept of interesting, identifiable, and compelling characters right out the window. One of the player characters, Guerra, seems like he's got a bit of a story behind him (DEA agent that's a compulsive gambler and selling drugs on the side to try to pay off his debt), but it's never really fleshed out. The female characters name eludes me because she was so one dimensional it wasn't even worth remembering who she was.\n\nThe game starts out with you "meeting" all of these characters in a high speed car chase in which you have no earthly idea what you're doing or why you're shooting at these various cars. Get used to that feeling, because this game rarely stops to explain what the hell is going on. After that you're catapulted into a world of tracking down the leader of a drug cartel after a DEA building is bombed (the connection between the two is nebulous at best), and protecting a girl who is thought to have witnessed the bombing... and also one of the playable characters survived and witnessed the bombing but is somehow expendable enough to simply throw into a massive, violent war against drugs rather than being temporarily relieved of duty and examined by psychiatrists to handle the mental trauma. Also, he's suspected of being the bomber, so... send him out on police work? Sure.\n\nWhat follows is a half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at making an action game that allows you to sling enough lead to supply a Chinese paint factory for a month while also tossing all of the rules of common sense straight out the window in favor of cheap "thrills". Oh, and the driving sequences... God save us all from the driving sequences... The driving mechanic is so poorly designed and implimented that it's far more frustrating than cool, and unfortunately you're almost ALWAYS the driver. And as for the guns, they all feel approximately the same, apart from different skins and rates of fire.\n\nThe storyline is approximately 6.5 hours in length, but manages to feel like it's dragging on for an eternity (see GTA V for the opposite effect, where it lasts 40+ hours and still feels like it's not enough), having overstayed its welcome within the first 45 minutes.\n\nWith all of these terrible features, there were a few redeeming qualities. Personally, I felt like the bullet time mechanic was well done and well integrated, the music was quite well directed to fit the situation, and I do like seeing games branching out and police games starting to trickle onto the market. I also feel like some of the voice acting was done competently, and the graphics were, for the time, moderately good.\n\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, the few things it did right weren't enough to save this honker, and so I give it a thumbs down. Buy it only if it goes on sale for $2 and you need something to waste a few hours with.","April 16, 2015","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very poor plot, gameplay is dull, multyplayer is dead(I think so), even 3 player coop can't save this game from being good one. Maybe its entertaining to play first 2 hours but then it becomes boring with each section of game same thing over and over again.

Cross","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028390148/","81 products in account","In my opinion, this is the single most underrated first person shooter ever made.  Critics and some users have taken this one apart (for some odd reason). I mean, okay, I definitely understand some of the complaints regarding polish.  The graphics, though not ugly by any means, are outdated. A few stiff animations, a bad draw distance (only in the first level) emotionless character facial expressions, not much color to the world, and a few (non game-breaking) glitches here and there. The story also could have used some more refinement, especially the unlikeable overly foul-mouthed characters (seriously, dropping 20 f bombs in 5 minutes of gameplay makes you sound desperate, not edgy). All this aside though, the Cartel is a blast to play. The first mission is a little slow, but once you get into it, the game slowly builds and builds into this high octane corrupt cop action movie that you happen to be in control of.  The gunplay? A little floaty, but solid overall. The action? Fast paced and exciting. You'll be gunning down criminals through city streets, warehouses, alleyways, forests, strip clubs, swamps, country locales, rooftops, etc. Each of these locations is varied enough to hold your visual interest and each of them has plenty of open spaces for you to run aroud dodging bullets, taking cover, and returning fire.  It's nothing short of exciting (though the enemy AI does get a bit dumb on occassion). One particular sequence left me totally breathless: a mad dash through the streets where you have to lean out your car window and open fire on a bunch of criminal cars as they try to gun you down or ram your car off the street. Like most of the game, it was stressful, exhilirating, and adrenaline-pumping.  I have more to say about it, but it's best not to make this review too long. I'll just sum up the positives and negatives to wrap this up.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced, breathless combat\nVaried scenarios\nA few awesome set-pieces\nDecent variety of weapons\nNice ambient music and sound effects\nLow system requierments (I run the game on an outdated, mid-range nvidia gt 640m and it runs near perfectly at max settings)\nA few somewhat visually attractive areas.\n\nCons:\nBoring story driven by the most unlikeable and repugnant characters ever created (if you're turned off by nonstop language and insults, stay far away from this one. Even Jason Brody and his dude-bro friends from Far Cry 3 were more likeable than these characters.)\nSome glitches here and there\nA few bad animations (not the weapons themselves. Those animate quite nicely in my opinion)\nOutdated, occasionally ugly graphics (even at max settings)\nGunplay, despite being pretty satisfying later on, feels a little floaty and awkward at first (it's hard to describe it)\nCould have used a little more mission variety, though what you do get is still satisfying\nFirst mission is a bit boring when compared to later ones\n\nBottom line: Its flaws are noticeable (at times glaring), but The Cartel is still an exciting, fast-paced, and rewarding shooter. For me, graphics, production values, and story aren't what make a game. The gameplay is, and this one a real winner on that front. I'm not kidding when I say this is one just joined my "favorite shooters" list. If you're looking for a deep, meaningful gaming experience with a top-notch story, mind-blowing visuals, and terrific voice-work, stay away. On the other hand, if you're just jonesing for action-movie style firefights between corrupt cops and criminals, with some of the most fast-paced action you'll ever see, car chases, and satisying fist-fights, don't hesisate to lay down the ten dollars for this one.","February 5, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/33420/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Call of Juarez: The Cartel (just "Cartel" from now on) is one of those shooters that was a product of the times, or even slightly behind the times, and tried to meld a Western motif onto "modern day" (early 2000's, after 9/11) US Mexican border. This is a "modern" shooter where instead of hunting for health packs, just hide for a little while to regenerate your health (theres' not even a health meter). However, there is no cover system. It's side-strafing all the way.\n\nThe back story is the DEA office in LA got bombed, and the DOJ arranged for a DEA guy, an FBI girl, and a LAPD veteran to for an interagency task force to find out who did it, then one of the dead agent's daughter had a message from his dead father... So she's a witness... The trio each had their own agenda they try to accomplish without revealing to their two partners. As the investigation takes them from barrios of LA to border to desert to Mexican estates, they get to shoot their way through a TON of bad guys of various types, from simple gangbangers all the way up to mercenaries. And sometimes, they even have to deal with heavy enemy support... like gunships.\n\nTo do that, you get your standard arsenal, from pistols and revolvers to SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, and even light machine guns. However, you can only keep two pistols and one long gun. To make things simple, all pistols use the same ammo, and all rifles use the same ammo, even though in real life they use different calibers. And yes, you can dual-wield the single-hand weapons like pistols and light SMGs. It's fun to do so, as you'll have two triggers (mouse left and mouse tright) for separate guns.\n\nThe "Concentration mode" (i.e. Matrix slo-mo) is back, where basically time slows down so you can kill bad guys by pumping them full of lead before they can react. There are also various "breach" scenarios where your team line up on the door and at the signal, bust in, and in slow-mo, shoot everybody that has a gun. (Yes, there are often civilians, and you get an award if you don't cause collateral damage by end of campaign).\n\nOne of the factors that sets Cartel apart are the driving sequences... where you get to drive the car, dodging traffic, and if you're not driving, you can hang out the window and shoot at bad guys. If necesary, that is. There is a mission where you need to tail another car, not too close, not too far. (And don't run over civilians)  But often, you need to chase enemy vehicle while dodging things left and right, and sometimes, you just need to get away.\n\nAnother thing that sets Cartel apart is the fact that this is a 3 player co-op shooter... In "single player" you play with two AI bots. if you have multiplayer set two buddies join you to shoot your way through bad guys. There's also competitive mode online. It's basically the same game instead of completely separate SP vs. MP map levels.\n\nAs mentioned before, each member of the team has their own personal agenda, and often will get calls or reminders about where their ultimate loyalty lies, and have "secret agenda" on missions, as well as try to sneak some evidence, money, or such "found" on various parts of the mission. And they have to do so without being seen by their partners, making it tense. This is how the character gain "XP" for levels to unlock additional weapons,  in fact. So you have to explore a little.\n\nThe story is actually better than the average shooter. There's no "foozle", just a lot of guys with guns, and each guy has their own motivation to "do the right thing", which may not be THE right thing.\n\nThe hardware requirements are strange. I can play COJ: Gunslinger with no problem, but somehow Cartel felt slower. At least the bots know how to conduct themselves.\n\nAll in all, COJ: The Cartel is a hard break from the "Western" roots of COJ. There are some tie-ins but ultimately it felt really weak. The shooters are not bad, and 15 levels ain't bad for co-op, but it's not exactly a shining sample of how shooters *should* be done. I applaud them of trying to break new ground, but the execution seems to lack that "must keep playing" feeling. It's recommended, but only if it's at bargain bin level prices.","January 1, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cross","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028390148/","81 products in account","In my opinion, this is the single most underrated first person shooter ever made.  Critics and some users have taken this one apart (for some odd reason). I mean, okay, I definitely understand some of the complaints regarding polish.  The graphics, though not ugly by any means, are outdated. A few stiff animations, a bad draw distance (only in the first level) emotionless character facial expressions, not much color to the world, and a few (non game-breaking) glitches here and there. The story also could have used some more refinement, especially the unlikeable overly foul-mouthed characters (seriously, dropping 20 f bombs in 5 minutes of gameplay makes you sound desperate, not edgy). All this aside though, the Cartel is a blast to play. The first mission is a little slow, but once you get into it, the game slowly builds and builds into this high octane corrupt cop action movie that you happen to be in control of.  The gunplay? A little floaty, but solid overall. The action? Fast paced and exciting. You'll be gunning down criminals through city streets, warehouses, alleyways, forests, strip clubs, swamps, country locales, rooftops, etc. Each of these locations is varied enough to hold your visual interest and each of them has plenty of open spaces for you to run aroud dodging bullets, taking cover, and returning fire.  It's nothing short of exciting (though the enemy AI does get a bit dumb on occassion). One particular sequence left me totally breathless: a mad dash through the streets where you have to lean out your car window and open fire on a bunch of criminal cars as they try to gun you down or ram your car off the street. Like most of the game, it was stressful, exhilirating, and adrenaline-pumping.  I have more to say about it, but it's best not to make this review too long. I'll just sum up the positives and negatives to wrap this up.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced, breathless combat\nVaried scenarios\nA few awesome set-pieces\nDecent variety of weapons\nNice ambient music and sound effects\nLow system requierments (I run the game on an outdated, mid-range nvidia gt 640m and it runs near perfectly at max settings)\nA few somewhat visually attractive areas.\n\nCons:\nBoring story driven by the most unlikeable and repugnant characters ever created (if you're turned off by nonstop language and insults, stay far away from this one. Even Jason Brody and his dude-bro friends from Far Cry 3 were more likeable than these characters.)\nSome glitches here and there\nA few bad animations (not the weapons themselves. Those animate quite nicely in my opinion)\nOutdated, occasionally ugly graphics (even at max settings)\nGunplay, despite being pretty satisfying later on, feels a little floaty and awkward at first (it's hard to describe it)\nCould have used a little more mission variety, though what you do get is still satisfying\nFirst mission is a bit boring when compared to later ones\n\nBottom line: Its flaws are noticeable (at times glaring), but The Cartel is still an exciting, fast-paced, and rewarding shooter. For me, graphics, production values, and story aren't what make a game. The gameplay is, and this one a real winner on that front. I'm not kidding when I say this is one just joined my "favorite shooters" list. If you're looking for a deep, meaningful gaming experience with a top-notch story, mind-blowing visuals, and terrific voice-work, stay away. On the other hand, if you're just jonesing for action-movie style firefights between corrupt cops and criminals, with some of the most fast-paced action you'll ever see, car chases, and satisying fist-fights, don't hesisate to lay down the ten dollars for this one.","February 5, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/recommended/33420/","MaxBrando","YagamiBrando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/","62 products in account","Call of Juarez®: The Cartel is the third game in the series. It is considered to be the worst Call of Juarez game, but is it realy that bad?\nI consider myself a fan of CoJ series. And I like western setting in general. So it was sad to hear that the third game of epic western shooters is actually not a western, because the action takes place in 2011 and the setting here is called...ugh, "Neo-Western". Well, whatever. I've read some reviews of this game before playing so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. But let's talk about it, there are good things and bad things, like in any other game.\n\nFirst thing, the story, the setting, the atmosphere and the soundtrack. Well, those are not half bad if you ask me. Well, the story is a mess actually, there are lots of uninteresting dialogs and complicated stuff in the mood "who betrays whom", actually the story here is much worse compared to all other CoJ games (even the Gunslinger). There are 3 playable protagonists, the police officer Ben McCall (a walking tribute to Ray McCall, not as Badass as the latter, but not half bad though), the DEA agent Eddie Guerra (for some reason he remonds me of Pierce from Saints Row series, probably because of those black and purple tones in clothes) and FBI agent Kim Evans (the girl with an attitude). Each of them has their own problems and "inner demons", but in the end I can tell that only Ben McCall is interesting enough as a character. Anyway, the characters don't trust each other, there is no bond between them so you won't like them too much anyway. The heroes must find and terminate the Mendoza Drug Cartel, who is presumably responsible for some kind of bombing in which several people died. They investigate deeper into the case and it turns out to be that the culprits are also their higher ups in FBI/DEA or whatever. Anyway there are many things in story that I didn't get fully and that's quite sad, when the plot is overweight in lots of uninteresting twists. I'd say the story is really poor, well, at least there are several endings.\nThe graphics in the game are so-so. Not bad but not good either. They say the developers were testing the new engine, meh. The soundtrack is actually pretty good. There are many decent western-themed tracks that actually create a western-feel in the game. There will be some missions in western setting and you will even visit Juarez, so those levels come along nicely with the soundtrack.\nIn terms of gameplay the game is so-so. You can play as one of three characters and the other two will accompany you as AI bots (or you can play online with other people, but I couldn't find any partner via internet, looks like nobody plays this game anymore, lel), each one is good with a different type of weapons: mister McCall is good with pistols and heavy machineguns, the lady is good with sniper rifles and Eddie Guerra is decent with SMGs at medium range. There is almost no recoil from guns and it was kinda hard for me to shoot enemies at times for some reason. I just don't feel the gun and the crosshair in this game (and I didn't have this problem with other CoJ games by the way). Oh and you won't ride horses in Cartel, but there will be some car chasing missions and they are actually pretty fun.\nThere are some bugs in the game, like clipping issues and stucking in the walls, but nothing serious so far.\nVERDICT: CoJ The Cartel is indeed the worst game in CoJ series, but it still has good things in it. And most importantly it feels like CoJ game and has a western feeling. The chars are pretty boring though (and some of them are just replicas from other games, like ben mccall and Juan mendosa), the story is not captivating and the gameplay is iffy at times. But I would still recommend this game to those who like Call of Juarez series. I think it is worth a try, at least, besides it is not very long and you can complete it within 7-8 hours. My personal rating for this game will be 6/10.","January 10, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea behind the story is great, with all 3 playable characters operating with their own motives and secret objectives, but the story just doesn't hold up and gets stupid and unbelieveable fast. Kind of like one of those sitcoms where for no reason characters withold important information from each other just to create "drama". In this case, it just makes everything incomprehensible. The dialogue is also just terrible. B-movie from the 90s kind of "Gangsta" swearing bad.\n\nGunplay is okay, but level design is horrible. The game uses a waypoint system with giant, ugly, low-res dots on the screen every 20 meters. Sometimes it breaks and stops working and when that happens, you will get lost because the levels are so poorly constructed and repetitive.\n\nMost of the game is pretty easy, except for a couple spots where they send 30 enemies at you simultaneously and you just have to get lucky that their firing patterns give you more than 1 second at a time to pop out of cover and shoot them. Be prepared for a couple spots requiring 20 restores, while you probably won't die anywhere else in the game.\n\nThis is the kind of game you only really want to play if you haven't played or can't afford all of the 150 or so better FPS games out there. It's NOT a wild west setting like the rest of the series, so it doesn't even have that going for it.","January 28, 2015","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With all the drug violence on the South Western US border, this game takes the player into the seedy and dangerous world of the drug dealers and the cops who try to stop them.  The game starts in a marijuana field in Sequoia park, and ends in a huge hacienda of a gun runner in Mexico near Juarez.  In between there are plenty of gun battles, and also an interesting plot line, as you try to follow informants and leads to  bust the bad guys.  The graphics are pretty good,  and there are a pretty good variety of guns to try.  Picking up enemy guns is a great way to try one out before it becomes available in your inventory.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of issues with the game play.  For one thing the AI of  your partners is pretty bad.   They are dumb as a post, continually stepping in the line of fire.   Fortunately, friendly fire is disabled, or they would commit suicide multiple times in every battle.\n\nTo make the weak AI situation even worse, as a side plot you are supposed to acquire items without the puppy-partners seeing.  But since they are  always stupidly right on your heels like of couple of love-starved puppies, this side agenda quickly becomes irritating rather than fun.\n\nAnother weakness of the game is the driving sequences.  These maybe wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so numerous.  Unfortunately they are in almost every level.  No matter which kind of vehicle you are in, your top speed is quite a bits slower than all the enemy vehicles.   Consequently, enemies are always swarming around shooting.  If you vary from  the predefined path even a little like a normal  human would to avoid the fusillade of gunfire,  the game warns that you are "leaving the mission" and the level ends.  I found myself yanked out of the immersion of the experience when driving, and just hoping Ii could get through it without having to repeat it.  The lack of player options made it more of a chore to  be endured, rather than fun.\n\nIn summary the game is a great idea that isn't fully realized.  If you can get it on sale, it is worth a play through.  I wouldn't recommend it a full price though.","February 10, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some driving missions but they are boring and no fun.\nEven the smallest details in this game are poorly made, the game takes place in Los Angeles but all the police cars are marked Texas state Trooper!\nI paid only $2.99 for this game and it’s not even worth playing if it was for free.\n","June 23, 2015","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To a certain extent, they're right. The Cartel doesn't add many new ingredients to the mix and the graphics engine is certainly not as advanced as Techland claimed it to be. Also, I feel that the game could have been a sandbox.

In this respect, The Cartel is unfinished.\n\nHowever, the level designs are very good. Both the main characters and the antagonists are foul mouthed and not the most likable people you're ever going to meet, but they make entertaining adversaries and the camaraderie between Ben and his collegues is admirable. The gun physics are a little off and the AI isn't very challenging, but the Cartel does manage to create an atmospheric adventure, with believeable environments and gaudy villains.\n\nIf only Techland had invested a little more money or taken a little more time to polish the Cartel, it would have been as notable as its predecessors.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/judassem/recommended/33420/","judassem","Judassem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/judassem/","1125 products in account","Definitely not as bad as the majority of other reviewers make it out to be. This is just like Resident Evil 5; when you take it out of the series, you have a decent game. When you compare it to the other games in the series, yeah, it's a bad game. On its own, not so.\n\nHowever, is this game good? Is this game going to make you tremble with ecstacy? Is this game will the "the one"? Hell no.\n\nThe only thing keeping this game together is its incredible story. You can take this game's plot and shoot a blockbuster Hollywood movie with it. It's extremely realistic, dark, and a very good reflection of the hellhole we call politics. It becomes so complex sometimes that you need to pause the game and get all the pieces together in your mind's eye.\n\nSoundtrack is well done. It suits the theme of the game and the environments you play in very well. It's not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, but it's definitely enhancing.\n\nVoice-over is brilliant. You can feel they paid attention to quality in that department.\n\nAI? Well, it's complicated. Sometimes they just get stuck and stare at you like some idiots. Some other time, you see them flanking you, moving from cover to cover and getting you at your most vulnerable moment. Your partners though, they are completely useless. Don't expeck anything big and you won't have a problem with them.\n\nGameplay mechanics? Bad. It's just plain bad. Covers don't always work, the game glitches and bugs in some missions, forcing  you to load a checkpoint, grenades are useless, weapons don't differ from each other much, playing offline really detracts from the whole gaming experience, etc. One good thing is the "Secret Agenda" system. During most missions, someone important calls you a gives you a secret mission that you must complete without being seen by your partners. It's a breeze when playing offline, but I reckon it adds a lot of excitement on online playing sessions. A very refreshing idea. More games should try something like this.\n\nWorst thing? Sound effects. You fire a shotgun and it sounds like a tiny balloon just popped. You fire a friggin M60 and it sounds like an old man's fart. You shoot you Desert Eagle and it sounds like a kid is clapping his little hands together. It's downright terrible.\n\nOverall, would I recommend this game? If it's below 5 bucks, yeah. It just isn't worth 10 dollars.","May 9, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as being a call of juarez game it doesn't really fit and it comes off as a bit cheesier then the other games.  If you're looking for another game in this particular series you might be disappointed.  As a standalone game it's pretty entertaining.  The graphics are rather impressive as well as the environments.  One thing that does get annoying is your partners constant badgering.  Every 10 seconds they yell " if we weren't watching your back you'd be mother♥♥♥♥ing dead" or " do you ever practice with that thing." And if they arnt insulting you then there are attacking you for hogging all the action like a couple of bipolar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Despite that, it has a good variety of different locations to keep it interesting throughout.  You even get to go back to a location from the first game which is kind of cool.

This entry in the franchise took the franchise to a more modern time, centering on gangs and drugs. This upset many fans who immediately gave it a 0/100. While I personally believe the preceding and following games (Bound in Blood and Gunslinger) are far superior products, for the most part this game is  mediocre and not terrible.\n\nGameplay 7/10\nAt the heart of the game is fairly solid gameplay that plays like all the other entries in the Call of Juarez series. Weapons are powerful, but manageable, and the game ticks off all the positive points of a first person shooter. What brings the game down is driving sections or really anything that relies on your allies.\n\nCharacters/Story 2/10\nWithout a doubt the weakest part of this game is the characters you will be interacting with and the story you'll be interacting in. Your AI team will complain if you miss, complain if you play well, and factor into the non-sense story with secret agendas (Everyone is bad etc.). My least favorite parts of this game are the parts where you have to rely on your team mates for anything, as they are just terrible. Not only are they absolutely incompetent, but their one dimensional personalities are absolutely grating and their tacky voice acting is just awful.\n\nSound 8/10\nEasily the strongest part of this game is the excellent sound design. Music is well written and fits the period well, with modern western metal mixing with a score. Firearms have a powerful sounding boom, and even the starter AK and pistol sounding like a cannon when it goes off.\n\nVisuals 7/10\nWhile I experienced no major pop-ups/glitches, the game is average for the course. Serviceable with occasional rendering delays.\n\nOverall 24/40 or 60%. I personally would recommend skipping this game, for even with the solid sound engineering and gunplay, it's sequel (and prequel) do that without the irritating characters. If it goes on sale and you're a completion-ist, by all means go for it.","April 21","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
