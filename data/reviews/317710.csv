"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/317710/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","Whenever a highly challenging arcade game with quick runs based upon dodging obstacles comes along, every journalist and pundit in the industry declares it a new incarnation of Super Hexagon—though sadly not, as far as I have seen, accompanied by the gruesome headline that we masochists so richly deserve: "Super Hexagain."\n\nThe reason why so many leap to this comparison is obvious: Terry Cavanagh's game represents the pinnacle of the genre.  But while I enjoy seeing that fact so widely recognized, it's also led to a string of frustrating disappointments because few who remember it seem to actually understand why it is so good.  I've put more than 150 hours into Super Hexagon and at one point was the 27th best player in the world.  I consider it a perfect work of game design, and every time its name is invoked for the purpose of describing some newly announced this or that I can see within moments that the supposed successor is a mere pretender.\n\nVelocibox fares far better than most.  Like Super Hexagon, it is an addictive game of fast, involuntary pace and geometry avoidance with short runs and instantaneous retries.  It is even thematically similar, concerning itself with cubes much like Super Hexagon celebrates its flatter six-sided shape.  Is Velocibox as good as Super Hexagon?  Well, no, it's not.  Its design is a bit more convoluted due to the scoring system and, more importantly, the ramifications of its third dimension.\n\nFirstly, instead of merely avoiding patterned sets of obstacles, the player must also guide the avatar to run across cube pickups both as a means to progress to the next level (which pops in after every six pickups) and in order to increase the score and its multiplier.  Taking too long between cubes causes the score multiplier to be lost, and so it is vital when attacking the leaderboard to aggressively pursue them.  Your interest is thus divided between maneuvering to survive and taking risks in order to pick up cubes more frequently for a better score, whereas in Super Hexagon survival time simply is the score.  Objectively, the design is less pure; however, some players may prefer Velocibox's approach for generating tension and fostering a more active form of competitive play.\n\nThe more essential difference is that, because the three-dimensional field extends forward into the distance, the hazards are not uniformly visible like those of Super Hexagon.  By itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing; the nature of the challenge is simply different.  However, it is important to consider that perhaps the most clever thing about Super Hexagon is the fixed relationship between the disorienting field rotation, the player's rate of movement, and the visibility of forthcoming labyrinth at the edges of the screen.  Brilliantly, each stage throughout the game ramps up these intertwined factors until the field rotation abruptly stops in the post-game stage, limiting visibility unevenly and suddenly making aspect ratio a key factor for gameplay.  In that transformative moment, Super Hexagon reveals itself to be an entirely different game than previously assumed and requires a new layer of awareness and decision making from the player.  In contrast, Velocibox offers a free range of evasive movement that is disconnected from the rate of forward motion and maze discovery, and both remain static from one level to the next.  It makes no attempt to explore changes to field visibility—indeed, it probably cannot because it does not share the abstraction of Super Hexagon's 2D plane.  It is, ironically, limited in scope by the lack of restrictions posed by its 3D environment.\n\nUltimately, though, despite not being as interesting or as beautiful a work of game design as Super Hexagon, what Velocibox does accomplish is to be quite a good game, and that is certainly enough.  Not everything has to be a work of absolute genius, and it may well be impossible for anything to truly match Super Hexagon because it is so thorough in exploring the possibilities of the carefully limited space that it defines for itself.  Despite the clear parallels between the two, Velocibox occupies a different space, and it is to our benefit that they can coexist.","September 9, 2014","true","7.1"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","66","77","0","4"

As frustrating as it is, why do I keep coming back for more? Despite my initial hundreds of deaths on the first level, despite hearing "Level 1, begin!" ring through my ears and haunting me in my sleep, I still keep loading up this punishing game every chance I get to push onwards. It's probably because every time I play I learn something new and get a little further with the end of my current best stage always just out reach. Patience is clearly a virtue as you take baby steps learning to surf along the four deadly sides of this flashy and minimal Velocibox.\n\nVelocibox originated as a Ludum Dare game jam, and after high demand comes to Steam as the newest and hardest offering in the endless runner genre. This is the definition of "one more try!" gameplay, like some kind of super addictive fusion of Super Hexagon and the usual avoid-em-up action of an endless runner, the gameplay is super easy to get into but quickly ramps up into pure chaos making mastering the game a serious challenge.\n\nLevels are generally short but that depends mostly on how fast you're picking up each of the floating cubes along the way, as you can drift along endlessly until the correct amount are obtained. Each of the sections all have a random factor to their composition and placement on any fresh start but always feature the same general patterns, requiring a bit of muscle memory to fully master each one. You'll die an innumerable amount of times learning these layouts and the lack of checkpoints will punish your every mistake dooming you to start anew with each failure.\n\nGetting into the groove is a slow affair for newcomers as the player takes their time figuring out how to navigate the fast-paced walls and its obstacles. Once you've got a handle on how to flip the stage and grind along the sides with ease the game opens up a lot more, going from frustrating to outright addictive.\n\nThe player will apply these newly developed skills flipping and coasting across walls with finesse and elegance picking up the important orange cubes with diligence. As skills improve and orange cubes are picked up faster, your multiplier ascends at an alarming rate and you'll be burning right through each of the stages in a minimalistic Super Hexagon-esque blissout.\n\nVelocibox requires persistence and a bit of patience, that's for damn sure, but if you're willing to dedicate a high level of focus you'll be rewarded with one of the most intense and refreshing pick-up-and-play experiences. This is a must for fans of quick and colorful arcade action who aren't discouraged by a fierce challenge.","September 20, 2014","true","19.2"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","2"

This illusion was completely shattered and humiliated after just one minute in the fast-paced and unforgiving world of Velocibox. The amount of deaths was nearly proportional with the amount of seconds played, and after just ten minutes I seriously questioned my abilities to even reach level two, let alone complete the game in level eight.\n\nThough, while Velocibox share the same rouge-like elements (no pausing or resetting) as other endless-runners, then Velocibox is very unique due to the controls and graphics. You are allowed to utilize the ceiling and walls (in fact, you are more or less required to do so). This means that all obstacles may be completed in different ways – all depending on the next obstacle, certain approaches may be preferred. And with 70 different patterns there are a lot of options – and a lot of frustration when your plan fails miserably.\n\nAdditionally, the cubes needed to advance to the next level are rarely placed in line; thus forcing the player to hunt these while spinning and dodging obstacles. The player is required to collect six cubes to advance to the next level, though these may be collected when the player see fit – the level will continue to run until the player catches six cubes or dies. Your score, however, is depending on how fast and how many boxes are collected – the more cubes as fast as possible, the more points. The player is thus encouraged to take chances for a higher score.\n\nMastering the controls while comprehending the camera movement and constant speed is a strong indicator that Velocibox indeed is a skill-based game – somewhat similar to games like Super Hexagon. It requires fast reflexes and a seemingly impossible overview – though, with enough tries the player learns how to approach the individual obstacles and master the controls properly. However, once the player finally advances to the next level, the aforementioned colours turn out to be a real enemy; because while the controls are essentially the same, the drastic change in colours means a loss of the vague overview. Similar, each new level introduces new obstacles – something which ultimately means the player is forced to slowly progress as they master each level better and better. The better they master the first level, the easier they may approach the second, and so forth.\n\nVelocibox is an extremely challenging and fast-paced game with minimalistic graphics and a very intriguing gameplay. Advancing through the levels requires patience and a great amount of concentration – and despite the thousands of tries, the game still remains fun, entertaining and extremely challenging. The key is undeniably to master your reflexes and understanding the art of re-orientation, and doing so successfully is highly rewarding. Don’t be put off by the first many failed attempts, but rather try and experience the satisfaction by reaching level two (and three, and four, and…).\n\nGood luck!\n\nRead my full review here: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=283\n","September 8, 2014","true","9.5"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/317710/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Velocibox is advertised as a game for the hardcore players out there and I can confirm that this is one of the most intense and hard games ever released. And although I think it’s a little too hardcore, there’s still a lot of fun to be had by regular and casual players. Just give it some time.\n\nYour objective is simple: collect as many cubes as you can while navigating through different environments with randomly generated objects. That doesn’t sound so difficult, I admit, but the game immediately starts at a high speed, so the first time you’re going to play this you’ll probably die within mere seconds. Fortunately for us restarting the game takes about a second or so, so frustration is kept to a minimum.\nThe fact that the game loads so fast is also one of the factors why it’s so damn addictive. I kept thinking ‘just one more game’ after I died at some point and when I looked at the clock I already played over 10 minutes extra (which is a lot for this game, since one attempt usually doesn’t last longer than 30-60 seconds).\nThere’s one action button, really. And that button is to jump to the opposite side; so if you’re down you’ll go up and if you’re left you’ll go right. And vice versa, of course. This action button can be a fire button or you can move the control stick up or down. The control stick can also be used to move your character left and right and by combining these two controls you have to carefully manoeuvre your cube between all kinds of crazy objects.\nSo, you’ll first start off with some simple objects. That’s just an illusion, however, because your cube moves at such a high speed that you probably don’t know what’s happening to begin with. And then you die. And restart again. After a little while you’ll learn to move between objects relatively easily and after collecting enough cubes (which fills up a little meter) you’ll move on to the next level. The current level will morph into the next one so there’s no pause; a different setting is instantly created and generates entirely new objects on-the-fly. The second level has more and bigger objects in it and you also have to pay attention that you’re not hitting the colored floors.\nMost of us will only reach the third level after an hour or so (and countless attempts), and the third level will have moving scenery in it. I haven’t been able to get past 3 yet, so it’ll probably take me at least a couple of hours more before I even get there, but I can only imagine what those levels will introduce. It must be horrifying.\nWhat I enjoyed and admired about this game is that, somehow, you only get better given enough time. That’s usually the case, I know, but you make visual progress after just half an hour; it gets (or seems to get) much easier to get to the second level. It’s now less difficult for me to get to the second level. Sure, I still die a lot, even in the first level, but I can now get to the second level with less trouble. It’s very rewarding to see and witness this yourself.\n\nThe game looks very stylish with sharp, colorful, graphics. It has a bit of a minimalist feel, which I usually appreciate. The game runs at 60fps without ever dropping a frame and it warps and moves at very high speeds.  It looks gorgeous in action but you won’t notice because you’re too focused on getting as far as you can.\nThe music is very up tempo and has a great beat and it’s the kind of music that motivates you to keep going. It truly completes the game. There’s not much else to hear besides the music, though.\n\nVelocibox is a great and rewarding game. If you get hooked on games quickly then you simply must play this. It’s like digital crack and trust me when I say that that’s a huge compliment. It’s a game for anyone and it’s one that can be played for a couple of minutes or a couple of hours. Simply put: it’s awesome. So do not forget to buy this little gem because it is absolutely worth the price.\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","September 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/317710/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","When you break down twitch games to their base elements, they tend to revolve around the same basic concepts: fast gameplay, and dodging things at high speeds. Some excel in their simplicity, like the classic flash game Vector Runner or the more recent Super Hexagon, while others add more complexity, such as Pivvot, Wave Wave, and Duet. Point is, that since the core elements are generally similar, it takes something more, something exceptional for games in the genre to stand out. Velocibox is one of those games, and it's perhaps the most addictive twitch game I've played since Super Hexagon.\n\nExpanded and improved from an entry for the current "Connected Worlds" Ludum Dare, Velocibox is unforgiving. In fact there aren't any checkpoints, when you fail (and you will), you start over from the first stage. Initially, I disliked this lack of checkpoints, but once I played more, I came to appreciate how the game was set up. Success relies on practice, learning the quirks and obstacles of each stage and surmounting them. It's more than twitch reflex but also adaption and gradual improvement, not just "one more go" but "I know these obstacles. I can do better". It's incredibly satisfying to race through stages that had defeated you countless times before.\n\nBut what makes Velocibox exceptional, because that's a pretty strong word? Well, it's more that all the game's aspects merge into a excellent whole rather than any individual element. It's the sense of speed, the feeling of racing forward at some extreme velocity, blasting off from stage one without a moment to catch your breath. It's the gravity-defying gameplay, as you flip between floor and ceiling and ride the walls. It's how the gravity flip mechanic opens the door for a wide variety of obstacles that wouldn't be possible in other twitch games, forcing you to deftly maneuver around and across all sides of these corridors. It's the vibrant visuals and effects, the great music, the no-frills presentation that lets you jump into the action in seconds.\n\nI've only reached stage four out of nine, and beating the initial nine stages unlocks an even more insane Super Velocibox mode, so there's a hefty amount of content here. Velocibox is an easy recommendation for fans of the genre.","September 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The premise of the game is really simple, collect 6 cubes per level to advance to the next level. There are 9 levels for normal mode, each with their own different challenges and obstacles. Losing in any levels causes you to restart the game from level 1 as the game does not have any checkpoints or saves.\n\nWhile that may sound rather unfair, each level is finely tuned and well balanced. There are multiple ways to overcome obstacles in your path, and each challenge often teach players new ways to overcome previous obstacles. Velocibox gives you a very strong sense of achivement and progression when you're finally able to deal with the levels you've previously cursed and raged at.\n\nIt is by no means an easy game, but it's definitely a rewarding game that you'll come to enjoy playing after hundreds of attempts. Velocibox is the game that'll get you saying "Just one more try! I can do this!" over and over. Good luck with this game, you're gonna need it in Super Velocibox mode. Get ready to meet your new best friend: Level 1.","September 8, 2014","true","16.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Великолепные эффекты искажения пространства при боковых смещениях в совокупности со "скользким" управлением заставят вас почувствовать себя субатомной частицей, разгоняемой до безумных скоростей в этой прямоуголной магнитной трубе, очень убедительное чувство (несмотря на то, что ваш электрон представлен оранжевым вокселем)!

Not just in gameplay, but in score. As you play as a cube that avoids the plethora of obstacles that the different stages throw at you, you earn a score. You earn MORE score and progress through different levels as you pick up miniature cubes that float about the stage. The faster you pick up the cubes, the higher you score. See where this is going? As you constantly put yourself in danger for the sake of these cubes, you die. Repeatedly. Just when you think you're about to enter another stage, you die. This adds a very effective method of addiction. Just for that, this game has done its job well 10/10.\n\nBut that's not all. The game also adds a couple rewarding steam achievements as you continue to progress through the levels, which is a nice touch. Most indie games like this don't have any achievements, so that aspect really adds to the game. On top of that, you get steam trading cards which add another awesome touch. You can collect them all and craft badges, or sell them at quite a high price ($0.40 a piece? 11/10 overachiever).\n\nThe only downside is the controller support. The controller could have been configured better, such as moving slow which you push a tiny bit on the joystick, and fast when you jerk it. As of right now, it moves at a set speed no matter where the joystick is.\n\nOther than that, the game is great. Pick it up, and be one of the first to enjoy it. Just make sure to put it on super settings, because it ran the smoothest and had the best sensitivity, and have no homework to do, because once you're in the game, all you'll think is...\n\nVELOCIBOX","September 14, 2014","true","30.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This reduces Velocibox to a memory game.\n\nSuper Hexagon generally allowed you to save yourself early-to-mid on patterns if you twitched fast enough... it was only late pattern that your pattern reaction had to be perfect, and even then a superb twitch reaction *might* still bail you out on a bad early decision or a misread. This provided both an incredibly rewarding feeling as you then fought to resume flow, and allowed you to learn levels as you progressed without destroying you immediately.\n\nVelocibox, in comparison, is completely pattern dependent, and you'll often find yourself crashing on what seems like a flip you had ample time to make (I found the sluggishness of the control speed excessively irritating). In that respect, it becomes both frustrating for the average gamer and makes learning the levels far harder and less rewarding. The game ends up being, in a sense, only half the game that Super Hexagon was--appealing only to those who enjoy the pattern memorization aspect.\n\nThat's fine... and if that's your kind of game, more power to you... but it isn't nearly as enticing or satisfying as Super Hexagon (and yes, Velocibox's gameplay goes back to far earlier referents on the PC (even the old Star Wars vector arcade game), but I can't remember the 2 or 3 'tunnel' games it references).\n\n","November 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

The number of times you will end up\ndying on level one alone should be enough to persuade\nyou that this game is not for the casual gamer.\nThe moment you go into the game, it instantly starts with\na tutorial which shows you what to do.

It is\neffective with how they are utilised. The game mechanics\nare also deceptively simple: you avoid black lines and collect cubes until you finish\nthe level. However, there is maybe 10% of people who\nwill be able to complete level one quickly. It will test\nyour ability to perservere and your self control.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music is very addictive, and again the sound will\ntest your self control, since you are, lets not lie,\nyou ARE going to hear the words "Level One," in a cool\nfemale voice, followed by "Game over," over and over again.\nAnd then with the other levels. Over and over again.\n\nGood luck.\n\nDo note, that if you're a person who has trouble with\nmotion sickness in games, I wouldn't play this straight\naway, or for extended periods of time.\n\nOverall verdict :\nPlease be warned.

Really painful too.\n\nIn Super Hexagon, you have 3 levels of difficulty at first, and you can work on each individually. In Velocibox, you have 9 levels. Beware : IT DOESN'T INCREASE NICELY. This game isn't gentle. If you want all the achievements, you'll suffer. You'll have to finish each level 10 times. 1 is easy, it rarely beats me. 2 is not. 3 is hell. (I think in a few hours I'll say 3 is easy, like in every skill-based games)\n\nIf you like hardcore and fast-paced die-and-retry games, it'll fit.\n\nNEGATIVE :\n\nIt's another of these no-depth games. It's clean, yes. But it's too much, I think. I play and I don't feel any universe, I don't feel anything that make this a unique game. It is well-made, yes. It is difficult, yes. But... I don't know, I find it lacks charisma.\n\nI wanted to play it very badly and I din't want to wait a Steam sale, and I knew it could lack charisma and depth. So I don't complain, it's my choice, but I feel it's a 5-bucks game, not 8. Or a early-access game. The "Velocibox" voice is generic, the textures are not engaging, the cube you control is a generic cube, the music is not really original, and it gets really annoying long before you play level 1 for the 3400509034th time.\n\nSo. I was more or less aware of it before buying, but I'd advice that you wait it's on sale, and while you're waiting, you could take F-Zero GX outside his box, and plug again your old Gamecube.\n\nBut if you don't want to wait, don't wait, and you'll still enjoy one of the best arcade challenges of 2014. Gosh, for 2015 or 2016, I would really like a skill-based game with both the mind-r*ping style of Super Hexagon, the subjective view, some stupidness in it and an agony-style difficulty.","July 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not very good at it either. i only reach level 7 at best (out of 9 i guess). But still i want to play it and get to the end. I know there is nothing there at the end of this game. But it is something special about it. I recall my first attempts to play this game. It was horrible. It was after several hours of unsuccessful attempts and "wtf am i doing wrong? are you telling me i cant do this?" moments that I reached level 2 and 3. And it was amazing experience. I am so glad that i kept playing it at first. The feeling I've got when I reached those new levels I thought was impossible before was absolutely worth it. I don't regret it at all. And trust me. This game will beat you to death.\nI like how this game messes with you and your mind. I like how the game keeps throwing stuff at you as you progress. Every new level offers nothing more but death to you. I like how there is no time to think and no room for mistakes. You have to be perfect, go ahead, plan your moves and sh#t. It is not an easy type game there's no practice mode, no easier path or smth, the game offers no helping hand for you (except that init mode which is useless). Every time you fail you'll go from the beginning even though it was only a hair from that damn obstacle or a wrong button you pressed or a millisecond delay of your thought.\nThe game is responsive and fair. It's your fault that you can't play it. It gets very frustrating at times I admit it. But every time you fail there's nothing more to judge but you. It is about challenging yourself, progressing at it and the feeling you get then you're finally good at it.","May 20, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First I was playing Super Hexagon and thinking, "What is this stupid game that only lasts like 5-10 seconds?!". I started enjoying it  sucked the life out of me until I started getting a little better. Then I got Wave Wave and Wave Wave 2.0 from the Humble Bundle and again began to be frustrated with such a simple little game that just kept telling me I'm getting old as a gamer and my reflexes just aren't what they used to be. But finally, Bundle Stars had this game bundled with a few other "Abstracts", and this "twitch-gaming" is just not for me. Oh no, I WILL NOT GIVE UP, but I only finally made it to level 2 to tell you one thing: it changes the color scheme. That is how long I lasted on level 2, and I can't seem to make it back there.\nWhy would you want to play this game them? It tests your reflexes, it's good quick thinking for the brain, and it's a great laugh when you invite friends over so they can get hooked on "dying" over and over again. Great quickplay game that can take a few seconds and probably warm you up for the next game you plan on loading up in your steam library.","January 18, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have to die many times to understand how new level obstacles work. Normally I'm up for a challenge but not when the progress is slow and frustrating. Here is an example (at around 30 seconds):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Lt5foSU-NQc?t=28\n\nIn this example as you reach level 2 you quickly get a new obstacle where you have to immediately move to wall and time your flip well enough to not hit the red zone. You then have to move either left, right or flip again to get through that obstacle.. and with the time window the game gives you to do so (paired with flip animation), it will take a while to get it right... and this is just the second level.\n\nI really think the flip animation should be smoother and immediate instead of taking time - just a few 10 milliseconds too long and you can find yourself in a situation where your horizontal movement speed and reflex are too slow to move you away from the next obstacle.","June 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You thought Super Meat Boy and Eryi's Action were artificial difficulty? Play this. Sure, there's a lot of content for your money, but there's no point in having 70 levels if they're all marred by the inability to progress due to a number of bugs on top of the artificial difficulty.\n\nThe launcher itself isn't great. I wouldn't expect much from the Unity launcher, but I couldn't even rebind my keyboard controls and the game's hardware detection decided that my 780Ti couldn't run the game on higher than "BASIC". Not a great start, agreed?\n\nUnfortunately it only got worse from thereon in. There are no in-game options, which means alt-tabbing out to the Windows sound mixer if you want to change it.\n\nIn-game, the controls feel unresponsive due to the ridiculous FOV, causing you to crash into obstacles when it doesn't look like you should. This leads me onto the broken hitboxes. There are times I've been in the clear and been given the game over screen, there are other times where I've gone straight through an obstacle.\n\nThe game over screen itself is another issue. The multipliers for your score are always zero regardless of how high you got it when you were actually in the game. On top of this, a fast paced game where most rounds are less than 10 seconds long, you shouldn't be waiting this long to get to the next level. Each transition is painfully slow and I'm pretty sure I spent more time watching the game over screens flash up than I did actually playing the game.\n\nOverall, my experience with this game wasn't at all enjoyable. It feels like it should be in Early Access, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone, even if you're a fan of masochistic games. It's more like a chore than it is a game. Games are meant to be fun, this is not. The only positive thing I have to say about it is that it's not as nausea inducing as Super Hexagon, though when I realized that I paid real money for this I threw up in my mouth a little.","September 10, 2014","false","0.2"," 20 of 54 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","20","54","0","8"

Even though I haven't played it too much, I'm really enjoying it. The disorientation of flipping is a little jarring and tricky to get a hang of (things on your left are suddenly to the right so you hit it and die) but I can feel myself getting used to it. It isn't a frustrating game at all, you just have to adjust to the learning curve.\n\nOne suggestion, make an option to shut that voice off. It's really gratifying to hear her tell you you got to a level you haven't been to yet, but hearing her constantly saying 'Game Over' and 'Level One', usually overlapping each other gets very tiresome. Maybe make her say the level until you reach the level 10 times, and then just the first time you open the game. I don't want to mute the sound but it makes it feel like the only real choice.","April 16, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though I haven't played it too much, I'm really enjoying it. The disorientation of flipping is a little jarring and tricky to get a hang of (things on your left are suddenly to the right so you hit it and die) but I can feel myself getting used to it. It isn't a frustrating game at all, you just have to adjust to the learning curve.\n\nOne suggestion, make an option to shut that voice off. It's really gratifying to hear her tell you you got to a level you haven't been to yet, but hearing her constantly saying 'Game Over' and 'Level One', usually overlapping each other gets very tiresome. Maybe make her say the level until you reach the level 10 times, and then just the first time you open the game. I don't want to mute the sound but it makes it feel like the only real choice.","April 16, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no saves, no checkpoints, no slowing down, you just need skill, memory and reflexes. You always restart on level 1.  Very fast paced game, and very very fun.  Once you finally beat the full game and feel good about yourself you find out there's another half to the game that's faster and tougher.\n\nHighly recommend this game.
