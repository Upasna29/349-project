In BADLAND you take control of a small creature residing in a forest filled with deadly traps and obstacles, but where did these traps and obstacles come from? That is what you must find out. Along the way you'll come across many different pick-ups which will help you on your journey, some pick-ups will even clone your humble forest dweller! Creating an army of forest dwellers (clones) to take on whatever the forest throws at you.\n\n+Absolutely gorgeous art style\n+Incredibly good world design\n+Simple gameplay, you keep your clone airborne while avoiding obstacles and traps using one key/gamepad button\n+One hundred singleplayer levels, 100 multiplayer levels and 27 battle levels\n+Excellent level design\n+Great soundtrack and sound effects\n+Most levels have very frequent checkpoints which is great if you're like me and die a lot\n+A wide variety of pick-ups, many of which change the appearance of your clones\n+Lots of interaction with the environment to avoid traps and complete puzzles\n+The difficulty increases at a reasonable rate\n\n-Apart from in the trailer there isn't really a story which is somewhat disappointing\n-A few levels don't have checkpoints which is rather frustrating\n-The speed at which the screen scrolls is dependent on what pick-ups you have and what speed your clone is going at which means if you're going really fast and suddenly stop you're screwed\n\nWorth Noting:\nBADLAND was originally a mobile game and has been ported to Steam, I wouldn't have known it was a mobile game had it not said on the store page but I know some people really hate seeing mobile games on Steam\nDespite being called Game of the Year Edition, BADLAND has not been awarded this title on PC though it did win an iPad GOTY award from Apple on the app-store\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing (8/10)\n\nBADLAND: GOTY is a great side-scrolling action adventure game with a gorgeous art style, great world design and simple gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptor1138/recommended/269670/","raptor1138","Raptor1138 - KI BABY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptor1138/","77 products in account","Badland is gameplay-wise a wholesome, simplistic, and very fun sidescroller, which will occupy you for a long time with its uniquely challenging puzzles. But on the side of art design and atmosphere it is on a whole new level, rivaling some of the best indie games out there. It has a level of professionalism rarely seen in iOS to PC ports, and a level of immersion and beauty rarely seen in games as a whole.\n\nGameplay:\nBadland is not mechanically deep, nor does it need to be. The gameplay is simple: get your small flying creature to the end of the level. There are puzzles, level geometry, and machines which stand in your way, and powerups which can serve as either a benefit or a hassle, and the levels dramatically increase in difficulty. Originally released on iOS devices, Badland was controllable with one button (or more accurately, one touch), but for this Game of the Year release, it has been rebalanced for a new control scheme allowing the player to move in any direction, with levels modified to accommodate, which adds an extra layer of depth and challenge. The controls feel incredibly fluid and smooth, and the game makes use of a realistically applied physics engine to increase the vivid, immersive feel of the movement and the game itself. There are even multiplayer and coop modes, local and playable with up to four players on one keyboard.This game gets much harder than you’d think!\n\nArt:\nBadland is artistically beautiful, with gorgeous background art, highly detailed level design, and incredible sound design, the latter of which is some of the best I've heard in any game. It immerses you in an atmospheric world of nature and beauty and mysterious machines. The silhouette level design reminds me of Limbo, but has its own unique feel within the context of this game as well.The story is told by the images in the background and how they evolve over time. Eventually you begin to question the world you are in, what happened to make it like this, and what role this small creature has to play. The atmosphere is sometimes peaceful and sometimes rather creepy. The visual art and level design are supplemented by the incredible sound design, immersive, ambient and very realistic. This is a great game to put on nice headphones, sit back and relax, and play, and it has a feature called “Flow Mode” which provides uninterrupted gameplay and minimalistic, text-free UI which is gorgeous and one of my favorite things about this game.\n\nNegatives:\nHere is the short list of things I don’t like about this version of the game. They are mostly just immersion-breaking more than anything else.\n-Achievement notifications: Steam has its own achievement notifications, but Badland adds another: a banner that covers the top portion of the screen and breaks immersion. I’m not a fan of that, but it’s only there for a couple seconds.\n-Camera: yes it is a sidescroller, and therefore the camera is supposed to be my enemy, but it still isn’t easy when the threat of the left wall of the screen is always directly behind you and you never get to look at the middle or right side of your monitor.\n\nIn all:\nBadland was a standout showpiece on the iOS market, a place filled with the scum of the game industry, but here on Steam I can see that it will likely stand out less among more popular indie games. This is why I encourage you to get it: it’s a lovely experience, a wonderfully fun puzzle game, and a beautiful audiovisual presentation, and not something to be missed.","May 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","52","63","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/269670/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","BADLAND is a casual game made by studio Frogmind. You take control of a flappy furball animal somewhere deep in the forest where odd things happen because of alien machines full of traps. Well, actually, you take control of more than one furball, as almost every level will grant you the option of cloning them! Tens or hundreds or furballs that you will control with one button!\n\nThe controls are really easy and intuitive - you have a button to flap (with all your furballs) and you just choose the direction of movement. You can do this either with your keyboard or gamepad (Xbox 360 controller worked flawlessly). To be not too much casual, this game will push on you by moving screen to the right - any furball that goes off-screen dies. But don't get discouraged, the game isn't made to be hard and there are usually checkpoints before and after more demanding parts of levels.\n\nYou might think this is the extended version of popular mobile game Flappy Bird (made by Dong Nguyen in 2013), and you might be actually right - the main gameplay element is same, with added furball clones, specific gameplay changing mutators like faster sidescrolling or furball size change, and beautiful visual style based on silhouettes that you may know from LIMBO (made by Playdead in 2011).\n\nThe game offers huge amount of content, as there are hundred levels optimised for both singleplayer and local multiplayer (there are just smaller differences between SP and MP levels). But that's not all, there are also thousands of custom levels!\n\nEven though BADLAND is originally a smartphone game, it didn't get just ported, it got a rework with focus on many details to feel great on PC. There are still new updates with even more content and bugfixes, it's great to see active indie developers. BADLAND fully deserves recommendation for what it is - entertaining sidescroller with beautiful graphics.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 14","true","11.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","1"

Previously for mobile devices, this game has now been ported to Steam-powered devices.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You, as a cute fluffy flying spinning cloning bouncing sticking dying respawning resizing reshaping creature, have to fly across the levels without dying and you have to finish with as many clones as you can. Simple as that.\n\nPros:    Visuals are simple, charming and great to look at. The character is really cute and the whole look of the game just makes you keep playing.\nThe puzzling side of the game is great. You are not told anything, you have to figure things out by yourself. Usually, it's not hard, the hard part is actually completing the stage once you figure out how. And when you do, you feel like you accomplished something.\nThere are a lot of levels. Really, you will need a lot of hours to complete them all. There are 100 of them and they usually last a few minutes, depending on how bad you are (or how good).\nThere are even multiplayer and co-op levels built in, in case you run out of levels.\nIf you are more of a couch player, this game fully supports controllers.\nFor a port, this game plays really great.\nApart from the obvious Windows support, you can also play this game on MacOS and Linux/SteamOS.\nTrading Cards, Cloud Support, Steam Leaderboards, Achievements ... this game has taken Steam seriously!\nLow system requirements, this game will run on pretty much anything.\nCons:    When you first launch the game, it just throws you straight into the first level. In case someone would want to check the setting first or anything like that, this can be slightly annoying.\nSome level are extremely hard, much harder than the ones preceding and following it.\nThe final verdict:This is one of those games you just can't stop playing. Its art, music, levels, it all combines into a near-perfect experience and you will most certainly have a great time playing it.\nIn case you want to try it out first, you can download free Android version here. And if you enjoy it, which you certainly will, be sure to buy it on Steam. You won't regret it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

It's like Flappy bird on drugs.\n\nBasically you control the bird type creature and have to get through levels and go into some vaccum type things at the end of each level. The game adds power ups like mmultiply the birn into many clones, bird shrinker and expander, sticky bird which can survive sawblades,, accelerators etc. There are puzzles added and you have to strategize your  flight according to that. The screen keeps moving so you have to stay ahead of it, if you get stuck and the screen passes you, you will die. Controls are very simple you just use the directional pad and use 'w' or 'up' key to fly. You can tap and it'll fly like the Flappy bird or you can hold the key and it'll keep flying until it hits the cieling.\n\nThe game can be difficult at times but thanks to generous checkpoint system, it's not really a problem.\n\nGraphics and sound are cool and keep you immersed.\n\nRecommended, check out gameplay videos and if you like this sort of puzzle/action game you'd love this.","June 22, 2015","true","17.2"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","1"

The first levels I played them instinctively, but after I few more I saw the game requires some thinking too. It's relaxing, and incredibly optimized to play even on older laptops like mine at a constant 30fps (even 60fps) in HD graphics. It's flow and controls allowed me to finish some levels while talking on the phone, sharing with someone dear the joy I have.\n\nI believe Badland teaches us about making sacrifices in order to pass over some obstacles.

For those who have played the app, the game is almost the same, with the same levels as far as I can tell. Controls for left and right have been added (and the levels have been slightly modified to accommodate), but the gameplay feels the same. The levels still constantly scroll, meaning the puzzles remain intact.  Multiplayer becomes much easier when everyone has a controller and doesn't have to huddle around a tablet screen.\n\nYou play as a cute species of creatures navigating their way through a forest being overtaken with machines. There's an implication of a storyline, but it doesn't have a resolution (yet?). I'm hoping the developers will come out with a definitive ending to the adventure in the future. In the past they have mentioned that more levels are planned.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple, but the gameplay becomes very difficult. You will die a lot, but every time you lose you are only sent back a few seconds earlier in the level, so it never becomes too frustrating. The puzzles are clever, and many are based on trial and error.  The sounds and graphics are spectacular, and provide an immersive experience when you play with headphones.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game (it's 4 player) is very well thought out. Those who have played more will consistently defeat beginners in the competitive mode, but in the cooperative mode, everyone has fun regardless of skill level. When you die, your teammates will either revive you within a few seconds, or everyone will die, starting at the previous checkpoint with everyone back again, so no one gets frustrated, and everyone feels like they’re contributing. It's entertaining to watch, and there's a lot of discussion because teamwork becomes essential as the difficulty increases.\n\nI highly recommend this game! If you have the app and only play single player, you won't see much by way of new content. But if you play multiplayer, it works much better here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/269670/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","badland is in an incredible fun and unqiue game with challenging but enjoyable gameplay.\n\nBadland is a mobile port. I have played the original and I thoroughly enjoyed it on android and I thorughly enjoyed it on there. Having played this version I was very sceptical about it being released on PC. The controls of the game on mobile are extremely simple. All you do is tap the screen to go up and let go to go down. I didn't think this would work out well for a PC game.\n\nWhat badlands does to combat this problem is introduce a simple but definitely well needed feature. They make it so you can go left and right. You may think I seem completely crazy even advertising this as a feature, but trust me, without it the game would feel so bland on PC. As far as I can see the levels have also been edited to go with this change and you do need to use the movement to get to certain parts of the level. Not as much as I would have hoped though. The majority of the game you do still only use up. Which can make the game drag at some points.\n\nOutside of the trailer the game has no story. The trailer basically tells the story of them being clones and that is about it. I would have personally liked some kind of basic story but it isn't entirely necessary. You should definitely watch that trailer by the way because it is incredible!\n\nThe challenge of the game is provided by use of obstacles and power ups. The screen moves along automatically. You need to try and keep up with this. If your character ends up going off the screen you will fail. There are also obstacles with spikes and such to avoid as well  and these get increasingly hard to avoid as you go along through the game. Pretty standard gameplay really but it still does what it needs to do well.\n\nBut the real thing that gets the gameplay going is the powerups. You start the game with a few standard power ups that you can pick up during levels. These include size powerups to make your clone bigger or smaller, clone powerups to make copies of yourself and many more. You unlock more as you go throughout the game. The powerups are necessary for you to progress through the levels and you need to make sure to use them correctly to progress. This adds a real great element to the standard gameplay presented.\n\nNow what you will probably notice immediately is the incredible graphics the game has. It adds a real nice style and nice depth of colour to the gameplay. Many of the levels give a very dark vibe and then others give a nice colourful vibe. These contrast well with each other. I'm not certain, but I believe the PC version also has had a high upgrade in the graphics and looks way better.\n\nThe biggest problem I found with badland is the laziness of parts of the mobile port. The menu seems to have just been ported straight over, without being edited, from mobile. This means that to navigate parts of the menu you have to slide your mouse accross the screen. While this method of control works great on mobile it isn't nice to have to do this with a mouse. You then just have the fact that the menu looks extremely mobile like. I mean the buttons are rather simplified to fit with a small screen on mobile. You even have a facebook and twitter button.\n\nThe options menu does mostly stick with this trend as well. Initially the only option your presented with is a sound slider. It is only one slider and there are no seperate sliders for music and sounds or anything else. You do also have a very basic graphics options menu. This includes HD graphics, bloom, V-sync and fullscreen. But there are no resolution options or other customizable graphics options. There is also a controls menu with completely rebindable keys.\n\nOverall I have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy playing badland and will definitely go back to it and enjoy the highly challenging gameplay. I am nowhere near to completing it and I can only imagine it will get much harder. I would definitely recommend it to any fan of a challenging platformer. And the price is cheap for it as well!\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free review copy by the developer to right this review with.","May 29, 2015","true","4.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

It can be a bit unnerving to be able to go backwards now, unlike the mobile version, but it is a very minor problem that I quickly adjusted to.\n\nThe art is fantastic, the atmosphere sometimes sunny, sometimes scary, but always mysterious. There is no soundtrack, but the ambience and sound effects greatly add to the tone.\n\nThis version has bonus worlds, which really expands the game from what it used to be.\n\nAnd multiplayer has never been better. It was amazing on Android, the great race against your friends to see who can best survive the chaotic environment. Not only does this game have more unique multiplayer levels, it also has an added co-op too!\n\nThe power-ups are fun, I love becoming a mammoth beast that crushes everything, or a swarm of swift creatures that are difficult to kill in numbers.\n\nThe difficulty of levels increases nicely too, and I never find myself too frustrated to continue the game.\n\nSo do I reccomend this game? Of course! From its great visuals to entertaining gameplay, it is truly a gem. It may not be my favorite game on Steam (Papers, Please, but THAT'S another review), but BADLANDS is definitely an entertaining game to pick up.","May 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Evidence that no one can deny the attraction of the Dying Light, Grand Theft Auto V or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\n\nLike a habit, every year AAA titles launched to satisfy the thirst of fans, and of course, help companies earn huge profits.\n\nHowever, I myself noticed that the big firms, "scrambling" product launch can create an invisible wall, and cover many small but worthwhile projects.\n\nTemporary bypass lengthy preamble and rambling on, today I am very pleased to introduce to you read about BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition - The game was developed by Frogmind - an independent game company from Finland - with a starting point from mobile platforms. Hopefully readers will not waste a single moment when I discovered the game.\n\n------------------CLONY--------------------------\nJust Imagine for a mysterious creature in the woods called Clony. Its identifying characteristics: Round Round, plump, and wearing his wings ruffled feathers. On one morning, he woke up, it still is it, but today forests to other truth. Yes, the machinery ...\n-------------------------I LOVE-----------------------------------\n+WHEN PEOPLE ARE ... VANDALS!\n\nWell, the humans is who destroy the environment, destroy natural. They cut the trees, they deforest, they repel all species with death machines. The truth is always easier to destroy build something, and we did, doing it every day, right?\n\nStoryline of BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition extends through two days of Clony pitiful adventure. It will "be" gradually feel the change of the forest - the home of it - to every little one: From early morning when the neighbors are not awake, suddenly there was something bothering him and the entire forest in the noonday sun; until dark, it struggled to escape the deadly chaos there.\n\nClony not a single creature, but you will gradually see the changes through each screen play: All gradually disappeared in the destruction of science!\n\nBADLAND: Game of the Year Edition does not make players feel frustrated. 2D graphics with nature scene made me think to Ori and the Blind Forest, but is somewhat darker, more mysterious.\n\nBackground music in the game is essentially "symphony" of all species, and it will change according to the circumstances taking place. Imagine that music would be like if the machinery destroyed the forests?\n\n+VERY ATTRACTIVE!\n\nBADLAND: Game of the Year Edition has not only a good story or beautiful graphics (and cute too), the gameplay itself was also very great then.\n\nJust one morning (in the game), players were able to become familiar with the remote operation of three navigation buttons (up, left, right) to help "baby" cute Clony fly and move under the "helicopter control system". Your job is to move from the starting point to endpoint.\n\nIn theory, everything is easy, but the difficulty of the game increases with each game screen. It's no exaggeration to say that to a certain level, players will feel bitter ... because of dying constantly!\n\nYou will gradually get acquainted with the power-ups (actually some special chemicals) help small chemical Clony big variable, fly fast or slow glide "Clone Technique" ... and above all do rhythm game become transformed over.\n\nJust one second slower reaction, or even a "miss" voracious another big variable results only, Clony will probably be stuck in the cavity because ... big bottom. Meanwhile, the screen will constantly go from left to right, try not to be left behind!\n\nIf that were not enough, please rest assured, because along the way you'll also encounter the deadly trap: crushed stone, sawing machines, oblique, crushers and many other things will require players to not only react nhanhn but also performed a little tactics to survive.\n\nBADLAND: Game of the Year Edition only has 100 levels - in which the main storyline did over 80 levels - but perhaps no one can complain about a game platform charismatic and challenging so be .\n\n--------------------------DISLIKE--------------------------\n+A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT...\nBADLAND: Game of the Year Edition is really good, and probably the game could be perfect if you like to be cared in the multiplayer section.\n\nIndeed, in Section teamplay (Co-op) and countervailing (in Section Multiplayer) can support up to 4 players, however, only on one computer and can not play with a friend over the network . Unfortunately!\n\n\nMy review in vietnamese: http://vietgame.asia/badland-game-year-edition-danh-gia-game/\n\n\n\n","June 24, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You have to move around moving cogs, spike bombs and many more interseting things. As you move towards the levels end you met other Clony on your way. This is were it might sound like a nightmare.... but you will have to offer some of them, to give yourself a chance to complete the level. Talking of levels, there are 100 levels, divided over four times of day, Day/Noon/Dust/Night. The level change depending on the time of day. There are over 300 missions included... and no I have gotten that far yet. With regards to achievements there are 77 within the game. So there is also something there if you an achievement hunter. Badland also has 3 different game types, single player, co op and  mutliplayer. I have yet to try the last two, but hopefully will get the chance to. So is Badland worth your money, Yes. Should you buy it, I would say yes. Badland Game of the Year Edition that was released in May 2015 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U and Steam for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X. So there should be a platform for everyone, whatever your favorite is.","June 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They did something on Facebook where the first 50 people who message them would get a free Steam key, which I sadly missed. However, I contacted them anyway, and they gave me one! It's so nice nice to see a company who values their customers so highly. Anyway, onto the review.\n\nI got this game on iPad about half a year ago, and it was one of my favourite games. It has a really nice art style, and the physics are awesome. Even when you complete single player, multiplayer never gets boring. Indeed, how can it be, when you are constantly knocking your friends into circular saws or blowing them up. I always appreciated the regular updates, which constantly brought in new content, something which I expect they will continue in the new game.\n\nI really like the function in GOTY edition that allows you to move back, something that I always wanted in the first game. It also has 4 times as much content as the original one, and 15 hours of playing time, which is ridiculous for just £6.99. It seems a realistic estimate as well, considering how long it has taken me to get as far as I am.\n\nThe only 2 asks I have of this game are: bring in online multiplayer (which according to their website they are already considering), and please add in a level customizer, it would be so awesome!\n\nOverall, this is a great game, which I would definitely reccomend getting.","June 25, 2015","true","9.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They managed to make the physics feel sooooo nice. The game flows smooth while your character changes shapes, size, amounts and physics. Its just a joy.

This includes the backgrounds and the level designs. But most importantly, the local co-op is what makes this game interesting. The more people you play with, the easier (or more difficult) it is to solve some of the levels as everybody wants the honor of finishing a level with their own clone. My only disapointment is the fact that they didn't add the level editor to the pc. But I guess all the other "pc only" features outweigh this disapointment.","May 8","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
