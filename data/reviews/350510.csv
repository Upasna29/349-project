The graphics made me think of the old arcade game "Tapper" and the gameplay is satisfying for what it is.  It's ridiculous, silly, crude, simple, but all in the best way possible.  Essentially your battery power is draining, and to keep yourself alive you need to lure people using certain items that appeal to them, and while they are distracted you rip their hearts out and replace your battery with their heart to keep on going, and repeat this to get a high enough score to advance to the next level.  The catch being however that different types of characters have better hearts than others, so a wealthy businessman might give you 30 seconds of life to work with to find a new heart, while some fat slob might only give you 10 seconds.  There's also hazards and the likes to try and avoid that will shave off valuable time on your battery/heart.  The plus side is your battery can be picked back up again at any time to replace a heart, and it keeps its energy with it so there is a bit of strategy involved for when to use your battery and when to use a heart.  The gameplay is very reminiscent of oldschool arcades where the focus was a high score.","February 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Altho,  I do enjoy the subtle psychological point that is either intentionally or not, protrayed in this game it's not really fun. Which is kind of the point of a game. (Gasp)\n\nSound and video isn't horrible except for maybe the shriek as you kill people.\n\nI would say avoid this game and spend your money elsewhere.\nWith the amount of cheap decent games available on steam this one simply isn't worth the time put into it.\n\nFor the record I did put a total of about 3-4 hours into it half of which was offline / not reflected in the time played.\nSo I did give it a fair chance and played through what it had to offer.\n\nMake up your own mind about it, for my money however it simply wasn't worth it.","October 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Keep in mind that this game is only $3 and you should be pretty satisfied.\n\nPros:  Fun sprite graphics, unique concept, plenty of levels.\nCons:  It gets repetitive pretty quickly, the plot is pretty minimal, it takes a few minutes to figure out exactly what's going on (this isn't a huge deal, but a quick tutorial screen might have been nice for the unitiated).\n\nThe difficulty curve is pretty fair, and as the variety of targets increases and the environmental hazards show up, things get a lot more interesting. All in all, though, the gameplay is pretty straightforward, and it does eventually get stale.\n\nAll in all, this isn't a game you'll sit down with and play for hours on end. This is a nice little time waster. I might even go so far as to call it charming.\n\nYou'll spend a half-hour stealing hearts here, a half-hour stealing them there, and you'll probably finish it in a day or two. For $3 this is a worthwhile buy.","February 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It is a very simple game, with nice pixel-art (play it fullscreen to understand what I mean!) and easy gameplay. It gets more and more challenging the more you play, and this gives the game an arcade feeling that very few games have been able to emulate. All in all, HassleHeart is well worth the little money it costs.","February 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's a great little time-waster if you don't mind being the littlest robot who needs hearts to live. And we don't mean love, we mean tearing beating organs from people's chests.\n\nProbably my only issue having played it some, is that I've seen the game stop spawning people and thus I've run out of power because no one else comes onto the map.\n\nStill enjoying it, though!
