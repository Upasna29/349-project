The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3).

Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).\nMod Support:\nThe modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!\nOpen World:\nDepending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot!\nWeaponry:\nFallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.\nHardcore Mode:\nWant something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a "Hardcore" mode you!\nMultiple Playthroughs:\nThere's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!\n\nWhat I disliked:\nCrashing:\nFallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.\nNavmesh:\nDespite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)\nPC abilities:\nThis game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)\n\nSo what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?\nThe ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.\n\nAll-in-all:\nFallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion. Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game.","October 11, 2014","true","288.1"," 1,079 of 1,124 people (96%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","96","079","1","24","16"

Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?\n\nThis game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter.\n\nWhen you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.  If you are interested in modding the PC version of this game, and you should be, then check out my tutorials on how to do exactly that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-3c1a9cLL8&index=1&list=PL0E5E8CA384409B11","January 4, 2015","true","208.2"," 979 of 1,026 people (95%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","95","979","1","85","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/22380/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","I think this review is going to be much like my Arkham City review; I would say the majority of user's on Steam will have already purchased Fallout: New Vegas, and most will have probably even finished it.  So this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who don't have it, or just haven't played it.\n\nFallout New Vegas was released in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the areas of Nevada and California. You play as a Courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the New Vegas strip across the Mojava Desert. During the delivery, you are captured and shot dead (or so they think). After being recovered by a friendly robot, you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land.\n\nThis was my first ever experience with a Fallout game; I had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there, and of course I am on the internet, and so it's always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so I knew what I was getting into,  a huge deep time sink.\n\nGame play is focused around the use of your V.A.T.S for guns, as well melee weapons. V.A.T.S pauses the game so to speak, and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body. You have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode, so once you aim, you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set. You can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode.\n\nAs you wander around the desert, you will find plenty of items, weapons, food, drink, books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another.  Obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find, alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time. This can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor. As you progress through the game and get a higher reputation, you unlock safe houses, where you can store your items in fridges, cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling.\n\nOne thing I was surprised about in Fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as I had initially imagined. I created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations, and this cut down the amount of fighting I had to do by quite a bit I think. It was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as I have not come across many that have; like wise, you can go guns blazing at all times if you want; although I would hate to see how your story ends out.\n\nWithin Fallout New Vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game, right until the last moments in the game. Along the way you will pick up side quests, these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed. There are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while. Some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable I have ever played, helping ghouls escape on their great journey, liberating a power plant were among my favorites, but there are just so many to do, and I would highly recommend that people don't just rush through the main quest in New Vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content.\n\nWhile the graphics in New Vegas don't look like the graphics we have today in game; they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play. I played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through; I was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state, it looks nice. You can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find.\n\nThe game has varying levels of difficulty, you can play it on hardcore mode, or just on the regular easy, normal and hard modes. I played on normal mode so I could see the missions, story and explore the world without being too focused on min/maxing my character to be optimum at all times - although once I got the option to have Boone as my companion (a sniper), the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time, sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead.\n\nAs you can see from the amount of time I have put into New Vegas, this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see, and probably in our life times. You will never be bored; there is always something different to do, whether it be crafting potions, or just playing a little Black-Jack at the casinos - there is never a dull moment.\n\nI 100% recommend Fallout New Vegas to anybody. Even if you aren't a fan of RPG games. New Vegas will probably change your mind; this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and I cannot believe I had not played it until now. If you haven't got New Vegas, get it, it's on sale quite regularly and if you do have New Vegas but haven't played it; please don't wait a second longer, boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game. Easily one of the games of our generation.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.\n\nUnlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.\n\nNew to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.\n\nWhilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.\n\nSo it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.\n\nFallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.","August 1, 2015","true","230.0"," 553 of 588 people (94%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","94","553","588","33","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/22380/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey ♥♥♥.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time.\n\nI played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.\n\nThe Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit.\n\nThe combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, I use a mod to keep that part off.\n\nThis is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it.\n\nBuy At Full Price","April 16, 2014","true","156.1"," 379 of 398 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","379","398","0","11"

But Bethesda has.\n\nWhen Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and Intellegint speach options the dryer mercilless expense of the Fallout franchise could offer.\n\nThey returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that have scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site.\n\nThe NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag.

A man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head, telling me I had entered a game I had to lose. Like so many others, my story would have ended in blood.\n\nExcept I didn't. My lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up. Sadly, my name and life was gone. All I knew was the face of the man, and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of Goodsprings. I don't know who I was, but I know who I am now. I am the woman who will have her revenge. As I stepped outside, I saw the good people of Goodsprings being ravaged by bandits. I took up my  9mm pistol, and told the leader to meet us. We would give him their prisoner. As they stepped out confidently, I shot them all in the head. The blood stained the sand red, but the bandits left Goodsprings alone. Taking some food and water, and as much ammo as I could carry, I took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep.\n\nI eventually came to the town of Primm; here I met the NCR. A large group of foreigners who told me what I could and couldn't do. Wanted to help, but didn't do anything. Unbound by their rules, I picked a rifle out from their bed and, at night, rescued the locals. I supported the new Sheriff in Primm's independence. The NCR was only willing to watch; cowards, the lot of them.\n\nI later came across more of them; content to sit, drink and complain, I learned of the situation of the Mojave desert and began to fix the problems; they thanked me, paid me, took the credit, and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere. They had built a great statue, but did no great deeds.\n\nI then moved along the path, following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip, until I came across a town on fire. Outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps; I killed them all and took their caps for myself. Strange. Stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt; a town of the dead. Legionaires of Caesar came to me, and asked me to carry on their message. All shall be equal before Caesar. I remembered these words.\n\nWhen I came to Novac, I found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the NCR. As I saved them, I taught them to stand alone. I met the NCR at the power station; obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert, I sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people. I winked at my fellow co-conspirators of the Fellowship of the Apocalypse, and continued on my way.\n\nAt a trading post in the middle of nowhere, I met Veronica. Beautiful, if eccentric, she was as alone as I was in this desert. She told me of the threats the Mojave faced; her own Brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the NCR. We travelled together, learning of the plights of the people in the Mojave.\n\nAs we moved along, we came across the poor gathered outside new Vegas. The Fellowship of the Apocalypse agreed with my thoughts, that those in power cared little for the Mojave beyond resources and manpower. We killed the local drug dealers, killed the troublemakers, wiped out the Kings for creating a civil war, and once peace reigned, continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion.\n\nAs I looked upon the wealth of New Vegas, I saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside. I found my man in his suit, "Benny". Surrounded by guards, he warned me off. I hadn't come this far to fail, however, and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room. Alone, I took my pleasure from him, and with his shaving knife, cut his throat in his sleep. That was the first night I slept well, although I needed a shower upon my awakening.\n\nI discovered his secret; a robot that could change the whole game to my rules. Not a brutal conquerer like Caesar, not the haughty expansionists of the NCR, nor the greedy self-interest of House; no, Yes Man provided a new way. Our own way. My travels taught me that only in true Chaos could the strong rise and lead the Mojave for itself; not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich. That was what I told myself as I walked through the rivers of blood.\n\nThe White Hands family was first, high airs and low appetites, I smiled as I cut my way through them, executing them with the same gun Benny tried to execute me with. Then the Omertas, typical schemers; they screamed as I murdered them in their beds.\n\nInstead, I put the power into the hands of the people; the Boomers, remants of those before, I brought their dreams to life. I gave the Brotherhood back to those who would see it's power restored, partly for my philosophy, partly because Veronica had been my partner through everything and I would see her dreams come true as well.\n\nI then found the Sierra Madre, a dead land with untold riches. Finding it ruled by the mad, I killed the King of the Dead for my partner's sanity and the safety of the Mojave, and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison. Alone and silent.\n\nI found Mt. Big, the hope for the future from the past. Dusty, unused relics, I crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot. Our future would be our own; the past had already failed us, as my past had failed me.\n\nTo the north, I found Zion; a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires, and despite the bleating of pacifists, I forged these people into a strong ally for the Mojave; they, like we, shall be independent.\n\nFinally, I took control of New Vegas; as the NCR and the Legion of Caesar fought, we executed our coup. A grand army of independence, from the many I had helped, came to free our land from the bear and the eagle. We drove off the Legion; and when the NCR came for their blood prize, I had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death.\n\nThe Mojave is free, and shall stay free. Even after I leave.","November 1, 2015","true","53.8"," 295 of 327 people (90%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","90","295","327","82","16"

If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Fallout New Vegas Review.-=-\n\nIf you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, you might be familiar of the famous RPG/Adventure game developers, Bethesda. They do an AMAZING job at creating medieval and sci-fi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago. I think Fallout New Vegas is a great game, but the graphics and presentation are ugly. Its really not even an upgrade over Fallout 3, I would call it more of a downgrade. Bugs are small in amount, landscapes are varied, the open world populated, and many, many towns and cities to visit, including your very own Vegas.\n\nOkay, off of the specs: You start out in a small town with a gun, and you can get meat cleavers, baseball bats, plasma rifles, sniper rifles, a concrete club, etc. There are lots of choices on weapons.\nYou have so many choices of armor, too. You will never get bored of character customization.\nSome horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat. The worst I've experienced was walking through a rundown factory, killing weird creatures and invisible giants.\nGORE. Yes, I said gore with all caps. You can dismember people! Even when they're laying on the ground, dead, you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads, yes heads, off of the corpses.\nCrippling aspects. Pretty neat, although weird in some ways. I shot a centaur with an incinerator (Flamethrower) and I crippled his tongue.\nMutant creatures. Giant flies, scourpions, and geckos, etc, alongside and against eachother. (I was walking to a town called Prim, and a fly got mauled by a young gecko.)\nThe exploration in this game is incredible. You can go through Vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire, repaying debts, etc. You can head to several different other towns, drink out of toilets to regain health, take down large bandit empires, and kill large geckos with pool cues.\nIf you like the Elder Scrolls, this game is fun and enjoyable. 9/10 great game, accidentally deleted my level 12 character and I hate myself for that. (Spent 9/10 hours working on him. I had a sword and medium armor. freaked me out, I guess I can restart.)\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review, please rate if it helped, also comment on what you'd like to see in any other review, open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed. :)","November 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 500 of 586 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","500","586","11","46"

Yes.\nElements of the cancelled Van Buren (Black Isle's Fallout 3) finally brought to life? Yes.\nA mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences? Yes, yes, yes.\nFor all intents and purposes, Fallout: New Vegas is the true Fallout 3 and the best sequel to Fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series.\n\nUnfortunately Obsidian was stuck working with Bethesda's sub-par game engine and base mechanics, but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up Fallout 2. If you're a long time fan of the Fallout series, playing this will mostly make you forget about Bethesda's attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over (problematic automatic weapons, for a big example.)\n\nAlso worth noting is that Obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project. The fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me.\n\nLead developer JE Sawyer's mod (though I consider it a much-needed patch) is highly recommended for the best possible experience.\n\nDescription/update notes for JE Sawyer's mod for a good idea of what it does: http://fallout.gamepedia.com/JSawyer","October 23, 2014","true","810.6"," 455 of 534 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","455","534","15","28"

At least, most of the elements that make their appearance in New Vegas were actually of the original Fallout 3, which was canceled when it was almost finished by Bethesda so they could make their own 3, which wasn't as amazing as it could be in several factors, and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors, to say the least. Fallout New Vegas is pretty much more of a Fallout 3 than the actual Bethesda Fallout 3 was, so calling it Fallout 3.5 isn't doing it any justice whatsoever.\nPlus, Fallout 3 runs quite badly on the PC partly due to GFWL and apparently is even more crash-happy, so there is that.\n\nOn to the actual game, it is incredebly enormous in size.\nI bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least.\nIf you just take your time and explore like me, expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run. The game world feels huge, with way more than enough places to discover. Also, it has a gigantic list of quests, so yeah, this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks. Evenmoreso with the Ultimate Edition, which covers every piece of Expansion Pack/ DLC with it, which ups the game length very reasonably, and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile. Not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the Mojave Wasteland, but they all bring enough new in-stuff to the table which is also useable outside the Expansion Pack arenas.\n\nHave I mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons?\nSeriously, I cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use. True, it is partially due to the Expansion Packs bringing a part of it to the table, but even without it is bigger than Fallout 3, and with the expansion packs, it absolutely makes Fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two. The only thing Fallout 3 has weaponwise what New Vegas doesn't is the Rock-It Launcher, but that is about the only thing.\n\nEven if it isn't graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine, GameBryo, which really should be replaced next-gen and is still a bit glitchy, it is still really acceptable, and hey, graphics aren't the most important things in a game.\n\nStory's pretty great too. It all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like Bugsy Siegel, if he wasn't shot in the face (yet) and wasn't living in a post-apocaliptic Nevada/ Las Vegas,  you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit, where ever he might even be, to have a very stern talk with him. What's more, is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the Mojave and New Vegas, and it is all your choice who's gonna come out on top, by what means necessary... Or you just decide to take it all for yourself. Voice Acting is pretty well too mostly. Just don't expect the nameless NPC's to say something amazing.\n\nDarn, hear me rambling about this game, and I've probably haven't even covered a small part of it! In short, this is a quality game, the Ultimate Edition is where you should go for, and it is really dirt cheap during event sales (like 5 bucks in the Summer Sale) , and you really should pick it up, for a game of this calibre it is practically theft.","October 17, 2013","true","102.1"," 506 of 607 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","506","607","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oxygen97/recommended/22380/","Oxygen97","Oxygen97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oxygen97/","309 products in account","One of the greatest RPG games of all time (In my Opinion)\n\nLots of people say Fallout 3 is better, I admit it is hard to decide between the two.\n\nPositives\nFallout 3 had a better atmosphere compared to Fallout New Vegas, it actually felt less of a Wasteland in New Vegas, less of a gritty and depressing feeling and more of a Cowboy, Western feel.\n\nThe Story in Fallout New Vegas is utterly Amazing. It can go many ways depending on who you side with later on in the game which brings me to another point, later on in the game you have much more choice and freedom on which path to take, which allies you want aiding you, who you don't want to work with... etc.\n\nThe Game starts off very slow paced, a bit like any RPG and is most likely the part where most people are going to turn it off at, but once you get going it becomes addicting, the Characters are detailed and some of the guys you encounter you will either like or hate.\n\nFallout 3 had 20 Levels (NO DLC) and 30 Levels (WITH DLC) so if you thought that was too little, you will be glad to know that Fallout NV has 30 Levels (NO DLC) and 50 Levels (WITH DLC).\n\nMany people argue that Fallout 3 had a bigger map, this may be true I'm not sure but I feel that FONV has more unique locations to visit. I also found the DLC in FONV much more interesting than FO3. It wasn't a case of... "I just want to finish this damn DLC so I can get the items".\n\nLast thing is, there are Factions which weren't in the previous game which is pretty damn cool. Once again opening a path for your character on who to side with. (Legion FTW ^^)\n\nYou can at least create attachments for your guns in this game, unlike Fallout 3\n\nTons of mods which spices the gameplay up A LOT\n\nNegatives\nThe only downside to this game is that it of course uses the same engine as FO3 so it may feel a bit outdated, along with the graphics (Not like they matter, sadly they do for some people).\n\nOne thing that annoys me the most about this game is the fact you cannot work alone later on in the game, you must have the aid of someone else if you choose to... SPOILERS >>>  Take over Vegas\n\nOnce you hit max level, it gets really boring. All you can really do is do the side quests and explore.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nGreat game, definitely buy it. Worth way more than the price it is. 9/10","September 26, 2014","true","280.1"," 170 of 186 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","170","186","3","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skiesbleed/recommended/22380/","skiesbleed","skiesbleed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skiesbleed/","549 products in account","Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation. It takes the fundamentals of the classic Fallout games and puts them into the Fallout 3 engine, giving fans of the original games a true successor.\n\nDeveloped by Obsidian Entertainment, New Vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original Fallout series, and whose strengths are writing and solid role-playing mechanics, and it shows. The writing throughout New Vegas is phenomenal, and no matter what type of character you want to play, the game was made with you in mind. You constantly feel rewarded for your choices. Hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game, having to get food, water, and sleep. For a real challenge, check out the mod Josh Sawyer (lead designer) made for the game. It takes hardcore mode to a whole new level.\n\nI also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for New Vegas, since it has the best DLC suite I've ever experienced. Each of them is brilliantly crafted, expanding the story of New Vegas in interesting ways. Furthermore, the DLC is foreshadowed throughout the main game, and the DLC can cause changes in the main game as well. If you only get the DLC for one game, make it this one.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.","November 2, 2013","true","186.3"," 340 of 422 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","340","422","0","0"

After five years of being\na couple with her since entering high\nschool, my girlfriend has left me.\n\nI am horribly depressed, but I begin\nmy ritual of logging into Steam in the\nmorning. The Fallout Franchise Sale\nis in full swing, and New Vegas tempts\nme so. I consider buying the game.\n\nI believe I am going through something\nakin to withdrawal symptoms. I miss her\ntouch, her laugh, her smile. My hands\ngrasp air, as I swear I can still smell\nMs. Novocaine's scent about my bed.\n\nI break down, crying. Ms. Novocaine\nleft me on the first day of the holidays,\nthe time before college. My plans with\nher up in smoke, I blubber and buy the\nUltimate Edition of New Vegas.\n\nFallout: New Vegas downloads fast\nenough. I begin the game with a bullet\nthrough my head, buried alive and left\nfor dead. The game opens up its story\nneatly and cleanly, telling me I was just\nan everyman hired to do a job which\nwent horribly downhill.\n\nThe world is now mine to explore, what\nwith me having cheated death and the\noptions to pursue multiple paths have\nopened for me. With trusty six-shooter\nin hand, I leave the dusty backwater\ntown I recovered from my beating in\nand venture into the bleak world on\nthe frontier.\n\n\n-Day 15 without Miss Novocaine\nI have become a veritable recluse. In the\ntime that has passed, the feelings for Ms.\nNovocaine have not dulled, but my heart\naches even more for her. How can this be?\n\nShe's started seeing a lanky, fashionable\nart student. Then a new, stereotypical\nbiker bad-boy. I hear she's begun sleeping\nabout. My heart breaks a little more with\neach shred of news I overhear.\n\nIn New Vegas, my vengeance is tenfold.\nI brandish and alternate between a lever-\naction cowboy shooter and a revolver\nwhich would make Ocelot approve.\n\nI undertake multiple quests, but stick\nto the main quest to restore the fortunes\nof my employer, the mysterious Mr. House\nand his casino the Lucky 38. I encounter\nboth the NCR (New California Republic)\nand the savage Caesar's Legion, led by\nthe terminally dying Emperor Caesar.\n\n\n-Day 30 without Miss Novocaine\nI've completed a good chunk of the main\nstoryline by playing two sides between the\nNCR and Mr House's outlying Casino forces.\nPerhaps on my next playthrough, I shall be\na cruel sadist and throw in with the Legion.\n\nNo matter, the DLC of the game shall keep\nme company on these cold nights alone.\nI instantly regret playing Dead Money first,\nas I soon discover that compared to the\nothers which are of incredible quality, it is\nDead Money that is the most exceptional.\n\nAfter a few tears sting my eyes at the end\nof Dead Money, I dive into Honest Hearts,\nand meet the enigmatic Burned Man at his\ntable of seemingly endless M1911s.\n\nHis mission clear and his soul reborn, the\nBurned Man extends his hand out to me\nso that I may join in his crusade against\nthe savage White Legs tribe, allies of\nCaesar's Legion.\n\n\n-Day 45 without Miss Novocaine\nI've done it. I've returned to the main story\nand fought the final battle at Hoover Dam\nagainst the new leader of Caesar's Legion,\nthe towering and brutal Legate Lanius.\n\nArmed with all that I can carry and draped\nin an NCR Ranger's trenchcoat and Chinese\nStealth Helmet, I finish the leader of the\nLegion on behalf of Master House with my\nnow-signature Revolver.\n\nI still have two more DLCs to complete,\nOld World Blues and Lonesome Road,\nwhere the latter serves as an epilogue\nto my character's original story from the\nmain game.\n\nI stifle a yawn and take a long hard look\nat myself in the reflection of my monitor\nas I put my computer to 'sleep' mode.\nTime I got some sleep myself.\n\n\n-Day 65 without Miss Novocaine\nFinished Lonesome Road last night, and\nhere I am stifling more yawns in the line\nto apply at College on this hot Monday\nmorning. A good epilogue after all that\nhappened in Fallout, but I did wish that\nthe main villain, 'Ulysses' would have\njust shut up rather than droned on as he\ndid in Lonesome Road.\n\nMy mind wanders to Ms. Novocaine as I\ntry to remember any shred or scrap I can\nof her. It frustrates me to no end that I\ncan barely remember, especially after all\nthe time we've spent together. Did New\nVegas really help get over my flighty\nex-girlfriend? Surely not...\n\nLost in my thoughts of Ms. Novocaine\nand considering replaying Fallout: New\nVegas from a different perspective, I fail\nto see the pale perfection of a girl, dressed\nin gothic petticoat and corset and daubed\nin black, blue and silver, knocking into\nher and throwing her application papers\nabout.\n\nDumbstruck, I apologize profusely, but\na stare which could stop a clock ticking\nfrom her hazel eyes meet mine. She blows\na stray blue lock of hair away from her\neyes and pays no attention to me.\n\n"I'm- I'm so sorry- I was just thinking\nabout my application, and Fallout, and-"\n\nShe perks up at the mention of Fallout,\nwhile kneeling down to retrieve her\npapers. "...the Fallout sale? I thought it\nended already?" I tell her about how\nI've been playing it since the sale, and\nhow well it's been, as both a game and\na journey of self-reflection.\n\n"What course you apply for?" She tersely\nsays. It sounds more of a demand. I gulp\na bit, intimidated by this beautiful girl\nwho seems dangerous and skilled. I tell\nher I applied for Arts and Psychology.\n\nThe girl has a deadpan look now, before\nshe breathes out in boredom. "Huh. It\nseems we're going to be classmates,\nloser." She's collected her papers,\nbut I manage to grab hold of her book\nthat she dropped in the commotion.\n\n"Let me carry your things. It's the least\nI can do." I tell her, as I feel a fierce heat\nwell up behind my cheeks. "Please. Let\nthis loser make up for his clumsiness,\nMiss...?" She scowls, before handing\nme all of her papers and strutting off.\n\n"Come on, Fallout Boy. I don't have all\nday." She beckons, her voice laced with\nirritation. She almost looks beautiful, as\nbeautiful as Ms. Novocaine was, if not\nmore so. "Walk me home while carrying\nall my things. Then... then maybe I'll\nforgive you, and add you on Steam."\n\nMy heart leaps now, and I suppress a\nsmile, bounding after her so I can walk\nin step with her. After a time along the\nsidewalk, I finally muster the courage\nto ask her.\n\n"What's your username on Steam?"\n\nShe flicks my forehead before skipping\nahead of me, flashing what I would\ncome to know as her signature smile.\n\n"It's _Summer-Rain_."\n\nI bid Ms. Novocaine farewell under my\nbreath and I smile to myself at having\nbought Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nHeartaches by the numbers, troubles by\nthe score- everyday you love me less,\neach day I love you more~\n\n","October 22, 2015","true","108.2"," 199 of 236 people (84%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","84","199","236","91","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/22380/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","I, along with an unfortunately large number of people, was not too fond of New Vegas when it was released. My original review was littered with complaints about bugs, issues, uneven difficulty, and so on. However, with Fallout 4 on the horizon, I think I'm going to miss Obsidian. They have (or had) an understanding of what I appreciate most about the series, and it took me almost five years to realize it.\n\nDon't know what you got till it's gone?\n\nWhen it comes to the post-apocalyptic wasteland; once you've seen one bombed-out building filled with skeletons, you've seen them all. I got my fill of "destroyed-beauty" in Fallout 3. I expect something a little more intriguing. New Vegas creates a more thoughtful world. The characters are interesting, the stories are imaginative, and there's always that superb twist of dark humor. It ain't pretty though, and I mean that in every sense of the word.\n\nSpeaking from a strict game-design perspective, the Mojave is amazing. There's a linear structure, which works well for first-timers. In subsequent play-throughs you'll know where to go, how to get around those freakin' cazadores, and create your own path. If you focus entirely on the main quest-line, the average play-through is roughly 5-10 hours. Naturally, once you factor in all of the additional content (side-quests, DLC, mods, etc) that time balloons into absurdity. I think it's perfect. I also really appreciate that this game doesn't employ level-scaling. But the Mojave is not only a desert, it's also a desert that suffered through a nuclear war. Even New Vegas itself is just a few casinos and some lights. If you didn't notice the details, you'd think it was the blandest place imaginable.\n\nThe details are where New Vegas absolutely shines. Each "dungeon" has a story to tell, some (like Vault 11) are among the best the genre has conceived. It helps to pay attention to posters, and even subtleties like what somebody was holding before they died, or how some everyday objects are arranged. This is what I appreciate the most from Fallout's jump to 3D. Though I have a soft spot for reading a paragraph of text when I right-click on a broken vent, sometimes I just want to be able to see that it is in fact a broken vent and move on.\n\nNot only are there multiple endings, there are also several methods for getting to them. Every quest has numerous solutions, and if you can't be bothered, then just crack skulls until you're allowed to progress. The faction system is also quite interesting (especially now that it works), and it's nice to have actual consequences. Bethesda's obsession with essential NPCs drives me insane. Diplomacy is also extremely effective. Not only can you talk people out of fighting, but you can talk people into fighting for you. In a couple play-throughs, I sat back while my allies did all of heavy-lifting, even for the climatic Hoover Dam battle. On the flipside, there isn't any "benefit" to playing a stupid character. This is the unfortunate side-effect of higher production values. Everyone has to be voice-acted, and there's no time to record hundreds of lines to satisfy low-intelligence play-throughs. Playing an idiot in Fallout 2 was so much fun.\n\nThe combat mechanics are...well they're still rather poor. This is something that I've grown to accept with this game. We can't expect all games to be at the level of FEAR 1 when it comes to shooting, but FO3/NV are content with barely passable. After all these years though, I guess I've just grown tired of pointing it out. I never paid much attention to combat in the 2D Fallout games. It might be considered strategic, but for me it's only entertaining when I knock a chunk out of somebody with a sledgehammer, critically hit someone with an advanced karate move that kills them instantly, or shoot their eyes out with limited edition red ryder BB gun. Basically, when I get into a fight in Fallout, I only care about the results. I punch someone, someone turns into dog food, and that's good enough.\n\nSince this is a review of a Bethesda game on the PC, I might as well talk about mods. With Skyrim, I got almost all of my enjoyment through modding. With New Vegas? It isn't really necessary. There are a handful of mods that I think are essential: New Vegas Stutter Remover*, Mission Mojave, and Project Nevada. Once you grab those, you're pretty much set. Now I'm not saying that's all you'll ever want in terms of mods, but it's more than sufficient for playing and enjoying the base-game. The only other notable mods I have installed are A World of Pain and Daughters of A.R.E.S. AWOP adds hundreds of dungeons, which can be fun to shoot through. I have ARES installed because the courier is actually a cool-looking robot with anime-colored hair. This is totally immersive and most certainly canon. Also when playing New Vegas, instead of listening to "Starrrrrrrrs of the midnight rangers" for the billionth time, I listen to non-stop Eurobeat.\n\nIn short: I have a new-found appreciation for this awesome game.\n\n\n*Mission Mojave might make this mod unnecessary, I'm not sure.","May 8, 2015","true","114.9"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","93","104","7","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/22380/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","Somewhere between convincing a young boy to hand over the trigger for an orbital death laser, and running into a trio of elderly women howling for my blood after I reprogrammed a sexbot to work for the local bar, I found myself thinking, "This might be one of the best RPGs I've ever played."\n\nMore than any other game in recent memory, Fallout: New Vegas is an RPG that encourages - and rewards - you for exploring strange or out-there possibilities. Whether you want to be the savior of the Mojave Wasteland or the Devil Incarnate when it comes to the way you deal with the world and its residents, this game actively relishes in allowing you to mold the experience in any way, shape or form you choose.\n\nAs a courier who is double-crossed and shot in the head, the game immediately sets itself apart from previous Fallout titles (which all had you start in a Vault and bring you slowly into the outside world) by having you wake up in a small town and immediately get caught up in a (sometimes-overwhelming) amount of oddball characters, sidequests and machinations from various factions within the Mojave. When you set out, you'll quickly find yourself making enemies, running across all sorts of strange locations and getting lost in a mountain of sidequests that will quickly have you glued to your computer saying "just one more mission".\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the game is the care that's taken to giving the player unique, memorable experiences. Whether it's strolling into a new town as the sound of Marty Robbins' "Big Iron" plays on your Pip-Boy radio, the oddball encounters given by the Wild Wasteland perk, the unmarked quests peppered throughout the wasteland or the fact that you can literally run around killing everything and everything (up to and including the heads of major factions), the game has an unbeatable sense of world-building and freedom. You can quite literally massacre everyone and still achieve an ending that's on par (or arguably better) than one of the faction endings.\n\nMuch care has also been given to the wide assortment of companions you can recruit throughout the game, which all have weird quirks but provide incredible benefits during combat. They all have their own quirks and unique conversations, strong companion quests, insight into the various factions and amusing chatter during combat and encounters. Likewise, it shows how much care Obsidian Entertainment put into the game when you see some of the minor NPCs, who have surprisingly-intricate conversations and mini-questlines.\n\nNew Vegas also has some of the most interesting and, I would argue, iconic encounters and quest designs in the entire series. Whether it's the surreal "social experiment" in Vault 22 (and arguably, the rest of the Vaults in the Mojave), menial tasks like the picture-taking sidequest at the south end of the Vegas Strip, or just being able to sell your companion to a group of high-society cannibals for no other reason than "for the evulz", the game does an incredible job of keeping things fresh and varied throughout a playthrough.\n\nThe most interesting thing is that you can play the game a number of different ways and get a different experience every time. The first time I beat the game, I was doing a completionist "goody-two-shoes" run where I saved everyone I could and was incredibly thorough. When I went back for a second run, I played as a female melee expert who ran around stealth-killing everyone with sneak attacks, but couldn't shoot guns to save her life. The flexibility and care given to making both character builds have unique advantages is the main part of why New Vegas continues to have such replay value.\n\nOf course, there's also the modding community, which has given the game unparalleled longevity, both through restored content (like the New Vegas Uncut series on Nexusmods) or major gameplay overhauls like Project Nevada. Even if it wasn't on sale, the game is still incredible value thanks to the amount of content both in the game and contributed by the community.\n\nI highly recommend New Vegas for anyone getting into the genre. It's one of my favorite Western RPGs, and an experience that keeps rewarding me time and time again.","February 2","true","187.3"," 70 of 73 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","70","73","10","7"

I've clocked each and every one of these hours with actual gameplay (or modding and testing), and it is far far more than merely "okay".  If you've been living under a rock and you still haven't gotten around to playing this yet, you're missing out. I can't even count the number of characters I've played through to varying stages of completion -- probably in the forties by now. With Tale of Two Wastelands porting over all of the Fallout 3 GOTY content (if you own that one too), the hours I've clocked and the numbers of characters I've played have tripled.\n\nSure, it's buggy. The graphics were outdated when they came out, let alone for 2016. The 50's schtick wore thin enough in Fallout 3 and they tried lampshade-hanging on it in this one, but all they wound up doing is showing how stupid it is to run around with a lampshade on. Some questionable design decisions, sometimes linear plot, invisible walls, vast tracts of empty. Dialogue that sometimes vastly misses your actual motivations (where's my "Because I don't like being used!" option when playing the Wild Card?).\n\nBut this game is ten times the roleplaying game that Fallout 4 even dreams of being, and twice the game that Fallout 4 actually is.","April 16","true","641.1"," 82 of 91 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","82","91","11","7"

War never changes!‘[… but mods can change everything.]\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThese words are the prelude to the ‚Fallout‘ series, a world on the brink of destruction. During the great war in 2077 all the nations launched their nuclear weapons and civilization was nearly annihilated. Some people have been seeking shelter inside the vaults, others died by the explosions, the contamination and the fallout. Nowadays ruins are most of the time the only witnesses of former glorious cities and nations. Mutations have spread, the curse of radiaton still haunts the wastelands and brutal raiders and gangs wage war against poor survivors and former armies. And then there's you, a simple courier who has been hired to transport a mysterious package. You had the feeling that something wasn't right there. But you still took the job. And in the end...\n\n... you’ve been shot in the head. Twice. Then your pursuers robbed and burried you. But somehow you’re still alive, rescued by a mysterious robot and a doctor. Of course you not only want your package back but you also demand some answers. And so you start your adventure through the wasteland of Nevada, following the trails of your former pursuers. And this will lead you right into the heart of the Strip, where the former glory of Vegas is being rebuilt.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTypcially for the ‚Fallout‘ series you are able to explore a huge open world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland where hundreds of abandoned buildings, ruins, caves and so on wait for a curageous adventurer. You will find countless weapons, armors and items, fight against raiders, bandits, animals and mutated beings like ghouls or death claws. With every lock you open, every enemy you defeat, you’ll get stronger, forming your own character. You may evolve into the intelligent mastermind, focussing on energy weapons and science or into the evil cannibal with a love for rusty chainsaws – the choice is up to you. And meanwhile you can follow the storyline of the main quest or you lose yourself in the huge wasteland, the sidequests, the crafting or the fighting. Or you'll just go to the casinos and try to hit the jackpot. The amount of content is huge, so many persons to talk to, so many places to visit, so much stuff to blow up.\n\nAnd all these positive points make up for some of the games disadvantages: Even with different fixes and stuff the stability isn’t perfect, the translation of some items, dialogues and stuff is (at least in the german version) ‚interesting‘ (maybe ‚creative‘ would be the better term) and some stuff like e.g. loading errors can annoy the crap out of you…\n\n…but you will still continue playing. At least I did it. Because I really love the style and atmosphere, the soundtrack, the exploring, the development of my own character and all the other stuff. And due to the great 'Nexus' modding community you can make the game look absolutely stunning and beautiful, you can add even more content and make it an apocalyptic masterpiece. But even without the mods you won't regret the time you spend in New Vegas.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo all in all there’s only one more thing to say: Gather your stimpaks and the ammo, load your energy rifle and ride into the sunset… *Vault-Boy approves*","August 9, 2015","true","123.4"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","69","76","17","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urah/recommended/22380/","Urah","Urah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urah/","685 products in account","A work of art reflects and depicts the culture where it is created.\nThis is what Fallout: New Vegas achieves on its best way.\n\nPolitics are defined here like anywhere else in a videogame.\n\nDemocrats are represented by the New California Republic -NCR-\nwhile Republicans are epitomized by the Legion.\n\nTechnocracy and dictatorship are Mr House,\nand Anarchism is the fourth path you can choose to finish the game.\n\nSome spoilers here:\n\nNone of them are perfect. NCR are corrupt and pay no attention to anything but their interests;\nand Legion are slavers and gynophobic, although true to their word as their ending shows up.\n\nDespite the fact that Mr House is one of the best hopes for humanity (you can see the message if you get rid of him), his regime is totalitarian and despotic.\n\nNo Gods, No Masters ending is also imperfect. Hard to say which one is canon, honestly.\n\nEnd of spoilers\n\nAll the relations you establish with every faction, and there is a lot, affects its gameplay and endings, so this game becomes in my opinion the most complex and rewarding I have ever found, and I remember seeing the first arcade Pacman when I was a kid.\n\nThe quality of the main quest is reinforced by the impressive amount of sidequests. This game is not only about the campaign, you get swallowed by the Wasteland through the sidequests. Even your companions have hidden quests, all of them flawlessly written. You might need to check the wikias, or buy the game's guide (totally worth it, for me at least), to activate them. There are hundreds of hours ahead of pure delightment, and you will have that feeling you get when you read a really good book:\n\n"I don't want it to end"\n\nNew Vegas inherits the spirit of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, in an act of enrichment beyond Fallout 3, even though a good game, not as excellent as this one. Even the humour is pretty as unique and subtle as in the two previous games, (just watch a Legionnaire picking his nose and we'll talk).\nOr the name of one of its Commanders: Vulpes Inculta (Ignorant Snake Fox in Latin).\n\nJust play Old World Blues if you want to have some hillarious laughs. I still smile remembering those conversations, oh God!\n\nSuffice to say, if you ever played Fallout 1 & 2, I assure you you'll get shocked when you find some characters in the Wasteland. There is a LOT of references to the previous games. Just like the Wild Wasteland perk, you get it or you just don't even notice. That is, after all, what being cultivated means.\nAnd yes, I'd love to see those games remade with nowaydays engines. Sorry, purists.\n\nWhereas Fallout 3 was focused on resources -water, more precisely-, New Vegas is a struggle of energy resources and you can notice how everything is twisted around that. Not only this is very clever, but also it is the most mature post-apocalyptic simulator you can find to this date.\n\nMojave Wasteland isn't as huge as other sandboxes, but it is worked to the detail, full of spirit and so plenty of diversity or marvels you can walk those sands for a thousand hours.\n\nI can guarantee that.\n\nEven though the campaign is close to perfect, New Vegas DLCs, all of them, create a storyline arch which multiplies the game's quality immensely.\nFrom Dead Money through Big Empty to the Lonesome Road, there stands a parallel storyline mesmerizing and superbly written. By the way, Lonesome Road which was unfairly critizised for being "linear" (aren't all paths linear after all? o.O) contains some of the best this game has to offer.\n\nEdit: for those owning Ultimate Edition, think that you should really play the DLCs in order:\nDead Money\nHonest Hearts\nOld World Blues\nLonesome Road.\n\nVoice acting:\nSimply the best there is. Let's talk about Caesar and get to the point.\nEvery time I found this character I was amazed how charismatic and strong he was.\nNo doubt a superb actor was behind those flawless performance.\nThat actor is John Doman[www.imdb.com]\n\nWhen I was watching The Wire (the best TV series of all time) I was literally shocked when I heard the Commissioner William A. Rawls reprimmending his police officers.\nThat acting strength wasn't similar to New Vegas' Caesar, it WAS Caesar himself!\nAnd he was.\n\nSame goes for many others. Boone, Veronica, Doc Mitchell... Ulysess.\n\nEdit:\nTHE MUSIC:\nIt goes without saying this is some of the best soundtracks ever made. I just want to talk about something else to reinforce how mature, cultivated, and serious, this game is.\nDriving and listening to this soundtrack I found something amazing: the TITLE of a song.\n\n'Jacobstown Ladder'. Inon Zur left an impressive cultural mark even at the level of giving title to the songs. It is a reference to Jacob's Ladder, a Biblical figure whose purpose was to rescue the lost souls and take them to Heaven.\n\nIf you have ever been in Jacobstown you can see the pun (paronomasia it is also called) and how it is related to the game. I bow in respect to you. Me quito el sombrero.\n\n'Dam Nation' is the song for the Second Battle for Hoover damn.\n\nThere goes another paronomasia with big balls.\nCon dos cojones.\n\n\nAnd there is more: the MODS.\n(Yes, that thing some economical powers of gaming industry wanted to charge you for).\n\nI have not only found gamefixes which work fantastically, but also some writers out there that I do consider cannon of the Fallout universe. I am looking at you, Someguy. Your "New Vegas Bounties" are part of this game. Congratulations.\n\nEdit: WOW just WOW New Vegas Bounties III.\nMarko enters the Pantheon of best villains ever made (Kerrigan, Arthas, GLaDOS, make some space because you have a new neighbor)\n\nAnd the story, Someguy, you really got me there, you monster.\n100 out of 10. To my eyes you are part of Fallout Universe by right.\n\nCheck "Paint Your Weapon", please. ;)\n\nThere are other fantastic attempts, like for instance "Dust", the most extreme survival simulator, although having certain flaws in my personal opinion.\n\nOther mods I recommend:\nLeather Backpack\nVeronica Can Wear Vera's Outfit\nRussell\nBurning Campfire\nHZ Novac Campfire\nNew Vegas Stutter Remover\nThe Someguy Series\nEnhanced Blood Textures\nTales From The Burning Sands <--\nYUP Base Game and all DLCs\n\n\nWhat else can I say?\nOne more thing: what this game means to me.\n\nI deleted my previous recommendation, which was one of the most higlhy rated I have, but deep inside I knew I was being unfair to my favourite game.\n\nIn a few days Fallout 4 will come out.\nI know it will change many things, and you can bet your moustache Bethesda is going to put a lot of efford to make it a breaking point.\nI am not saying I am not going to love it.\n\nI am just saying it has the most difficult task if it wants to conquer my heart.\n\nI left my heart at The Mojave.","October 25, 2015","true","167.5"," 92 of 111 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","92","111","9","13"

I've still yet to play Dead Money (got the endings from the wiki).\n\nI'm also currently replaying Fallout 3. The base game has been finished, and I'm currently trying to explore the entirety of the Capital Wasteland and do the DLCs before I go back over the review.\n\nLike my other reviews, this will be kept simple, with pros+cons, and a small explanation of the game.\n\nDisclaimer: I played Fallout 3 through a CD ROM.\nAnother: While I have 100+ hours on the game, today was the first time I actually did the Battle for Hoover Dam.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is a spin-off in the Fallout franchise, a series of post-apocalyptic RPGs. Using the same engine as Fallout 3, New Vegas was developed by Obsidian, the same company who made games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.\nUnlike Fallout 3, New Vegas takes place in a location not hit by the Great War as much as DC was. The Mojave, which was already a wasteland. Also unlike 3, you don't start out as a Vault Dweller.\nYou start off as The Courier who was sent to deliver the mysterious "The Platinum Chip." (Yes, THE is actually part of its name.) You're intercepted by the Tops chairmen, Benny and two Great Khans, who then shoot you in the head. You're rescued (slowly) by a strange, friendly Securitron named Victor, and sent to Doc Mitchell in Goodsprings, who saves your life. After creating your character, you set out to the Mojave to hunt down Benny, only to be caught up in a full blown war.\n\nThere are of course spoilers ahead.\n\nPros:\n+ A strong lore like the other Fallout games.\n+ Great companions that all have their own story. They all give opinions to the Courier and make comments about the world around them, even a PROBE, who got an ENTIRE DLC involved around him! Except Boone. "MY WIFE IS DEAD"\n+ Characters in quests have better writing and memorability than the ones in 3, The only characters I can remember in 3 are James and Three Dog.\n+ MUCH MORE PLAYER FREEDOM. Fallout 3 had barely any freedom. You HAD to go here, HAD to find your dad, and HAD to side with the Brotherhood of Steel. In NV, you have many more options, including multiple game endings, where you have four choices. NCR, Legion, House, or Independent. Six if you count Dead Money (dying in the vault or siding with Elijah).\n+ Less invisible walls than 3. Still a lot, but they don't block off any paths or anything. Only simple hills and mountains. I'm going to get a lot of backlash for that, but this is from experience.\n+ A great radio and soundtrack.\n+ Graphics are quite decent.\n+ Animations are OK. It's best if you get a mod to improve them.\n+ A large modding community. Not as large as Skyrim's, but still quite large.\n+ Better optimized than 3.\n+ Well designed armors, weapons, and enemies.\n+ Well written storyline. While not as story-rich as Skyrim, it connects with characters more.\n+ The move from Damage Resistance to Damage Threshold was a smart one. Now you won't be shredded by a simple assault rifle while wearing Power Armor.\n\nCons:\n- MULTIPLE bugs and crashes that need to be fixed with mods, and said mods require the DLC. I'm looking at you, Unofficial Patch.\n- Gunplay is... bad.\n- Sometimes you can halt the progress of the entire game by doing a quest wrong.\n- Locations tend to be very bland. In 3 many of the locations were quite unique, like Rivet City.\n- Feels boring at times. In Fallout 3, you had actual random encounters, even if they were just Super Mutants every 200 feet.\n- Game ends completely at Hoover Dam. Unlike Fallout 3, there is no DLC to fix this, but there are mods.\n- Battle for Hoover Dam felt small, BUT it could be because I nuked the entirety of Arizona. I'll change this con when I STOP the nukes in my next playthrough.\n- While there are less than 3, invisible walls. Some of them, while most are in hills and mountains, are in places they shouldn't be, like ridges in places you can go.\n- Not enough redheads. Forgot about that one.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10 AMAZING\nOnce again, I will add onto this as time goes.\nPlease comment on any pro/con you disagree with.","June 26, 2015","true","213.2"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","67","75","15","3"

Before I bought it nobody told me that it crashed so badly and was so glitchy. However, this doesn't make it a bad game -- bear with me. Just, be warned; if you can't stand it crashing frequently, get it for a console instead of PC.\n\nAnyway, I'll start first with the gameplay and summarize it in one word: fantastic. If you played Fallout 3 then you know all of the basics already and you know that these two games are fairly different (mostly in graphics and layout) than the other Fallout games. I adore VATS; where time freezes and it gives you time to aim and get your ♥♥♥♥ together while bombarded with people/things attacking you. Strategy in this game is also great. There will be times you'll have to solve (fairly simple) puzzles, hack terminals and pick locks.\n\nThe story consists on your descisions alone. It all depends on who you choose to side with, kill or become friends with. I won't go too much into this because it's easy to spoil. Just know that there's multiple endings and the replay value to get every ending is time consuming and very fun.\n\nConsidering this is a 2010 game, and the scenery has drastically improved from the other games, the graphics are pretty good. It's not so much as a dead, colorless wasteland like it was in Fallout 3, but a more vibrant and flashy kind of place; like New Vegas but just more sandier. The mechanics are simple and easy to access; there's multiple weapons to choose from whether you be a fan of melee, guns, explosives, stealth, etc. You can do it all.\n\nThe difficulty is selectable and ranges from very easy, easy, normal, hard, very hard and hardcore mode. Most of the time I personally play on normal because it's fairly simple but challenging. The only downside is despite what level you play on, experience doesn't change. If you play on hardcore mode, the differences are drastic though. You have to consume food and water on a regular basis and your followers can actually be killed.\n\nOverall; hell yes I recommend this game, it's my favorite game, and if you ever run out of things to do in the story line there's plenty of DLC that is well worth the money.","January 20, 2014","true","243.3"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","69","78","0","1"

It's just as amazing as Fallout 3, but the game is a bit on the lighter side astmosphere wise. Instead of taking place on the east coast like Fallout 3, This takes place on the west coast and gives the game that more cowboy southern feel to it. I also find the story to be a tad more enjoyable just because it's so different and refreshing from Fallout 3. I'm normally not a fan of shooter games, but Fallout is amazing!

In 7th grade I decided that I should slap my 5th grade self. I bought fallout 3 and it was amazing. Such a rusty, post apocolyptic feel that tells you "hey you're in the future" but the radio and weapons just laugh as it takes you to the past.\n\nNew Vegas I got about the time I beat 3... most people would say its the same game, but my experience with this game was exactly like my experience with Mario 64. I played this game... and played it... and played it on my Xbox 360... ran through about 6 copies of this game, I cannot get enough of this game. It is a masterpiece. Improving a lot of flaws with Fallout 3... like the annoying repair scheme, the annoying ADS. This games DLC is masterly too.

OK\nGameplay:\nAlthough you might argue that the shooting and gameplay in general is the same as fallout 3 (which you should also buy) it does improve over its predesecor like with the all new ironsight, a real one for once.Crafting is generaly the same etc. etc.\n\nQuests:\nThis is where the game really shines, its story and quest will leave you wanting always more and that's a good thing. The characters are way more interesting then in fallout 3, in this game you will want to think twice before killing someone who isn't an enemy and you will always think : was that a good idea? Also the quests are not fetch quest well some of them but not a lot.\n\nFactions:\nIn this you will come across the many factions of the harsh Nevada desert which wil include mad bombers, underground thechnology freaks,the new army of some sorts,a legion of slavers and Mr. House(I can't tell anything about him)\n\nStory:\nYOU are a simple courier... or are you? So, after you ty to deliver a package you get shot in the head... but you live and now you're on a wonderful magical quest to find the sonofab***h who shot you... but that's where our story begin, find out by yourself.\n\nCommunity:\nYou being part of the pc master race CAN and WILL put mods on your game. What are mods you ask well they are content created by users like you yes you and with time and patience you can make some too. But seriously go to the mod nexus, it is amazing what people can do with this game.\n\nDLCs:\nAs I see it, the dlcs( downloadable content) are part of the experience, don't buy the game without them you will miss out on an extrordinary adventure.\nDead Money: The first and best dlc released for New Vegas, I recommend starting it at low level, you might not get the best ending but it's way better that way also play it in the dark, it will be quite an experience.\nHonest Heart:The weak link at least in my opinion, it does have a good story but all in all it was laking something, I don't know what.\nOld World Blues: If you are patient you will enjoy the dialog but if you normaly skip it all you will find this dlc laking, it still as some memorable moments though.\nThe lonesome Road: Arguably one of the best story in video game history, this dlc makes you uncover your origin, do this as your final challenge before the end of the game if you want to enjoy it.\n\nAnd finally\nThe Verdict:\nAs I said before buy itright now, you will not regret it, it doesn't cost much and it will take you more than a few dozens of hours to say: I'm finally done with this.\nI give this game 9.8/10, my favorite video game in the history of gaming.","June 14, 2014","true","310.4"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"

While the vanilla game experience is still good, playing with even simple mods that fix bugs makes the experience so many times more enjoyable, and allows you to tweak the game to your preference.\n\nThis game is very enjoyable and easy for me to lose myself in. I can spend hours just wandering the Nevada wasteland exploring new locations or cutting down enemies. A number of the non-playable characters have interesting, and even sometimes thought-provoking, dialogues that makes doing quests something you actually want to do (besides getting a reward of some sorts).\n\nOf course, this game has its downsides. For starters, the game engine is junk. The game clearly shows its age, so if you're not using mods to make the game look good, don't expect it to look amazing. You can go in any direction you want past the opening sequence of the game, and while I consider this a good thing, those of you who prefer linear games will probably dislike this. The game very strongly suggests the direction you should go in (by following along the main questline), but more experienced players will probably greatly deviate from this.\n\nIf you've never played a Fallout game, what are you waiting for? (Well, I can understand if you're waiting for the next $5 sale, I did that too.) For those of you already familiar with Fallout / The Elder Scrolls, you'll probably enjoy this.","October 11, 2014","true","251.1"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

I'm not the sort of person who plays just one game based on nostalgia. The primary reason for my love for this game is that. like many others in Bethesda's RPG line up, it's pretty much fully customizable with mods. There are mods still being made to this day, and you can make changes to virtually everything in the game world. Modding includes adding custom weapons, clothing, lighting, enemies, creatures, weather effects, custom companions, missions, expanded game areas, sound effects, voice effects, interface, homes, and even to linking fallout 3 to New Vegas (given that you own both games), and that's not even scratching the surface.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suspiciouslemon/recommended/22380/","Suspiciouslemon","Suspiciouslemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suspiciouslemon/","105 products in account","This game is love. Fallout: New Vegas really tells a brilliant story and although you feel at parts like nothing more than a pew pewing machine, other times there are decisions that affect you as a person, and your emotions, be extreme laughter, or sorrow for the smallest of characters. Without a doubt my favorite DLC is Old World Blues, I highly encourage you to buy this along with the game, if not the entire DLC. OWB had me laughing and giggling with each witty remark, and Obsidian do a fantastic job in both this and its other DLC opposite, Dead Money, a horror type DLC which does a good job of making each step you take a worrying and questionable one due to the enemies AI staying stealth and silent untill the last second. Good job Obsidian, I'm sure the replay value for taking sides will keep me going for quite some time!\n\nEdit: The music in this game has become a bliss for me, the music having music from the actual time the game is set in gives a stable feel of authenticity to the game and to its creators. Each time "Big Iron" plays from my Pip-Boy I can't help either go along silently in my head, or even start singing it out loud with broken but well meant notes :)\n\nAnother thing I have to say is something I feel a bit sad about. When I began the game, I had no clue what I was doing and thus, did not like the game at all. I had a friend's strong reccomendation that all would get better and thanks to his reassurance, I've had great fun. So this little note is just to say that you may not fall in love with this game at first, but perseverance makes the game feel like a gift rather than the chore like feel I had at the beginning.","July 30, 2014","true","269.5"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","32","32","0","5"

They tracked the radiation to the vault but since there's tons of undead in it nobody wants to go in.\n-I get my rad suit on for protection, I got stimpacks, some fresh water, some rad-away, some rad-X and so on.\n-I head in and find out that there's a small cave I have to get through first.\n-Then I enter the vault.\n-I find my 1st vault dweller (undead) pretty easy, dead in a few shots of my 9mm machine gun.\n-I take some Rad-X to prevent rad poisoning.\n-And then I find my 1st vault dweller guard.\n-He's much stronger than the 1st, and he gets a lot of good hits on me.\n-I drink some water, and eat some food, it restores my health, but I still needed to use the one super stimpack I had, so now that's gone.\n-I have 10 water, 2 food, 4 stimpacks, and 1 doctors bag at this point.\n-So then I go deeper and deeper in the vault, navigating the maze, all the while my rad points are increasing steadily.\n-I get rad poisoning, I use some rad-away. This happened multiple times until the last time when I ran out of both anti-radiation meds.\n-By now I've explored most of the vault going from terminal to terminal to open door after door.\n-By now I have 5 water, no food, 1 stimpack, and a doctors bag.\n-I find the vault overseer who is the most radiated of the undead and the strongest, he's protected by 2 machine gun turrets.\n-Before fighting him I take out all the nearby undead to avoid them interrupting the fight and catching me off guard.\n-My supplies are: 3 water, no food, no doctors bag\n-I proceed to the overseer's door. My health is VERY low, so I use all 3 of my survival magazines to increase my water's effectivness of healing me, I then proceed to use all the water I have left in order to have the most health possible.\n-My health is now at 85% and I have no healing supplies.\n-I open the door, and the turrets start firing. I sneak in a grenade which takes them out.\n-My companion (A robot named ED-E) charges in and gets some good hits on the overseer, he now has half health, and I still have 85%.\n-He charges and I have no choice but to back away as quickly as possible while shooting a plasma rifle at him.\n-He gets plenty of hits on me lowering me to 5% health.\n-Then I get rad poisoning. And have no way of stopping it.\n-So now my brain FINALLY says "GET THE CRAP OUT!"\n-So I begin to make my way out and actually run into another vault guard, I use a stealth boy in order to avoid detection, and have ED-E take him out.\n-After this happens my health is down to 4%. (Rad poisoning)\n-I proceed to try and find the fastest route out, but since it's a maze down there I end up just wandering aimlessly.\n-Eventually I find the exit to the vault.\n-My health is at 1%.\n-And then I hear a vault dweller directly behind me.\n-ED-E takes him out and by some INSANE luck, I level up.\n-Now leveling up does not restore health in Fallout. It just lets you increase your stats. So I'm not too excited.\n-But then it turns out it was an even number I leveled up to, which means I get a new perk.\n-One of the perks that I can unlock at level 12 (Which is what I leveled up to) is one that allows me to increase my max health by 50 more points.\n-And so I use it, make it out of the cave, fast travel to a doctor, and fix the rest.\n\n10/10 would panic insanely again.","January 29","true","24.7"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","34","36","15","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/22380/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Fallout: New Vegas is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played.\n\nI'm not going to pretend i'm not a fanboy as I write this, because I am. I have always been deeply in love with the Fallout series since the first game and I am happy to say it's one series that seems to have only gotten better.\n\nI'll start by saying I own this game both on Console and on PC and i've completed the game on both. Though, with Fallout 'completed the game' is a very loose term, I use it to mean finished the main story mission line.\nFallout is one of those games that allows you to play how you want, and punishes you accordingly. If you want to be 'evil' then you can, but don't expect to find allies amongst those who want to protect, and if you want to be 'good' then the same applies, but don't expect the Legion to want to help you.\nMy favourite thing about this game is the freedom to play it at your own pace. There is the main story mission which you can follow and most likely complete the game in a few hours, but there are also hundreds of sidequests, areas to explore, people to help and companions to find.\nMy Steam shows that i've played 79 hours and i'm nowhere close to having completed every side quest or exploring every location and in those 79 hours I don't think I've ever felt bored.\n\nThe morality in this game is another standout feature that I loved. Many games have a good/bad element to it, but I felt in Fallout: New Vegas your actions and choices really do have an impact. I find that there are so many games now that give you choices but they never really affect your gameplay. Fallout: New Vegas isn't one of those. Maybe like me you'll start to question if what seemed to be 100% right at the start, really is the right thing.\n\nFallout does have it flaws though, like most Bethesda games, and they don't intend to fix them. You will most likely find quests glitching out here and there and the game crashing as and when it feels like it. Saving often can massively help, and keeping a Fallout Wiki open in the background to check if the quest you're on has any known glitches is something i'd recommend. There's also the massive issue of killing someone (by mistake or purposely for whatever reason) and finding out 20 hours in they were part of a quest and that quest is either failed, or you have to select an ending you wouldn't have wanted. The frustration of losing an hours worth of gameplay because I forgot to save it has been the reason many times that i've stopped playing, but I always pick it up and play again sooner or later.\n\nYou can't really go wrong with an open-world rpg survival style game with leveling, perks, companions and over 50 hours gameplay.\nThe game is worth every penny and more in my opinion, and even if you don't have the £14.99 to spend now, when it goes on offer grab it. You won't regret it.","May 19, 2014","true","80.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaxter/recommended/22380/","elaxter","elaxter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaxter/","76 products in account","SUMMARY\nObsidian's Fallout: New Vegas is the last good Fallout game. It features everything good out of Fallout 3, features superior writing, and a generally better feel.\n\nREVIEW\nFallout: New Vegas. Otherwise known as "Fallout 3 that should have been".\n\nImagine Fallout 3 but with more meat. A lot more meat. I mean a mega-ton more meat. That's New Vegas. Basically, New Vegas features better writing, better plot, more story, better pacing, more interesting side quests, more weapons, more interesting perks, the re-introduction of traits, interesting factions, and interesting locations.\n\nNew Vegas manages to revive the feel of the classic Fallout games by including fun, interesting characters, grimy locales, and choice with consequences. In the first few moments of the game, you are given a number of choices that can influence how the rest of the introduction will play out. For example, the starting town of Goodsprings is facing a problem with a gang known locally as the Powder Gangers - merciless thugs that use a lot of dynamite. You essentially have four choices: help Goodsprings, help the Powder Gangers, help no one, or kill everyone. But it's not so straight forwards, as there are subtle ways to complete the quest without following the most obvious - being to complete all the objectives. I'll leave the rest for you to find!\n\nThe visuals are improved only slightly from the previous installment, but they get the job done and can be easily improved using an ENB filter. The basic gameplay mechanics are the same, but there are some improvements here and there. The game shines with its writing, proving that Fallout isn't about the guns and loot as much as the story and characters.\n\nNew Vegas is known for its large modding community, and it has more files on Nexus Mods than Fallout 3. They range from small tweaks,  as in the popular "New Vegas Anti Crash," or as expansive as Project Nevada - which changes the fundamental gameplay of New Vegas, adds new weapons and armors that are well balanced, adds neat visual effects, overhauls the stealth mechanic, and more. If you are a returning player of New Vegas and haven't played in a while but are still looking for an interesting and immersive experience, I recommend these following mods:\n\n- Project Nevada\n- Enhanced Camera Mod: makes third person animations visable in first person (check the ini!)\n- Nevada Skies: adds new weather affects, like rain and sandstorms. Works well with Interior Lighting Overhaul which changes the mood of all rooms in New Vegas to be more realistic.\n- All of Vegas Uncut, especially Freeside Open and the Strip Open.\n- Enemy AI - Tactics - NPC Healing: just generally makes the AI better and more interesting, plus optional AI healing.\n- EVE: New effects for explosives and energy weapons\n- MTUI and oHUD: MTUI is just a more PC friendly hud set up, with small fonts, more room in menus, etc. oHUD is a suite that includes imersive HUD options, (HUD disappears after a moment) adjustable HUD options, and extra HUD options (hardcore needs, clock, etc.)\n- WMX: Adds a bunch of new, balanced weapon mods.\n- Classic Dialogue Options: Doesn't tell you when you have a skill check in dialogue. For immersion, etc.\n- Enhanced Blood Textures: Generally better and meatier looking blood.\n- Pipboy 2500 mod: it's not a big, ugly Pipboy, neither a gay readius\n- Flashlight NVSE: adds a host of different flashlights, for when Nevada Skies nights are scaring you away\n- Fallout 4 Quickloot: The only good thing to come out of Fallout 4.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhere Fallout 4 failed miserablely to capture the intangible essence of Fallout, the folks over at Obsidian managed to craft a fantastic Fallout game that is worthy of being placed alongside the classics.","April 14","true","132.3"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","36","42","6","1"

It has a great atmosphere,quests,and locations. The modding for the game is top. I reccomend this for anyone that liked Fallout 3(and all who dont need dragons or orcs and elves in a rpg xD)\n\nThe Fallout series takes place after a nuclear war and the U.S. is desecrated, a shell of its former glory. Humanity emerges from the tragedy as selfish and power-hungry as ever. Despite the bombardment of numerous nukes, the city of Vegas managed to survive the war mostly untouched. In the aftermath, a group of people formed touting the values of the old governmental system and called themselves the New California Republic, or NCR. Thanks to the Hoover Dam, the NCR and citizens of New Vegas have access to clean water and power, something most areas lack. At odds with the NCR is the Legion, a dictatorship lead by a man who renamed himself Caesar. Based on the Roman methodology of conquering other civilizations, the Legion absorbs nearby tribes and enslaves a portion of their population. The NCR and Caesar's Legion butt heads over control of the area, and tensions are high.\n\nDeception, cannibalism, space travel and drug use are all themes, really crazy sometimes :)\n\n\n\n\n\nbackstep-crit-boooom      :-O","June 4, 2014","true","157.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/recommended/22380/","ayres662","Bloody George","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayres662/","350 products in account","Never would one imagine that one would find so much to do in such a grand role-playing world. If I were to define New Vegas in a brief sentence, that would be my definitive statement. The extent to which this game has changed me whenever I replay it is incalculable. So much so that it is a difficult task to enumerate its many virtues. I will try to stick to vital values.\n\nFirstly, this is a game that adapts itself to several gameplay tastes. Whether one wishes to play it casually, attentive to storytelling elements and lore progression, or whether one would rather feel the potential for post-apocalyptic survival that it presents, New Vegas is there to provide it. Explore the numerous side-quests or discover how influential and emblematic each of the four main-quest personalities of the game (Yes-Man, Caesar, Mr. House, General Oliver and his entourage) can be. There is never a shortage of in-game mythos prone to in-depth unearthing by the player should they be interested enough. On the other hand, the game is so self-sufficient and self-explanatory as to not demand any background knowledge should the player choose to ignore Falloutian lore. And all that wholeness executed in perplexing 18 months by the careful minds at Obsidian.\n\nNew Vegas steps into the chaotic territories of mechanic bugginess from the infamous Gamebryo/Havok combination, but manages to keep major nuisances at bay. I have never experienced a single game-breaking bug or glitch, only the minor and even amusing stuff. And although the mechanics was already dated when it was released (late 2010), New Vegas feels like a fresh journey with its simple but timely additions - among them I can bring up the Companion Wheel, shooting downrange, and the addition of a hotkey to switch between ammo types; not to mention the precise crafting system and the hardcore gameplay option.\n\nCharacters are as close to perfection as you can get with an RPG. Brilliant voice-acting, immense sense of uniqueness in each of the relevant characters, and an actually solid story given to each and every one of the player's companions. This is the good old Fallout 2 companion system that we are discussing here, only improved. A set of quests intertwined with the main conflicts shall give the player valuable support for the entirety of the game's mythos, as almost every companion has a history with the Mojave to be scrutinised. The emotions enticed by such quests can vary greatly, and only serve to reiterate Obsidian's sharpness in delivering an authentic, almost flawless rendering of branching storyline in an electronic RPG. And these are just side-quests. I am not even going to discuss the merits of the game's intricate main storyline, as I leave it up to anybody thinking of buying this title and playing it for their first time.\n\nWilling to abandon your real-world anxieties for valuable moments of embedding yourself with an immersive post-apocalyptic experience? Investigate or intimidate, persuade or kill, hide or bring mayhem about, survive or secure your niche, craft or buy from merchants. New Vegas gives you all said options to prosper and unveil its stories. The Mojave awaits, and it will reveal a thousand mysteries as long as one is willing to travel extensively across its horrifying deserts. Those points and several others are some of the reasons why this is one of the most impressive videogaming enterprises I have ever witnessed.","December 22, 2014","true","445.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","2"

You can have optional FPS Shooter elements with Project nevada. Dynamic Crosshair, Bullet-time, Peripheral vision etc, fully customizable you can enable or disable them at any time. Also to mention Cybernetic implants which give the player extra perks.\n\nTrue leaning, by XilandoEssential if you are going to Install Project Nevada, or Stealth. A very simple mod which allows you to peek from corners. Thats about it.\n\nNMC Texture PackThe game is a little old, but NMCTP revitilazes the game giving more realistic and detailed textures. Will consume extra space on your HD but worth it definetely.\n\nBottle that WaterIt's odd that Obsidian devs missed such feature, by default you don't have the possibility to refill water from lakes, pumps or fountains. But thanks to the modding community now you can.\n\nThe mods I recommend going on and on, there are definetely more essential mods but I wrote the most important.\nLook from my personall mods installed here:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Xixo1zb.png\n\n\nI Bought Fallout New Vegas on Autumn Sale 2014, Invested many hours playing even after finishing the game I feel like playing it all over again. I upgraded it to Ultimate Edition on winter sale 2014, to get all the DLC's to increase the playability of the game. It's basically enormous game, and the time you  can spend on it.\n\nLet's also mention the ridicilous modding potential, if it happens to beat the game with all 4 "factions" and finishing the DLC, you can either turn the game into a complete sandbox, give it some bounty hunting mode or user-created quests.","January 8, 2015","true","194.6"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","2"

Much like its predecessor, the game features a desert, gangsters, casinos, guns, surprisingly good role-playing. The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland � a pretty much lifeless, HUGE and twice as many locations as F03.  It's a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse.\nNew Vegas does have a few technical issues. Overall, the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional RPG where you explore the main quest, which, depending on your choices, will send you to a variety of locations. New Vegas is a huge game. I can probably write another 6 pages examining New Vegas's various aspects but i'd rather play more. This game is only improved upon with the INSANELY TALENTED modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones Obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour, weapons, the re-texture's and mods that increase the difficulty of the Mojave.\n\nWithout a doubt a MUST OWN! even without mods and any DLC its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money.","October 20, 2014","true","119.7"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","0"

Fallout New Vegas, like its predecessors, inherits lot of its series strong points, the most important thing is that your choice matters. The game is set upon the ruins of Nevada after the Great War, which includes the "city" of Las Vegas and its surroundings, such as Primm, Goodsprings, and Freeside. Like in RPG games, you can interact with a ton of characters, you could speak, trade, or get mission from them. The combat in the game is similar to FPS, which means just point your gun and shoot, but also added with a special mechanic that allow you to stop time for a while and fire more accurately.\n\nThe Good of the GameOpen World. No borders.\nSince the beginning of the game, you can go whenever you wanted. You heard from the NPCs that the Quarry Junction is filled with deadly deadclaws, which are high-level encounters. You still want to go there? No problem. Do you want to skip early mission and head straight into New Vegas? No problem. You wanted to use that beautiful gun? No problems, there are no level requirement, just some stats requirement (for example : You need a high skill in Guns before you can use a Marksman Rifle).\n\nYou can interact with many people.\nEvery people have their own schedule, so you won't find a single person at the same location every time. At night they usually goes asleep at their own home. Some may visit other people, some may visit casinos, but no one will just stand and waiting for you to talk to them. You can kill people, enslave people (mods required), pickpocket them, puts grenade in their pants, etc. Some of them have interesting personalities, in fact most of the personalities you would find in Fallout New Vegas are on the colorful side, instead of the "Regular Joe" personalities. Like what a character in the game said : "If someone is too clean, you can bet he/she has hidden a terrible secret."\n\nGreat DLCs\nFallout New Vegas does not have DLCs that only add 1-2 weapons, but they add DLCs that gives a new area to play, even some DLCs have different way to play. At Honest Hearts DLC, you are living with the tribes near Grand Canyon, thus you must rely on traditional medicine instead of your regular stimpak. At Dead Money, you are forced to be more resourceful and careful. And so on and so on.\n\nBetter companion system that the previous game.\nInteractions with companions is now done using companion wheel, so you can order them around without the trouble of going to their dialog choices one by one. On the other hand, you companions also have a lot of interesting backstories attached to them.\n\nFaction system\nThere are lots of faction vying for power in New Vegas. If you kill faction A members, expect them to came to you and try to kill you. If you help faction B members, expect them to give you something or help you.\n\nWeapon modding\nA new feature in FNV, that allows weapons to be added with mods, such as scopes, silencers, cooling system, etc. A small but great addition to the game.\n\nInteresting world\nThe world is interesting. The game is interesting. The world is interesting. The story, mission, backstories, they are all interesting. Interesting means that they evoke a sense of "need to see the end" of the story, so you don't get bored. The details of this game is also big, there are lots of terminals and logs scattered around places that gives rich backstory to the game.\n\nMod support\nEnough said. With mod support, there are lots of changes in the game. There are mods that makes the game more realistic, whether in the gameplay, lighting, or the weather. Some mods add weapons, armors, and other stuff to the game. Some even add areas outside the game world for more gaming hours. Mods are what Fallout New Vegas are still played today.\n\nThe Bad of the GameBugs\nLike your regular Bethesda game, there are some bugs. Some doors fail to open, some achievements fail to register, some quests do not work, but mostly it is a minor issue. Being a PC master race, usually a simple console commands will fix the bug too. Bear in mind that the game is very stable, but using mods may creates instability, though it adds lots of fun.\n\nCompanion mission\nWhile companion mission are great backstories and great stories themselves, to trigger them it is fairly difficult. Without guides, sometime we can only walk in the dark. Even more, some companions "trigger" will only trigger once (for example : when meeting a person for the first time) thus by just playing you could miss your companion mission and it have detrimental effect in the ending.\n\nVerdictA definite buy this game. Don't buy Fallout 4 yet, but buy this one and Fallout 3. Both are great games.","June 25, 2015","true","81.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","27","30","3","1"

The reason ... the freedom. Sure you could say it’s for the graphics (not), or the amazing story line, or even the gameplay. No, the freedom the game offers you is amazing. You start of a guy/or gal, woken up from a shot to the head that should have killed you. Although some information was given about the person you choose to play as, I would have liked to seen more from the game. From the start you are given various options as to how you want yourself to be represented. As a hero, or an anarchist. Aside from the freedom you also get lovable characters and their factions, the decisions you make, and locations you venture off to that you   WILL remember. Graphic wise, the game isn't strong. The animations aren’t either. But you know what who cares, oh you do? MODS!!! The modding community of this game is huge, however it has  gotten smaller but sure as hell isn’t dead. The community is still alive and still pumping those sweet, juicy, hot mods you want. The mods include many things like : texture packs, weapons, or weapon mods; quest, npc's, and a whole lot more. Don’t like the mods the community has to offer? Make your own! The game does have a creation kit,yes it is confusing, but with a little practice you’ll be making mods better than a lot of the stuff on the sites. Sure the game isn’t perfect but you can make as good or as horrible as you like depending on what you do in the game or what you do to the actual game.","October 12, 2014","true","542.4"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpheitman/recommended/22380/","jpheitman","HeitMachine92","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpheitman/","162 products in account","There are lots of people who say that Fallout 3 is better than Fallout: New Vegas because Fallout 3 has better dialogue, or more interesting characters, or makes you care more about the world than New Vegas does.\n\nThose people are lying.\n\nLet's start with the obvious one: The world. In Fallout 3, you basically have a choice of being a good guy or being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag, but no matter what, you are railroaded into following the main quest line, which is to grow up in the vault, leave to chase after your father, join up with the Brotherhood of Steel, and fulfill your parents' dream of a wasteland filled with life. The only difference between a "good" and "evil" main quest completion is which of two options you pick at the very end, either putting a modified FEV strain into the water supply to kill off "unfit humans," becoming a eugenicist in the process, or not doing that. That's it. A "Do you want to be evil? Y/N" dialogue box at the very end of the main quest is NOT GOOD DESIGN. Even worse, picking one choice or the other doesn't actually change anything after you complete the main quest.\n\nIn New Vegas, by contrast, you have four different ways to finish the main quest line, and you're locked into picking one when you're still a few quests away from the climactic ending. Once you've firmly sided with one faction, the others  will shun you, and even attack you if you're particularly mean to them. The fate of the Mojave wasteland is real and dynamic, and you get to shape it to your will far more than you can the Capitol wasteland.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the fact that it takes a solid ten minutes in Vault 101 before you're let out into the world, while you only need about sixty seconds of listening to Michael Hogan before you can start roaming in New Vegas. The tutorial in NV is more organic than F3, and completely optional.\n\n\nWhat about the mechanics? Well, F:NV has everything F3 does, PLUS a fully-flushed crafting system (Fallout 3 let you make 10 marginally useful items from blueprints; New Vegas has dozens, maybe hundreds, of craftable items) that includes campfire remedies, reconstruction and recalibration of bullets, improvised ammo, natural poisons, and lots more; the ability to AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS (I didn't remember how much I valued that until I picked up Fallout 3 again); a higher level cap and more - and more specialized - perks (lots of Fallout 3's were just "Add 5 points to this attribute and 5 to that one!" Boring.); the need to choose two handicaps at the start of the game to make each playthrough pose its own challenges; faction disguises; a hardcore mode; decreased effectiveness of V.A.T.S. to make the choice of whether to use it or not meaningful (in Fallout 3 you could just spam Jet with Grim Reaper and mow down tons of foes without thinking; NV makes you play more tactically); and lots of other things I've mostly forgot about. From a mechanics perspective, then, Fallout: New Vegas does beat Fallout 3.\n\n\nWhat about characterization? Lots of people have said that they just didn't care about the characters in Fallout: New Vegas the way they did the characters in Fallout 3. I can only conclude they didn't get exposed to any video game characters before playing Fallout 3, because New Vegas' characters are definitely more flushed out. Companions are the best example of this: In Fallout 3, your companions have the personality of two lines in a speech bubble stapled to a cardboard cutout with a crayon smiley-face drawn on. There are no real differences between the companions: They simply run around, shoot whatever weapon you give them, and have a few generic lines of dialogue. In New Vegas, however, each character starts out holding a part of their personality back from you - you know, like people in real life. They have personal motivations, and will leave you if you do something they don't like (for example, retired NCR ranger Boone will leave if you start hurting NCR people, Cass will leave if you have very low Karma, etc.). If you do things they like while they're travelling with you (for example, if you have Chuck Bartow- I mean, Arcade Gannon in your party when you direct HELIOS One's power to Freeside and Westside), you will eventually trigger more dialogue options where they tell you more about their past - because they trust you - and, depending on how you respond, you can trigger a quest that has them confront their past, the choices they've made, and what their future holds. You, as their friend, have some influence based on your dialogue options, and that impacts the way these characters will act in the future.\n\nThis is the epitome of characterization in video games. That is about as close to "how people work" that we're going to get in an open-world post-apocalyptic RPG, and I love it.\n\n\nI'm not going to bother getting into nitpicky things like weapons, armor, buff items, etc. It's a sequel, so of course there's an improvement in the variety of items. That's to be expected.\n\n\nIn short, the worst Fallout: New Vegas can be accused of is "not improving on Fallout 3 enough." Fallout 3 is better from a "Narrative storytelling" perspective - the narrator, of course, being Liam Neeson - but Fallout: New Vegas is a game where *you* choose who you are - which is the crux of an RPG, a Fallout game in particular. I recommend you get both this and Fallout 3, but if you *have* to pick just one, New Vegas is the better option.\n\n-Heit","June 5, 2015","true","120.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","28","33","3","2"

The atmosphere, the weapons, the lore, the NPCs... all of this make it my favourite game.\n\nInstead of having the focus on your character's story like in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas puts mostly the focus on the background of those places : the war between the NCR and the Legion. This background is so well-introduced and so well-placed, when I met Mr. House for the first time I felt like it was a movie (a true icone of the game). Thanks to this, you feel like a part of the Mojave and not just playing an RPG game.\n\nAbout the gameplay, the new crafting seems a bit too complicated and unworthy to be really used, but the addons on weapons are really nice to get. Also the survival mode makes the game a great experience. Like in FO3, the locations are well detailled, and even if they don't have a reason to be visited through some quests, you'll end up doing it just to find the funny easter eggs.\n\nFinally about the RPG part, you'll really feel like your actions have influence on the world and also how the world will react to you. You have a karma with each faction, and each one will change your own story in the Mojave.\n","May 9","true","220.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart.

Tricked. Betrayed by the man. But you wake up from the grave with a mighty lust for revenge and nothing is going to stop you.\n\nThats how i felt when I first started playing New Vegas. I think it has one of the most amazing beginnings of any game, because you just feel that you have the get back at the man who shoots you in the opening cutscene. A lot of people have spoken in a negative way about how the game isn't open from the start, and while I partly agree with that, I don't think it matters that much becuse starting your journey towards the strip is just so engaging.\n\nLike any other game from the fallout franshice the experience is what you make of it. If you just use the first gun you find, only follow the main storyline and don't talk to people and explore, you're probably not going to get that much out of the game, althoug it is certenly playabe that way.\nTo get the most out of this game, you have to immerse yourself in your character that you can basically make your own in most ways; from what faction you are going to side with, handling delicate situuations peacfully with you charm or going in guns blazing killing everything is sight, how you are going to look and act during dialouges.\n\nThe game is however full of bugs (and not just the giant insects trying to kill you). Some of it can be excused due to it being such a large world with so much to do, but it can be annoying at times when the game freezes, some character interactions being buggy and objects glitching out.\n\nBut most bugs can be fixed throug unofficial patches since fallout probably has one of the largest modding comunities. This also means you can add endless amounts of content to game already filled to the brim with it.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is a great addition to the already fantastic fallout series, fixing alot of the problems people had with Fallout 3, like like the iron sight. It aslo contains probably my favourite storyline in the series so far, with gambling, gangs and a big battle.\n\n8/10\n\nFeel free to check out my other reviews.","November 26, 2013","true","113.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

Ladies an gentlemen, welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.\n\nNow I'll be comparing this masterpiece to both FO3 and FO4:\nNew Vegas is set much closer to the original Fallout games, on the west coast, where super mutants don't exist everywhere for shooting things reasons, there are no colapsed buildings to force you to go around or use console comadns( that annoyed me so much the only way I was traveling the DC ruins was using tcl).There are no enemies named 'raider', the 'raiders' are part of different gangs. There are FACTIONS, something thatwas missing in FO3, and they don't shoot at you for gameplay reasons. In case you haven't figured it out I'm talking about the Enclave, who even if you side with them still try to kill you just so you have something to shoot at that shoots back at you. Speaking of the Enclave WTF are they doing on the east coast in DC? I tought they blew upp at the oil rig back in FO2. You can still find remnants of the Enclave scattered across the Mojave, and they are well aware thet the Enclave blew up at the oil rig, one of them can be your companion. Companoins who won't hate you because you want to make money. Oh, and inn this game you aren't a concerned middle-aged white parent, or a 19 years-old daddy's boy, no, you are a... mailman. The Mailman. Who has more than 4 answers to a question. In FO4 you had 4 options:\n1) Yes(I'll help you)\n2)A question that lead to the other options\n3) Sarcastic( make a bad joke that will make the player feel embarased they chise it and help him)\n4) I don't care about you but my character and quest  marker does so I'll help you anyway kind of option that will make your companion hate you\nIn New Vegas you can talk your way out of most situations with a SKILL check, and not having to quicksave before you choose something in case you have 10+ Charisma but you still fail. Also this CHR checks are not color coded for people with low INT(see what I did there) who can't read numbers. Also in FO4 INT no longer affects your speech, because they could't record so many lines. Take this for example:\nFallout 4\nWhen you meet Kellogg, no matter what you say( all options indicating that you are a middle-aged concerned white parent) your options are:\nI'll kill you\nI'll make you suffer\nI'll make you pay\nA bad joke about killing him again in hell or something like that\nYou can't convince him to leave, either by a speech check or by having low INT, You can't side with him, BUT you can shoot him, because this what FO4 is all about: shooting things and being a middle-agedg concerned white parent\nIn FNV\nWhen you talk to the Legate you can tell him to f*ck off, you can convince him to fight you 1v1 with a karma check(karma no longer being in FO4)\n\nOR\n\nWhen you meet with Benny you can just kill him, have sex with and kill him in his sleep, let him escape and tell him to let you live etc.\nAlso New Vegas includes dark humor, not bad and embarasing jokes that only a middle-aged concerned white parent would say. In FNV you have no family, no friends, it's just you, the Mailman. And that makes you feel like an adult making your own choices that affect the game.\n\nThe 4 main factions are: Mr House, The NCR, the Legion and Yes Man's independent New Vegas. When you finish a faction's quest you don't get the same end mission( yeah,you have to face Lanius, but under different circumstaces) like you do in FO4. Also, some may disagree, but its better if the game doesn't allow to play after the main quest because if you sided with let's say the NCR, you've probably done all of their quests before the second battle for Hoover Dam. If you would still be ablle to play, there'd be no legion, no Mr House so it's better if the game ends with the main quest. Also this game includes gambliing, just like FO3 and FO4, but unlike FO3 and FO4 it's gambling with chips and money and all that, not your skills and dialog options.\nThere are also plenty of smaller factions such as the Great Khans, The BoS, who can either help or work against in the second battle for Hoover Dam.\nTake this for example: Colonel Moore from the NCRasks you to(spoilers) deal with the BoS. You can initiate the self destruct sequence, just kill them of sign a truce between the NCR and the BoS. Each of these options will give you a diffferent end slide, and the Courier can decide if the choice was either good or bad. You can play as a saint or thedevil's right hans if you want, you don't have to be the Wasteland's hero. FO4 wants you play as a good guy, but it doesn't really let you help people. In FNV you can really help people if you want to, like helping people in Freeside kick their habbits, not making you build houses like a minecraft ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 'settlers'  who are never happy. There are plenty of houses in Boston, you don't need more.","April 17","true","226.4"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","0"

Hmm, ok, the main story of New Vegas: VERRRRY well written! An almost perfect balance of difficulty, questlining, exploration and cast of colourful characters. An awesome 4 different endings for the final Hoover Dam battle, deciding the ultimate fate of the Mojave forever. Plenty of side and faction quests to keep you occupied for an easy 100+ for completionists.\n\nThe factions are very cool, with some very interesting backstories, e.g. how the NCR are the re-construction of the democratic world, or how the Legion are basing themselves on the success of Pre-War Rome. Definitely adds to the throwback of the Pre-War era.\n\nOk onto the DLC's:\n\nLonesome Road: Ok Lonesome Road has got to be my favourite DLC by far. The amazing and yet emotional story of the true destruction of human nature, The Divide. The hellish nightmare you'd think most of the Fallout world would truly be. With plenty of secret US Govt. bases and awesome prototype laser weapons including Red Rocket. A heartwarming and cold-blooded ending with the tale encrypted into ED-E, and an epic finale showdown in an OPERATIONAL Nuclear Missile Silo, with the option to change all Faction relations in the Mojave with the option to Nuke NCR or Legion... or BOTH! 10/10 would replay many times!\n\nOld World Blues: This was an interesting DLC. Travelling to an old Pre-War Area51-esque science base called Big MT, having your Spine, Brain and Heart removed for robot parts, and then quest to overthrow the facility and track down your old brain in a very epic confrontation. Definitely will recommend this DLC to anyone. 10/10\n\nDead Money: Ok, so Dead Money. This DLC has a unique and interesting storyline, of a super luxurious casino opened on the day of the Great War bombings in 2077. Having never opened, and left sealed in a cloud of toxic dust, it has been haunted by the ghosts and holograms left to rot. I liked the story of the Greatest Heist of the Century. Howecer, the downside to this DLC is the unbelievable difficulty. It took me as a Lvl50 character, 9 hours and about 12 deaths later to beat it. Its a good DLC, but needs to be nerfed in Difficulty ALOT! 6/10\n\nHonest Hearts: Honest Hearts was the kind of DLC made specifically for the more strategic and cartegoraphical advanced player. Not an easy terrain to navigate in the Utah badlands, but a very cool Native American-esque story with many tribes scared of Pre-War structures, living the old native way, under threat for warmonger tribe White Legs. And a heartwarming story to decide the fate to Fight or Run to save the Sorrows and Dead Horses. And a very confronting meet with The Burned Man himself.... 9/10","October 3, 2014","true","84.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

Fallout has always been about the world that was burned away as much as it is about the world that rose from its ashes, and Obsidian never forgets this. Dark humour abounds, twinged with a kind of sadness, but also with profound musings on what it is to be human, what it means to lose your history and culture, and how we might replace these things among the ruins of the civilisation of yesteryear.\n\nA fantastic job is done of resisting painting the franchise's various factions as simply "goodies and baddies", giving you the freedom to decide the fate of the Mojave without feeling like you have been pidgeon-holed down clear-cut, simplified endings. The game refrains from judging the player's morality in a refreshing way, staying true to a core tenet of Fallout: morality is a flexible thing that can mean many things in the Wasteland.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this is a game totally unafraid to bar you from embarking on certain quests as a result of your actions, and I must insist that if you play it, you fully embrace it. It's not about seeing it all, it's about the tailored story unique to your character that came about by reacting intelligently to how you played, and letting the chips fall where they may. In my most recent playthrough I played as an Enclave fanatic, and this roleplaying decision governed all of my choices - what weaponry and armour I wore, how I interacted with others, the factions I chose to support and attack. It couldn't have been a more different playthrough than my first, where I decided to be chummy with the New California Republic. It is hard to describe the satisfaction to be had when a game reacts so capably to your decision-making. Few games have done it as well as here.\n\nCompanions are memorable and have side-quests which open up their characterisation and make you feel attached. Locations are iconic, ranging from the debauched New Vegas Strip to the sun-baked settlements that surround it.\n\nThe DLC is, frankly, unmissable, chronicling an excellent story thread which is interwoven in each piece of DLC despite them at first glance appearing to be thematically unrelated. It's important to play them in order of release for the full effect.\n\nFallout 3 was an amazing RPG, but New Vegas reminded me why exactly I had loved Fallout so much in the first place. Closer to Fallout 1 and 2 in tone and RPG design, New Vegas leaves huge boots to fill for Bethesda's Fallout 4.\n\nNew Vegas honestly remains one of the best games of its generation.","July 16, 2015","true","197.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yupitsken/recommended/22380/","yupitsken","ken503b","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yupitsken/","34 products in account","I remember waiting anxiously for Fallout: 3 to finally arrive. I had played and loved Fallout and Fallout 2. I had waited for  years, and could barely contain my excitement for a modern Fallout title to be released. I have no shame admitting that I enjoyed playing the game immensely. However, I always felt that it just had the Fallout name slapped onto a post-apocalyptic RPG, with a few Fallout-esque elements thrown in to loosely tie it to the previous titles. While the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the DC ruins was incredible, It didn't follow in the intellectual footsteps of the previous games in the Fallout lineage, nor did it maintain the same feel.\n\nWhen Fallout: New Vegas arrived, I was completely blown away. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The setting in the American Southwest maintained the atmosphere of the original titles.  The faction system allowed for alliances to be forged within the Mojave Wasteland, but like the real world, denied you the possibility of making everyone happy. While I believe there was a mistake in maintaining the clunky Karma system of FO:3, I felt your choices within the game were more morally grey, more reflective of the world wherein there are actions and consequences rather than an arbitrary definition of good and evil. The major NPCs have excellent dialog and some of the most compelling back stories in gaming. The base game is good in and of itself, but the DLC add dimensions that are unparalleled in any of the previous Fallout games and the modding community has produced many excellent add-ons which enhance the gameplay and appearance far beyond the vanilla offering.\n\nI have devoted more hours to this game than any rational adult should. It is by far my favorite game of all time.","September 24, 2014","true","725.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It fixes almost everything that Bethesda flopped with in the original (DT is better than DR, the locales are pretty believable, dialogue checks are guaranteed with proper skills), and it just feels like what Fallout should have been with the transition. There's no level scaling, so there are some locations that are probably a bit too difficult until you reach a certain level, and it doesn't feel like an empty land to explore. There's vegetation and people trying to go about and make the world seem as if it's trying to repair itself 200+ years after The Great War rather than the DREARY POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND THAT STILL SOMEHOW HAD FOOD IN GROCERY STORES. Good character writing, quirky but not too far out there, and factions are well done. Karma system still sucks but is essentially irrelevant.\n\nAlso, unlike FO3, there are actually 200+ endings in New Vegas. Just play this buggy mess instead of Fallout 3/4, because Bethesda needs to know that they suck at Fallout, and it's a shame that we might not see Obsidian take another jab at it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppytippers/recommended/22380/","toppytippers","Monsoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppytippers/","149 products in account","Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. Thankfully Fallout: New Vegas was developed under Obsidian Entertainment, a smaller company known mainly for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. The project leader was Joshua Sawyer, the same person in charge of the original Fallout 3 that was cancelled after financial troubles with the developer’s parent company. Fallout: New Vegas serves as a “return to form” for the Fallout series, bring it back to its roots in exploring the ethics of a post-apocalyptic world, not exploring the world itself.\n\nReturning to Western USA, New Vegas is set in the Mojave Wasteland, directly adapted from the real world Mojave desert. Being a western the art direction of the game has changed from Fallout 3 but it should look familiar. The horrible green tint has been replaced by a much more subtle (yet still a bit annoying) orange tint, Buildings a much more suited to the environment (with much more varied interiors) and a good portion of the game world is actual desert. Despite being set on a desert, the sheer amount of content in New Vegas is densely packed in a logically designed world that is easy to navigate without a map, thanks to cleverly located landmarks. Gone are the days of trying to distinguish between this pile and rubble and that pile of rubble. The Mojave also features a number of areas that are very dangerous to lower level players, while level scaling does exist, it only ensures that enemies aren’t just cannon fodder at later levels.\n\nMoving from Fallout 3 to New Vegas won’t feel too different gameplay wise. While the two are very similar, New Vegas is improved in every way. Iron sights have been added to make first person shooting a viable tactic, VATS has been reworked to be less unfair for enemies, Guns skill no longer increases bullet damage, etc. Character creation has had a few smaller changes but the ways your point allocation works in the world has been greatly improved. Perks are only gained once per two levels making you still human by level 30. Traits make a welcome comeback from Fallout and Fallout 2 where you can choose a nice little perk but at the cost of something else. Fallout: New Vegas allows great flexibility in what kind of character you want to play as, and all character build are perfectly viable. Want to be a gunslinger who kills and instils fear in all who oppose him? Go Ahead. Want to be a pacifist? Using your words to solve issues? Sure, New Vegas allows you to. Being able to shape the game, rather than just play it, is what makes Fallout: New Vegas stand out among modern RPGs. It’s surprising how not many Role Playing Games actually let you Role Play. While at launch the game was buggy beyond being playable, the game has been shaped by developers post launch to be the most stable Gamebryo game in existence, not a hard title to achieve but a good one nonetheless.\n\nYou play as “The Courier” and while delivering a small package to the New Vegas Strip, you are ambushed and end up in a shallow grave. Miraculously you survive the encounter and begin your quest to retrieve the mysterious package. A common misconception with Act I of the story is that it's just a western tale of revenge. The reality is that the story is about the package you were meant to deliver and using it to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland and its inhabitants.\n\nThe two main factions, the New California Republic and Caesar’s Legion are battling for control of Hoover dam and the conflict between the two is apparent throughout the whole game, and by the time you finish Act I you should be near a decision on who you want to side with, or if you want to side with one of them at all. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a simple tale of White Knights vs Evil Moustache twirling cartoon characters and many of the game’s decisions are morally ambiguous as opposed to black and white choices. Because the game predominantly features factions with unique motives, it makes sense to reintroduce the Faction Reputation System, as opposed to relying on a heavily flawed Karma System. Players can complete quests in a variety of different ways, and in favour of different people. Whether it be through distribution of electricity, or destroying the NCRs monorail; the variety of ways to play the game makes it unrivalled in terms of replayability.\n\nInteracting with the seemingly infinite number of NPCs is a joy. Dialogue is excellently written and everyone has lots to say. The Skill checks the feature are well varied in the skills they use and expertly written to be believable. “Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past” sounds like a credible thing someone trained in Medicine would say. While the number of voice actors is only a small improvement over Fallout 3, the quality of the voice acting is a massive improvement, characters personalities are greatly enhanced by the brilliant voice work done. Facial animation still leaves a lot to be desired but it’s still an improvement.\n\nBecause Obsidian Entertainment consists of many ex-Black Isle employees, including the series creator Tim Cain, New Vegas is very faithful to the canon established by the first two games. The game also plays a lot like a first person version of the old-school RPGs. A lot of NPC interaction is involved making the game more about interacting with the world than exploring it.\n\nFallout: New Vegas does well to capture the atmosphere of Fallout, a world rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust. Adding to this is the soundtrack, which is largely comprised of the atmospheric music from the first two games. While it’s disappointing that very little new score was composed for New Vegas, it’s still infinitely better than the action movie soundtrack of Fallout 3. Radio stations make a return and play music appropriate for the retro future setting. Though this time with radio hosts that actually make sense in the world of Fallout.\n\nIf you enjoy RPG experiences with deep lore, plenty of replayability then Fallout: New Vegas is for you. If you just want a simple minded shoot and loot then it may not be for you, but I still highly recommend it. It does a fantastic job of bringing Fallout back to being… Fallout.","December 25, 2013","true","354.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","4"

Easily one of the best RPG's ever made thus far. I may get some hate for this, but in my opinion, Fallout New Vegas has out done Fallout 3 in nearly every regard. The story is pretty great. It can be slow at times, but when you make decisions, they feel like they actually matter. The setting is something many people used to praise Fallout 3 for, including myself, and it is no doubt one of the best game settings ever, but after several play throughs of New Vegas, I feel the Mojave has that extra bit of charm that the DC wasteland didnt have. Some disliked the Mojaves bright skie's and bright City for a post apocalyptic game, but for me it just felt very right. The writing for some of the Side Quests in this game, is truly phenominal, and I hope Obsidian gets another shot at a Fallout game once Fallout 4 is out. Overall Fallout New vegas, and the Fallout franchise as a whole is a master piece, with rich and interesting Lore, great characters, excellent gameplay, and HOURS of replayability. Expect 100+ hours per playthrough, and even then you'll still have not done everything. My playtime on steam for this is only about 128 hours as of 2/14/16, but when I used to play this on console, id say my time on it is around 600+.\n\n**EDIT: Having now played Fallout 4 and its overly simplified rpg elements, i've come to appreciate this game even more than when i originally wrote this.\n\n\nHere is a summed up list of the Pro's and Con's of Fallout: New Vegas\n\n\n\nPRO's\n\n-Amazing and vast, variety of weapons.\n\n-Interesting and Fun characters.\n\n-Extensive character customization.\n\n-Great leveling system with awesome Perks.\n\n-Excellent setting.\n\n-Good story, and great variety of story paths and Choice's.\n\n-V.A.T.S\n\n-The Pip Boy 3 thousand, Enough said.\n\n-DLC's add a good amount of content for your character to take back to the Mojave. The way the DLC story lines tie in with the main games narrative is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent, making this games DLC some of the best i've ever played.\n\n-Very well optimized for the PC. Runs better on my fairly average computer than it did on my Xbox 360.\n\n\n\nCON'S\n\n\n-Occasional crashes, not as big a deal as people make it out to be. You should be fine unless your trying to run this on an Etch A Sketch or a Potato.\n\n-Sometime's a glitch will interfere with a quest or you might get stuck in a ledge. This is also Very occasional and not a real problem at all.\n\n\n\nIf you dont already own Fallout New Vegas, why are you still reading this, go buy it. NOW!.\n\n10/10, Would herd Wind Brahmin Again.","April 3, 2015","true","129.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","13","13","5","2"

You can choose your way of playing the game after you develop some skills pretty freely and it never loses that "choose your way" feeling. The DLC that tie in along the way are mixed. Dead Money and Lonesome Road feel like filler material while Honest Hearts let's you explore a totally different area and Old World Blues is just a must play. The main story isn't fully engaging, but it offers enough choices to be interesting for a couple of play-throughs.\n\nSadly the game crashes a lot and feels a bit under-tested which takes away from the overall experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/recommended/22380/","chaoticmayhem","ChAoTic_MaYhEm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/","58 products in account","This review. Like my Fallout 3 review will be long.\n\nFor my Fallout 3 review go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/recommended/22300\n\nFallout New Vegas still stands as one of the greatest games ever to be enjoyed not only as a Fallout fan but an RPG fan as a whole.\n\nThe game brings together combined elements from Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout 3. While adding a few things of it's own here and there to make the game even more exciting. To top it off this game presents Hardcore mode, which basically turns Fallout New Vegas into an (almost) realstic game.\n\nCombat- Combat has seriously improved since Fallout 3. The combat in this game instead of a straight forward shooting up your enemies with VATS with a few grenades here and a rocket launcher here, and a lazer gun here and last aid of your companions or the other faction that is fighting your potential killer, you will have to rely mostly on 'special ammo' for example, if you are attacked by a deathclaw the only way to kill it or bring down it's 'defeneses' (the name will have a shield icon right next to it) is by using armor-piercing rounds.\n\nMusic- The music of this game is both combination of western and Vegas style. You will need music mods to make that list grow even larger. But in the end it doesn't really matter because both music pieces presented in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are great either way.\n\nQuests- There is a barrage of quests, not only from the modding standpoint, but also DLC and the game overall. You will spend a lot more hours with these quests as the same amount of hours you do with Fallout 3, and the other Fallout titles\n\nCompanions- Companions are no longer "Lydia's with guns" They are actually smarter and with the aid of the companion wheel it makes life SO MUCH easier when talking to your companion for him, her, or it to move back, go non-agressive, wait, trade equipment, and maintain distance. Bewarn, if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode, your companions will still be smarter, but they will end up dying and staying dead till you reload your save or you restart the game after you finish it. There are also companion centered quests, Which by the way some are fun, but others are just boring and tedious to do.\n\nWorld/ Exploration- Unlike Fallout 3, where it really shows the post apocalyptic side to the world. Fallout New Vegas really doesn't have the gritty atomosphere sadly, It is more of a homage to movies like Mad Max (1979) and the Book of Eli with Denzel Washington (2010). All desert, a few settlements here and there. Hostile areas here and there with random events. You only have the New Vegas area as the "DC ruins" of this game but unlike D.C ruins of this game, it is populated. Also the game map itself is huge.\n\nRPG- The RPG elements in this game are heavily seen, for example, "Faction armor" depending upon what faction armor you wear, the other side, and the neutral party might be offensive or hostile to what you wear. The choices you make in game, also shape how the faction looks at you. Leveling up is much different from previous games. It goes on an odd or even level of leveling up, so install mods to fix this little issue and make it more like Fallout 3's leveling up system. Lastly the perks within the game that you obtain either through challenges or leveling up really make a difference so choose wisely\n\nDLC- The DLC within the game are extremely well done. If you want to put your skills to the test, play Dead Money. If you want to play a DLC that touchers your inner nerd, play Old World Blues. If you want something more faction oriented and exploration play Honest Hearts. And lastly if you want all three combinations (except the inner nerd part) But offer a much more bigger challenge, play Lonesome Road. There are also 'player add-ons' that gives you basically starting gear.\n\nVoice Acting- Fallout New Vegas not only has a huge celebrity cast, but also the voice acting for the different NPCs ranges differently so from settlement to settlement don't expect about every odd or even number of NPCs to sound the same.\n\nThe Modding Community- The modding community has been ever helpful to make this game not only challenging, but more prettier and much more longer, also of course the usual mods (weapons, armor, companions, etc.).\n\n*MASSIVE Spoiler Alert* Because unlike in Fallout 3 where you can free roam after Broken Steel DLC, all DLC takes place BEFORE the final battle at Hoover Dam. So make sure you really take your time with this game, because there is no going back when the final quest begins.\n\nConclusion: Like in my Fallout 3 review, Fallout New Vegas has things that Fallout 3 should've had, but again Fallout 3 had things that Fallout New Vegas should've had as well. But regardless of that, it is really an enjoyable game to play and this game is a definite recommendation","March 11, 2015","true","133.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

Its all because of 2 very simple things, one being factions and the other being karma. You can be a phycotic killer, wiping out towns like Goodsprings and Novac and still get one of the NCR endings. You can be a prince of goodie-two-shoes and still get a Legion ending. You can ally the smaller factions with you even if the NCR or Legion tells you to wipe them off the map and get them to help you with the Hoover Damm battle. So yeah, you can steal eveything in the Wasteland and still get a good ending. The only faction I did not really like was the BoS (Brotherhood of Steel) because they only appear in one location, and you need DLC for them to be able to idolize you. Other than that Fallout New Vegas is an amazing game, and its better than Fallout 3 for the reasons I have given you.

Fallout: New Vegas lived up to every anticipation, and is truly an excellent game worthy of the series.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nI just returned from my first PAX, where I managed to get a good look at the upcoming Fallout game: Fallout New Vegas.\n\nThe Bethesda booth had demos on the X-Box, only allowed you to play for a (theoretically) 15-minute interval, using a demo savepoint, and had lines at least 45 minutes long -- all of which gives you a very limited look into the game. But fortunately, I discovered that the Nvidia booth had a Fallout 3 demo for the PC, often with no lines and a gameplay duration limited only by your conscience. As such, I was able to get in several hours of play in the new game.\n\nThat said, I avoided most anything that would spoil the plot for me, as well as avoided major areas like The Strip. Instead, I focused on learning what I could about changes to gameplay, and I'm writing to share those with you.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n(If you've been looking forward to this game, some of these things you will probably already know from other reviews and spoilers.)\n\nFallout New Vegas uses the same engine and basic gameplay as Fallout 3, but incorporates a lot of things from Fallout 1 & 2 that Fallout 3 dispensed of, and includes a lot of game tweaks previously only available in mods.\n\nVisually, the game is beautiful. The green haze is gone, giving us a bright blue sky and a lush desert landscape which is heavy on oranges and browns.\n\nTraits are back. Traits are special perks, available only at the beginning, which either modify the game a little or which give you a benefit at the cost of a drawback. You can pick two traits for your character. (One trait, Wild Wasteland, "adds additional 'wacky' content and modifies existing content and special encounters" that makes connections to the bizarre encounters you could have in the first Fallout games.)\n\nSkills have been mildly revamped. "Small Guns" and "Big Guns" are now just "Guns". Plus, they have added in the "Survival" skill. (More on it later.)\n\nA lot of the perks from the older games are apparently back. In addition, opposite-sex perks (like Black Widow) now have same-sex equivalents.\n\nFood items now give you health slowly over time rather than in a single lump sum. With sufficient Survival skill, you can activate any campfire you find and cook food (or otherwise combine foodstuffs) to create superior foodstuffs. For example, you can cook gecko meat to create a gecko steak which is much healthier.\n\nSimilar to the "recipes" for food, you have the ability to modify or break down your weapons with a sufficient level of Repair skill -- you can even break down scrap metal into lead. You can add silencers, scopes, etc to certain weapons if you have the parts, the Repair skill, and a workstation.\n\nIn addition, apparently you can repair items up to 100% regardless of the level of your Repair skill -- higher levels just makes it easier, requiring less items.\n\nAnd, having mentioned gecko meat... yes, geckos are back! In addition to a wider variety of monsters, New Vegas offers more variety within those monsters, including smaller "young" versions of the adult critters.\n\nAs well as basic good-evil karma, you also garner reputation with each settlement and group. On a similar note, stealing from any group (even an evil one) will get you negative karma. This leads to scenarios like the one I encountered below:\n\nI sneak up on a camp of Powder Gangers (a gang formed of escaped convicts -- they be evil) and take them out (gaining positive karma for killing the bad guys but negative reputation with the Powder Gangers). I loot their bodies (gaining nothing... except loot, of course). Then I loot their campsite (gaining negative karma for stealing from the Powder Ganger faction).\n\nAs a fun addition, if you are wearing the outfit of a particular faction, you are disguised as a member of that faction. The initial reactions of people you run into will be based on that disguise. (So, as it turns out, running around in Powder Ganger armor wasn't such a smart idea.)\n\nWeapons (at least some of them) have special critical hits. For example, fighting with boxing gloves allowed me to knock an enemy critter out cold.\n\nSo, overall, I'm even more excited for Fallout: New Vegas than I was before PAX. It looks like this game is going to be excellent!","July 3, 2014","true","671.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Roaming around the dry Mojave Desert day & night, slaughtering mutated creatures that were once normal, avoiding other tribes that will ruthlessly steal your damn clothing & supplies, murdering you is in the deal as well. Although V.A.Ts is a bit buggy, Example: You would use it & heaps of enemies would be around the area, it'd take afew minutes to actually lock onto the targets that are head of you. When you click one of the arrows to go right, it may go left, even though there is another enemy towards the right.\n\nWeapons:\nHoly ♥♥♥ this game has heaps of weapons, actually reminds me of Borderlands/Borderlands 2, I know I know, this game came first, haha. Definitely your kind of FPS if you enjoy advanced technological weapons or old timey western guns! The concepts & designs are amazing for the futuristic weapons, my personal favorite is the "Q-35 Matter Modulator", the name is a cronky one, but how it looks is simply sexy & dangerous!\n\nCharacters:\nVery unique character designs & clothing. However, as I stated, I loved the clothing, some of the clothing was completely Overused. I mean, I get it, it'd be pretty expensive to have every single character have different clothing! The ragged & digusting look of the raiders in this game is absolutely amazing! Originality blasting in this game, such as a car tire for a shoulder pad, haha.\n\nVoice Acting:\nLet's be honest, this game had so little voice actors. I didn't really mind it, but it kinda got old after awhile hearing the same voices over & over again! Some of the voice acting could use a little more work, such as the NCR soldiers & how almost every  civilian had the same dialogue.\n\nSoundtrack:\nComing from a person who absolutely loves retro soundtracks & music, this game has to have my favorite OST! As for the ambience while you're roaming around or in battle, it's pretty intense & may get a bit creepy from time to time. The ambience really depends on your location & state, which is a pretty sexy addition to the game!\n\nStory:\nHow I loved the story! It gives it a realistic vibe due to the fact you can literally slaughter important people.(Not that you should...) You have about 3 whole main choices in the game, Neutral, Bad, Good. Neutral being you forget about everyone else & fight for no one excluding a certain robot. Bad being you side with the Legion & plot for Vegas Domination. Good being you side with the NCR, New California Republic, taxes up the ♥♥♥ but that's what it will take to get the world back into natural order.\n\nConclusion:\nWell, all I gotta say is you should really buy this game! I enjoyed it so much, I still play it! It'll give you endless hours of entertainment & fun, especially if you add in additional content, such as mods. Exclusive mods can be found at: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/?\n\n10/10 ♥","March 1, 2014","true","189.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Fun!\n\nSo take the superb writers and designers who were behind the original two Fallout games (who also did other great RPG's like Planescape: Torment and KOTOR 2) and mix it with the gameplay of Bethesda's Fallout 3. The result is a game that, at first, is a bit annoyingly linear, but opens up later once you eventually find your way into New Vegas itself. But you also get a game that is overflowing with sidequests, dark humor, and neat little bonuses found all over the world much as you would in Fallout 2. In fact, there is so much to do here I am not positive I've actually seen everything there is to see in this game despite having 100% completed it.\n\nObsidian, of course, is a developer that is rather infamous for bugs in their games, and there are some to be found here as well. As usual, save early and save often just in case something breaks or crashes, but usually that won't happen too often. It will probably happen more if you fill this game with mods like I and many others love to do, but that's something you will have to accept because mods make this already great game even bigger and better.\n\nSo if you like the Fallout series, you... probably have already played this, actually. If you haven't, then you should. Otherwise you too might find yourself digging a shallow grave in the middle of the Mojave desert. o_o","April 14, 2015","true","216.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","12","13","9","0"

If you want a new generation fallout game that better represents the originals then this is the game, it follows a greater focus on character development and how you interact with the world; appreciating the fact that not everyone cares about pure run and gunning (you can still do that but there is a high chance of death involved). It may be a sudden change from the atmosphere of Fallout 3 now that they have somewhat of a more civilised stable society and its rather reminiscent of the wild west styled games but that only serves to continue the atmospheric development. If you can embrace actual adventure and actually role play then you are in for a treat of post apocalyptic wild west vibe.

Also, there's a Hardcore mode where you really have to pay attention to your hunger, sleep and radiation levels, as well as not lug so much ammo around (ammo has weight in Hardcore mode).","January 25, 2015","true","17.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Sakura_/recommended/22380/","_Sakura_","Sakura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Sakura_/","140 products in account","Fallout: New Vegas, is possibly one of the most successful video games published to the Steam Community. Not only becuase of its sense of real life war, conflict of nature, and real grasp of a post apocalyptic world, but also becuase it allows to feel yourself as you might in the real world. An example of such is how it allows you create your own character, with your own tastes in style, color, and even gender.  It also gives you the feeling of bonding with other NPC's as they as well have a design, much like one you would find in the real world itself. Another very popular and inspiring thing for this game, is its open world enviroment. You can do what you want, go where you want, take who's side you want, and say what you want. Along with a more then wide variety of armor, weaponry, and most anything else you can think of, to choose and select from. And if that isn't enough to satisfy your tastes, you also have the ability to install mods, to perk up the enviroment, change many differant aspects of the game, the people, places, and things you interact with, and even yourself. Though this is a spin-off from the Fallout games, 1 2 and 3, this world still allows you to imerge in a whole differant world that you would likely never find in any other game. And if you're the type who is up for a challenge, you can even use a feature, known as "Hard Core Mode", where hunger, thirst, sleep, and radiation, will be allowed to play roles in your gameplay experience. All in all, this game is a excellent piece of art made by the game industry, and I would highly recommend buying this game, if you are the type of gamer who like post apocalyptic, open worlds, as well as a throw-back to what seems to be as far back as the late 1950's, yet mixed with a futuristic element at the same time. I would with no doubt support this game, and encourage the Community to give it a shot.\nGame on, Fallout Universe!","September 18, 2014","true","208.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","2"

The only problems are that the story is somewhat weak and it has a MASSIVE amount of technical issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/22380/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","I used to think no game could come close to how good Fallout 3 was but all my friends would say to me "You bought Fallout: New Vegas collector's edition on launch day! Why haven't you played it yet?! It's so much better than Fallout 3" and how right they are.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game / Survival Horror game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and is set in a post-apocalyptic western United States, an area largely untouched by the events of the great nuclear war of 2077. You are a Courier, delivering messages around the wasteland and have been assigned to deliver a package containing something very special. Unfortunately, you are captured, package stolen, and left for dead in the wasteland. What happens next will eventually determine the fate of the thousands inhabiting the Mojave desert for years to come.\n\nThe huge open-world of Fallout: New Vegas is well constructed and very atmospheric. I found however, that it feels slightly less interesting than Fallout 3. In Fallout 3 you would worry all the time about what is around the next corner. In New Vegas, the landscape, at first, looks fairly flat and uninteresting. Is this a fault of the game or is it to be praised for being authentic to the area in which it is set? I have friends that have visited Las Vegas and they tell me "Yes, the area around Las Vegas is pretty much how it looks in the game".\n\nWhich ever way you look at it, you'll get lost in the atmosphere in no time. The ambience and music gives the game a great western vibe as well at the nicely crafted musical score (which also includes tracks from Fallout 1 and 2 for added nostalgia)\n\nThe world is also not immediately open to the player. Going North is pure suicide early on in the game so the player is encouraged to explore the south before venturing north. By closing off certain areas to the player early on, I found that it really helps to emphasize just how much of a dangerous place the Mojave wasteland really is and it increased my wanting to explore those areas later once I got some better gear.\n\nThe plot in Fallout: New Vegas however is a lot more open and is better written than Fallout 3. Right up until the very end of the game, you have total freedom to choose your own path in the world. The story also doesn't take itself as seriously as Fallout 3 does; the characters you meet, situations you are put in and overall tone of the game is lighter, funnier and doesn't centre around one specific key character. You have a world, an event is happening in that world, get going and help shape what happens!\n\nThe game mechanics are deep, very very deep. There are almost System Shock 2 levels of complexity in this game; It keeps pretty much all of Fallout 3's FPS/RPG elements and statistical goodness everyone has come to expect from a Fallout game but also re-introduces mechanics from Fallout 1 and 2 back into the mix. Damage Threshold and Damage Resistance are back and really well implemented into the combat. I learnt pretty quickly that it is futile to chip away at a creature's thick hide or somebody's metal armour with a 9mm pistol, you're going to need the right gun for the right situation which means thinking on your feet. Guns can also degrade in quality over time and depending on what ammo you use which means keeping your gear in top condition is very important.\n\nThe game also allows you to create your own food and ammunition. Different types of ammo will require different components you can get from either de-constructing existing ammo or finding them in the Mojave and will affect different opponents in different ways; Use 12 Gauge, Slug rounds to pierce through Armour or use 12 Gauge, Dragon's Breath rounds to set squishy things on fire!\n\nThe game introduces an optional 'Hardcore mode' which, amongst other things, requires you to eat, drink and sleep in order to stay alive. Ammunition has weight to it and getting health from Stimpaks occurs over time. It will drastically change the way you think about approaching situations and provide you with a more survival horror type experience.\n\nNot only all this but your actions will affect people's opinions of you. Do good things and people in that region, town or faction will like you and will come to your aid in times of need. Do bad things and expect to be hated, shot at and have general abuse hurled at you.\n\nI've only scratched the surface of what the game can do here but now it's time to talk about the Downloadable Content that the game contains. There are four packs and they all differ widely in settings and theme but they all tie together cleverly to create one big story to play through:\n\nDead Money DLC - Holy crap this is one atmospheric ride! You are sent to uncover the secrets of the Sierra Madre and I can't say much more as anything else would be a spoiler. This is probably the creepiest DLC out of the four, It's bursting with places to explore and things to find. Anyone who finds that a lot of Fallout: New Vegas feels quite empty and void of small detail in a lot of places will have nothing to complain about here. Great characters and very nicely paced with amazing atmosphere.\n\nHonest Hearts DLC - You are hired to travel with the Happy Trails caravan to Utah's Zion National Park. This is the first of the DLCs to give the player an open world to explore. The world is, once again, very nicely crafted with real attention to detail but unfortunately it suffers from being quite boring story-wise. It's nice to meet characters that aren't your average wasteland survivors though but sadly, most are largely forgettable and the story can go out with either a small pop or a whimper depending on what you want to do.\n\nOld World Blues DLC - This is probably the funniest and most bizarre DLC made for New Vegas. It was even nominated for a 'Best DLC' award! This is a real turn around from Honest Hearts; hilarious from start to finish, incredibly well written story and characters, a new huge open area to explore, perfect pacing and the DLC will prove a real challenge for players of all skills. Absolutely worth playing and taking your time with.\n\nLonesome Road DLC - The final DLC and it is something quite special. This is really worth playing if, like me, you disliked the game giving you a character that was both a blank slate and had some kind of past that was a complete mystery. This will definitely fill in some of those blanks and make the Courier more interesting. It's a return to a linear world like Operation Anchorage but it is so full of more interesting places to see and things to do. You will find yourself backtracking to either find all the hidden secrets or opening up new areas but a lot of the time, it's worth doing. There are cool set-pieces (which is a must for this kind of DLC) and what happens to you (and/or others) at the end is amazingly good. A great end to an impressive series of DLC.\n\nWith all of the praise I've given the game, it has its faults. Bugs mainly. There are a few hanging around and whilst they aren't game-breaking, they can range from floating objects to random crashing to desktop. Another issue depends on your point of view, the game falls into the same trap Fallout 3 fell into by letting the player level up too much and becoming too powerful making most of the RPG elements like speech-checks largely pointless. An RPG isn't an RPG any more when you're good at everything!\n\nI'm already planning my next play through of Fallout: New Vegas and after playing it, it makes Fallout 3 a very hard game to go back to. Fallout: New Vegas is just an all-round better game, despite it's small flaws and if you enjoyed Fallout 3, I urge you get your hands on this as soon as possible! Hundreds of hours of enjoyment guaranteed!\n\nRecommended Mods:\nJSawyer and Mission Mojave. Use these to make your game a better RPG and fix over 27,000 in-game bugs.","April 5, 2014","true","375.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/22380/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","This game has the potential to be so much more. Anyone who has ever visited Nexusmods and seen the library of content created as an addition to New Vegas, can attest to the potential of this game. Bethesda, off the heels of success with Fallout 3, in my opinion rushed New Vegas and released it before it was stable. Non-modded, Vanilla versions of New Vegas with and without DLC, are prone to random crashing. Now, even with that most annoying of pet peeves for all gamers, New Vegas is another post-apocalyptic, immersive sandbox, Taking place in the Mojave wasteland, and with the DLC content, surrounding areas. Instead of playing the intrepid vault dweller, you are a courier for the Mojave Express, who is gunned down. You must uncover the reason behind your attempted murder, find your stolen package, and unravel the mysteries within. The Brotherhood of Steel makes a brief appearance, but does not play the central role of law and order, the way they did in Fallout 3. Now we are introduced to the government and military of The New California Republic, as well as the despotic and sadistic masses known as Caesar's Legion. Fallout New Vegas is a game that must be played with all available DLC, for the full experience. Despite all the flaws, there are hotfixes, such as official game patches and player created Mods, to combat game crashing. If you enjoyed Fallout 3, you will love New Vegas.","May 28, 2015","true","130.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedLegionnaire/recommended/22380/","RedLegionnaire","Seoul Survivor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedLegionnaire/","125 products in account","Despite what Hideo Kojima would tell you, war never changes.\n\nFallout New Vegas returns the Fallout series to it's west coast roots, sort of. While little of the action actually takes place in The New California Republic, the state DOES play a heavy role in the title.\n\nThe player embarks on a quest of mythical proportions starting as a simple courier caught up as a pawn in the affiars of dicatators, emperors, and corrupt senators, and offers satisfaction to any who step into the wastes, in several ways.\n\nOne can endavor make the post apocalyptic, post divergent hell (as opposed to pre-apocalyptic, pre-divergent hell, or even conteporary hell) a slightly better place through feats of heroism. Alternatively one can take out their aggression at the powers that be by establishing new orders under nefarious leaders of varying degrees of nefariousaritynessnessism (sp?). Or one can simply say "screw the rules, I have ______" where ______ is "money" or "all manner of fictional designer drugs and booze" or "a collection of exotic guns that would raise Heston from his grave" or "300,000 piles of scrap metal, duct tape, a radioactive toy rocket, and some bubble gum!"\n\nThe morality system is still in place, and the game can be heavy handed with this, though in addition to "break stuff steal things, versus fix stuff, save idiots" are a series of factional based fame meters. Remember how back in high school, you accidentally peed your pants in the cafeteria? Well instead of immediately gaining the same amount of infamy among all the cliques, the art kids, and tweakers thought it was kinda cool, in an ironic way. Same thing goes in FO:NV. Blowing the facial bones out of a random scumbag with a kids BB gun, maxed skills, and the "Bloody Mess" perk may toque off half the factions, but it may just earn your a little bit of positive feedback from other groups - maybe that guy pooped in their Sugar Bombs.\n\nAdded to this iteration of Fallout is also increased crafting as a mechanic. One can skill up abilities in making medical and food aid items, which come in handy if one plays the real game (hardcore mode) and not just "Cousin Timmy's, I'm Too Frail to do Even Live Hard in a Simulated Reality Weekend Adventure" (regular mode).\n\nHardcore mode requires the player to consume food and water, as well as sleep regularly or risk stat debuffs or even death. And healing items take longer too work, along with stat buff items risking negative side effects like addiction, far more frequently than in Cousin Timmy's experience.\n\nAll said, FO:NV is what Fallout Fans were hoping for from FO3, Fallout franchise based setting, more guns, more items, huge map, hours of gameplay and sidequests, but still with all the bugs one can expect from Bugthesda, though you shouldn't complain - If you're reading this, you're in the PC mustard race, and therefore console is always a tilde away, and through tilde, all problems can be solved. Some may not enjoy single player only, but this is the apocalypse. All your friends are dead. JK, you never had any friends, that's what the charming classical radio tracks are for.. All in all, one of my personal favorite.\n\n\nFinal score: 875/1000 Rads\n\nProtip: Generally speaking, honest heats will tell you the DLC was lackluster, however, while it was a lonesome road to get to this point, for the current going price, I'd say all are worth the dead money. I'd have something clever to say about Old World Blues, too, but out of all the DLC it was the only one worth the initial cost, as it was clever enough on it's own, and is this reviewer's personal pick.","October 31, 2014","true","299.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/recommended/22380/","CDFW","Riko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/","1005 products in account","A game of limitless choices, possibilities, and complexity; something an RPG wants to be at its core. Fallout New Vegas is truly an 'epic' experiance, with a whole world of choices and options at the players fingertips, all of which is explorable and playable space. Want to be a space cowboy firing lazors and lever action rifles, sure. Want to be a swat trooper who bashes peoples knees in with a katana, you can easily do that. The game just has a lot of things to do.\n\nThese choices, compound into its ultimate game strength; the sheer amount of content there is. The game has a massive world, with easily 110+ quests, and probably even more unmarked quests. As well, the vast arsenal of weapons, the variety, and the balencing the game has in regards to these are phenoninal. Any playstyle is viable in this game, and it is an experiance where everyone can flourish. The game is perfecly paced as well, meaning that at no point are you this indestructable God of death, you are fragile, you are not the best, you are mortal. The game teaches you that very well, that you are human, nothing more. You live in this shattered world, dealing with your own human nature; whether it be the mortality, the drugs, sex, disease, or just plain stupidity.\n\nBut despite the games humanity, it falls into one major trap. That is, the game encourages metagaming at its finest. For instance, to get the best stuff/ending/quests, you need to know how/when to do things. This can be argued in the whole nature of the complex choice system as well, but because of the no turn back attitude of the game, it highly encourages veterans to play the game rather synthetically, rather than let it all flow together as it may. Yes, this does mean replayability, but its not as fun as a purely organic gaming experiance.\n\nDespite the main criticisms of the game, and other factors I chose not to mention (for length restraints), the game is not bad. On the contrary, its quite good, very good. Why is it good? Because it emplifies its core concept excellently: Humanity, and what it means to be human. That focus in what its about, makes it a must own.","November 2, 2013","true","159.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragonpwnsz/recommended/22380/","Dragonpwnsz","Dragonpwnsz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragonpwnsz/","27 products in account","I recently played a game titled, Fallout: New Vegas, it was developed by Obsidian Studios, which many of the company’s members happen to be former members of Interplay Productions’ Black Isle Studios, the ones who brought you Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. The game was published by Bethesda Softworks, the Makers of Fallout 3, as well as one of my other favorite game series, The Elder Scrolls.\n\nThe game takes place in The Mojave Wasteland, which is the Post Apocalyptic version of the areas of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The game follows a The Courier who has a package delivery go wrong, as you find out at the very start of the game. This is one of the few games that I recommend watching the intro all the way through on, as the intro is very well done, in fact I enjoyed watching it my first playthrough, and then after I had played the game through several times, after which I noticed many different things that you would only notice after having played the game in depth.\n\nThe game is played in 1st/3rd person perspective, and the player interacts with the world and with items using a GUI called a Pipboy 3000, which can be upgraded to the Pimpboy 3 Billion (Which is a gold plated version of the Pipboy 3000.) after completing a certain quest. The game has a nicely done crafting system for creating items for the player to use/sell. You can make items from a few different hotspots, those would be, a fireplace or hot plate, a workbench as well as a repair bench.\n\nThis game unlike so many of its kind, actually has a nonlinear questline, which basically means you can chose who you would like to side with, as well as how you want to handle a situation in most cases.\n\nThe games main factions that you can side with during the main questline are Caesar’s Legion, Mr. House, the New California Republic (NCR), and for an independent New Vegas, you can side with a overly friendly and forthcoming robot named Yes Man.\n\nCaesar’s Legion is led by no other than Caesar, aka Edward Sallow, Caesar co-founded his legion with a man known as Joshua Graham, whos name is not to be spoken within The Legion without punishment.\n\nMr. House or Robert House, founder of RobCo Industries, is a man who spent the latter years of his Pre-War life, planning for how to keep himself alive indefinitely, and protect the Vegas Strip from nuclear attacks.\n\nThe New California Republic is a fairly large democratic federation that is the absolute enemy of Caesar’s Legion.\n\nThe music choices in Fallout: New Vegas are fantastic, it perfectly fits in with the early 1900’s feel of the game and while a few may disagree the music itself is very good, with selections of the greats of the 1940s and 1950s with genres including classical and jazz. I feel like this revived a great period of time for music, so that new generations could enjoy it for themselves. This game is amazing and I would recommend it as a must play for gamers everywhere.","January 13, 2015","true","113.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

Has to be one of the best RPGs to date.\n\nI highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition to enjoy the brilliant DLCs, the game is much more complete with them.\n\nGame-play is as amazing as ever, pretty much following the same game-play as Fallout 3 with a few improvements here and there. Strangely they decided to add an iron-sights mode when shooting, which would be fine, but seeing as this game doesn’t have the best graphics, it can sometimes feel like your aiming down a brick. This can be easily corrected by disabling it and going back to Fallout 3’s zoom, however.\n\nAll the guns feel great, all with a specific purpose and good against certain enemies, there is a great deal more strategy to the gun-play than with Fallout 3, with many more available stats, weapon mods and weapons which are useful in particular situations.\n\nThis game also introduces hard-core mode, where the game is set to the hardest difficulty (very hard) and forces you to eat, sleep and drink on a regular basis in order to survive. This mode tends to start extremely hard, with endless treks searching for water or supplies and provides a hefty challenge for experienced players, but once you’ve played this game to death, you’ll have enough supplies to not really have to worry about impending starvation any longer.\n\nI could go into much more detail on game-play but many of my points would also apply to Fallout 3, which if you haven’t played, I recommend doing so before getting this.\n\nAs far as visuals and soundtrack go they are beyond exquisite, with a great mix of a western style Mojave theme and the classic 1950s twist that was evident in earlier games.\n\nThe story is excellent, following your life after being shot in the head. The game has over 62,000 lines of dialogue, holding the Guinness World Record for the most dialogue ever produced for a video game. It also has has some of the best written characters I’ve ever seen in gaming, most of them appearing the DLCs.\n\nThe actually story, well, that’s up to you. Do what you want; don’t do what you\ndon’t want to do. This is the definition of strong story-telling in a truly free game world.\n\nWhere the game has many of its problems is in mechanics. Perhaps it was rushed out, thanks to Bethesda only giving Obsidian 18 months to make the game. Very small aspects of the game do sometimes feel unfinished, or the remnants of an idea that was originally in the game are left lying around. There can also be a number of pesky bugs, most of which can be fixed by a few easily installed community mods.\n\nWhat truly should sell you on this game is the endless supply of amazing mods on the Nexus. These mods with the game and DLCs combined will give you endless hours of fun.","August 20, 2013","true","219.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

As a vengeful, brain-damaged delivery boy with VAC ban-worthy marksmanship skills you get to explore the vast and empty Nevada desert, laying waste to anything and everything that comes your way. You may pledge allegiance to the NCR and protect the helpless population, join the Legion and righteously cleanse the desert in the name of Caesar, assist numerous other petty factions or just wander the wastes alone like the worthless sack of ♥♥♥♥ that you are. If you aren't poor, you can also stop by The Strip - the heart of New Vegas, complete with suspiciously underpopulated casinos, arrogant gamblers and cheap hookers. If you've got the balls, you can also visit the one and only Mr. House at his own private casino, the Lucky 38, to learn more about that main storyline quest you completely forgot about. Before you begin your journey, head over to NexusMods and install as many nude mods as possible. Otherwise, you can play without mods (and without bouncing breasts) and enjoy the Vanilla gameplay along with the severely low intelligence that runs in your family.\n\nProfligate-tested, Caesar-approved; 10/10.","August 6, 2015","true","106.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","10","12","10","0"

The storyline is amazing, something I felt lacked in Fallout 3, New Vegas really makes you feel like you have a goal to accomplish. The combat system is highly improved from Fallout 3. The only thing I criticize the game about is the empty spaces, there are a lot of them but then again it is a desert after all.

Saying Fallout 3 is "bad" just because I happen to like New Vegas more would be too harsh. It's still a great game in its own right, and let's admit it, New Vegas wouldn't even be greenlit if Fallout 3 weren't a commercial success, but in my opinion New Vegas surpasses it in almost every aspect. Here is why:\n\nCrafting in New Vegas is more extensive and rewarding than carrying some scraps to a workbench and making goofy makeshift weapons which belong in Road Runner cartoons. Instead, you can craft potent consumables and powerful ammunition, and more possibilities become available as you improve your skills and learn perks. The quests and dialogues branch out with observable consequences to your decisions (for the most part) instead of pseudo "choices" which always lead to the same result. And last but not least, hardcore mode lets you immerse yourself in a desperate post apocalyptic world where every bullet and every drop of clean water is worth its weight in gold, instead of always packing absurdly high amounts of ammo and consumables. It forces you to manage your resources and basic needs at all times. If you want to add another layer of difficulty on top of hardcore mode, I suggest checking out project leader and lead designer Josh Sawyer's namesake mod[fallout.gamepedia.com], which he made in his free time for personal use, and then decided to release it as a free download.\n\nOh, and you're a professional courier in this game. So doing a fetch quest, which makes you feel jerked around in most games, is for once in character. So chop chop, work those legs!","August 11, 2014","true","358.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

The DLC alone is enough to buy this game as it adds so much in terms of story, gameplay and maps. Although if you try to describe this game to someone it can seem a little wierd. "the world has been nuked and a mail man gets shot in the head only to survive and go on a mail man phsycotic rampage, nuke two places, rob a casino, extermanate tribes and be the most baddas mail man there is". I think that this was the true falout 3 (not that it was bad or anything it was realy good) but because most of the people, factions and references are for fallout 1 and 2, so it feels like this should have been were fallout 3 is, and 3 be a spin off game (a very good one at that)\ni give this game 5 stars and bannana out of 10","October 27, 2014","true","690.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Rigidly follow the main storyline – or wander off and ignore it entirely. Try and be as moral as possible – or kill and rob the first merchant you come across. It's a tailor-made gaming experience where everything can be done at your own pace and in your own way – no wonder it resonates with so many people.\n\nFallout: New Vegas, the latest addition to the FRANCHISE, exemplifies all these great qualities in the series' best outing to date.\n\nThe action this time takes place on the US west coast – the setting for the first two Fallout games – a decision which has granted Obsidian much greater scope for variety in landscaping and colour than the washed-out Washington DC of Fallout 3.\n\nBeing further away from the game's titular nuclear fallout, there's blue skies, singing birds and more signs of civilisation – a marked tonal shift from the unremittingly bleak scenery seen previously.\n\nAside from the familiar burnt-out cities and trailer parks, the centrepiece of this new setting is the New Vegas strip – a wonderfully distorted and dark version of its real-life counterpart. Vomiting drunks, voluptuous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and a selection of fully playable CASINOS(better max out your Luck rating first) make it every bit as vivid and memorable as the decaying US capital of the last game.\n\nIn terms of the story, there's next to no foreshadowing this time around – players are expected to be familiar with the Fallout universe – and the main narrative follows your attempts to unravel the events leading up to your near-death, which prefigures the game.\n\nFallout: New Vegas\nI've been asked a few times whether it's 'better' than Fallout 3's central plot and to be honest it's hard to say. It's a looser strand to follow, meaning side-questing fits in much more easily, though the blank nature of your character means it's hard to care too much about what happened to you – especially when there's so much fun to be found elsewhere.","September 8, 2014","true","151.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I had played none of the previous games and was not willing to fork out the money to buy Fallout 4, a game that was released just prior to the sale and thus was still at full price. I wanted to see why people like the Fallout universe so much and since New Vegas was the most recent entry into the franchise after Fallout 4 and was quite cheap, I decided to buy it. Needless to say, I have no regrets. New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easy to substantiate that claim.\n\nTo get started on the good points of the game, New Vegas is a very rich, albeit not in a monetary sense. The characters, story, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. The quests were really well-done and I didn't feel bored while completing the main and side quests, although the side quests were the ones that really stood out. Most of the game's content comes from side quests and it was really rare for any of those quests to feel mundane or lacklustre in any way. I constantly looked out for quest givers so I could complete the side quests they provided, and it felt fulfilling to complete them. Almost every location in the Mojave has a quest or more tied to it and it was great exploring the Mojave while doing the task that has been set before you. NPCs are numerous and you're sure to have memorable interactions with many a character in the Mojave, whether it ranges from doing stuff for them or popping a cherry in their forehead. Moreover, the choices you make will have an immediate and sometimes far-reaching impact on the world around you. Although you do get to decide the fate of the entire Mojave Wasteland during the main questline, your actions in side quests also affect the individual communities and organizations operating within the world, which also extends to having an impact on the main questline. The role-playing element is certainly very present in this game, and coupled with the amout of freedom presented to the player, it does make for an awesome experience. You have plenty of freedom to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. The game doesn't rush you or push you to do or complete quests; you can take your own sweet time by exploring and doing whatever you fancy in the Mojave. If you so wish, you can be a homicidal maniac and murder everyone in sight (and risk breaking quests in the process), or you can be the stereotypical western hero-type that engages in more benevolent activities. Your actions carry weight and it feels really good to know that you're shaping the Mojave in one way or another. In addition, New Vegas has a great modding community. Although the modding scene has slowed down over the years, there's so much good content available on the Nexus for download. I have 130+ mods installed and it has really enriched my experience of playing New Vegas. New weapons, gameplay overhauls, minor tweaks, new world spaces, more quests, etc can all be added if you manage your mods properly. You can even make the aged New Vegas look more aesthetic through the use of hi-res texture mods and lighting mods like ENBs although you have to be prepared to suffer performance losses, the magnitude of which depends on the power of your rig.\n\nHowever, as it is with any other game out there, New Vegas does suffer from some flaws, some of which are pretty blatant. The devs had a very short development cycle for this game and some of the cracks really show. For instance, this game is pretty buggy and it runs on a very dated engine, the same one that Fallout 3 used waayyyy back in 2007. Compared to other games released around its time, New Vegas looks and plays quite badly. Animations are rather clunky and combat is not as smooth as I would like it to be, being pretty awkward and not quite responsive (Graphics and animation mods can somewhat mitigate this problem). Most of the time, I just found myself using VATS instead of aiming down sights due to hit detection issues and not wanting to deal with the whole unresponsiveness of gunplay. (VATS is awesome by the way) Crashes can occur quite frequently although downloading some mods can patch that issue. Also, locations are rather disappointing. New Vegas, which is supposed to be a bright, bustling hub in the center of the Mojave feels really empty and small, being made up of several main buildings. Casinos are dark and lifeless, and towns are quite small and lifeless. Yes, some mods can add onto those locations, but there is only so much a mod can alter. However, I must say that this doesn't detract much from the exploration and roaming experience.\n\nTo conclude, New Vegas is a fantastic game and I'm sure if Obsidian Entertainment were granted a longer time to develop this game, it would have turned out to be a greater masterpiece. Much work has been put into this game and we can see it in the role-playing, story, and character elements, and I see myself putting many more hours into this game. Overall, 9/10.","March 24","true","195.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

From the story to the gameplay, it has eaten the past 100 hours of my life and I'm  very pleased to waste my time. From the art style to the music to the characters, it all just fits in so well. You could say that it's no different from Fallout 3 but unlike Fallout 3, this is a much brighter and much more difficult and polished up experience with only a few flaws within the game. The DLC is fantastic, offering lots of new content and areas to explore.\nHowever, there is the problem that it's a Bethesda game. Why is that a problem? Because it's buggy. You have to be careful with the game. If you can get over the annoying save bug (where you can't load your save, requiring you to start the game from the start in order to be able to load your oldest save), to some quest breaking bugs that require you to cheat in the console (I had this occur for me once, but still). The other problem is that the battle with Caesar is very very badly executed. But, that doesn't stop the game itself from being good. If you're looking for a very fun and enjoyable experience, I highly recommend you try it out.

My first true RPG, and one true love. Full disclosure, I prefer 3 to NV, but it's almost solely because of the radio personalities; Mr. New Vegas is just kind of...blah. Luckily, there's an all-music station, and the in-game sound track is pretty damn good, too.\nSo, hey, the actual game. For starters, super-fun story. I've always been a sucker for games that have you caught between large warring factions. New Vegas has three of them. Not two. ♥♥♥♥en three. AND, you can say to hell with all of them and throw in with the faction of Me, Baby, taking the riches of New Vegas for yourself. But whatever choices you make, they're all apparent during the final battle, which somehow manages to put Liberty Prime's curb-stomping rampage to shame.\nThe world is beautiful and makes me wish I had a better graphics card. The vaults in particular are very well-written. I still get a feeling of dread whenever I crawl through Vault 34, and Vault 22 is supremely fun with fire-based weapons. The world is solidified by the fact that, unlike in F3, there are a number of large, well-established settlements, with whom you can gain or lose reputation as you and your shooting sprees see fit. The terrain itself is varried, from sprawling dessert to rocky cavern to lush forest to snow-sprinkled mountain, all within about a day's run of each other.\nMechanics are glitchy but good as always. Love the condensation of Small Guns and Big Guns into just Guns, and the addition of Survival. I actually wrote my own physical copy of The Wasteland Survival Guide with all crafting recipes in it, just so I could better manage my inventory and decide what crap I could sell safely. I can't mod weapons to save my life, but based on the public achievement stats, I think I'm the only one with this issue. Doesn't bug me much, as there are enough unique weapons in-game to make moding almost pointless. I am, however, a huge fan of the new ammo types; armor-piercing rounds making it so much easier to kill higher-level enemies, and coin shot gives you something to do with all that worthless Legion money you're going to collect.\nBuy this game, Ultimate Edition. Everyone talks up Lonesome Road, and while enjoyable (partly because it gives you access to the best companion in the game), it's one of the slowest points in the game - and filled with Deahclaws. Old World Blues is hilarious and gives you invaluable resources, Honest Hearts is beautiful in its simplicity, and Dead Money...well, Sierra Madre Martinis make Tin Cans worth something, and there's some good loot towards the end that does help your midgame.

You, most known as the Courier, were hired to deliver an unknown package from the Mojave to the New Vegas Strip but you were intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by an also unknown man who steals it.\nAfterwards, you are found and healed by a local doctor and then, your story begins. No complains on the writting department from me.\n\nBeing an Open World Action Role playing game gave Bethesda give the gamers so many things to do in the map: from following the main story, or just not and complete side quests; or from being an explorer of the wasteland to wander just in populated places. This game gives you freedom to choose what do you want to do in it and how do you want to develop your     story and character (as you have speech,lockpicking and multiple skills to upgrade by playing).

This is what keeps the player so connected to the game: the freedom of playing as you want.\n\nThe gameplay is  similar from Fallout 3: the Pipboy is back with all it's previous options modified a bit to fit in this game (radio included, lol), the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S for the specific aiming of a limb and the real time effects of it (brilliant), the karma and your reputation (good or bad, your choice), companions, weapons modding and the adding of the Gambling (cheating is included) are the most unique things of the series and of course, it's signature. Even the new players can blend in without any problem.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is one hell of a game and will not steal minutes from your life because you will enjoy every second of it.\nYou won't regret the experience.\n","December 30, 2013","true","43.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/francophile/recommended/22380/","francophile","Na'vi Едвард","http://steamcommunity.com/id/francophile/","615 products in account","A fitting love-letter of a bygone era known only as the '50s, it reminds me of a dusty ballroom recording, with its crackles and pops, genuine improvisational finesse, and its propensity for dryness. It seamlessly blends diverse modes of visual art, ranging from retro-futurism to Art Deco to modernist sensibilities into its quirky and idiosyncratic world.\n\nYou, the Courier, wander the vast expanse collectively known as the 'Mojave Wasteland', a post-apocalyptic, divergent vision of the United States in 2281.\n\nOn a quest to seek revenge against a mystery man who left you in an unmarked ditch to die, you are inadvertently thrown into a quagmire between three major factions: the 'New California Republic', 'Caesar's Legion', and with the enigmatic 'Mr. House'.\n\nThe main story revolves solely on these three factions, which I'll get into in relative detail. (Spoilers below).\n\nThe 'New California Republic' touts itself as a last bastion of a democratic federation, structuring its government and its system of laws after pre-War United States sworn to egalitarian ideals. This ideology was handled rather poorly by bureaucrats and serve as an annoying hindrance to civic order. (They are now dealing with a conglomerate of loosely connected but independent city-states.) Problems arise regarding but not limited to: laissez-faire capitalism, populism, rampant corruption, extensive senatorial infighting, and most recently, aggressive expansion.\n\nEdward Sallow was a former member of the Followers and the NCR. Here is a man who took charge of his life, as a true anarchist like himself would. He familiarized himself with the 'Commentarii', Julius Caesar's firsthand account on the Gallic Wars and emulated his character, even taking on his title. He quickly established himself as a man to be reckoned with, resorting to shockingly barbaric ways to make his point, and established the monolithic 'Legion'.\n\nOne might think Caesar's Legion would serve as a direct dichotomy to the NCR, but they're very analogous if you think about it: both are nationalistic (strictly in the traditional sense), militaristic, imperialistic, and arguably totalitarian. The Legion takes it one step further and "obliterates the identity of every group it conquers", a homogenous culture of racialists, galvanizing under one banner.\n\nAnd of course, you have Mr. Robert Edwin House and his roaming army of Securitrons. A mysterious and undoubtedly interesting figure, a staunch antitheist, and an ambitious, calculating autocrat with great oratory skill and prowess, he practically owns the New Vegas strip. He is also a self-described visionary of technological and economic gambits, and wants total control of the Wasteland.\n\n(I won't even mention all the fracases you can get into with minor factions, specifically with the Three Families, the Boomers, the Great Khans, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Remnants of the Enclave, etc. simply because there's no room for it.) These storylines are just as enjoyable and original, if not moreso than the main quests.\n\nThis is a game that's politically versed, wholly engaging, dark and humorous, and always fun to play. Mod it to your heart's content, and explore the Wasteland, a dried-up canvas that keeps on giving. Fallout at its best.","May 30, 2013","true","111.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","6"

The creators and successors of Fallout truly love their creation and put so much passion into their games and related items of interests. Only finishing FO:NV, I realise that I have only touched like 5% of the whole story. It made me curious and so I read the timeline of events in the whole Fallout universe and pleased myself with the reading of the whole story. I really enjoyed that as well!\n\n(From a first-time player of Fallout) FO:NV has great FPS gameplay including the VATS feature. The leveling, skill, S.P.E.C.I.A.L, perk and reputation system is vast and astonishing. I enjoyed starting new characters with high strength and luck and yolo it out in the Wasteland. The mass amounts of items, armor, weapons, ammo and drinks you can find is another aspect that'll make me enjoy and not get bored. Storyline is very non-linear and links up few quests so you don't have to got through too much trouble. The A.I is nicely designed for the era of the gaming industry when FO:NV was in. Companions are cool and there are many options to do with the companion (fight, stay, disband or just have a nice chat). Overall I just think FO:NV as an incredibly badass game.\n\nThe main reason I played FO:NV was because of the massive hype for Fallout 4 that provoked me to try out the Fallout Series. I know now that I will definitely buy Fallout 4, when I have the money ofc. I am proud of Bethesda, Obsidian and the original creators Interplay.\n\n10/10\n\nI write poetry in my Brotherhood of Steel armor. Lasers are my ink.

It has the same basic "Fallout 3-esque" gameplay but it's much improved. They took many popular mods from FO3 and implemented them directly into the game and it's much better for it. I'd even go as far to say that "hardcore mode" is the way you should play Fallout: NV. It feels much better with that turned on...like a real wasteland and you're trying to survive in it.\n\nNV is exactly what Obsidian does best - They take a good IP and improve upon it in almost every way....especially the writing. Bethesda couldn't write a decent story to save their lives. Their writers are down-right horrible and every one of their games' story was a joke. They make nice lore, but they never write an interesting and involved story in a single game.\n\nThe only thing FO3 has over NV is easy to see (literally). It's the visuals. FO3 takes place in a  ruined downtown DC area in the USA. Very iconic even to people who don't live in the US. The cowboy-esque visuals from NV are nice at times too, but nothing compares to a torn-up iconic environment most people have seen pictures of in real life.  It's the one real advantage that game has. Everything else though? Fallout: New Vegas actually does it better. Don't get me wrong, I liked Fallout 3 for what it was, but most everything was improved for New Vegas.\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and pick up NV today!","November 18, 2013","true","287.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Sure, it's a bit broken with those glitches, you can't turn a blind eye. But its quests and story, its freedom of choices and an amazing soundtrack really makes the glitches look like something unimportant, something small. I personally enjoyed New Vegas a bit more than FO3, but I think that it depends on your personal choice and experience. Most DLCs give you at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is quite important in my standards and they follow up different stories, which are brand new for you. Game's been out for years, it's basically a no brainer to get it, doesn't matter if full price or on a promotion.

The Fifth official installment in the brilliant Fallout series is wholly welcome.\nCarrying on faithfully the looks and feel of the much loved franchise it's a brilliant addition and definitely elicits a huge amount of enjoyment.\n\nThe game depicts the adventures of 'the Courier', a man shot and left for dead in a grave yard in the town of Goodsprings. His quest was to deliver some sort of message... But it was stolen.  Venturing through the game you meet a wide variety of people and groups (including fan favorites such as the Brotherhood of Steel) and on your quest to recover the message you become involved in things much more important than you could ever have expected. The entirely new location allowed the Game Devs to include various new creatures and factions, allowing for interaction with strange new peoples.\n\nThe visuals of the game are slightly different to it's predecessor Fallout 3, the altered, now orange-y colour scheme is a bit alien to the normal colour pallete however is not too disappointing. An issue with the landscape that I had, is the fact that it doesn't look enough like it's 'just' after an apocalypse. The environment seems a bit too lively, but in fact, it may have looked a bit too repetitive if it carried on looking like Fallout 3 (I'm excited to see how Fallout 4 will look with its rumored Nuclear Winter environment.)\n\nThere are not many alterations to the gameplay as opposed to the last Fallout game - a style of gameplay which i have come to love with a passion. Fans of the series will be happy to return to using familiar mechanics such as V.A.T.S. which newcomers will quickly get used to.\n\nBasically, the game is pretty damn good! The new environment and story line, as well as glorious DLCs (like Old Time Blues) make it a must have in any gamer's collection.\n\n80/100","November 26, 2013","true","35.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I only wish they made the characters more authentic in general, but the DLC seems to make up for this weakness, at least to some extent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoryStarkiller/recommended/22380/","CoryStarkiller","CoryStarkiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoryStarkiller/","893 products in account","TL;DR - Just by sheer length, you should be able to realize that I would recommend this game to everyone. This review is about WHY I recommend it so highly. I do not use the word "awesome" very often, but to say “New Vegas's writing and characters are awesome” is true. And I mean, they can create a feeling of awe in YOU. It is especially obvious in the companions that join YOU during YOUR game.\n\nSPOILER WARNINGS FOR FALLOUT 1, FALLOUT 2, FALLOUT 3, AND FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS ULTIMATE EDITION!\n\nIt's easy to see why Boone is a great character. Or how much of a story you can actually give an eyebot. You should sympathize/empathize with Veronica, while being frustrated and understanding at the same time with what Christine had to do. Getting to choose which brain gets to be Rex's replacement, and finding him a mate in Roxie. Being able to help the Nightkin with a high enough science skill and Lily. Getting Dean and Dog/God to begin again. Helping Arcade and Raul choose their own future path in helping the wasteland. Aiding Follows-Chalk in deciding if exploring the "civilized world" is worth the time. Helping Waking Cloud with her family and uncovering the mysteries of her tribe's past.\n\nThey are all interesting characters, because of their abilities to help you, and because they all have different stories. But Cass's story is different, even though it does not seem different. You find her drinking alone on the edge of New Vegas. Trapped between going home and trying to uncover the problems of her caravan business. You can help her several different ways. First you can convince her to go back home and not "sellout", or "sellout" in order to uncover what happened. And you help her choose how to deal with the assassinations, whether to take them to court and hurt them in their pocketbooks(the reason they did the assassinations in the first place) or deal in "An eye for an eye" justice, and kill them all. Regardless of your choice, she is never mad at you for helping. But you literally help decide what kind of person she will become. Now this might not seem very special. You are right, when only taken as the story from Fallout: New Vegas, her companion story lands somewhere in the middle to upper range.\n\nBut Fallout: New Vegas is not the start of the series. And Obsidian had members that worked on Fallout 2(most importantly Chris Avellone, since he is also the writer of Cass and the Mohave Outpost where you find her, and he created Vault City – more on this later), and are close friends with the people that made Fallout 1. So it was not difficult for them to understand the entire narrative and expand upon what has already happened.\n\nTo really appreciate Cass's complete story, you have to go back to the start of the series and understand your role in the Fallout universe. In Fallout 1(1997 in our world), the Overseer of Vault 13, sends YOU("The Vault Dweller") outside of Vault 13 in order to find a replacement for their failing water filtration system. The solutions to YOUR Vault's water problems cause the otherwise secret location of YOUR Vault to become known. The Overseer is angry that YOU have endangered Vault 13, so he sends YOU back out to save the Vault from YOUR mess. Once YOU are finally done ensuring the safety of Vault 13, YOU return home. The Overseer recognizes that YOU are no longer a Vault 13 citizen, YOUR travels have changed the person that YOU once were. He feels that YOU would be a danger to Vault 13's society. So after all YOUR hard work, YOU get exiled from YOUR home.\n\nSome of the other members of Vault 13 are angry at the Overseer for the choice to exile “The Vault Dweller”, and they all join "The Vault Dweller". They travel for a bit and eventually create the village of Arroyo. "The Vault Dweller" gets married and has a daughter. This daughter becomes the leader of the tribe. A generation almost completely passes before Arroyo falls onto hard times. They need a technological boost to survive.\n\nFallout 2(1998) opens with "The Vault Dweller"'s daughter(the leader of the Arroyo tribe) explaining to YOU, her child("The Chosen One"), to leave YOUR tribe to find the required technology to help save everyone. Along the way YOU stop in Vault City. In the outskirts of town there is a bar. The owner of the bar is John Cassidy. YOU help him with his unfair debts. He wants to escape from Vault City now that he does not owe money and joins up with YOU. There is not much else to say. For the next 12 years(in our time) there is not much to talk about. John Cassidy was a popular choice to bring in YOUR party. He had a bad heart so YOU could store YOUR drugs with him without fear of him ever using anything but stimpack, but the man loves to drink. YOU can ask him what weapons he is good with. He tells YOU that he is mostly good with guns and knives, but is ashamed to tell YOU that he can use a spear(since it might make people think that his is just a tribal). The main character development seemed to be explaining to him that YOU are just a tribal, and he has learned his lesson about being judgmental of tribals.\n\nSo why was all that back story about the stories of Fallout 1 and 2 important? And why did I capitalize all the "you"s and "your"s when talking about the Player Characters? I capitalized them to remind you that it was your choice for these things to happen. These are the canonical events. Even though you do not have to recruit John Cassidy, the official story states that you did.\n\nSo jumping ahead to Fallout 3(2008). It is based on the opposite coast from the rest of the series, and barely tells us anything about what happened in Fallout 1/Fallout 2, like Fallout 2 did with Fallout 1. That is all that needs to be said about Fallout 3.\n\nBack to Fallout: New Vegas(2010). If you do not send Cass back West, she joins YOU. When YOU ask her about her name YOU learn it is Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Cass for short. YOU learn that she can use guns, knives, and spears. She gets annoyed with YOU, if you talk to her while high on any drugs, but gives you bonus for drinking alcohol. Especially her favorite kind, Whiskey, which gives YOU another bonus. When YOU ask more about her life growing up, YOU learn that her mother was sick and did not raise her much. Her dad just left one day, when she was young. All of the evidence should show that Cass is the daughter of John Cassidy. YOU!!!!!!!("The Chosen One" from Fallout 2) are the reason why John Cassidy leaves Vault City and Cass. YOU are the reason Cass's life has turned out this way. YOU are the cause of all her problems, just because YOU wanted a party member that was really good with a gun.\n\nThe developers are the reason why Boone had a such a rough life. The developers are the reason why Christine was so obsessed with being in the "Circle of Steel" and solving the internal problems of the "Brotherhood of Steel". Even at the cost of her voice and her relationship with Veronica. The developers are the reason that ED-E is broken and that Rex is dying. The developers are the reason that Raul is locked up, or that Arcade has run from his past. The developers are the reason that Lily is going crazy and Dog/God's personality is split. The developers are the reason that Dean got caught up in the Sierra Madre. The developers are why Follows-Chalk and Waking Cloud are struggling with different aspects of tribal life.\n\nSure, Josh Sawyer told Chris Avellone to do something with John Cassidy when the game was being developed. It is not completely YOUR fault. But you actually caused Cass to turn out this way. If YOU did not find John Cassidy's character to be useful, then Josh would never have told Chris to use that storyline from Fallout 2.\n\nYOU now recruit John Cassidy because if you don't, he doesn't help save the world, but still leaves his daughter and wife. Now this is the part of his story that YOU get to shape.\n\nCass is one of the many examples of why I recommend this game to everyone.","November 21, 2013","true","230.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","10"

Fallout: New Vegas takes the focus of the Fallout franchise back to the west coast and does so in a very good way. The story isn't exactly amazing, however it lends itself to letting you create your own backstory, and making your own decisions. There really isn't too much to hold you back from doing what ever you want? The base game alone has hundreds of hours of contnent in it, and has a huge amount of replay value, from four different major endings and dozens of smaller end pieces. That being said it is not without a few flaws: namely the glitichs and instability. It manages to be worse than its predecesor in that regard, as well as numerous bugs; some hilarious, some that can ruin a run through. The only other real complaint I have is that you CANNOT continue the game after you beat the ending, which is a shame. Still there is more than enough to do in New Vegas, and with all of its DLC this is a must have for any Fallout fan, as well as anyone who likes RPGs.","October 13, 2015","true","710.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Fallout: New Vegas takes the focus of the Fallout franchise back to the west coast and does so in a very good way. The story isn't exactly amazing, however it lends itself to letting you create your own backstory, and making your own decisions. There really isn't too much to hold you back from doing what ever you want? The base game alone has hundreds of hours of contnent in it, and has a huge amount of replay value, from four different major endings and dozens of smaller end pieces. That being said it is not without a few flaws: namely the glitichs and instability. It manages to be worse than its predecesor in that regard, as well as numerous bugs; some hilarious, some that can ruin a run through. The only other real complaint I have is that you CANNOT continue the game after you beat the ending, which is a shame. Still there is more than enough to do in New Vegas, and with all of its DLC this is a must have for any Fallout fan, as well as anyone who likes RPGs.","October 13, 2015","true","710.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The engine is a bit outdated, but still makes a great Job in being fun. Specially if you mod the ♥♥♥♥ outta it.\n\nSkyrim may have better graphics, and be more stable, but like most Elder Scrolls games, it lacks roleplaying. The TES saga is great for it's lore and dungeoncrawling. But in New Vegas you can REALLY play a different character. You can be a gay guy who's a smooth talker and doesn't need to fire a shot to get ♥♥♥♥ done, for example. The different ways to solve the quests, according to your skills is what makes the Fallout saga really great.\n\nOf course, that's not the only thing this game has to offer. An awesome ambientation, the whole Fallout lore is so rich and unique. Since the smiling guy from the pipboy and all the 30s related humor, to a faction that tries to live by the rules of the Roman Empire, or the super mutants, and a lot more stuff. If Fallout has something that makes it different from other post apocaliyptic settings it's its humor and its uniqueness.\n\nComparing it to Fallout 3, it's better in pretty much every way. The decisions now aren't all "be a good good person or be a evil evil man". There are more quests, more factions, a better reputation system. The companions actually have quests and personalities, you can really get to love 'em.  The combat system is better, with the weapons having iron sights and mods, and different types of ammo. Armor is more important now, etc. And to top it off, there's a really nice hardcore mode that allows you to have needs. Yes, now you need to eat, sleep and drink to survive, and can only heal limbs with the not-so-common doctor bags or by actually visiting a doctor. It definetly makes the game harder (Though it IS pretty forgiving in some aspects).\n\nThe game has its flaws, obviously. The most serious being its bugs. But even like that, the game is a lot more stable than Fallout 3 and is fully playable.\n\nAnyways, I could keep talking, and I know I left various aspects of the game uncovered in this "review", but this is Just a general recomendation. If you like old RPGs where roleplaying was more important, or simply an unique and open world to explore and get into, this game is for you. Just buy it, you won't regret it.","July 15, 2014","true","68.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I've played the entire Fallout franchise and in my opinion this game is what Fallout 3 should have been. Not to belittle the previous title in the series, in its own right it was a fun game, with an excellent storyline, but this game is truer to the original Fallout's quasi-Western-like feel. As with this games predecessors, you wander the apocalyptic wasteland, Immersive stories begin to emerge, with some pleasant story lines and character references to previous games in the series cropping up from time to time. In this game you will encounter a range of factions with whom you can choose to become friends or enemies. Many of the decisions you will make throughout the very open world/storyline will also transform your experience. One of the greatest aspects of this game being the fact that following the first playthrough you can make entirely different choices in your second playthrough (ie, appease a group you previously were enemies with on first playthrough or make entirely different decisions at key points in the game to unlock a totally different storyline) and enjoy an almost entirely new game experience - within certain limits. In some cases the storyline wont be as flexible as you may like and will limit how far your "alternative version of events" can go.\n\nThere are other core features of the game that are equally important to mention - hidden storylines that you from time to time accidently stumble into in that second or third playthrough that will totally open up the game for you again and keep it fresh. There are numerous weapons, armour types, places to explore, people to betray, people to ally, monsters to kill, adventures to be had, decisions to make - and most importantly - the type of character you create as you play through the game. Do you wish to be hero and saviour of the weak? Or perhaps make sacrifices for "the greater good"? Are you super inteligent  and able to outwit those around you? Amazing with a rifle so that you can kill with a headshot before they get close? Perhaps you prefer to be a super strong brute that goes in close for the kill? Or are you the Rockafellar of the wastes - making a profit everywhere you go so that you can afford to buy rare and impressive weapons no one else has? The list of traits goes on, and you can choose to specialise in some or be a jack of all trades (and master of none) - the flexibility is all yours. Do you seek revenge? Do you crave power and influence? Do you hate bandits or perhaps wish to be one? The choices are *nearly* endless.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about this game was not the game itself but the DLC. I only tried one or two of them and just could not enjoy them - even though they aim to expand some elements of the story line - I would consider giving these a wide berth unless you're particularly curious!\n\nFor those of you who love post apolocalyptic themed games, sci fi, westerns, shooters, clever storylines, rpgs, action games, monsters, decision making and replayability. A highly recommended game that has been very cleverly made and well thought out. In most ways (aside from the FPS element) it remains true to the original Fallout games. A credit to the people who made it.","February 15, 2014","true","247.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I thought that Morrowind or Fallout 3 would be very tough to surpass, hell even Elder Scolls Oblivion was a pretty comprehensive experience, but no, Fallout: New Vegas is a masterpiece of gaming. The core game is great, but when you add the DLC it really becomes a massively worthwhile experience. Lots of moral choices, lots of options in how you can approach the combat, plenty of customization, single player even lets you recruit companions and equip them as need be. The settings are masterfully done, and have plenty of variation. Some stuff can plain creep you out, and some can make you want to just stand for a few minutes and take it in.  If you want a fulfilling experience get this game and play through it. There are enough endings and your actions carry over through even the DLC, so its easy to play 10 times through and have just as many final conclusions that are distinct from each other.","November 26, 2013","true","932.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Took me about 4 hours to get it running smoothly and without crashes, but it's totally worth the time and money!! For me  NMC-textures and Nevada Skies crashed the whole game. So this was a bummer.\n\nI recommend the following mods:\nWestern Sky!!  Active Wasteland  db enhanced Blood Textures  Full Character Overhaul!  Improved Sound FX!!  Sprint Mod  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash  EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements!!  The radio stations: CONELRAD and Old World Radio\nI also recommend to start the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode (Windows XP Service Pack 2).\n\nBut also without mods and stuff this game is absolutely great and except the grafics totally up to date! If you're from Germany, be shure to buy the UNCUT Ultimate Edition!!\n\nFor More Blood etc. open Fallout_default.ini Config file found in:\n...Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegas\nand find the following lines:\n\nfDecalLifetime=10.0000\niMaxDecalsPerFrame=50\n\nchange the numbers to:\n\nfDecalLifetime=720.0000\niMaxDecalsPerFrame=512\n\nBottom line: This is one of the best RPG of all time and can keep up with games like Morrowind and Skyrim!\n\n\nUpdate: It's still running pretty good, but every 2-3 hours it's crashing...But so what?!\n\nUpdate after 150 hours: Done most of the side-quests and it's still fun to scavenge and explore the wastelands. There's sooooo much to discover and I realized that last time I played it I missed many many cool quests and locations.\nRight now, I'm starting the Dead Money DLC with my level 34 character. This DLC seems to be quite out of touch with the "normal" Fallout NV world. There's something about ghosts, radios which will kill you if you go near them (you're wearing a booby-trap-collar (Battle Royale?!), which will detonate on approach) and some guy is forcing you to enter the Sierra Madre casino with some companions...Mhh, I'm eager to find out how this turns out!!\nI'll keep you updated!\n\nUpdate: Okay, totally got addicted again to this game! Played every DLC and maxed my character out...Mhhh, let's see, how long it takes until I play it again :-D\n\nI WILL BE BACK!!\n\nUpdate:   Okay, maybe I won't be back, because, people, hear me out:\nFALLOUT 4 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!\nSo for all of you who can't wait, get this game and prepare yourself for the wasteland!!","January 21, 2015","true","372.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Neither does Fallout.\n\nBetween Fallout 3 and New Vegas not a whole lot had changed. Heck, usually a sequel adds significant technical improvements. Not New Vegas. New Vegas trades out the setting for a slightly different one, trades in its story for something that Bioware would be jealous of. And adds a few new weapons and options. Other than that, New Vegas and Fallout 3 are pretty much exactly alike. And that is not a bad thing.\n\nI would have loved a more intuitive interface, or higher walkspeed, but I guess the developers held true to their creed of "do not fix what isn't broke." They also didn't fix was was broken, but big games have these small issues, and New Vegas is big. Huge. Ginormous. Not just in scale, but also in scope. There are so incredibly many things to do; if you'd try to do them all, you'd go mad. It is impossible to do it all in one playthrough; many quests have different angles and outcomes, and your alignment plays a big role. Oh, and this game isn't cushy with good and bad alignment. No, this game has a tonne of factions, and each keeps tabs on your relationship with them. You can suck up to all of them, or a few, or just go full paraiah and just kill everyone. Also, the game generally doesn't care about how you finish up a quest; just that you put an end to it.\n\nNew Vegas is a true, and both technically and literally a sandbox game. Most of the world is desert. Miles and miles of barren, irradiated sand, rocks and broken roads. This is where the tedium sets in. Because for all its superfluence, there isn't much variation in the design. All the buildings look the same. Someone built the same dingy shack about 18 times over, all across the Mohave desert. You can only distiguish the various derelict factories from the name on the door. It's a shame. For all its complex relationship mechanics and over the top gore, it is easy to see where the developers cut costs.\n\nNone of it really matters. The narrative just sucks you in, then spits you out to the side so you can go fishing for airplanes, only to draw you back in as you are rummaging through random hotel rooms. When you finally hit the climax, you'll have no idea about what and who you were working with. All the more reason to play it again, and waste even more time, looking for snowglobes in a giant desert while the future of mankind is at the mercy of antiquated fanatics who like to nail people to crosses for fun.

It’s longer then most normal games with tons of replay ability and I’m still finding stuff I’ve never discovered.  NV also makes for a good follow up to Fallout 3, as they are build off the same engine and for the most part have very similar play style.  On top of that they reworked combat outside of VATS to make if feel more fluid with the ability to actually shoot down your sights even at low level over FO3.\n\nAnother improvement was to repairs for weapons were now you can fix a gun to max condition even with low repair  vs FO3 not letting you do that.  Lastly the change to companions and making them more useful over FO3 is great.  I liked having companions to help out and all of them have missions and stories their own that add even more to narrative of the world you play in.\n\nNew Vegas does come with a little baggage (Few bugs/CTD) but other then that, as long you have auto save on your ok.  The only thing that puts me off little on this game is it don't really have the apocalypse feel as much as FO3 does.  I'm ok with the more old western feel but I do miss the large destroyed city feel most of FO3 had.  Mods also can help add to your world, change whatever you want.  You choose how things turn out but as always, war… war never changes.\n***9.5/10***","July 9, 2011","true","696.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I'll be going over my reasoning for believing that New Vegas is better and generally comparing it to FO3 a lot.\n\nFirst of all we'll have to go over some pros for Fallout: New Vegas\n\nFallout: New Vegas Pros     Improved Gameplay Mechanics: One of the biggest improvements over FO3 is the improved mechanics such as the widely improved crafting system, the weapon modification system, ironsights, nerfed VATS, gambling, and etc.\nImproved Character System Mechanics: Faction system, better karma system, almost no essential (unkillable) characters, hardcore mode\nBranching Storylines: One awesome addition was the branching storylines (I'll cover the FO3 storyline later) one great thing about the branching storylines was the replayability, I'm about the do my 4th playthrough of the game, the factions you could choose from are the  New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, Mr. House, and Independant Vegas.\nModding: The game itself is amazing, and mods just make it more enjoyable, fix bugs, or add more content, it's all there within the Fallout: New Vegas modding community.\nFallout: New Vegas Cons     Bugs: FO:NV, just like any other Fallout game, or Bethesda games for that matter, are plagued with bugs. Whether it's clipping into the ground, mission glitches that make them uncompletable, or missing textures, even though a mod has probably been made or a guide that can be found with a quick Google search.\nSimilarities: One problem I had when first playing is how it was too much was similar with Fallout 3 such as the user interface and it just felt like a Fallout 3 reskin at first.\nFallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 Comparisons     World Design: I personally like the vibe that FO3 gives off more than FO:NV, while New Vegas gives off a "humanity rebuilding" feel, FO3 focuses on the apocalypse more and I personally like that about FO3, when I was gambling in casinos on the New Vegas strip it sometimes felt like a Las Vegas Simulator.\nStoryline: So this was my main gripe with Fallout 3, it's storyline, you would think I would have some choice, in Fallout: New Vegas there were 4 different storylines, all with different missions, and even side missions would affect the endings\nFallout: New Vegas Verdict\n9/10","October 9, 2015","true","347.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You have a gigantic world to explore, countless number of side quests in addition to the already meaty and choice-based main quest The gameplay is satisfying and is is the perfect balance between RPG and action shooter. The game easily has over 150 hours of content with all the DLC. It is a proper RPG, letting you play how you want, be it a suave diplomat, a sneaky thief, or a thug with a very big hammer, and has multiple factions to side with for the end-game.\n\nAs someone who played the hell out of this on the Xbox, I got the game again on PC primarily for mods, and if anyone is considering re-buying for that reason, I whole heartedly say do it right now. Modding makes an already great game fantastic and utterly unique to you with thousands upon thousands of mods. Never a fan of any of the armour or weapons? There is probably a mod out there for you. Not a fan of the fast travel system? Get XRE cars and drive around the wasteland. Have Fallout 3 and want one huge game? Get Tale of Two Wastelands and combine them into one big game with the same character. Want the game to be less of an RPG and more of a shooter, with high damage numbers, sprinting and hotkeys for grenades and melee? There are indeed mods that do that. The possibilities are endless, and the main modding website for New Vegas is easy to use, letting you both manually install mods or have an app that does it for you if you aren't confident enough or unsure.  Pretty much any kind of mod you want, it's out there.\n\nThe main downside to a game of this scope if the stability, and while generally stable there are some very common bugs everyone will come across when playing the game. Of course, if you have played any other Bethesda-style RPG you will expect this anyway. I made a post on the forums which has the main ones you will need to make the game stable and mostly bug free:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/522730700736948013/\n\nI can not recommend this game highly enough.

From the moment Ron Perlman mutters the simple opening line to the point in which you look back upon all that you have accomplished before your final decision at Hoover Dam, you experience a world filled with colorful landmarks and memorable people. On the surface, the game and its world seem crude, dirty, and vulgar but once that surface is cracked and you look inwards, you see an arrangement of mysteries and philosophies all waiting to be explored and experienced. Unfortunately, nothing can be perfect, every shining jewel is tarnished in some way or another- and in the case of New Vegas? The game is broken and unstable. You can not spend an hour in the game without experiencing the consequenses of an incredibly low budget and a development time of less than 2 years. Clipping issues, assets becoming distorted, quests not allowing you to progress, and so on. Not to mention the crashing. The game has some of the most insufferable crashes, often forcing you to sign out or restart your PC entirely. The final drawback of the game is its graphics. The game is ugly. It recieved no enhancement over Fallout 3. In fact, a noticeable percentage of assets and textures are borrowed directly from its predecessor. Of course all of these problems listed can be fixed with one simple method: mods. As one of the most heavily modded games of all time, its very difficult to run out of content, whether it be vanilla or added in at your discretion.

I was not disappointed.\n\nFallout: New Vegas feels like a standalone expansion to Fallout 3.  However, this particular standalone expansion brings so much to the game that it may as well have had a 4 slapped onto the end of the title.  The roleplaying aspect is drastically improved with a faction alignment system, a balancing of the skills (all of them are extremely useful throughout the game now), and an incredible and deep storyline that alters the world and the ending based on choices that you have made throughout the game.  As opposed to saying that I enjoyed the story as I did in Fallout 3, New Vegas pulled me in and didn't let go until I'd finished the game in its entirety.\n\nThe more action-FPS aspect of the game was significantly improved in this iteration as well.  Fighting outside of VATS seemed much smoother this time around and was genuinely enjoyable as opposed to merely acceptable.  Crafting was completely overhauled with several different skill lines unlocking hundreds of recipes that were invaluable at differing stages of the game.  The lands around New Vegas were a blast to explore and seemed packed full of life from one side of the map to the other.  Every trip I took across the wasteland resulted in discovering a new location to explore, a caravan being ambushed by the dreaded Caesar's Legion, or any number of other events that were a breath of life in the world.\n\nA great game, and one of my favorites now, that I highly recommend to RPG, FPS, and Post-Apocalyptic fans. I'll definitely be taking at least one more trip back into New Vegas to see what other events, quests, storylines, and endings I can discover by signing on with one of the other factions in the game.\n\n","November 3, 2015","true","61.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Reviews and trailers for Fallout 4 caught my attention, but I wasn't quite ready to dish out the money for a genre I've only started to dabble in recently. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas caught my attention when it was discounted during this past Winter Sale, and I went with Fallout New Vegas because I was worried about Windows 10 and Fallout 3 not being optimized past Windows 7.  I am soon to be 30 hours in and there is someone with almost 4,000 hrs of gameplay out there, I do not regret my choice and it speaks to the opporunity to replay the game when I am done with my first playthrough.\n\nFallout New Vegas welcomed me in without the need to play the previous Fallout games, the storyline is captivating and well-planned thus far. The quests help me to explore an almost open world, exposing me to various creatures and gangs. I am not an expert and no where close to ending the game, but I like the fact that I can choose to replay the game differently by altering my choice of SPECIALS, skills, and choices that in turn affect how the game continues. I have restarted a few times while learning which SPECIALS and skills work best with the character build I am interested in. I finally have a better understanding of the setup and I find that the game provides a challenge without completely sinking and frustrating me as a new player to the genre and franchise. I imagined originally that I wouldn't like it because I don't typicaly play first person shooters but the whole aspect of combining elements of an RPG that I am dabbling with as of late with FPS has suddenly made me more fierce with a gun and explosives. I LOVE that I can cause damage but on the side of good. Some day, maybe I will walk on the darkside to see what else Fallout New Vegas has to offer in terms of quests, but until then I am shooting ghouls, creepy crawlers, and gang members in favor of those in need.","March 20","true","77.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Small towns dot the lands, while remnants of large cities are ridden with bloodthirsty junkies and criminals. While there is so much danger in the world, there is one gem that sticks out and attracts wealthier people from all around: New Vegas. A city protected by a mysterious overseer called "Mr. House", New vegas contains gambling just as much as dirty criminals and squatters.\n\nYou were delivering a package for the Mojave express when you were shot in the head and buried alive by scheming businessman and had your package stolen. You wake up in Goodsprings, a quaint town on the very outskirts of New vegas. The doctor patches you up and sends you on your way. Your Mission: find the man who tried to kill you and get revenge. On your way, you may be having to decide the fate of New Vegas, and maybe, the world.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe gameplay stays true to regular RPGs, with a balanced level system but a low cap at level 30. The game is easy to get used to and does have a more challenging mode for when you become a veteran at the game. Hardcore Mode is a mode that increases the difficulty of the game by giving ammo weight and adding hunger, thirst and the possibility of sleep deprivation. I dont reccomend playing on this mode on your first playthrough, but is a fun twist on the traditional game. The arsenal of guns is truly AMAZING, some obtainable through with expensive purchases while others you may have to do some hunting for. there are a large variety of locations in the game and there is even more if you buy the DLCs. All of them are great in my opinion but you may want to pick up lonesome road and old world blues before any of the others. Both give you interesting new areas to explore and cool storylines (lonesome road is a direct continuation of the story!) and maybe up to 10 hours each of additional gameplay. The game also has an INSANE amount of mods and a great mod community. Head over to the Fallout New Vegas Nexus for most mods.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nThe Graphics are a little dated since it uses the same engine as Fallout 3. The Game also does have a long tutorial period for learning the game, Which can almost stop you from replaying the game a third or fourth time. The "Dead Money" DLC is absolutely horrible, full of ugly puzzles which make you feel like you're not even playing Fallout, More like a horrible and buggy indie stealth-puzzler. The vanilla game is also buggy, some that can even stop you from progressing in the game.\n\nDespite these cons, Fallout NV is a great Shooter-RPG to pick up, and a cheap one at that! I give it an 8/10.\n\n","December 10, 2013","true","126.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

For example, it depends on whether you prefer the blade or guns. After playing Oblivion and Skyrim, I tried this game and was both pleased and turned off. The cool stuff:\nI got a mod that imported Star Wars droids into the game, and they are awesome.\nThe costumes can make your character look awesome!\nThere is a jetpack mod......\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37140/?\nThe main city of New Vegas is pretty nice, and Freeside is fun to explore. The Liberty Loft is the house to get there.\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41822/?\nIn addition, it is easy to be a total bada** in the game, which is pretty fun.\nThe guns are also diverse and fun, the gunplay is solid. There are also throwable weapons (which Skyrim should have).\nThe soundtrack is good.\nThe uncool:\nOblivion and Skyrim spoiled me with beautiful worlds and exciting combat, so I expected a world ripe for exploration and screenshots. However, while it may be great for exploration, its sheer ugliness completely turned me off. On top of that, deadly monsters roam the bleak landscape and serve as bullet sponges, so I ended up being content staying in the City.\nThe NPCs seem fake and are not interesting (if that makes sense).\nThere are some annoying mechanics such as dehydration and radiation. It is fun sometimes and annoying as all heck other times.\nThere are great ENBs, but the game looks bad without them.\n\nI now know that I much prefer Elder Scrolls over Fallout. Although Fallout has its perks, I will always rather invest my time in Oblivion and Skyrim's gorgeous worlds, spells, potions, sword combat, and quests. New Vegas' ugly and unrewarding world, unfortunately, dampened my excitement to do a serious playthrough.\nBut: Do not let this deter you. Try it out for yourself and see if you like the elements this game has that other games do not. Plus, check out the Nexus Mods. There are some pretty cool ones there!","December 26, 2014","true","10.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

The glitches give it that charm that lets you know not to take things too seriously, many laughs to be had. The game provides challenge as long as you play at least Normal and up.\n\nThis game also gives you the option the literally play through the adventure, in many numorous ways whether it be what main story path you'll take (NCR, Caesar, House, You having an entire robot army)\nOn top of that, you're free to decide how you will deal with every situation.

Shun or gain respect with different factions and choose a path of destiny with the bigger factions that play core roles in the main storyline.\n\nThe game is not really too difficult in normal mode but I enjoy playing this game in hardcore mode because it adds more realism to the gameplay, where carrying ammo is counted as weight, injuries take time to heal and ensuring to keep tabs on eating, drinking and sleeping enough.\n\nThe battle system uses VATS, a targetting system that is entertaining to use if  zoned in on an enemy and they happen to have the weirdest expression or pose at the time!\n\nWhat really creates Fallout is the psychological dialogue of the characters encountered, giving clues to a history or a side-story in the background. Some of the characters are so quirky and memorable that it made me gain a thirst for knowledge about the fallout world.\n\nI think you will ♥ this game if you enjoy a combination of RPG, FPS, exploration. Plus there is a lot of DLC to dig into along with completing the main story and exploring all of the wasteland.\n\nOverall, this is one of my most loved games and I have to recommend it as one of the best games I have played, not just for the gameplay but simply for the character and role customisation that has been presented as an adventure. ♥","April 25, 2013","true","328.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/22380/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a "Fallout" game.\n\nIf you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games.\n\nAs someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.\n\nNuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?\nBefore I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, "Coke or Pepsi?"\n\nWhile both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.\n\nQuests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.\n\nEven when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.\n\nSpeaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level—and scaling later—which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.\n\nI personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.\n\nIt's All A Matter of Context\nIf you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed.\n\nQuests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.\n\nFallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children.\n\nIn contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.\n\nAs seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain).\n\nWhat can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.\n\nThe reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse.\n\n"I've Got Heartaches by the Number"\nI would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect.\n\nWhile I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.\n\nThe narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)\n\nThe rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.\n\nFor example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game.\n\nOn the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest.\n\nIf Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.\n\nWith all these gripes being said... the day I stop counting that's the day my world will end.","June 3","true","94.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

I then actually got into the game and met and old man that looked like a child molester. I then made my character. For some reason I decided to make him look like a ♥♥♥♥ing black pedophile who went head first into an ocean of bleach. Thought it would be a good idea to name him 'Long Slong John'. I then immediately stole everything from the old white man. I walked outside and wondered if there was a sprint key, I then realised that the devs decided that thier defintion of sprinting is hobbling along the ground like a man with no arms and no legs struggling to move. Their defintion of walking is the same man but is incapable of remembering to breath. I then went to meet up with Sunny. I walk into the saloon and find Sunny, then I proceed to stare at her Ta-Tas for several minutes. Talk to Sunny and proceeded to ask her to teach me ♥♥♥♥. She said that we are going to shoot some ♥♥♥♥ing bottles. Went out back and shot some bottles like a legend. Talked to Sunny again and asked for work. She said that we could go shoot up some geckos. We then walked like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disabled persosns to the where the geckos were located. At first thought of 'Geckos', I thought that they would be small as ♥♥♥♥ so I then stared directly at the ground. I was sadly mistaken. Some ♥♥♥♥ing big ♥♥♥ Geckos come racing at me. I said and I quote: 'WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THOSE!?', which was then followed by 'AAAARRRRGGGGHHH! GET THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY FROM ME!'. I then killed them Godzilla Geckos and claimed my reward.\n\nWhat a ♥♥♥♥ing hour. Them ♥♥♥♥ing Godzilla Geckos though man, nearly went into the fetal position SMH...\nOverall rating: 10 out of ♥♥♥♥ing 10, would spend most of an hour of my life 'sprinting' as the devs call it again.\nHit me up in my Steam DM's if you would like me to update my Fallout: New Vegas experience with you all, Cheers.","March 2","true","5.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","7","9","8","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalGearLaunchesNukes/recommended/22380/","MetalGearLaunchesNukes","Reggie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalGearLaunchesNukes/","583 products in account","Before I start the main portion of the review: I just want to clarify that I have spent hundreds of hours of Gameplay in the PS3 version of this game and I have played all the DLC in the PS3 version (You can verify, account name: DarkKingSpyder)\nAnd that I'm playing the game with a few graphical mods and as such, this review is on Fallout New Vegas and it's content so I shall not touch upon the subject of visuals as I've modified my visuals.\n\nFallout New Vegas is the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky of the two Bethesda Fallout games, when I say that, I'm mentioning the fact that people see Fallout New Vegas as inferior to 2008's Fallout 3. But this doesn't neccessarily mean that Fallout New Vegas is a bad game, far from it! Just that it's got less content than Fallout 3, but that doesn't mean that the game is short, far from it. But let me explain why I DON'T hold this opinion and find it superior to Fallout 3.\n\nStorywise, this game is a humongous step away from 2008's not-so-open ended Fallout 3. Which had the same ''core'' ending, which was, someone finished Project Purity by sacrificing their lives(which we find out in Broken Steel that they were in a coma for just two weeks). This game can branch off and some quests can be ruined if you take a different method than normal. A minor spoiler: During two quests, named ''Heartache by the Number'' and ''Birds of a Feather'' I had to bring Cass to the Silver Rush in Freeside to collect evidence, when I had done so, I was forced into a giant gunbattle and then I had to end up killing everyone in Silver Rush, which then ended the quests ''Birds of a Feather'', and then later in the game, I get another quest named ''Tend to your own business'', which told me to kill the owners of the Silver Rush, the Van Graff Family. This is a HUGE issue with the game, if you take one branch fully knowing the consequences, then later encounter a quest that you wish to do to progress, you can't, as maybe, you might have done the same task in another quest. This is just one specific case. Which just might be a glitch with my game as I had never bothered with the Birds of a Feather quest on any of my other runs of the game, I just played until the part where they wanted me to deliver a package.\n\nThe 'branches' in the story really is just 4 branches, but within those four, each action changes a ''slide'' of the ending.\nSo, each run can be different AS LONG as you do something different in terms of your actions in a quest. The ''branching'' story paths has only been done right in this Bethesda game. Sure, The Walking Dead does branches nicely, but they change the story minorly rather than locking off CHUNKS of content that is related to working w/ another faction. This alone gives reason on why to replay with a different faction.  Or just reload an early save if you don't want to bother with going back to the Strip for the first time.\n\nOne of the additions to Fallout New Vegas that I loved was Hardcore Mode. Where food, water and sleep actually matter, rather than being means just to fill up your health and if you fast travelled, that could lead to you being more hungry, etc. etc. It's a welcome change to a game as other games don't incorperate this form of roleplaying. Also, if you're new to the  Bethesda Fallout games or newer Bethesda Elder Scrolls games (Oblivion onwards) and wish to do Hardcore mode, I recommend you to buy the ''Courier's Stash'' DLC, as it adds in an item named ''Vault 13 Canteen'' which is a nod to the Vault that the Main Character from Fallout 1 is from and also, is REALLY helpful if you're running through Hardcore.\n\nThe expansion packs in this game was done right BUT. BUT-THERE'S ALWAYS A BUT. There's Dead Money, OH, how I hate Dead Money, and I like difficulty, don't get me wrong but that crap in Dead Money was insane, ESPECIALLY in Hardcore. It's horrible, in terms of level design and how annoying it can be to start Dead Money for the first time and to realize that the only save that is BEFORE starting Dead Money is HOURS behind.\n\nHonest Hearts is a real nice change of pace for Fallout, instead of having the normal Day and Night, there is a new weather effect which is rain and the landscape in Xion is BEAUTIFUL, I can't say how nice it is to be walking around on a mountain, then swim in a river, then calmly walk around in a cave. Everything is nice.\n\nOld World Blues, a hated one by some members of the Community is only hated for the first few minutes, because too much dialogue at the start when you get abducted to start Old World Blues, if you like Sci-Fi, just play it, it's really nice to see a Sci-Fi based DLC as Mothership Zeta wasn't really Sci-Fi but more like what you'd expect in a 1950s/60s film which is nice due to the fact that Fallout seems to be eternally stuck in an era with stuff from the 50s/60s yet the bombs dropped in 2077.\n\nThen, if you play the game's expansions in order, there is Lonesome Road, which is very climactic as it answers all the questions about Ulysses, a mysterious character hinted at in both the base game AND all the DLCs. And getting to him is difficult yet fun (I say difficult because I played the DLC when I was Level 4 when I got it, my main character got destroyed when my PS3's HDD got curropted and I had to replace)\n\nMechanically, it's the same as Fallout 3 but some things have been tweaked. And I also do recommend installing a Sprint Mod as sometimes, it's extremely slow at the start.\n\nDefinitely worth buying the Ultimate Edition or just the Base Game if you don't care much for extra areas.\n\nEDIT: Since I've written this review, I feel I need to include this little part about Tale Of Two Wastelands in this review since I've been recently playing it and I'm in love with it.\nTale of Two Wastelands is a mod that merges Fallout 3 into New Vegas. This adds a little issue about the Lone Wanderer being the Courier, but I personally don't mind that and I just went on with my time. The story of Tale of Two Wastelands goes ''Born in Vault 101, then did Fallout 3 Story, go into Metro, take train west into the Mojave, then start New Vegas story''. Sure, this messes up the lore of FNV and FO3, BUT. I like this as you get the improvements of Fallout New Vegas BUNDLED with FO3. So if you want Traits and Hardcore Mode in Fallout 3? BAM! This mod is good for you.\nHere's the link for the mod: http://taleoftwowastelands.com/\n\nNOTE FOR THE FIRST EDIT, IF YOU WANT TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS, YOU REQUIRE ALL DLC FOR FNV AND FO3 (except the Courier's Stash DLC) AND YOU CAN'T PIRATE ONE GAME TO GET IT TO FUNCTION.\n\nAlso, let me just clarify and go into depth why I prefer Fallout New Vegas compared to Fallout 3. It's just the writing and characters. In Fallout 3, it's not bad, just unbelievable, that doesn't mean that I hate the game, dear god no. I love Fallout 3. But Fallout New Vegas' writing is superior in almost every way (when it comes to 3D Fallouts, I own the 3 2D Fallouts which are Tactics, 1 and 2 but I simply couldn't get into them due to reasons of me being too much of a casualized gamer and unable to get into Isometric Turnbased games. I'll probably get into it in the future, but not now). The development team, Obsidian are brilliant and consist of many people who worked on older Fallouts and understand what they're doing related to the lore, writing and other situations in Fallout.\nFallout New Vegas is the more colourful, more true to the original and definitely insanely fun for those who want more Fallout or just want a brilliant FPS-RPG.","May 10, 2014","true","129.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The atmosphere, design, story, combat, strategy, mechanics, etc. blend perfectly togther into a delectable post-apocolyptic RPG cocktail.  It is more family to me than my own damn family.  Sure, mom packed my school lunches, but Fallout threw me a duster that didn't make me look like a tool, a plasma rifle, and said "Here, my son.  Have a form of aimbot that makes sense and still doesn't ruin the skill aspect of the game."  Honestly, there are so few games out there that have the kind of planning this game does.  Wanna shoot that store owner to get his nice hat? Have fun not getting the one modification you need for a perfect weapon later on.  Wanna shoot up a city?  You better have saved, becuase half of the quests in the game are probably in there.  Literally every action has a reaction in this game -- it's tough, it's gritty, and I love it for that reason.  Not to mention how well a 1950's sci-fi action movie was dressed up to be embodied by lucky players like myself.  Not only this, but lasers and beams are just as effective as bullets and javelins; it's all up to the player to decide.  So do you love story and atmospher just as much as gratuituos violence?

I have written lots of reviews, but their short and generic. I am so enamored by this game i am going to write a full review\n\nFYI, I have not beat the game, or havnt even really touched most of the places or characters or quests. But after 25 hours with so much to do, I feel I can accuratly review the game.\n\nOverall Impressions:\n\nIf you don't want to read a very detailed review of the game, just read this. If you want a detailed review (although u shouldnt be reading reviews and be clicking that buy now button) scroll down a bit.\n\nFirst off, I have not played FO3, so I have no way to compair weather its a better game than that or not. I had heard about fallout and the mascot for me was easily recognizeable when it came out, but I never had much of an intrest in the game or rpgs. Fallout:NV came out and when my friend got it for Xbox 360, I watched some and it looked interesting, but i was into other games and didnt want to play it. last christmas, while it was on sale, I purchased skyrim, my first rpg taste. Now I realize skyrim isnt as much of an rpg as FO but it got my feet wet, and I loved the setting, being an insanly big Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones fan. However, i LOVE EFFING SKYRIM TO DEATH. That made me go wow! I bet Fallout is awesome if Skyrim is this good! So i saw it on sale over haloween and i picked it up along with the witcher, payday 2, dmc4. I played mostly pd2 and dmc and witcher and kinda forgot about FO:NV. However, when I did, I wasnt just hooked like i was 2 skyrim. This became the most fun, and overall meaningful game to my playing to date. All of the options are great, there are a lot of different factions all fighting and weaving in and out and picking some sids but not others is fun and challanging. I havn't touched hardcore mode yet but I bet its fun, I just want to focus on enjoying the game right now before I go shoot myself haha! Anways this game is amazing and a MUST OWN. Now onto specifics\n\nGameplay:\n+Many weapons\n+GORE\n+V.A.T.S. system is a great and not overpowered.\n-spriting\n\nThe gameplay itself is good, it feels good to shoot and the slight waver in your hand adds to the realism and I personally liked the added challenge. However, not being able to sprint, while not bad, can be annoying as I wish I could rush from cover to cover. I give gameplay 9/10\n\nVisuals:\n+Has moments of beauty\n+Destroyed wasteland is great and it all affects the mood of the game\n-runs on old engin so graphics look mostly outdated\n-character models look a bit stiff to me\n\nThis game is 4-5 years old and still looks good! However, it does look outdated and abovementioned stuff 7.5/10\n\nStory:\n+SO Many options\n+tons and tons of ways to progress\n\nTo me the story so far is great. Every faction is interesting and your personal story is very cool. The sidemissions IMO are better than main ones, but the main missions are great so thats saying something. 9.5/10\n\nFinal verdict:\n\n9.5/10\n\nThis is my favorite game of all time. That doesnt mean its a perfect 10. It has a lot of bugs and outdated models, but the game itself is what keeps me going. Anyway thanks for reading!\n\nHODOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","December 2, 2014","true","57.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

It's worth every penny. I didn't expect to like this game as much as I do. I constantly tell myself that I'll do only one quest, yet that's very difficult to follow through with. I'll end up spending hours on end exploring new locations, doing side quests, and just being an awesome wasteland adventurer. Whether which path you choose, good, bad, NCR, legion, or whatever other choice there is (there's plenty), the game never fails to satisfy. There are so many amazing things about this game that will make you want to keep playing. I recommend doing what I did and buy Ultimate Edition because it will give you all of the great DLCs and extra packs for a very good price. It also will help you at the start of a new game. If you dont have Ultimate Edition though, it's all good. The game is just as great with or without it. The DLCs are amazing, but if you don't have them you'll enjoy the game just as much!\n\nPROS: Amazing story, ALOT of side quests, many places to explore, ALOT of replay value (many different ending outcomes), plenty of humor here and there, Amazing DLCs, and pretty much everything else!\n\nCONS: I can't think of any. o:\n\nYou will most likely enjoy this game, I recommend that you play it sometime. 9.5/10","July 8, 2014","true","46.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

There's just so much to do, and that's before you start dabbling in mods of which there are many excellent choices, no matter what it is you're looking for. Yes, there are bugs. But by now the majority of them are hammered out, at least in my experience. New Vegas Script Extender and New Vegas Anti-Crash are must-haves and greatly improve the game's stability.\n\nThe key here is exploration. Put one foot in front of the other for a little while and you're bound to find something cool to get involved in, whether it's a hostage situation in a ruined city or a showdown in a little desert town. The combat is quite fun, but it's the standard fare. You have guns, there are guys over there and ♥♥♥♥ those guys. Speaking of guns, there's an assload of them. Pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, SMG's, sniper rifles and even energy weapons, though I myself prefer conventional firearms, the energy weapons are still pretty badass.\n\nThe storytelling in this game is superb, with little details everywhere. The story of The Survivalist in Zion Canyon is amazing to read through and experience as you seek out his journal entries across the little hideaways he's established throughout the area. There's also the little things like finding a skeleton laying on a bathroom floor in a tophat clutching a revolver that makes you wonder just what that poor guy's story was. The game manages to be dark and hilarious at the same time which is a tough balancing act to pull off.\n\nOverall this game is excellent and will draw you in and not let go. You'll be stuck on this for hours and hours and you'll love every moment.\n\n9/10","July 19, 2014","true","317.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madithamonsta/recommended/22380/","madithamonsta","Madithashrubber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madithamonsta/","124 products in account","Fallout: New Vegas is a game built with the elder scrolls engine, making it extremely moddable. The community is still active, spitting out mods every couple of days. Some of the mods are crap, some of them are worthy of the title: "Mod of the Year". While the elder scrolls engine is known for its bugginess, the bugs are usually either patched or you can get a mod to help with them. If you've played fallout 3 and are expecting more color than that, I assure you that the stock game doesn't have more color. The game changes from fallout 3's greens, greys, and browns to orange, tan, and red. While on the topic of changes, a new feature is "Hardcore Mode" which can either be used to amp up the difficulty for some of the more hardcore gamers, or add a new element to the game for replaying the game. As far as guns go, the base game has a solid selection, but each gun can only have 3 mod slots and most guns don't even have three mods. My reccomendation is to grab WMX(Weapon Mods Expanded), which happens to be a mod, to remedy this. Although it doesn't add more mod slots, it makes sure that EVERY weapon has 3 mods for it. If you miss some of the guns from Fallout 3, go ahead and grab the Fallout 3 weapon pack(also a mod), which i just recently found out has added the Rock-It-Launcher, a Fallout 3 favorite. If you've completed the main game or just want more content, you can either buy some awesome DLCs or look for mods. There are some awesome mods that add entire storylines, factions, and even advanced functionalities. The main location to find mods is either ModDB or The Fallout NV Nexus[www.nexusmods.com].

Turn on true iron sights, install a few mods in the standard practice for Bethesda-engine games, and save often. I'll include a list of my choice mods at the end of the review.\n\nDo save often. Bethesda-engine games are notoriously unstable, and this (built on Oblivion's engine) is no exception!\n\nHowever, the game has good writing, plays fluidly, and delivers an enjoyably varied experience - especially if you play throught he DLC as well. Highly recommended for fans of Fallout who are not purists at heart (the series has diverged from its isometric RPG roots).\n\nI recommend the following mods:\n\n- Underwater Vault Home New Vegas edition (UMHNV) or Afterschool Special\n\nThese are housing mods with a quest to earn their housing. UWHNV requires NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender) and Afterschool special does not. NVSE is worth installing - there are other mods that use it, and it's an invisible modification. (I use the last Beta version, 4.X something and it works well.) UWHNV basically allows you to move the entrance of the home wherever you like and includes a beautiful sorting and display mechanism. Afterschool Special allows you to take over and convert the school in the first town to a home that is simple, compact and effective as well as pretty.\n\n- RHK Companion Cure\n\nCorrects an oversight in Bethesda/Obsidian's companion mechanism, allows you to cure posion in your companions, which is much better than the base mechanics.\n\n- Perk Every Level and Unlimited Traits\n\nThis shifts balance somewhat, allowing the player to build as many of the game's provided traits as desired during character creation. (All of them are tradeoffs of one sort or another.) In my case, I didn't want to forego Weird Wasteland because I chose traits that suited my vision of your character. Perk Every Level will build a more powerful character, but also free you from some of the tyrrany of having too many good options or having to ruthlessly specialize into one playstyle.\n\n- DLC: Old World Blues is the best of the set, followed by DLC: Lonesome Road.\n\nThe others are certainly not bad, but do not live up to these two. If you get the GOTY edition, you'll get them all, but if you're forced to choose, go with these.\n\n- Other mods, like texture and model replacers to taste.\n\nWhat you like will vary. I recommend installing the Nexus Mod Manager, and using it to manage your mods as painlessly as possible (everything except NVSE which must be manually installed).\n\nGet it. Get it now. Enjoy it.","March 1, 2014","true","546.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

War never changes. Except for the occasional crash and bugs, but that's typical of a game with little development cycle.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is a first-person action RPG, much like its predecessor, Fallout 3. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, it is set in the Mojave Wasteland, closer to where the original games were set. Your customizable character’s a Courier, shot and left for dead by a man named Benny interested in a package you were delivering. Following through your trail for revenge, you find that the major factions in the region--The New California Republic, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr. House--vying for complete control of the Mojave wasteland. It’s up to you whether or not any of the three, or yourself, would take over the Dam.\n\nThe NCR is a lot like the US, both the good and the bad. Most of the time, they mean well. In the game, they spread out a lot, using up quite a bit of their resources to cover their new land in the process. This puts them at a disadvantage after the first battle at the Dam against the Legion. Caesar's Legion, in theory, is supposed to be the Roman Empire. But it's filled with misogyny, homophobia, and slavery. There's Mr. House, an expy of Howard Hughes. While he wants to improve humanity in his own way, he's extremely ruthless in his dealings. And there's the Wild Card path, where you set the Mojave down a path of independence and anarchy, alienating the other main factions in the process.\n\nIn addition, there are four major DLCs (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues¸ and Lonesome Road), each having its own story, and two additional DLCs (Courier’s Stash--pre-order bonuses--and Gun Runners’ Arsenal—more weapons).\n\nI really enjoyed the game largely due to the writing, along with a lot of replayability. However, I feel that there was a lack of real motivation deciding which faction to assist in taking over Hoover Dam, and I felt that your character lacked a bit of personaity compared to other RPG characters. Even the Lone Wanderer had plenty of personality (c'mon. "No. ♥♥♥♥ you."). As mentioned earlier, there were a lot of game-breaking bugs, especially at launch. But thankfully mods and patches had gotten rid of them, but a few of them are still there, so mind where you travel.\n\nBecause of the small development cycle, there are plenty of missed opportunities, like exploring Legion territories and continuing the game after the second battle of Hoover Dam. My suggestion for this game? I would recommend getting this game and its DLCs, which is easy to do with buying the Ultimite Edition. But do take your time on the Nexus; they got plenty of mods that'll enhance the game immensely.","November 2, 2013","true","983.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Fallout 3 is still an amazing game it just doesn't feel as energetic.\n\nWith Fallout: New Vegas the world feels more alive. With massive amounts of weapons, armor, and mostly MODS.

I feel that regardless of to what extent I praise FNV, I will still not be doing it justice.\nFallout as a series has grown from some seriously humble roots, and what it has become is one of the finest post-apocalyptic open world RPGs to date. The world is alive, desperate, detailed, immersive and a true wonder to explore. Within this incredible world are some of the most spectacularly realized NPCs and stories ever conceived by Bethesda. The last time I remember being so aware of the lives around me was when I first played Morrowind.\nAs if the vanilla game wasn’t amazing enough, the modding community is seemingly limitless. From tower defense, to a first person shooter overhaul, to countless add on stories and scenarios, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of content to lose yourself in.\nThe ultimate kicker here is that Fallout: New Vegas is CONSTANTLY on sale. And not just dinky 15% off specials, during any given steam sale, FNV is almost always on sale for 2 or 3 bucks at some point.

Give the entire mojave a makeover, or implement zombies, the choice is yours! The modding community is very much active and helpful.\n\nCons:\n-Game crashes. You will have a few, guaranteed. Not sure if there is a memory leak or not, the game does have a spike in RAM usage when loading new areas. I have 8GB and have not really had many issues at all. I personally only had crash issues related to mod usage. Friends' crash issues are with the vanilla game, do not know why. I think I can remedy any issues with a 16GB RAM upgrade.\n-Sometimes there will be bugs where you may not be able to access particular dialogue that will activate the next part of a quest, this has been rare in my experience and can only be remedied with a load to a previous save. So on that note, save often.\n-Without atmosphere mods (Neveda Skies is one of the best, also various ENBs are pretty cool) the vanilla atmosphere does not carry the same feeling as Fallout 3. I don't know if this was intentional, I get the impression that game-makers where trying to show an america where the world is very much accustomed to the new-world.\n-Not an issue for me, but the game can seem slow at times.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing experience that I recommend to anybody who has a little patience. The game gives the land of fallout, another breath of fresh air, which has been welcomed and embraced by many.\n\nEdit: Now have 16 gigs of RAM.

Despite having played other Fallout games in the past, I intend to write a (short and sweet) review that addresses New vegas in a fair manner, and hopefully while attempting to remain unbiased. Here it goes!\n\nGeneral notes\nFirst and foremost, as far as Fallout game comparison goes, New Vegas did not bring a lot of renewing elements to the genre. However, New Vegas does offer a very solid story, an immersive world and a fun atmosphere to be in. Moreover, the world surrounding the player is quite vast.\n\nGame world\nNew Vegas contains a variety of dungeons for questing, looting and satisfying the player's homicidal needs. These dungeons come in various forms and shapes such as Vaults, caves and buildings. Additionally, there are faction camps, towns and similar places, where the player mainly interacts with NPCs. Above all, I consider "The Strip" to be an absolutely terrific aspect of New Vegas. It's quite refreshing to visit The Strip and have a change of scenery after poking around the desert for a while.\n\nQuesting\nNew Vegas provides a large variety of quests that initially aid the player in getting familiarized with the game, the various factions and the implications of making certain choices. More quests and quest lines will be available as the player continues to discover new areas, NPCS and factions. In my experience, it is not possible to complete all available quests in a single playthrough. This is primarily caused by faction disputes and the implications of completing a quest for a certain faction. As a result, an opposing faction might regard you as an enemy, and thus no longer willing to make use of your "services".\n\nDLCs\nNew Vegas offers a decent number of DLCs that will keep you going for a while. These DLCs often introduce new areas, weapons, companions and relevant quest lines.\n\nBugs\nNew Vegas is quite a buggy game, probably the buggiest Fallout game I have encountered so far. Game sometimes crashes when attempting to fast travel in the main world. This happens very often in the DLC areas. I have encountered a fair share of bugs with the companions as well. Sometimes they get stuck in walls, doors and rocks, or sometimes they just completely disappear when entering a dungeon for example.\n\nGraphics\nWith regard to graphics, there is not much to say about New Vegas. The game simply does not offer a state of the art experience for the graphics enthusiasts out there. However, certainly not displeasing and good enough to keep the player going.\n\nFinal verdict\nNew Vegas is an absolutely terrific game that provides hours of pleasure for the player. It offers a great story, immersive game world and a fallout experience that far outweigh the current bugs and not so advanced Graphics in the game. I would certainly recommend this game to new players and the Fallout veterans.\n\n-Sean","January 4, 2015","true","55.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mormacil/recommended/22380/","Mormacil","Mormacil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mormacil/","504 products in account","Fallout New Vegas, the follow up game after Bethesda took the Fallout series into the action RPG territory with Fallout 3. Unlike Fallout 3 this is an Obsidian game which is both a blessing and a curse but less a curse then generally found with their games. It iterates heavily on Fallout 3 but it does a few things better. Like most Obsidian games FNV has great writing. This translates to better companions, quests and playerchoice compared to Fallout 3. However it lacks some of the personality of Fallout 3 who's start is far superior.\n\nNow onto the game itself. It controls like most Bethesda games, in either first or thirth person, optimized for the former. You most likely fight with either energy or ballistic based weaponry, which uses ammo. Unlike most Bethesda games the game is heavily fragmented into levels. Actions have hard caps, if the cap is at 25, 12, 23 or 24 in a skill will be equally useles. Enemies will level up with so, as will gear but it's less free in that aspect then the later Bethesda games. Another one of thise differences is choice. You can't complete the game 100% in one playthrough. The quests demand choice, generally between shades of grey instead of black or white and there is no optimal ending to the game. Yes unlike Bethesda games this game ends, at the end of the mainquest you'll get the credits roll and that's it.\n\nHowever in my eyes the jounrey is marvelous. You start in a basic western town, work your way up across the world in an attempt to make it to Vegas. You'll interact with different factions, find loot, hone your skills. Vegas won't be your end however. From there on the game opens up and starts demanding choices who you'll befriend and who you'll kill for profit or pleasure. The game has a lot of choice. Especially modded in true Bethesda custom. I've played a neutral minded combination of a samurai and a cowboy. Focussing on heavy armor, melee weaponry and comboy themed guns. No miniguns, lasersrifles, rocketlaunchers or sneaky powerfist attacks. But I also played a cannabilistic scientist with a knack for punching things or vaporizing them. All is possible, to sneak your way through, talk your way out or if all fails beat some heads to pulp with a steel pipe and then eating their corpses.","April 25, 2014","true","362.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In addition to more choices the developers have introduced a reputation system, you do something good like help a community you will be liked more, but if you do things they do not like your reputation will go down. All of this matters in the endgame, who will support you depending on what side you took.\n\nLike many of RPG you will encounter people, you will talk to people. Throughout your travels you will meet interesting people you either like or dislike, all characters of importance are interesting, they have a story to tell, from Mr House overlord of the strip to the super mutants in Jacobstown.\n\nThe graphics honestly are not anything to brag about. There is little change from Fallout 3, a few things have been brought over. But Fallout has never been known for their graphics, it has been for the story. If you are really bugged by the graphics you could just go and get a mod for it, there are plenty.\n\nVATS is back, along with other gameplay elements that made Fallout 3 popular. There have been changes made as well, more immersive elements have been added, like making ammunition, more crafting options, more weapons types, gambling and many more. I would not be recommending this game if there was no change, but there is change and it is a good change.\n\nActive community, Mods! The community is super active for mods, so many mods mods mods mods.\n\nLastly the DLC. Lonesome road, Dead money, Old Wolrd Blues and honest hearts. All of them are good in their own respects but this review is looking at the core game, reviews for the DLC's will be on their respective pages or elsewhere.\n\nFallout New Vegas is a game that is a game I will definitely recommend to anybody that asks.","September 16, 2013","true","83.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the Mojave Desert/Wasteland. The Mojave Wasteland isn't as interesting as the D.C. Wasteland in Fallout 3, but it still gives you a good Fallout experience.

A very extensive modding community. Which add's replayability.\n3. It's a Fallout game. Who wouldn't like a Fallout game?\n4. Has a lot of side quest's. Unlike Fallout 3.\n5.

A story of grit, deceit, and revenge. The story of a courier who got caught at the bad place at the worst time. After being shot and left for dead, the courier is seemingly brought back from the dead by Doc mitchell. After being let loose into the small town of goodsprings, and learning the ropes of the new survival system, you are set loose into the Nevada wastes. Dead set on revenge, the story is wonderful with many endings. Each one of your actions with the factions, your followers, the main story, the route you take, and even the smallest things (such as replacing a cyborg dogs brain ). The gameplay has not changed too much from fallout 3, using the same engine and all. The endings are all written to perfection, the legion, the ncr, and the independant vegas endings are all satisfying to accomplish. The followers system has been improved on in many ways, the most standout being the new companion wheel. Being able to give your companion stimpaks and orders is much more simple. That and the followers are amazing, and the way you recruit them is more interesting than Fallout 3. The soundtrack is what you would expect from a fallout game, 40s to 50s era music, and its wonderful. How do I know all of this with only 13 hours? I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of the playstation 3 version.

The community is still active, spitting out mods every couple of days. Some of the mods are crap, some of them are worthy of the title: "Mod of the Year". While the elder scrolls engine is known for its bugginess, the bugs are usually either patched or you can get a mod to help with them. If you've played fallout 3 and are expecting more color than that, I assure you that the stock game doesn't have more color. The game changes from fallout 3's greens, greys, and browns to orange, tan, and red. While on the topic of changes, a new feature is "Hardcore Mode" which can either be used to amp up the difficulty for some of the more hardcore gamers, or add a new element to the game for replaying the game. As far as guns go, the base game has a solid selection, but each gun can only have 3 mod slots and most guns don't even have three mods. My reccomendation is to grab WMX(Weapon Mods Expanded), which happens to be a mod, to remedy this. Although it doesn't add more mod slots, it makes sure that EVERY weapon has 3 mods for it. If you miss some of the guns from Fallout 3, go ahead and grab the Fallout 3 weapon pack(also a mod), which i just recently found out has added the Rock-It-Launcher, a Fallout 3 favorite. If you've completed the main game or just want more content, you can either buy some awesome DLCs or look for mods. There are some awesome mods that add entire storylines, factions, and even advanced functionalities. The main location to find mods is either ModDB or The Fallout NV Nexus[www.nexusmods.com].

Turn on true iron sights, install a few mods in the standard practice for Bethesda-engine games, and save often. I'll include a list of my choice mods at the end of the review.\n\nDo save often. Bethesda-engine games are notoriously unstable, and this (built on Oblivion's engine) is no exception!\n\nHowever, the game has good writing, plays fluidly, and delivers an enjoyably varied experience - especially if you play throught he DLC as well. Highly recommended for fans of Fallout who are not purists at heart (the series has diverged from its isometric RPG roots).\n\nI recommend the following mods:\n\n- Underwater Vault Home New Vegas edition (UMHNV) or Afterschool Special\n\nThese are housing mods with a quest to earn their housing. UWHNV requires NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender) and Afterschool special does not. NVSE is worth installing - there are other mods that use it, and it's an invisible modification. (I use the last Beta version, 4.X something and it works well.) UWHNV basically allows you to move the entrance of the home wherever you like and includes a beautiful sorting and display mechanism. Afterschool Special allows you to take over and convert the school in the first town to a home that is simple, compact and effective as well as pretty.\n\n- RHK Companion Cure\n\nCorrects an oversight in Bethesda/Obsidian's companion mechanism, allows you to cure posion in your companions, which is much better than the base mechanics.\n\n- Perk Every Level and Unlimited Traits\n\nThis shifts balance somewhat, allowing the player to build as many of the game's provided traits as desired during character creation. (All of them are tradeoffs of one sort or another.) In my case, I didn't want to forego Weird Wasteland because I chose traits that suited my vision of your character. Perk Every Level will build a more powerful character, but also free you from some of the tyrrany of having too many good options or having to ruthlessly specialize into one playstyle.\n\n- DLC: Old World Blues is the best of the set, followed by DLC: Lonesome Road.\n\nThe others are certainly not bad, but do not live up to these two. If you get the GOTY edition, you'll get them all, but if you're forced to choose, go with these.\n\n- Other mods, like texture and model replacers to taste.\n\nWhat you like will vary. I recommend installing the Nexus Mod Manager, and using it to manage your mods as painlessly as possible (everything except NVSE which must be manually installed).\n\nGet it. Get it now.

Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the Mojave Desert/Wasteland. The Mojave Wasteland isn't as interesting as the D.C. Wasteland in Fallout 3, but it still gives you a good Fallout experience. Now, I've played New Vegas for about 300 hours on the PC, but i have got New Vegas for the XBOX 360 and for PS3. On the PS3 I have played for nearly a 700 hours. XBOX 360 Version was about the same as the PS3 (obviously), but haven't played since my save files got corrupt.\n\nPro's:\n1. Excellent Gameplay. Like i mean this it's really good.\n2. A very extensive modding community. Which add's replayability.\n3. It's a Fallout game. Who wouldn't like a Fallout game?\n4. Has a lot of side quest's. Unlike Fallout 3.\n5. Has ironsights on weapons. Unlike Fallout 3.\n6. Interesting NPC's. Well not that interesting, but still...\n\nCon's\n1. The Mojave Wasteland isn't a very interesting place.\n2. The PC port is bull$hit, but you can fix the problem's in 10 minutes or so.\n3. Annoying stutters. Many mod's to fix them (30Hz Microstutter's are still noticeable).\n\nI highly recommend you to buy this game. It's hella awesome.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, mods are very easy to install.\n\nEDIT 2: It's September 14, 2015 and only 56 day's remaining till Fallout 4!!","June 7, 2014","true","421.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

In addition to more choices the developers have introduced a reputation system, you do something good like help a community you will be liked more, but if you do things they do not like your reputation will go down. All of this matters in the endgame, who will support you depending on what side you took.\n\nLike many of RPG you will encounter people, you will talk to people. Throughout your travels you will meet interesting people you either like or dislike, all characters of importance are interesting, they have a story to tell, from Mr House overlord of the strip to the super mutants in Jacobstown.\n\nThe graphics honestly are not anything to brag about. There is little change from Fallout 3, a few things have been brought over. But Fallout has never been known for their graphics, it has been for the story. If you are really bugged by the graphics you could just go and get a mod for it, there are plenty.\n\nVATS is back, along with other gameplay elements that made Fallout 3 popular. There have been changes made as well, more immersive elements have been added, like making ammunition, more crafting options, more weapons types, gambling and many more. I would not be recommending this game if there was no change, but there is change and it is a good change.\n\nActive community, Mods! The community is super active for mods, so many mods mods mods mods.\n\nLastly the DLC. Lonesome road, Dead money, Old Wolrd Blues and honest hearts. All of them are good in their own respects but this review is looking at the core game, reviews for the DLC's will be on their respective pages or elsewhere.\n\nFallout New Vegas is a game that is a game I will definitely recommend to anybody that asks.","September 16, 2013","true","83.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As the first Fallout game I've ever owned and played, I guess I can't say too much about New Vegas in comparison to its predecessors, but I think the game is just amazing overall. So far, the main story is great, the combat is spread out and fun, and there's just a lot to do. I would say that a half of the time I've spent playing the game I've been exploring the landscape for loot and discovering new places that aren't on the map which then leads to new quests. Character development is also another enjoyable factor of the game I've found whether you're going with a stealthy, assassin like character or a full out explosives one. Much like what Bethesda did in Skyrim, all the choices are yours to make.\n\nAlthough I have played this game for quite a bit of time (some will probably disagree, like those with 400+), I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of this game. I'm looking forward to finishing it in the future and then eagerly waiting for Fallout 4's release\n\n9.5/10","January 15, 2015","true","63.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

A story of grit, deceit, and revenge. The story of a courier who got caught at the bad place at the worst time. After being shot and left for dead, the courier is seemingly brought back from the dead by Doc mitchell. After being let loose into the small town of goodsprings, and learning the ropes of the new survival system, you are set loose into the Nevada wastes. Dead set on revenge, the story is wonderful with many endings. Each one of your actions with the factions, your followers, the main story, the route you take, and even the smallest things (such as replacing a cyborg dogs brain ). The gameplay has not changed too much from fallout 3, using the same engine and all. The endings are all written to perfection, the legion, the ncr, and the independant vegas endings are all satisfying to accomplish. The followers system has been improved on in many ways, the most standout being the new companion wheel. Being able to give your companion stimpaks and orders is much more simple. That and the followers are amazing, and the way you recruit them is more interesting than Fallout 3. The soundtrack is what you would expect from a fallout game, 40s to 50s era music, and its wonderful. How do I know all of this with only 13 hours? I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of the playstation 3 version.

This follow up developed by Obsidian Entertainement would not only meet fan expectations across the board but raise the bar of quality and world building for Western RPG's as a genre.\n\nWhat makes New Vegas a great game compared to it's contempararies is the level of depth and thoughtfulness when it came to presenting it's setting. The people, towns, and factions are all handled incredibly realistically, to the extent where each settlement has it's own food source and way of income. Comparitively in Fallout 3, such details are completely glossed over, leaving some very impractical settlements scattered about the wasteland.\n\nSince this game uses the same engine as Fallout 3, Obsidian had the luxury of improving where they Bethesda left off. As a result, players have the ability to aim down the sight of their weapons, switch between different ammo types, weapon modding, companion quests/companion perks, and a hardcore mode which offers even more gameplay mechanics to the mix.\n\nPersonally, I'd say my favorite aspect of New Vegas is the thriving mod community that continues to still produce more content on already 100 + hour experience.\n\nIf you're into games that present world worth engaging yourself in as well a wealth of opportunities for player expression, then New Vegas is definitely worth the purchase. Easily one of the best games of last generation.","January 18, 2015","true","154.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Certain will be or wont be available if you do certain things (it wont destroy your game experience, you'll still be able to finish it even if you slaughter a faction.. or two like I did)\n-The gameplay feels great\n-I really enjoy exploring the mojave BUT sometimes it feels a little empty..\n-Obviously the graphisms are bad according to today's standards but theres tons of graphic mods on the nexus mod.\n-The interface is okay. Could be better tho.\n-Some ennemies dont respawn or very rarely (cf : Our quarry junction buddies).\n\nI really recommend this game. The replayability seems quite high (like uhm theres multiple endings and also the hardcore mode that makes your game... hardcore).\nNew Vegas is a must have imo and its not even expensive.","January 20","true","114.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Blowing off a Mutant's head with your Hunting Rifle while listening to your radio is throughly satisfying but be aware that this game isn't for everyone. If you've played Skyrim and are expecting more of the lively, beautiful and colorful landscapes of Tamriel in New Vegas, you're in for a disappointment.\n\nNew Vegas is not pretty. It's run-down, gloomy, abandoned and depressing. But that's the point. You're supposed to feel isolated and feel out of place in the vast wasteland of Nevada. This is by no means, the game's con but rather, its pro. Obsidian nails the feeling of a post-apocalyptic world and the characters that fill this world is where New Vegas truly shines. You'll come across hundreds of NPCs, each with their own interesting, serious and often, hilarious backstories. It's these characters that bring the game and its story to life. On that note, the story is decent and keeps the game moving and depending on your choices, the game's ending will be affected. As a result, the game offers abundant replay value and can easily extend over 60 hours and counting (that's being really conservative).\n\nThe choices you make aren't superficial like most games that advertise a "choice system." In New Vegas, your choices have hard consequences whether it's making a faction hate/like you or killing off an NPC. Yes, you can kill ANY character you see in the game (besides children, although there's a mod that allows you to kill children as well) so the choices are quite unlimited. Doing this can cause you to fail certain quests because a specific character is dead so you should probably think twice before letting someone bite the bullet.\n\nGraphically, New Vegas isn't that great. In some areas, it's actually pretty ugly with some sloppy textures and the vanilla models are pretty basic. The animations are a bit stiff and clunky as well. Other times, the game looks good and mods can do wonders for the game and completely change how the game looks, making for an even more immersive experience. However, New Vegas shouldn't be looked upon for its graphics. It should be judged by how much flexibility and options it gives to the player in terms of its characters and story. That's where most of the satisfaction is going to come from.\n\nIf you're sitting on the fence for this game, go ahead and pick it up, especially when it's on sale. For it's occasional on-sale price tag of $2.49, this game is an absolute bargain. You may have to spend a couple of hours to really get into the game and enjoy it fully because I had to at first. But once I did, I couldn't put it down. Fallout: New Vegas is a really unprecedented experience and one that I feel many people should give a chance.\n\nI look forward to the next installment in the Fallout franchise.","August 18, 2014","true","129.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTrueSlom/recommended/22380/","TheTrueSlom","The Real Slom Shady","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTrueSlom/","65 products in account","As if it weren't clear enough already from it being on the same engine with the same controls and having the same thing where all the female characters look like a more boyish Natalie Portman, New Vegas is functionally just an expansion pack of Fallout 3, and I said everything I needed to say about Fallout 3 in my Fallout 3 review of Fallout 3.\n\nThere is one interesting new feature, though: hardcore mode, which has the need to regularly eat, sleep, and drink while traveling, which sounded like fun, in a Bear Grylls-y kind of way. And this is a role-playing game, so let's mother♥♥♥♥ing roleplay!\n\nDay One\n\nWoke up in a doctor's office with some guy telling me I'd been shot in the head and may have suffered brain damage, but I've learned not to trust the opinion of giant mustachioed spider people, so I made my excuses and left.\n\nThe town I found myself in was pleasant enough, with all kinds of useful supplies that residents were just giving away - that is to say, not supervising. But everyone seemed to think I wanted to go in pursuit of the bloke who shot my brain, but I'd have thought the fact that he shot me in the brain was a ♥♥♥♥ing good reason to not pursue the guy.\n\nI keep hearing about this New Vegas place that sounds like a happening kind of town, daddy-o, and the most direct route is north, so after loading myself down with other people's packed lunches I set off on the north road with a song in my heart and was immediately eaten by giant killer flies. Starting to feel I might not be the master of my own destiny.\n\nFine, whatever. After reloading - I mean, err, reincarnating - I went south instead, and thankfully no cosmic anvils descended from on high. After a peaceful walk through the lovely countryside, I began to feel thirsty, so I drank some pilfered soda bottles that boasted a +H2O effect and was about to set off again when I suddenly became dehydrated. While double-checking that I wasn't wearing ♥♥♥♥ing arctic gear, I noticed that my bottles of purified water had a -H2O effect. Oh, I see, the H2O stat refers to how much water you need, not how much you have. Well, that's ♥♥♥♥ing confusing. When does a plus sign ever indicate a negative effect? Wait a second, drinking soda makes me more thirsty? How does that make any ♥♥♥♥ing sense? Is it made of seawater?\n\nAnyway, the sun was hanging low in the sky like the carrot being dangled from the fishing rod of destiny, and I needed somewhere to sleep. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a repurposed prison populated by the gang whose members have been randomly attacking me all day, but I didn't bear a grudge, because they'd all learned combat from watching their hamsters playfighting and died easier than the ♥♥♥♥ing flies. They wouldn't let me in until I paid 100 caps, though. I'm pretty sure Disneyland doesn't charge that much, so I turned away and moved on. Then I stood on a mine and my legs blew off. Perspective thus gained, I sheepishly dragged myself back to prison and gave them all my money, but then the prison doctor wanted another 75 quid to glue my legs back on. But just as fate had lodged its spiked butt plug as far as it could go, the kindly prison storekeeper was nice enough to just give away 200 caps out of a strongbox in a locked room behind several armed guards. So with a net profit and two shiny new legs fresh from the wrapper, I settled down that night on a prison mattress that smelled like it'd seen its fair share of brutal romantic conquests.\n\nDay Two\n\nAs I stole breakfast, I was beginning to sense some hostility from these murderers. I decided there and then that I had to stop stealing things. While there didn't seem to be any negative consequences for having low karma, it was sucking all the survivalist fun out of the game -- I mean, my life.\n\nI set off on a southeasterly direction and was attacked by bandits who I could now kill from a smug position of moral superiority. Then I took all their stuff, which isn't stealing because they attacked me, making it mine by international law of go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves.\n\nI've been using a pistol and rifle and found myself relying less on the VATS aiming system, because I don't want to have to go to make a cup of tea every time I pull the trigger, but when manually aiming, my pistol seemed more accurate than my rifle, because the rifle sights look like I'm aiming down a ♥♥♥♥ing brick.\n\nI reached the next settlement on the road to find it taken over by Roman legionaries, but they seemed like quite friendly chaps who just want me to admire their modern art project, which unfortunately involved nailing everyone who could have sold me supplies or a bed for the night to bits of wood. So after letting one of their dogs bite my arm off, I hiked northeast to the next settlement, where I found a doctor for my arm and a kindly old couple who let me drink out of their toilet.\n\nDay Three\n\nThe morning got off to a flying start when I blundered into a hostage situation at the next town between local law enforcement and some gang who had taken two of their members hostage. I managed to convince the leader of the soldiers to let me try negotiating, but really I only wanted to loot the abandoned buildings for water and breakfast cereal. I felt bad on my way out, though, so I shot one of the gang members in the head and ran behind the soldiers as the battle broke out. Tee hee. But then the soldiers massacred the gang with no difficulty. You lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! What did you need me for? They didn't even shoot the hostages, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I didn't realize the gangs were hiring from girl scout troops.\n\nAnyway, I was now within groping distance of my destination, and I strolled confidently up to the magnificent steel barricade of New Vegas. Then I had to stroll confidently all the way around the ♥♥♥♥ing thing looking for the entrance. Eventually that got sorted out, and I found myself in a delightful little suburb on the way into New Vegas proper, which security wouldn't let me into because I didn't have 2,000 caps on me, which I estimated was slightly more money than there existed in the world. But I'd come too far to pull out and spoil the bedspread now, so nearby I found a bar willing to employ me to collect some debts from some locals, and then I just kept all the money for myself. Ha! Stupid trusting jerks.\n\nAnd then I made it. I stepped out into the glittering lights of the city, the towering buildings noisy monoliths to the sheer potential of why the ♥♥♥♥ can't I move? The game froze up! I mean, my life froze up! I mean, all that radioactive toilet water must have given me some kind of paralyzing - oh, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to this. Roleplaying in Fallout 3 is difficult enough with the interface and the terrifying fixed-eye contact conversations without it bugging out as well, and it will take more than having to stop for a sandwich and a ♥♥♥♥ every now and again to make Fallout 3 more immersive. Maybe if you ground it into powder and dissolved it in a swimming pool, but it'd probably only turn the water brown.","October 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

The first two titles regularly feature on the greatest games lists despite the unfinished, buggy and censored-in-EU nature of the second game in particular, which at the time gave a sadomasochistic mix of pain and pleasure. The legend is justified, of course, with complex mechanics married to equally complex storytelling. The original vision mixed surreal elements and pop-culture references with pitch-black realism and a psychotic wit. The series was awoken from slumber by Bethesda with Fallout 3, which met with success and acclaim at the time, triumphing over the scepticism of the community. Whatever the merits of 3 as a game, it was ultimately undone by paper-thin, artificial writing with the finest elements being simple allusions to what came before.\n\nWith New Vegas Bethesda did the best possible decision by giving the development duties to Obsidian Entertainment and the brilliant veterans within. New Vegas is a classic Fallout in the good and the bad. The game was released in an incomplete state to say the least, with a rotating head greeting players in a moment of true horror comedy... with many such moments following. Apart from the glitches there was much cut content which the mod community has done its best to restore. This is all classic Fallout indeed as is fortunately the game beneath the problems. Instead of merely repeating or referencing the previous entries Obisidian chose to reimagine the Fallout as a post-apocalyptic Western, building on tradition without being trapped in it.\n\nThe gameplay is by and large the same as in 3, with added subtleties, some of which were inspired by Fallout 3 mods. The optional Hardcore mode made food, water and sleep vital which was a pleasure-adding limitation. The perk tree was changed more and the skill tree a bit less, mostly for the better. Crafting is fun but not always necessary and stealth is simply much too powerful. Chems and alcohol give extremely useful boosts and addictions are so easy to cure that The Courier will most likely spend most of the game high out of his mind, yet reasoning calmly all the while. Certain perks are virtually mandatory with other ones being useless if not outright broken. Charisma is infamous for being the dump stat with virtually no use, Karma does not affect anything, a high Speech skill outweighs all the in-game roleplaying choices, the difficulty slider is both crude and shallow -- et cetera, et cetera ad nauseaum. There is only so much mods can do.\n\nBut while the mechanics can be criticized to no end New Vegas is a truly great game, one no games lover should pass. Whatever "it" is, the magic that makes any great game an another world, New Vegas has it. No magic can be dissected and analyzed but one can try to describe it. Thinking back on my time in the Mojave it is the people I remember, from the dignified to the funny... and the brutal. The articulate megalomania of Caesar, the resigned and humane smart-assery of ghoul mechanic Raul Tejada and the swanky sociopathy of Benny are all unforgettable, as is Mr. New Vegas, the greatest gentleman to ever grace the radio waves. Even secondary characters like a certain ghoul prophet or an extremely likeable Elvis impersonator leading a gang of Elvis impersonators leave a permanent impression. The DLCs follow suit, with Joshua Graham in Honest Hearts being a personal favorite. He has a history of atrocities he tries to atone for but finds it easiest to do so by committing even more atrocities. He describes his antagonist, the raider chief Salt-Upon-Wounds thus: "He is a butcher. I feel the godless fire burning in him well, for I have felt it too." Joshua wants to kill the things he does not accept in himself, which is a very human thing to do, for better or for worse.\n\nAll these characters are given true life by a cast that can only be described as unique. There are the famed veterans, such as Keith Szarabajka as Joshua Graham but then there are many unusual suspects like Kris Kristofferson as Chief Hanlon or Wayne Newton as Mr. New Vegas that all make me wish they would find alternate careers in voice acting. This applies in particular to the greatest surprise in the cast, Matthew Perry as Benny. This is his only VA performance to date but he brings such reptilian, smooth-talking calculations to the table it is very nearly enough to make one think he has been miscast all these years in his other work.\n\nAs for the graphics, sounds and much else the only thing that needs to be said is that there are mods for it all, more than enough to make the game your own. The DLCs are some of the best I've seen, the survival-horror-meets-casino-heist of Dead Money and the loopy Old World Blues being equally great for their very different reasons, with the always underrated Honest Hearts being my favorite of the bunch. (There is a fourth, Lonesome Road, but I have yet to play it.) The mods also fix all the bugs and the glitches and the JSawyer mod rebalances the game extremely well. Given the package price at which New Vegas sells the only conceivable reason to not play is the damage it will do to your free time. New Vegas may not have been developed by Bethesda but is nonetheless the greatest "Live another life, in another world" gaming experience associated with them.","December 21, 2013","true","399.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Personally, I think New Vegas is the better of the two, and here's why.\n\nNew Vegas, whilst it isn't as large as Fallout 3, still packs an awful lot of content into it's self. Whilst most of the map is a barren landscape, New Vegas is FULL of hiden quests, items, easter eggs and just swarming with things to do.\n\nWhilst it doesn't add much new to the Fallout series, in no means does it feel like a Fallout 3 copy. The story is great, full of twists and turns and most importatnly, player options. You get to choose how you want the grand finale to go, wheter it's the easiest way or the hardest. After you complete the main Act's, you still have a ton of places to explore, quests to solve, and DLC to download!\n\nMy only problem with this game, is linked quests. For example, to progress one Main Act quest, you must complete either a very long side quest, or various little side quests that usually offer no impact on the player or story. This is not a fun way to play, and it feels like the game is forcing these quests on me, rather than letting me have the freedom of choice, like the title the game holds dear to its self.\n\n+ Story is very interesting, player involvement heavily influences it\n+ Hundreds of hours of content, including 6 DLC expansions\n+ You really feel as if you make in impact in the game universe\n+ The Wild Wasteland perk. Nuff said.\n\n- Alot of grinding is required for some parts of the game\n- Enforced quests are not fun\n- AI is sometimes sloppy, but nothing too major\n\n9.5/10","July 19, 2013","true","159.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The gameplay is nice just frustrated the game dosent autosave more often cause i die... alot...\nYou will have fun with all the different weapons and quests but if your like me and like to do the main story first before side quests then its fun aswell. The charater all all uniqe i guess espect the robots, i havent gotten that far into the game but so far its awsome, if you like skyrim and games like that you will love this game.

The graphics are overall great and no lag like pepole say there are if you have lag that must be your pc then. The gameplay is nice just frustrated the game dosent autosave more often cause i die... alot...\nYou will have fun with all the different weapons and quests but if your like me and like to do the main story first before side quests then its fun aswell. The charater all all uniqe i guess espect the robots, i havent gotten that far into the game but so far its awsome, if you like skyrim and games like that you will love this game. The game is settled in a post-apocalyptic world where you need to survive  and know who tryed to murder you.\n\n\nI rate this 10/10\n\nIf i beat the game i would probaly play through it again.\n\nUPDATE: I have play new vegas over and over again even if fallout 4 is out and yes i do own it. But in my opinion New Vegas will always be the best game in the franchise. I know Fallout 4 has better graphics then New Vegas but it feels lamer story wise its just Fallout 3 but your looking for your son and yes i still like the game but New Vegas will always be better in my book!","June 21, 2015","true","195.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The scale of the Fallout: New Vegas world compared to Fallout 3 is tiny, if you take into consideration how much of the map was really used... The combat stayed pretty much the same, there wasn't really much that changed, the war certainly didn't... If I had not played Fallout 3 then Fallout: New Vegas would have been all that that I had experienced in Fallout 3, minus the NPC's who brought so much life to the game. Fallout: New Vegas' NPC's were really lacking, both in depth and variety, and I couldn't help but feel that the developers rushed the game adding hundreds of thingamabobs here and there to fill the vast expanse. That's the difference between FNV and FO3, in FO3 one thing would lead to another, which blended in seamlessly whereas FNV you've go from one spot then be like "what now".","September 3, 2013","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuka-Social/recommended/22380/","Nuka-Social","Nuka-Social","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuka-Social/","74 products in account","So what do I personally think of  "Fallout: New Vegas?"  Well, I think this is probably the best Fallout game I've ever played. Simply a masterpiece for the Fallout universe that fits so well, with a new main questline nearly totally different from Fallout 3. SPOILER, GO! ->  Except they both sorta still involve water at the end... Sorta.  With even some new creatures, and a new look at the way I saw Super Mutants, which in comparison to the once in D.C., they're just so... beautiful.  *Slow tear drop*  So if you like horror games, Fallout may just be your ticket to a few new scares from Cazzadors, Radscrops, or even Ghouls! Then you have NPC's. As there are hundreds of dumby NPC's like there are in every Fallout that lack every bit of social skill, there are a large amount of interesting characters with interesting names apart from "Novac settler." These characters with names such as Easy Pete, Mr. House, Ceaser, President Kimball, Boone, ED-E, and more are all unique. So every time you meet someone new in the game, expect a new personality to communicate with! Each one apart of a faction. Well, almost. But thats right! Because in this game there are loads of factions to choose from. Factions that each may just change the political map of the Mojave for the entire Fallout universe. Things you do have an impact on your character, the Mojave, factions, and just everyday Wastelanders. So if you wanna make it suck, you can probably do that. Wanna make it the next safe haven of happiness? Feel free! The choices are yours in this game. No need to really prepare for the future, because you're the one who shapes it here! Just be sure you're the proper level before hitting New Vegas. Especially do the same before you get any of the worth-while DLC as well. So for me, all of this just adds up to be my absolute favorite of the Fallout universe, since Fallout, to Fallout 3, and to now Fallout: New Vegas. *Cough* But still your average bugs of course. Pay no mind to them. *Cough* Note however this is all from past experiance on the PS3.","October 8, 2014","true","28.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

The story this time is based along the war between the New California Republic (NCR), and the Legion. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and you can join whichever you want to complete the game, or go through and independant New Vegas, and kick both of them out of Nevada. A vast improvement over Fallout 3 in terms of weapons, iron sights, and locations. The characters are quite memorable, and the companions are badasses if you get them the right gear. Both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave make appearances, but in vastly dimmed down appearances than their Fallout 3 counterparts. Which is a shame, as I like the Fallout 3 Brotherhood better than New Vegas's.\n\nThere are four pieces of DLC for New Vegas, but they all have their ups and downs.\nDead Money is an extremely confusing, and creepy DLC to play, but gives you a good few hours of gameplay. This was my least favorite of the four.\nHonest Hearts is my favorite, as it gives you a huge part of Utah to explore (namely Zion National Park), gives you some awesome armor to wear, and has some pretty awesome characters, namely the Burned Man himself, Joshua Graham. A must play even just to get the Desert Ranger Armor.\nOld World Blues was a pretty standard run to this place, grab something, run to this place grab this, and so on and so forth. The one thing that sets this out from the rest is the "Brains", a group of former scientists from before the Great War who placed their brains in robots so they could continue living. I won't spoil anything, but their entire dialogue is absolutely hilarious to hear, and it is hard not to like their dialogue. This is my third favorite of the four.\nLonesome Road. This is the last DLC, and the second best. The area you explore is extremly hostile, looks great, and everything is out to kill you. You also get to find out about your past before you accepted the ill-fated job from the Mojave Express. Ullysses is a great antagonist. Suffice to say, this is a great one to play as well, and you really should.","August 16, 2014","true","130.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RAKtheUndead/recommended/22380/","RAKtheUndead","raktheundead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RAKtheUndead/","132 products in account","Bethesda Softworks' release of Fallout 3 in 2008 went a long way in reviving a series which looked to have been milked for all it was worth, and brought a new set of fans for the series. Yet, while the new fans were being entertained by Fallout 3, some of the older fanbase – including myself – bemoaned the game for its poor story and dialogue, the liberties taken with the canon, and the disappointing ending. When the development of Fallout: New Vegas was announced, I must admit that I felt a bit of trepidation. Obsidian Entertaiment was composed of members of the Fallout development team when Black Isle was at its prime, but were they the right people to take up the mantle of a new Fallout game?\n\nIn the development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian drew in elements from the incomplete game which was to have been the third instalment of the main series, Van Buren, with various changes to their implementation to deal with the smaller geographical area. Gameplay-wise, though, Fallout: New Vegas strongly resembles Fallout 3, and could be best described as a refined variant of the first/third-person action role-playing action that distinguished Fallout 3 from its predecessors in the series. The skill set has been cleaned up somewhat, removing the Small Guns and Big Guns categories, and placing their weapons into the Guns and Explosives skills accordingly. The new Survival skill ties into the expanded crafting mechanics, and is of particular concern to the new Hardcore mode, in which the character must eat, sleep and drink, in which ammunition has weight as in the original Fallout games, and in which healing takes place over time, rather than being instantaneous.\n\nIn an increased attempt to make non-weapon skills useful, the crafting mechanic has been expanded to include the ability to hand-load ammunition using shell casings, powder and lead at a reloading bench, along with cooking and the production of poisons at a campfire. The reloading mechanic is particularly welcome, allowing for the recycling of excess stockpiled ammunition, as well as the casting of rare ammunition types, including certain enhanced ammunition exclusive to the reloading bench. Meanwhile, the cooking mechanic gives a new use to those boxes of Cram which seem to be littered around the wasteland, allowing a skilled player to produce food which can heal more effectively and, in Hardcore Mode, which satiates the character's hunger for longer.\n\nAnother new addition to the series is the “true ironsights” configurable option, which ties into a general tightening-up of the shooting mechanics. VATS has been weakened from Fallout 3, and in its place, the shooting mechanics feel somewhat more satisfying, at least at long range, where long rifles feel a bit more useful than they did in Fallout 3. Indeed, weapons under the Guns skill feel a lot more capable of getting one to the end of the game than in Fallout 3, and it is perfectly possible for somebody to focus on one weapon skill – apart from possibly Explosives - and to have few problems proceeding onwards.\n\nThe biggest way in which Fallout: New Vegas is distinct to its immediate predecessor is that it feels like a character- and dialogue-oriented game, rather than the exploration-oriented approach of Fallout 3. One of my biggest disappointments with Fallout 3 was its rather poor storyline, in which one felt railroaded into a set of actions, even when they didn't make logical sense for your character, and which worked to the detriment of the rest of the game. Fallout: New Vegas, on the other hand, allows for a greater amount of flexibility with the storyline, with four distinct paths for one to set on, a lot of choices to make in the wasteland, and far more logical consistency than Fallout 3. This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.\n\nAnother area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.\n\nA welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.\n\nAesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.\n\nInon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nAs with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors.  Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.\n\nNevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.","August 27, 2014","true","321.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.\n\nAnother area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.\n\nA welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.\n\nAesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.\n\nInon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nAs with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors.  Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.\n\nNevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.","August 27, 2014","true","321.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However old this game may be, the community is still running strong. And, although they've stopped developing updates or patches, said community is still modding and fixing minor bugs with the game.\n\nEnough with the prologue, New Vegas brings new mechanics to its predecessor, Fallout 3. With amazing graphics and overwhelming dialogue options, it brings something else.\n\nThe game's an RPG. This means you'll have different factions where you'll be able to gain respect, and later on change their [non-existant] lives forever.\n\nSkills have also been revamped, and there's been a lot of other changes over the last game.\n\nEven if you don't like the graphics, you can always go to Reddit or Nexus mods and find something that suits you.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome. 9.7/10, if it weren't for the occasional bug, it'd be one of the bests title of last generation. It's still on the Top 100s, in my opinion.\n\nPs. Special thanks to Kebab for this game. :}","February 21, 2014","true","31.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Literally the Fallout Franchise does in fact take place in a world full of rubble. So heres the story, A long time ago there was a great nuclear war and it destroyed the world, countries, everything, and left you with packs of raiders and mutants and nothing to live for. Now to prevent people from seeing these things were vaults. Now the vaults are more talked about in cared for in "Fallout 3" so you should check that game out as well for some more info and basic concept of them. So basically the vaults were to protect the people and lots failed and people left or they went crazy and slaughtered each other. So either way they failed. Anyway, so in this game its really not about the vaults but it still gives you a little wink from them because you are given a "Pip-boy 3000" in the beginning of the game and also a vault suit. But turns out, your not a vault wanderer, your a courier. You delivered items to different people and recieved payment for it. Basically it was the post-apocalyptic mail-man. Well, something went bad this one delivery and turns out your were caring something on fire (Really known to some important people not actually on fire.) The platinum chip. So when you deliver this chip there is this man named Benny. *SPOILER ALERT* When you deliver the package you are shot in the head. Which is probably one of the first achievements in the game. Also, this is also portrayed in a cutscene, well the head shooting part anyway. So turns out your NOT dead and you wake up in a doctors house 3 days later after the shooting. This is where the story begins and you get to choose your S.P.E.C.I.A.L and those nice little perks. Now, to the actual mechanics and guns and everything that deserves to be judged.\n\nMechanics - You really don't need to care for the mechanics in this game because they are just fine anyway. For example I blown away when I saw the beauty of the game with its destroyed buildings and what not, yet it had all of the little things you would see in the Nevada desert. Small shrubs and grass. But anyway, the mechanics are just the same as the previous game so you shouldnt expect anything different. Just good ol' Fallout!\n\nGuns- Oh my lordy, the guns are literally perfect this game. They completely fit the area and are over all really balanced. Try them all out.\n\nVehicles?- I wish.\n\nArmor- Mainly old armor but some new stuff was added in!\n\nSo thats really it, your really gonna have to find out yourself in this one if you live the game or not.

However old this game may be, the community is still running strong. And, although they've stopped developing updates or patches, said community is still modding and fixing minor bugs with the game.\n\nEnough with the prologue, New Vegas brings new mechanics to its predecessor, Fallout 3. With amazing graphics and overwhelming dialogue options, it brings something else.\n\nThe game's an RPG. This means you'll have different factions where you'll be able to gain respect, and later on change their [non-existant] lives forever.\n\nSkills have also been revamped, and there's been a lot of other changes over the last game.\n\nEven if you don't like the graphics, you can always go to Reddit or Nexus mods and find something that suits you.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome. 9.7/10, if it weren't for the occasional bug, it'd be one of the bests title of last generation. It's still on the Top 100s, in my opinion.\n\nPs. Special thanks to Kebab for this game. :}","February 21, 2014","true","31.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

War Never changes.\n\nFrom the time these words are spoken, to the moment you reach the end of the game, you will experience one of the best game’s out there.\n\nOutdated engine, loads of glitches, and too few voices for too many characters. Despite these flaws, I believe Fallout New Vegas is the best game I’ve ever played. A fantastic story, interesting and diverse characters, hundreds of mods, and a return to good ol’ Fallout.\n\nI bought this game a few years ago, knowing only a little about Fallout, having only played Fallout 3 a few times, never for long, when I was young. So, with Fallout 3, I bought this game, not knowing what to expect. Here I am, a few years later, with over 250 hours of gameplay under my belt, and still more to come. Over the course of these years I have played every other Fallout game in existence and have learned the lore and history of both the game and it’s world. Every time I play one of the other games, I am hit by a sense of wonder, but I always end up coming back to this one, New Vegas.\n\nNew Vegas has everything you could want from a Fallout game, bringing you back to the West Coast and the world of old Fallout. Hundreds of cool guns and missions and a gigantic world to discover, not to mention some pretty good DLC, for the most part.\n\nLas Vegas, now dubbed New Vegas, is the last bastion of civilization in the world, as far as it’s inhabitants can tell, led by the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House. The NCR, who you may remember from Fallout 2, have spread out to Nevada to find the Hoover Dam. With the discovery of the Dam, comes the discovery of the antithesis to everything the NCR stands for, The Legion, a group founded under the ideals of old Rome. Before the start of the game, the NCR and the Legion duked it out over control of the Dam, the NCR just barely winning. Now the Legion is back, and after revenge. Mr. House sits in the protection of the walled city of New Vegas, ruling over it’s inhabitants under the ideals of the old world, as the NCR dukes it out once again with the Legion, with plans of his own. You are a Courier, a messenger of sorts, tasked with delivering a mysterious package by order of Mr. House, who must unite the Mojave Wasteland under the rule of either the Legion, the NCR, Mr. House, or yourself. And with that, the best game of the Fallout series starts.\n\nSo with my FIVE STAR RECOMMENDATION, go ahead, buy the game, and start the journey of your life.","July 22, 2014","true","331.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I already had picked up New Vegas from this past Winter Sale and had been waiting to try it out, in hopes that it would extend my simple experience of 3. What I jumped into far exceeded my expectations. I felt like I was truly the player running across the wasteland. Whereas in 3 I was a kid from the vault following a paper trail to my father to do good for Washington, D.C., here in NV I had all the power to do anything from creating an autonomous society to becoming the main driver for a loose military force.\n\nWhat I learned from 3 and my initial playthrough of NV is you have to pace yourself. Explore aimlessly a lot more than you find yourself doing in the sister/rival Elder Scrolls games. There is no actual endgame in ES like there is in FO. You have to leave your mark before you make the big choices. You also find your personal morals driving your decisions. And unlike ES, the citizens of the Mojave Wasteland will not forget you. Screw the NCR, they will screw you back.\n\nI found myself enjoying the company of the smaller "tribes" more than the big players like the NCR and Caesar. Again inserting myself as the player character, I was another person in the wasteland, I just ended up shaping it to my whim.\n\nIf I had to criticize one thing, it is the somewhat-lack of incentive to scour every location. Reaching Level 28 on my second playthrough and choosing the Explorer perk was a good choice to find some difficult and useful locations, but just as many of them were not. I found a place called "Chance's Map" which only on further investigation did I learn it meant something, but only in the comics. I wasn't expecting valuable NPC's to be waiting every 5 meters, but possibly have a bit more to find under the rock. Despite this, the minutia in development is another reason to praise this game.\n\nAnd the average 2010 graphics? Doesn't matter, it was all about the detail and story, anyway.\n\n9.75/10","August 14, 2014","true","138.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game restores everything that "Fallout 3" gutted from the franchise: the humor, the factions, the detailed backstory of the world, the interesting companions, and the general desperate feel of surviving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMicroFreak/recommended/22380/","TheMicroFreak","The Micro Freak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMicroFreak/","168 products in account","(Keep in mind that this review isn't affected by mods, which add so much to the game)\n\nSTORY:\nFallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in the year 2281, 200 years after a nuclear war with China devastated America, and in a post-apocalyptic version of Nevada, California, and Arizona. In Fallout: New Vegas, you play as the Courier, who is hired by a delivery service to transport a very important package across the Mojave Desert to the Las Vegas Strip. However, problems arise when your character is shot in the head and left for dead in the middle of the wasteland by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot and brought to a local doctor, the Courier goes back out into the arid wasteland to search for answers to questions such as, “Who tried to kill me?” and “What was in the package?”\n\nWhen first starting out, it can be a little intimidating, as you’re thrown into this huge world without any sense of direction or objective, except to find the package you were assaulted for. From there, you have to earn the trust of people just trying to live in a cruel, unforgiving place. Once you figure out what you’re doing, you embark on your quest of vengeance.\n\nThe game really immerses you in the story, but doesn’t force it on you, so you can always have your own fun with the game. Also, this may be a little bit of a spoiler, but when you finish the story, you are told how your actions affected the future and some people you came across during your adventure. I would have to rate the story: 9/10.\n\n\nMUSIC:\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, but before that, in-game American society was fascinated with 50’s culture, so on the game’s radio stations, music from the 40’s, 50’s, and the 60’s and artists such as Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin plays. This music really adds to the environment because all of the buildings, features, landscape of the world were the same before the event that changed everything, just destroyed, so it’s nice to see that something from the old world survive for 200+ years. Also, the game features background music for intense situations, but I never really notice it that much. I would rate the music: 9/10.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nFallout: New Vegas plays like a regular RPG mixed with a FPS. In the beginning, you can select your SPECIAL stats, SPECIAL meaning Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. Based on which category you put your points into, your main skills will be different and you’ll be better at some things, but not others. For instance, if you put a lot of points into Agility, you’ll be able to draw and reload your weapon faster and your Guns skill level and your Sneak skill level will be increased. But, to put points into Agility, there will be a category that won’t have as many points in it. There is no way to get every category maxed out at first because the system is designed to make your character have strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFallout: New Vegas has a combat system called V.A.T.S. You can use it to pause the battle and aim at a body part of an enemy to inflict serious damage. Doing this uses Action Points, which are used and then replenish over time, so that way you can’t use the system all the time.\n\nThe game also has a karma and reputation system which both affect how NPCs react to you. The karma system is a system that reflects all the good and evil decisions you make in the game and how those decisions are perceived in the eyes of the NPCs you meet. You can be very good, good, neutral, evil, or very evil. It all depends on your decisions throughout the game. In New Vegas, the karma system doesn’t have as big of an effect as it did in other Fallout games. Instead, the reputation system has a more important place. The reputation system is a system that tracks how the many factions in the game feel about you and your actions. If you perform actions that benefit a group, you’ll gain Fame, but if you perform actions that harm a group, you’ll gain Infamy. Your reputation with a group is measurement of the balance of Fame and Infamy. If you’re more famous with a group, they can give you discounts from vendors, allow you to get into areas you otherwise you be able to get into, etc. If you’re more infamous, you can be shot on sight. Those aren’t all the significant gameplay features, but those are the best. I’d have to give the gameplay a 9/10 for the reputation system and SPECIAL system.\n\n\nGRAPHICS:\nFor a game that came out in 2010, the graphics aren’t all that spectacular. The ground and the walls don't have many details, but the people you encounter look fine. The weapons and armor are pretty detailed, but most are grey, boring, and not fun to look at. The outside world is a big mix of browns, but that is a good thing due to the setting being post-apocalyptic, so everything would be discolored and dreary. The sky is blue mixed with blue with white clouds, so nothing special there. I’d rate the graphics: 7.5/10.\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nThe controls in this game are not very complicated and it’s very neat that you can change buttons around so that way you can play in your own style. For instance, the default setting for the B (Xbox 360) is to activate the Pip-Boy, but I changed that to the right bumper. Other than that, there’s nothing special to say about the controls, it’s pretty standard FPS/RPG controls. I have to rate the controls: 9/10.\n\n\nThere you have it, that’s my review of Fallout: New Vegas with a score of 8.7/10. The game is not perfect, but I definitely recommend it to people who haven’t checked it out and like RPGs. Thank you for reading!\n","January 24","true","173.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even without any DLC at all, this game easily stands on it's own as a classic for years to come, if not already.\n\nAnd that's not even the best bit about New Vegas, i'd say the most exciting thing to come when you pick up this game is the amount of Mods you'll be downloading, because oh boy, there's a ton of them.\n\nIt's amazing how a community can extend the lifecycle of one game for 6 years straight, and for more to come.\nOverall, do I recommend this game?\nHell.

I have spent over a hundred hours on this game, and I am still have things to do. Focusing on the conflict between the NCR and the Legion, you play as a courier, who, at first, is not part of it. After getting shot in the head, you awake in Goodsprings, in good health, and ready for revenge. Compared to Fallout 3, I personally choose New Vegas over 3. New Vegas not only lets you choose the fate of New Vegas, you also become integreted with the other faction. WIth 4 different endings to choose from, as well dozens of side quest, New Vegas will keep you playing for hours on end.\n\n\nThe only main complaint I have with this game is the glitches. Though amusing and funny at first, getting stuck in a wall will make you not only mad, it will at often times make you curse at your PC/laptop. Along with the wall gltich, the game might, and WILL crash on you. Whether it is causing the game to get stuck in a loop, getting a black screen, or crashing the game all entirely, the crashes are very annoying, and, at often times, forcing you to restart at you last save point or auto save. The graphics are also lack-luster, looking as if they used the same engine to make Fallout 3. Nevertheless, what this game under-preforms in graphics, New Vegas more than enough makes it up with gameplay and story.\n\n\nThe story is captivating, often times making you want more, and forcing you to make choices that often test whether or not you are a moral person. Will you help the noble cause of the NCR and fight to power the Mojave with over, aid the slavers of the east, Ceasar's Legion, or will you lend a hand the mysterious Mr. Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas. Gameplay is also where this game shines. Though utilizing a first person view like its predecessor 3, New Vegas stays loyal with its RPG roots, focusing more on and RPG-like gaming rather than an action packed shooter. New Vegas combat focuses on how well you make your chracter, and on what you specialize it on. Every time you level up, you gain a certain number of points to spend, and what category you spend it on determinds what you are good at.\n\n\nNew Vegas is a grand game. WIth hundreds of things to do, New Vegas will certainly be worth the price. The gameplay and story by far overshadows the glitches and graphics. Note that New Vegas isn't for the faint of heart, for the is much more than your typical FPS game. New Vegas will leave you breathless, and glad you purchased this game.\n\n","July 4, 2014","true","187.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Why? because you can do almost anything.\n\nwant to play this with mods? check!\nwant great companions? check!\nchoose your own path? check!\nHardcore mode? check!\nwant to kill a hooker? check!\nkill people with a rolling pin while dressed up like a hooker? check!\n\nLike I said, in the world of fallout almost anything is possible (literally). but they're are a few game breaking bugs that can be hilarious or just downright anger inducing. for example, veteran fallout players will remember the glitch where a body will stretch out a far distance and start spazzing out around the map, thats pretty funny. But, when you are invading gun runners to make a few caps and the gun runner protectron somehow finds a way out of the stand he is stuck in... he is literally unkillable (mini nukes just tickle him)\n\nAside from the few bugs and glitches this game has, fallout new vegas has character customazation, want to be a female, ok. want to be a guy with a weird hair cut and hair color? thats ok, society wont judge you at all! Next in the customazation is the attributes you can give your character. there are 7 well balanced attributes to this game and they are: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. (I normally max out my strength so i can carry more loot) and each attribute also gives a minor bonus to certain skills.\n\nStrength increases yor melee damage, increases carry capacity, and improves aiming down sights (ADS) with all of the weapons( and how fast you can swing with melee weapons)\n\nPerception is used to see how far away an enemy is on your radar\n\nEndurance is pretty self explanitory, it increases your health, increases radiation resistance and poison resistance\n\nCharisma increases your companions chance to tell you a secret about themselve and/or give a quest relating to them\n\nIntelligence increases the amount of skill points availible when you level up\n\nAgility increases your reload speed with weapons and the amount of action points you have availible\n\nAnd last is luck, Luck increases your chance at scoring a critical hit, and also it gives you a better chance of winning at slot machines\n\nThese attributes are all really well balanced and most can be used sometimes in a conversation to persuade or give information\n\nFallout New Vegas has many factions for you to side with end, there is Caesars Legion, the NCR, Mr. House, or, yourself. along with these major factions there are minor factions like The Followers of the Apocolypse, Goodsprings, The Great Khans, and more.\n\nOne thing I really enjoyed about Fallout New Vegas was the hardcore mode. in hardcore you would have to eat, sleep, and drink. along with ammo actually weighing you down, stimpacks heal over time( so no endlessly shoving stimpacks down your throat to survive a deathclaw encounter) and you need a doctors bag, or doctor to heal a crippled limb.(side note by the time it takes you to get to the first tier of sleep, eating, and drinking deprivation you could be a quarter through the game, and yes there is a mod that was released by one of the developers to help make this a bit more... well, Hardcore)\n\nSo in short, I really recommend that people that dont have this game to pick it up right now, it is well worth the money( and time) to play this game. but be warned, once you play this game, it will eat your time like a fat kid in a cookie store.","September 29, 2015","true","97.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

For example, there are more requests, perks, weapons in it as well as the ability to customize your weapons.\n\nThe quests (including DLCs) are much better, in my opinion. In Fallout 3 there is really only 3 different endings but they are more or less the same. The DLCs weren't bad but it did feel repeative and more of a shooter than RGP. In NV, it offers different quest lines for different factions in the story thus giving us a  greater depth to the story and it really does feel like your actions do determin the outcome of the Mojave.\n\nThe only problems I find with this game is, that is sometimes crashes and gives my PC the Blue screen of death every hour and then. Most of the glitches are patched but it can become a pest. Also, Cazadores are complete c*nts. No matter what level you are, or what weapon you have, they always seem to wipe you out without a problem. And they always come in swarms which becomes impossible to fight unless you have Mini nuke to Shoah the scum.\n\nOverall, 9/10 game.

You are ultimately kidnapped by armed men, which you will get to know more about later in the story, and are shot in the head in a cementary outside of a small, un-disturbed town, known as Goodsprings. From here on out, you get to make your own decisions, and make a rebuttle of what is left of the Mojavé-Wasteland.\n\nThis game is a huge advancement compared to it's predecessor, Fallout: 3™. The amount of gameplay added to this game, which, might I add, is much, much more defined in the sense that you're really there; you feel as if you know your friends, enemies, and places you've been to. The quests and DLC make a surgated wall that can support the main quests of this masterpiece; as in Fallout: 3™, they don't. Fallout: New Vegas™ adds many more intelligent AI with never-before-seen dialogue that you can fiddle with -- meaning that some of your perks and skills can actually change the way you play the game, if done correctly, that is..\nFactions have always been a big-hit in this games overall franchise, and in this game, they really show you how they've completely re-fortified that way it was meant to be. They're not just a few, big ones in this game that are good and evil [Factions] that you only get to choose from one-or-so faction, but many of them. The three main factions in Fallout: New Vegas™ are the N.C.R., Caesar's Legion, and the Brotherhood of Steel.\n\ntl;dr\nI highly suggest buying this game - it is absouletely worth the twenty-dollars you will pay for it. I also recommend buying all the DLC whilst you're at it. It will make you have a brand new experience of playing.\n","August 4, 2014","true","76.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's the closest we will get for this franchise to recapture the magic of the old days.\n\nPros: Smart writing, interesting characters, quests that can be solved in numerous and unorthodox fashions, good weapon and armor variety, true player freedom to effect the story, tons of content, cool DLC, continues the lore of the first two Fallout games.\n\nCons: World design is rather bland, dungeon design is confusing, bugs and crashes are common (though much better now then at release).\n\nYour Mileage May Vary: Shooting mechanics are improved from Fallout 3, though not by much. Not the best FPS mechanics, but serviceable. Also, while it's "open world", it's not like Fallout 3 or Elder Scrolls where you can wander aimlessly. There is no level scaling, meaning there are areas of the game that feature enemies that will screw up your day even if you are at level 50. Tread carefully. Keep to the road, stay off the moors. Beware the moonlight. Don't go into this expecting a Skyrim-like experience.\n\nOther thoughts: In this game, only two NPCs are unkillable, both robots. Everyone else is fair game. Yes, that includes killing the Big Bad as soon as you encounter him if you choose. How many other AAA games let you do that? Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 3 certainly didn't.","December 16, 2015","true","155.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weeder76/recommended/22380/","Weeder76","=SSG= Weeder76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weeder76/","596 products in account","Fallout: New Vegas is all about more. There's more to do in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, its superb predecessor; there's more complexity to its gameplay mechanics; and there are even more secrets to uncover as you roam the postapocalyptic wastes. Fallout: New Vegas' familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have you itching to see what other joys you might uncover. Occasional glitches and performance issues occasionally intrude upon your travels, along with the scorpions and geckos that might accost you. Don't let the quirks frighten you away, however: New Vegas' nooks and crannies are bursting with grimy treasures waiting to be dusted off and admired by intrepid explorers.\n\n\nThere's a wild, wonderful world outside Vegas, just waiting to be explored.\nThis latest trip into the desolate American landscape possesses many of the same elements that made Fallout 3 such a successful role-playing game, but its story doesn't boast as many memorable moments. The large-scale combat scenarios are less epic, and the surprises are less dramatic than Fallout 3's mid-game reverie. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid skeleton from which to hang a dumbfounding number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will invite you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you wondering about what will happen next. A society of ghouls with pie-in-the-sky aspirations is creepy enough to make you squirm, yet blind devotion to their dreams still inspires empathy. Socialites in formal attire run a casino known for its creative menu choices, and if you play your cards right, you might get to make a menu alteration of your own. You investigate the disappearance of a sharp-tongued wife in one town and bring star-crossed lovers together in another. Some of the most fascinating occurrences are the wittier ones. During one quest, a robot with a specialized skill and a gut-busting name might offer a service that surely no game character has ever offered before. A poet in an unlikely place mumbles aloud his difficulties in finding the right rhymes. Like with Fallout 3, the greatest delights aren't in the central storyline but on its periphery.\n\nWhile the tale isn't as evocative as it might have been, the way it blossoms as you advance, giving you any number of ways to proceed, is extraordinary. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. Maybe you'll fend off the robots defending a long-forgotten museum, but you might also steal an identification card that allows you to walk around (mostly) unharmed. You might provide a drug addict his fix, but if your speech skill is high enough, you can convince him to get on the straight and narrow. One lovelorn fellow will try to send you on a scavenger hunt for spare parts, but a high science skill means you can recommend another schematic and avoid the job altogether. However, there are certain cases in which the game funnels you down a specific path that might come as a shock if you prefer peaceful ends but are forced into a combat scenario with a single viable solution. And in certain cases, the quests just aren't designed particularly well. Searching for a key in a vault overrun with vegetation can turn into a major hassle. Avoiding an artillery bombardment isn't fun in the least and feels out of place given the measured pace at which you move. And an optional quest in which you hop from one computer terminal to another to isolate a virus leads to frustrating trial-and-error guesswork.\n\n\nGhouls don't like it when you say 'eewww' to their faces. It's better to talk behind their backs at a later time.\nLarge personalities give an edge to your undertakings. A mysterious man known as Mr. House presides over both the Strip, as well as your own adventures, and his singular focus on fulfilling his needs looms dramatically over the later hours of your escapades. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an ominous presence and a violent counterpoint to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. A ghoulish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a potty-mouthed head waiter, and a wealthy-but-desperate father all make an impression in spite of their very minor roles. You might even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also open up different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them tick.\n\nFallout: New Vegas' major addition is that of faction favor. You establish a reputation with various towns and organizations by doing them favors or annoying them in some way or another. Which factions you align with has both subtle and profound consequences. If you're liked, a random somebody might run up to you bearing minor gifts, such as an iguana on a stick. (Mmm, tasty.) Or if you've gained a more violent reputation, a mugger might accost you with violent intentions, only to run off when he recognizes you. It's a pleasure to hear random citizens remark on how they feel about you as you pass by, even if the canned comments repeat a bit too often. (It's sometimes bizarre to hear two characters standing side by side deliver the same line, spoken by the same voice actor.)\n\n\nThat Great Khan is no match for a sword made out of a bumper.\nYour faction relationships also have much more dramatic consequences on your adventure, opening up new quests while closing off others. The game is sometimes a bit opaque regarding how your actions may inadvertently affect the way a particular faction sees you, but this complexity manifests itself in awesome ways as you near the end of your travels. One great twist to this system is that by dressing up in faction-specific clothing or armor, you can disguise yourself and avoid a confrontation. Though, conversely, you might get dragged into battles against allies if you forget to change gear, which might damage a relationship you're trying to cultivate. This reputation system is a bit abstract, but it's a great addition to the Fallout formula, adding even more layers to a template already lauded for its flexibility.\n\nGlitches may give you a few minor fits, but the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is not in the same rough technical shape as its console counterparts, possibly thanks to a sizeable patch delivered a day after its release. That doesn't mean there aren't problems here. We encountered some bugs, such as a friendly quest giver inexplicably attacking us, even though he didn't show as an enemy on the directional radar. Characters might still randomly freak out as if you're about to attack for no discernible reason, only to return to their normal locations a moment later and act as if nothing had happened. But we encountered only a few scripting problems, and the game never crashed. Most complex role-playing games suffer from technical hitches, and this one is no exception. However, the oddities in this version aren't exceptionally disruptive, which makes it easy to stay invested.\n\n\nHacking is one way to solve your problems, but if you aren't good at it, there's probably another way. Or three.\nIf you played Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which used the same game engine as Fallout: New Vegas, then you won't be surprised by some of the other minor foibles, although many of them seem exac","July 19, 2014","true","602.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has ♥♥♥♥ tons of content and is generally a masterpiece (but with mods, of course).\n\nThere's unique and varied weapons, plenty of quests to do, and superb atmosphere and immersion. In some ways it's better than Skyrim. The quests are far more engaging and interesting and there are lots of ways to finish a quest. Like many Bethesda games, there are simply no words to describe how much fun there is to be had. Obsidian really improved their formula by a ton too.\n\nThis game easily earns a 10/10. I'm eagerly anticipating Fallout 4 for new and improved Fallout content. If you don't have it yet don't hesitate. Get this game immediately.\n\nEDIT: After playing Fallout 3, I think New Vegas is generally superior. Obsidian really did a good job, so many improvements were in this game that were missed in Fallout 3. The story and characters and quests to me were all so much more memorable.
