The game appears to be something you may have played 10 yrs ago. The simple grinding, fetch quest with little to no reasoning behind it as "go here kill 10 of these, now go collect 20 of those" over and over. Its like something I played back when I first got into mmo's so so many years ago. For some, that can be a good thing. A simple, laid back game that you sit there, tab, and click repeatedly to kill everything that moves.\n\nThe graphics are very old, but gameplay wise it feels like a mess. Shooting a gun 5 feet from an enemy while standing slightly higher elevation won't even appear to have any effect or setting up mines to pull enemies did little or no effect as the mines would sometimes either not detonate, or do so with no effect. That along with the horrendous repetition of fetch quests pretty much put the final nail in it for me. Especially the king of collector quest chain, where you collect resources, turn it in, and he gives you the same exact one only double the resources. After hitting the 10th quest to fetch the exact same thing I gave up.\n\nPeople also complained about the cash shop, which I didn't have an issue with really. Inventory space and storage space? If people had actually played the game, they would know you are rewarded inventory space and storage space from a quest here or there. I was able to expand both once or twice via quests. Though the high end equipment (gold colored) items could only be identified and thus used only via a cash shop item which was kind of crappy imo.\n\nThe population of the game was my next big issue and pretty much THE biggest issue I had. It was non existant. After playing so much I ran across the same 5-6 people that frequented the game daily. I had the run of nearly all areas without running across a single soul, save the starter area and the last area available.\n\nI recall seeing something about customizing your character and the skill set. Mmmm, not really. You pick a class and you get a list of skills. After getting 8 or 9 of these, the next versions are just leveled up numbers of the same skills. So theres no real in depth custom this or that. Again, the combat with the skills were basically tab, click, tab, click. Half the time I wouldnt use skills just because I was too lazy and mostly lost interest.\n\nSo now the pvp and "resource wars". I thought this was a neat idea to get into. I could join a pvp battle against the other race/faction. Mmmm, nope. Even though I have the quests to do so, its not available. You can't do this until level 30, and not too many people are there yet say the GM's. I thought it made sense, until I passed 30. Then made another character and made it far somehow with the monotonous grindfest. Just by tab clicking my way through the game in just under 40 hours and having two characters that can do pvp stuff I can't imagine the other faction not having at least a few people. Oh well.\n\nSo ah base building? Thats cool....well. Select some buildings, gather the same type of resource to make them pop up. You can now craft weapons, armor, items. So more grinding resources, and I gave up because frankly you level so fast it's really not worth spending 3 hours to gather resources to craft a set of armor for yourself. So....back to the tab clicking.\n\nWell, aside from the mind numbing grinding generic mobs theres really nothing else to it. Oh wait vehicles? No...no. You get in these little instances in a vehicle, which all handle the same. They feel like static models that glide over the terrain, and can pass over or through anything....I say this because I tried running over enemies which they just kind of pass through me. Each vehicle instance lasts 3-4 mins tops. So...pointless.\n\nMainly you're running from point A to point B, kill this, run back to A. Quest complete. Now run back to B and kill 10 more. Over and over. These kinds of games were fun way way back in the day when we were all exciting to be online playing a game with other people but online games and any social type of game have evolved quite a bit past this type.\n\nI love the Gm's, and I love how involved and helpful they are in this game. Beyond that it's hard for me to state anything else positive. I took a break from Black Desert Online, and spent near 40 hours to give Trinium Wars a fair effort.\n\nCurrenly the price is very cheap, probably to entice more players. Sadly it should be said attracting players and getting them to stay are two different things. It's my hope that this game is continued to be worked upon, and improved in various ways. I did love how this reminded me of the old online games I first played, but sadly it's not enough to entice me to log in daily anymore.\nAt this time I can not recommend this game until more is released so that people won't rush to the finish line in a span of a couple days. Good Luck to you all.","March 16","false","52.0"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","70","87","5","2"

By their own admission here (http://steamcommunity.com/games/410560/announcements/detail/652265279128231790) he was merely " participating in the first concept art of Diablo 3 ". Time to fess up: this guy was never the Lead artist of Diablo 2 or 3.\n\nOn to the review:\n\nIn short: This is not the sci fi MMO you are looking for. Do not buy, even at a low price.\n"L.A.W.  (Living After War) was the foundation of Trinium Wars", which was canceled after a closed beta. They literally changed the "Nak" from Living After War to "Narc" (in Trinium Wars) and thought no one would notice. (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/424k8z/trinium_wars_announcement_trailer/cz7mhhn)\nIt fits in the model of the asian F2P MMO that has cropped up over the years, but has received zero refinement compared to the state of them five to ten years ago.\n\nFirst impressions:\nDEALBREAKER: Cash shop with more than merely cosmetic items (ergo: Pay 2 Win, P2W game, time vampire). The devs argue that "Time vs. Money mechanics give you a fair chance of winning without spending money!". You decide.\n\nThe graphics are really outdated. Think Anarchy Online (and I'm not talking about AO's upgraded engine). Extremely low res textures, few current century graphical effects, the only settings are shadows and anti aliasing, vegetation is sprite based and those sprites are lower res than the rest of the map. Strange DoF/FoV make for a nausseating experience.\n\nArt: About L.A.W. they said it was designed by "Nitrogen CEO and former lead artist for Diablo II Jang Wook Lee" and now in the first sentence of the Store Page description they say he also was the lead artist on Diablo 3?\n(I'll just borrow this part from another review): The claim on the store page is "that "JW Lee" the "Lead Artist" from Diablo 3 made the game. However, there's no JW Lee in the Diablo 3 credits as the >lead< artist." (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/diablo-iii/details) - same goes for Diablo 2, where he isn't mentioned at all, check http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/diablo-ii/credits - so this is FALSE ADVERTISING. If he truly was the LEAD artist on these major games, you'd think he'd be credited as such everywhere.\n\nGameplay is very static. "Challenging quests"? You basically walk around (very slowly) to a quest marker. "Exciting RPG combat"? Press TAB to lock on and 3 (to fire your weapon) and wait until the enemy is dead. Moving is not possible during this.\nVehicles sound exiting until you enter one: they basically float, people can walk through them, and they are based on the same combat system (press 1 to fire at the locked target). "Explore"? The map is as bland as can be.\n\nThere's also almost no serious in-game story. If there is, the gameplay does not fit the narrative, since it's basically: go to X, kill Y no. of mobs, return. Also: no voice acting (although it wouldn't do much), and bad English localization.\nMissing functionality: "Join the resource war" - not implemented yet because "not enough players have reached lvl 30". I can only imagine the horror of the grind those that did reach the required level have had to go through.\n\nYes, I uninstalled the game within one hour. You would do the same.","March 10","false","0.9"," 71 of 109 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","71","109","4","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/takingwithoutconsent/recommended/410560/","takingwithoutconsent","TriniumGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/takingwithoutconsent/","162 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MRRkb9pFQcM\n\nI am rewriting my review for numerous reasons:\n\nI'm at 14 hours now, and even after my initial bad review, I couldn't stop playing it. Let me preface this with - it's Early Access.\n\nHave we all heard that phrase before? We sure have. Does it sometimes irritate us when we read someone use that as an excuse? Yup. But, this game is very polished in its current state - much more than other EA titles. That said, let's look at its pros/cons:\n\nPros     Variety - This game has a lot of things going on. Initially, you'll be confused (and I agree they need a better training manual or more quests to help us understand the various things), but eventually, you'll get the hang of it and realize you have so many different things to do that you don't have to do anything!\n\nPerformance - This game does have some hiccups, but 95% of the time, this game runs SMOOTH. Very smooth. In fact, the moment you hit 'play' (after you've created your character already), you'll be in the game in about 1 - 1 1/2 minutes, if that. It's fast, and EA, which means it's only going to get better from here.\n\nGraphics - I've read people complaining about the graphics, but I have no issue with them whatsoever, and in fact, I rather like them. Nowadays, games are putting a lot of 'meat' into their graphics, which means if you aren't carrying around a 2,500.00 computer, you're getting lag spikes, choppiness, etc. But this game runs VERY well on the highest settings and I believe the graphics look great for that trade-off.\n\nThe Developers - When I initially complained about certain things, I thought the developers were going to get upset or defensive or whatever. But then they responded with understanding and support. They even admitted they realized there were issues with pricing schemes and other parts of the game. They then made it abundantly clear they will address those issues immediately and will build the game around the players wants/wishes. Don't believe me? Check out the discussion page and see for yourself. I've literally never seen that kind of response from a team before. That's definitely a 'pro'. If you want to feel like part of the creation process, then this is going to be the game for you to do just that.\n\nCrafting - There is a lot going on with crafting. Do I like it all? No, but the concepts are unique (as far as games that I've played) and they add visuals and style to moving up in craftable items. That comes in the form of what they referred to as 'browser-based-like base building'. Basically, you build and upgrade various buildings that you use to create various items. These items are the bread'n'butter of your character's build. They will make or break you, so make sure you start working on that early, so that you get the hang of it (I will post YouTube videos in the very near future about how this is done).\n\nCons:\nKeep in mind, the game is still EA and the developers are quick to respond.\n\nInventory - I've always loved loot. It's like Christmas with every group of mobs. But the inventory space definitely needs some work. There are a TON of things that you'll need for crafting, and access to the Warehouse inventory isn't convenient, so you'll find that 1/2 - 3/4 of your space is taken up with crafting materials you'll need throughout the game.\n\nQuests - the quests definitely need some work. I'd like to have some audio with the quest windows, but there's none. They're also cumbersome and get old very fast. For some reason, I feel like I have to do all the quests in every game, and let me tell you - there are a LOT of quests, but they're largely the same type - go to 'x', get 'y', kill 'z'. But, it isn't all in one shot - it's go to 'x', come back. Go to 'z', come back. Kill 'y', come back. But again, you don't really 'have' to do the blue quests - you do have to do the yellow ones in order to progress past the first area, however.\n\nMovement - This isn't so much a 'con' as it is a 'request'. There's no camera lock so that you can use your mouse to look around without having to hold down the right-click. I just wish that feature was there, but it isn't game-breaking at all.\n\nGrammar - You will find many, MANY misspellings, typos, and fragments in the game. I'm somewhat of a grammar Nazi and I find my fork inching closer to my eye socket every time I find one. . .\nNeither list is complete. There are a LOT of great things about the game and there are quite a few other frustrating things about the game. But it just released yesterday and is in Early Access. I do believe that with the dev team they have here, this game is going to become polished, community-driven, and will be a force among other bigger titles. Heck, I initially said 'no' to recommending the game, but then couldn't stop playing and ended up playing the game for 8 hours straight after writing the review. o.0\n\nYou know the game has something going for it when it keeps you sucked in to it for that long. I do suggest buying it, especially now when the price is low. Hopefully I'll see you in game! :)","March 3","true","68.6"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","47","70","4","9"

Possibly a sci fi one (We all know how few there are out there that don't involve you being a spaceship or a space marine).\n\nWell my friend maybe this game will be for you.\n\nThe game centers on a conflict 200 years after WWIII in which Humans left earth to sleep off the whole Fallout world.\nWithin that time a race pops up all Space Elf style. They colonize and terraform earth whilst we sleep in some large orbit.\n\nSo now humans are invading their own home to get those space elves on out of there. Those space elves though...lemme tell you something. JRR Tolkien didn't design these guys and they carry laser blasters.. You won't find Sindarin here. No sir. Well maybe in a old book at the bottom of an ancient earth city long colonized by mutants.\n\nSo if that sounds about right for you continue on.\n\nTrinium wars has many interesting concepts.\n\n-Station: It's your base. It's your craft skills. If you ever played a base building game in a browser you should know what to expect. This is how you make sure your wants/needs are covered. Potions, skills,weapons,armor and MORE.\n\n-Moba pvp: Yes this game has a fully functioning Moba within it.\n\nBut that's not your only pvp option.\n\nThere is a map shortly released upon which it's a 24/7 battle ground complete with mines and convoys to protect. As it's not been released yet I cannot judge this but the concept sounds about right.\n\nIt plays much like a old school rpg (L2, RFonline, Knight to an extent). In that regard they so far do not have the tropes of modern combat.....telegraphs etc and frankly? I'm glad. I have enough AMMORPG's to last a lifetime.\n\nIf you are going "eh?" right now... I forgot a key thing.\nBattles can be engaged in via tanks/flamethrower tanks/helicopters/mechs. I probably should of mentioned that really cool and epic feature but I saved it for last. Combat in pvp will be very much a vehicle war game as much as foot.\nIn a massive map...designed to keep up fighting all day.\n\nThe game does have it's faults however and that must be addressed.\nThe customization at character creation is sparse and the models of a few classes/genders do not scale well with the world.\n\nOther gripes are ...\n\nIt is direct X9 which isn't very stable compared to 10-11 so thus no matter what they add it will always have that old look to it.\n\nThe UI: They are working on it and once it's "good" I'll remove this gripe but the UI is very much a miss.\n\nThe moba mode: Requires you to sit around in a lobby waiting on a game to start. (Currently we're asking for a new system to join games).\n\nThe old world meets new age isn't quite there. We need more city ruins etc, more apocalypse is good apocalypse.\n\nQuality of life: There isn't much fluff.\n\n\nTrinium wars isn't trying to be just a pvp game though with tons of releases planned for more maps etc I can't help but question why you wouldn't want to play.\n\nIt's EA, it's fairly stable, the team is listening and it's actually a pretty good looking game once you get away from the very basic first area which serves as a tutorial. All in all if you like classic Korean style combat games like l2? You'll be at home here.\n\nI'm no professional reviewer so you won't see some bs score here I will just say that I was skeptical when I bought but Black Dersert Online was down at launch so..I bought it.\n\nI haven't played BDO yet and that was almost 6 days ago.... My time is spent playing a unfinished EA mmorpg that I can sit back and relax while playing fully knowing the dev team is listening.\n\nI'd recommend this game to those that can handle waiting weeks for content because it is EA after all. This game is by no means complete so cap reaching now will be easy but in a game like this? I can't wait for more pvp content.  Luckily with caps come resource gathering needs.\n\nA really good game at a super cheap price.","March 8","true","42.6"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","32","47","0","2"

I've been looking back and looking at what used to intrest me in mmo's back in the days my fav games were Legend of Mir2. Starwars galixies and vanilla wow.\n\nGames where the community was close, you're faction loved you're faction you're all fighting for the same side - none of this having one of every race nonsense. You pick your side with like minded people sure, your thinking but what do i pick.. its damn simple you pick what you think looks the coolest to you - no seriously you do, pick something that intrests you and dont look back and speak to every person you go past and get to know them.\n\nThere is just so many little things in this game that takes me back to when games were just less "mainstream" the graphics being slightly more simple that most mmo's released today, the old school personal character shops, ui is simple and and not over clogged.\n\nAswell as new features such as MOBA style pvp ground, its just sick.\n\nI will add there is a ingames shop its certainly not P2W and i would recommend everyone to hop on this game and atleast try it out.\n\nAnyways feel free to hit me up with any questions but guys..\nTrinium Wars is worth you're time and money.","March 2","true","203.1"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","31","47","0","1"

During that time the animals, people, and all forms of life were heavily mutated by radiation (mutants). Meanwhile another alien species came to earth to settle on Earth called the Narc. Now the humans have woken up from sleep and are returning to reclaim Earth from both the mutants and the Narc.\n\nThis is more or less a "impression" review as MMO's are very time extensive\n+ Probably the most unique part about this game is that you can drive certain vehicles for quests\n+ The combat is pretty simple but looks great, and later on in the game you really get a sense of how your class operates and which skills to use in order. (for example: Skill A: does more damage when untargeted, Skill B: causing bleeding, Skill C does more damage to bleeding targets)\n+ The world itself looks great visually, it's large and open to explore\n+ The User interface is very attractive, easy to use, customize, and doesn't get in the way\n+ Controls are very familiar if you have ever played any other open world MMO\n+ As with most MMO's this game is more fun if you have friends to play and level up with you.\n+ Interesting characters / classes including some pretty cute female characters with giant guns\n\nThis game is in Early Access so don't take these too seriously\n- The quests are pretty boring and repetitive (generally "go here, collect X amount of this, return, OR go here, kill X amount of this, return)\n- Doesn't do a whole lot to differentiate itself from other MMO's of similar nature\n- There is a cash shop, so along with developer comments I've seen on the forums I'm almost certain this game will be free2play at launch or shortly after so expect microtransactions.\n- The first mount you get (or the one you get for buying the game) is a bit too slow\n\n~ I would have enjoyed playing with a friend or two, so I'd suggest the dev make a "4-pack" option available to buy so that groups of friends who are interested in the game can get a discount, I feel like this would really encourage people to check out the game. Having a friend in a MMO adds a LOT to the time a player is going to spend, and they are more likely to stick around and possibly make a purchase later on. (OR perhaps give people who buy the deluxe / collector edition an additional free gift copy to give to a friend, more players in a MMO is always good)\n\n\nHere is another video at level 5, the combat does improve with more abilities\nhttps://youtu.be/LGXj7xS4TT0","March 5","true","11.4"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","1"

This includes many instances where text isn't even translated and it appears in Chinese letters or creature names are poorly translated or even spelled out incorrectly. For example, an achievement text says I have to kill a rare spawn called a Behimos when in reality, the creature's name is something-something Behemoth.\nSome may call this nitpicking and I am aware the game is still in development, but it's these little details that ruin the immersion. Plus if you don't understand what you have to do or are given incomplete or false instructions, what's the point really?

I decided to play for the sake of old times nostalgia\n\nwhen I used to play more. Guess players like me are the target audience of this game and\n\nalthough it has many bugs, many awful mishaps and crashing from time to time by doing the\n\nregular gaming things. The server is down at least once a day as it was expected for an early\n\naccess game but i didnât come here to talk about this...\n\n\n\nHaving much emotional attachment for such a nostalgic game, I really wanted to make the\n\ncommunity from this game grow! I started working really hard on grouping and placing all the\n\nactive players and encourage new players to keep playing the game, I actually even stalked\n\nsome of them to death. It is so rewarding when we manage to be the bigger and most active\n\nunion in the human faction and when i saw how other members of my union was working\n\nthemselves to inspire a better and more enjoyable environment for everybody, I just couldn't\n\nstop there. Being inspired by the awesome community i feel the need to double my efforts.\n\n\n\nSo i was always working with the GMs to find and report bugs in order to improve the user\n\nexperience of the players, I even managed to find critical bugs that are detrimental to the\n\ngame economy and I made a full report to the GMs about the issue, and even the full steps\n\nto replicate for them to fix the problem.\n\n\n\nI am always encouraging the players to participate in the events to make the community more\n\nactive and give them something to have fun (since the in game content is too short right now,\n\nyou can finish everything in 2 days which nothing for an MMORPG), and players saw the\n\nresults of this. Despite humans being the smaller faction, it was the last resource wars where\n\nthere was more humans and for this reason we were dominating the map!

For the today's kids, yes this game has outdated graphics and has the old school traditional MMO aspect of it, non of that action MMOs that has been coming out lately. I'm pretty old school and don't really care about the whole graphics scene. In my book, if the game is fun and runs smooth I'm a happy camper.\n\nThe game has a pretty decent story and you get to choose between 2 races, the Humans and Narcs. But please PLEASE choose a side carefully because once you do, you can't choose another side.. you will stuck there forever!!!! no going back!\n\nYes its true that some of the most powerful MMOs are out right now like Black Desert Online and Blade & Soul but don't let this MMO fall in the cracks. It has some nice things going for it and the developers are on top of their game. I haven't tried the PVP but it looks amazing and promising. The launch of this game went smoothly and servers are pretty solid, no lag or anything in that sort.\n\nAll in all I would give this MMO a 8/10, it's lacking little bit in some departments but the developers already acknowledge it and going to be adding and fixing this game. So what are you waiting for? Join the Human side :)","March 2","true","2.4"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","29","47","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seratin/recommended/410560/","Seratin","Zuldar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seratin/","182 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTrinium Wars is a fairly stale and generic mmo, but it does have a few interesting features worth mentioning.  For the most part it's your average tab targeter where you run around killing x number of mobs and collecting y number of items.  The core gameplay is nothing we haven't seen a dozen times over.\n\nThe game does shine in a few areas though, and I can see promise occasionally.  The crafting system is interesting, at its core it's similar to the games you'd get on your phone or tablet.  Normally I ignore these style of games with disdain, but with the bulk of the gameplay occupying your time you never really feel you have to wait to continue playing.  I feel this is a pretty strong feature that would be worthy of more development time and focus.  If they build up a really strong crafting system it could make up for the lackluster gameplay.\n\nAnother promising feature is the use of vehicles in combat.  They were somewhat infrequent in the beginning, but you get a decent taste of what they have to offer early on.  I have a few issues with them (but hey, early access) but they could evolve into something interesting.\n\nI glanced at the cash shop they had available.  While nothing stood out as overly pay to win, it seems a lot of quality of life features are locked behind a paywall.  It's too early to say how this will affect the gaming experience, but even early on I had some issue with the starting amount of inventory and warehouse slots.\n\nRight now I would be wary of recommending this game.  There are too many good games already out with gameplay that overshadows Trinium Wars.  This could change if the developers play to their strengths and carve out a comfortable niche in the market.\n\n\n*Keep in mind this is a initial impression of the game after about 4 hours of play and it's still in early access so things may be subject to change.","March 15","false","4.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

You certainly should be into theme-park / quest base MMOs, if you want to play Trinium Wars, but the unique setting, the ability to switch between two weapons (and therefore skillsets) and bunch of armed vehicles gives it a unique charm. For the price it's definitely worth checking out.","March 5","true","2.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","1"

I hope I can give you a brief insight in the game and some of the mechanics which have been discussed in the forum. Please always keep in mind, that this game is in Early Access and has launched like two weeks ago. Developers are very active in the forums and community feedback is taken in consideration for further updates.\n\nChoosing a side/ Making your character: In Trinium Wars you can choose between Humans and Narc (aliens). Although the game states "choose wisely, because the race will be bound to your account" it is possible to play both races with your account, but not at the same time.\nSome users have already complained about being locked by race. Truth is, if you delete all your current characters, you will be able to choose your race again. Therefore you could play with one race until you have done all current content, delete your characters and start fresh with the other race.\nI have choosen Human.\n\nYou can choose from three classes, Warrior (has melee and range attack), Ghost (like a rogue or assassin with meele and range attack) and Esper (range only, elemental damage, area damage). You can also choose female or male. I think three classes are enough. I dislike the idea of modern MMOs with so many different classes, which differ in minor things and in the end, every class is able to do everything so there is little to no need in grouping up. I like the idea of having a role within a group. I am happy to be tank or healer. And the skillsets let me still decide if I want to set my focus on the range attack of my Warior, or if I am more of a melee assassin.\nThe character editor has enough optins to customize your character in my opinion. This is still Early Access and there might be added more options later on.\nYou can choose your face, hairstyle, eye colour and hair colour.\n\nLevelingYou can level up until level 33 (current level cap as far as I know) via questing and a bit of grinding.\nQuests vary from standard "Go there, get me a bunch of this" as well as collecting quests, where you mine minerals and collect herbs or even escorting quests where you turn into a tank (yes a tank or some other kind of vehicle, depending on the mission) and defend a truck or somethingelse. I found these quests very interesting. Especially being able to BE a vehicle for once and not only using it as a mount.\nBtw: Speeder or Orthos (Narc version) are smaller vehicles you can use as mounts. Depending on the level they are more efficient, quicker or have less cooldown.\n\nWhat else...\nPvP Battlefield Trinium Wars has also PvP which is already playable. You can do Moba style matches in Third Person (not drop down) against the opposite faction. In the top left corner there is a button called "WAR". Choosing "Battlefield" leads you to the MOBA PvP. You nee a balanced team of 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4, or 5vs5 and there are currently 2 different maps.\nChoosing "Resource War" will not work right now. The Resource War will be unlocked later on during Early Access and provides the game with a map which allows 1000 players (500 Humans/500Narc) to do PvP against each other at the same time. As far as I know, during Resource War you can mine different resources which are more or less rare in the normal maps and even set up mines, sending out transport trucks, which can be attacked by the enemy faction. I am really looking forward to that.\n\nBase Building and Crafting\nTrinium Wars also features a base building mode which may look like some mobile game at first, but is really an efficient way to get you some armoury, potions and weapons. To craft you have to build different "facilities", which can be upgraded to get the better stuff. You can also craft weapons and armour for different classes, not only your own. If you need more money, you can simply sell selfmade armour via the Auction House or by setting up a player shop.\nThere is one special skillset called mechanic skill that can only be crafted in the base building mode or find as rare loot. That's kinda neat.\nI have heard a lot of good stuff about the crafting system and that there is way more to it, then it seems at first glance.\nI will have to sunk some more hours into this.\nBtw: If you find rare loot you need special tools to identify them. Some players have already complained that the one for highend stuff is only available via the cash shop right now. What I read so far, the developers have taken this feedback in consideration and will change that in near future.\n\nEarly AccessAnd yes. This game is in Early Access. It has launched March 2nd. So 10 days ago. Of course there are some bugs. But everyone choosing to buy an EARLY ACCESS game knows that. We, who own the game, have not paid to get a complete product. We have paid to check a game out long before it has gone into commercial launch. Because we are intrigued, because we really liked the idea and wanted to support the developer, because we are simply into game testing or just to be FIRST.^^\nThat said, the game runs stable, here and there you might encounter some frame drops or lag. Nothing special really. You get that in nearly every other MMO as well. Server have been quite stable and if they were down I experienced the developers and mods to react quite quickly to it.\nYes the graphics are a bit outdated, but I don't mind. I don't need a graphic feast, I want an MMORPG with a nice setting, a great community to engange in and a developer team that is active. And I get all of this from Trinium Wars. Therefore I would recommend it, if you agree with most points of my personal opinion. ;)","March 12","true","8.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Gives me that Old school MMO feel that I used to get. A great Mix of grinding and questing. Class system is overall amazing. On one hand I'm a sword swinging bad***, but when the war breaks out its just me and my rifle.\nB.) The graphics. Yes I said it. Its beautiful in its own way and doesn't sacrifice great gameplay by over the top graphics. Not everyone has a top of the line machine. This game allows a far greater scope of people who can play without Frame rate issues.\nC.)I think once it becomes populated the community will be great, RP along with social interactions will develope like they are suppose to. Any MMORPG in my opinion needs core elements to stay fresh. New Content every so often,Great community with a strong backbone and Lore with Light or heavy RP.\n\n\nIf you buy this game, Engage in the community, Tryout a little RP and TALK to others in game. If you can do this watch as this game becomes one of your favorites instantly.\n\nP.S Don't worry too much about it being release under different names before. Its my first time playing it and honestly if I knew about it before and found out it was coming back..I'd come back right along with it. Make your own choice, but in the end this game has the potential to be great and have a great community behind it.\n\n\nAnd no its not Pay to Win, the cash shop along with the bundle they give all starters is crazy and puts everyone at an above equal advantage.

Liked that style some years ago though and still feel some sympathy for it.\nDevs definitely have to work on the servers but it seems it is on their list with some priority so hope is stability improves soon.","March 21","true","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is not very similar, but just feels the same to me. There are not many servers/players on Trinium Wars, which will change as it is easy to find activation codes. (XWWYD-WJW35-BY498). This game is a bit odd with the combat aspect, as sometimes enemies appear out of nowhere and you have to keep turning to fight. I'd give this a 6/10, as it is still in early access for a reason.","March 21","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

On the other hand old school players are going to feel at home, especially the ones that used to play RF Online. In fact, this game could be considered a clone of RF Online with a somewhat improved experience and a few fresh ideas. Considering how few MMOs have been coming out that aren't complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ nowadays, you should consider giving this one a chance, beyond the not very appealing facade you might find it surprisingly refreshing.","March 18","true","13.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Reminds me of a mix of Planet Calypso and Fallen Earth. I would rate this as a Alpha game, mostly cause their is some content that needs to be added.\n\nFirst 10-20 minutes the game moves abit slow. But after that the concept comes into play and it is a very nice game. Being able to play your typical browser based games in a MMORPG its quite nice. The foundation of the game is well thought out, it has alot of potential to be great. Just have to keep a open mind since it is still in early developement.\n\nI give this a 5 on a scale of 1-10, still needs some more content but it is still has a playability of 100+ hours.","March 10","true","16.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Yes they are click this and  kill that but in a unique and fresh way. You aren't always using your character skills but the enviorment as well. Such as jumping into a turrent to mow down enemies and getting bombed out of it, and also escorting a bus from an outpost to the main HQ, the last one i've finished was drop podding down into a battle tank and shelling the crap out of 10 or so waves of enemies so to me there is a lot of fun to be had.

So im only a few hrs in and its a basic mmo atm nothing we have'nt seen before, but i think this is a good starter MMO if you are new into the genra and want to try one out that is cheap and fun. The game still has a few flaws but for a EA game it can be overlooked easy or down the road will be changed or fixed .\n\nSo for the time being ill pass this one and say give it a go.

It is Early Access and needs some polishment but it's fun and quite addictive. The story is unique and interesting and the design is awesome.\n\nHaving two weapons by default and thus having weapon depending skills is a nice approach in this sci-fi setting. The battles feel on the point and knowing when to use the right skills is rewarding. The approach to include vehicles like a tank or a mech in some missions is another cool idea and improves gameplay.

No matter how many players are playing, you will always have much to experience and this helpful community will always be here to help you get involved in every aspect of the game.\n\nAspects / Features\n- "Leveling / Questing" : I don't have to much to say about questing because every MMO has this but I do very much enjoy the story and lore of this game. Max level is currently 33 but the creators have mentioned a few times on a raise in the near future.\n\n- "Crafting" : Crafting in Trinium wars is very neat. If you are just starting out I think you should experience this for yourself. Crafting is a huge thing in the game and can be very handy.\n\n- "BattleGrounds" : This will probally be one of the neatest and greatest PvP modes you will experience in any MMO. This PvP mode is level 1 + , it is balanced for players. This is where Trinium Wars wonderful community comes in. If you need help or are interested in testing the battlegrounds. The community will always do everything they can to get you involved in these.\n\n- "Resource Wars" : Us players have only participated in this once for an amazing event hosted by the GMs. I personally had a blast participating in this. It takes a few minutes getting use to but if you are a PvPer , this mode is a must for you.\n\n(Next War Is Tomorrow) - 3/26/2016\n\nWhat We Know About The Future Of Trinium Wars Content : Level Raising / Dungeons - Coming Soon\n\n\nOne of the greatest things about Trinium Wars would be that the GMs are always around for the players. The GMs interact with the players making wonderful events for us constantly. (Literally All The Time, Never Ending Fun!) If you are are on edge if you should buy the game or not. Definetly try it. Many MMO websites will give away keys and its only $5 dollars if you want to just try it.\n\nHope To See You In Game!!\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n- Namsy (Narc)","March 25","true","92.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Old-school, new-school, sandbox, thempark, you name it. The one thing I learned about the MMO genre is that you can't judge one MMO universely.

I only played for about an hour, so its early to give a full-on opinion.\n\nThe game runs smoothly on in terms of controls and the graphics aren't bad they are just dated a little. I'm not a graphics guy so this doesn't matter to me.\n\nKeep in mind, the game isn't free to play. You buy to play it and the cash shop does have a few things you will want very badly.

That being said, this game is pretty cool.  The only complaint I have so far is the Konglesh (to steal a term) does get distracting and break immersion at times.  However, and still in the early levels, this game is impressive.  The PvE is challenging, the UI is intuitive, the tutorials are useful and most importantly, the community and GM's are active and friendly.  I'd reccomend hopping on the voice chat - already making the learning curve of this game much friendlier and more enjoyable.\nI've yet to PvP, do much with the AH, crafting system or guild things.  So, much more to look forward to in the days and weeks ahead.  I hope this game takes off - feels like it's off to a good start.","March 10","true","17.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

There is nothing to pick at right now that stands out as really bad although it is just too bland with little content to keep you going more than a few hours.  Character movement is  stiff and combat is quite repetetive although not more so than similar type MMO's.  Questing is extremely grindy with very basic quest objectives that get very old very quick.  It is just ok.\nThis title deserves more of a neutral feedback although Steam does not provide that option.  Since I cannot recommend this game at the moment it will get a thumbs down from me.  It is worthy to keep an eye out for in the future as with a bit more content among other changes it could become a title worth picking up especially one of the less expensive starter packs.\n\nI do however want to give a shout out to "6" and thank him for getting me a key to try out this title.

I only ran this game once and probably played for less than a minute and immediately uninstalled it for good. Game didn't look very polished and I just don't know what the publisher and developers were thinking of bringing this game to NA because they are too late on this one. In fact, Korean developers seem to be bringing their failed old crappy mmorpg to Western lately. I'm not very sure if they are insulting us or... thinking if we are too dumb dumb to play their smelly ol socks (crappy games) while predicting that their bags of recycled smelly ol socks would be successful here. I know that they are lying about having huge amount of players on their server but as I've tried it out (less than a minute) without having a feeling of satisfaction because of how gross the character looked and its animation.\n\nIf they are still going to charge people for 8 bucks for their crappy mmo on Steam, why not just make it free? They are very greedy. If there are new mmorpg French maids or Butlers out there, don't start with this one because it'll make your tummy very very upset and I'm sure you wouldn't want boo boo... would you now?\n\nI'm very glad that I was able to grab keys from mmo website because other wise, I'd be regretting on even buying this game.\n\nLet me tell you one last thing. This game is not worth 8 bucks. Just look at it... it'll melt your eyes!!\n\nOh and these guys probably won't get out of "Early Access" stage because of $$$","May 11","false","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

Hello !!!\nWell, i've played 14 hours of this game and in that 14 hours of gameplay (Without fun at 5 hours+ because quest are so\nrepeated )  i just complete COLLECT QUESTS !!!!\nWhy this mmo have only collect items quest ( Most of then ) ??? it's soooo boring! i think... this game can be so much better for the next months because it is only early and u guys just put this game on steam to sell to get some negative and positive REVIEWS .\n\nLets go to stats:\n\nÂº Fun according to the gameplay  4/10\n\nÂº Variety of quest : 3/10 ( Quest 1 : Kill some of that mob ; Quest 2 : Collect 100000 herbs ; Quest 3 : Escort quests\n\nÂº Graphics : 5/10 ( that game has the same graphics on games launch in 2006 - 2008 i know u developers can improve the graphics\n\nÂº Game difficulty : 6.5/10 ( I give that number because this game is not HARD to do some thing/Kill mobs BUT Its not easy too ... if u think can lure more than two/three mobs ... MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN u are in trouble !\n\nÂº Movement / Camera : 5/10 ( In that game u can use CLICK to move or QWES " Whaat wait Q and E ? Why ??? Well... if u want to straffe right and left u will need to use those !!! " Very different and confuse method to move ur char !!!\nAbout the camera ... i'm not a big fan to need to click Right click on my mouse to move camera location i think... if u guys just let us move the camera only when move mouse too " Like others rpg/mmo" that will be good because everytime u need to change camera location and everytime u need to > Right click > Move camera > release right click ... just set mouse movement to set camera location.\n\nÂº Obs: This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me right ? Well... WHY WE NOT HAVE INV SLOTS ??? OMG !!! Mannnnnnn this is a mmo !!! We allllllllllways will need inv slot spaces ( 40 slots is not enough and idk arround 8 on WH ?) Plsss give us more inv slots !! ( I know that is a game and u guys will sell some backpack slots on the cash shop BUT more 15 - 20 slots would be nice )\n\nÂº Obs 2 : I play this game for 14 hours and idk what are that thing on the middle of the screen LEFT ... i see two bars ( Each one consumed to use skills ) But no information about each one ... EX: When put the mouse on the " Health " it will show " HP " ... Put mouse on the " Mana/Magic " it will show " MP " u guys can do that on the two things on the left middle of the screen to us ( PLAYERS ) know what is each one !\n\nÂº Resume : Well DEVELOPERS/STAFF this game can be good with some changes but u guys has so much work to do !!!\nI found some bugs in the game ( i get two SS showing that up ) i do not added a BUG REVIEW here because that > EARLY ACCESS GAME !!!\nDevelopers I WISH U GOOD LUCKY ON THE GAME ( CREATE NEW THINGS AND FIX SOME THINGS TOO ) But on my review now cant be a " YES " because the game has so many negative thigs ! But i will wait anxious for the final version of the game and for sure i will review again and probably will do the YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!","March 30","false","14.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice acting is kinda bad and the graphics are old. Gameplay wise its just mash your abilites and walk back and forth to objectives, also NPC's generally dont have voices. The character creator is pretty lame, only ten face and hair options and thats about it other then color or said selections.\nTL;DR : 3/10 but may rise if the developers ever finish it.","March 23","false","1.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","3","10","3","0"

The zones are completely dead. The combat is very slow , awkward,  and fidgity. Mounts cant jump lol really? Not a game breaker just annoying(No fall dmg though). In all honesty the game wouldnt be on par with other mmos even 10 years ago. Terrain looks ok but little to no character customization. So far ALL gear practically looks the same and offers no variance. Special Solo quest every other quest (in an mmo) is pretty annoying. Now as far as movement goes its pretty clumsy. No strafing while mounted and watching the pathing of escort npcs is just hidious. There are some cool features but not many. Only 3 classes , a warrior , ghost(rogue wanna be), and esper (think steampunk mage). All in all the game might have potential but with the playerbase being so low the game will more than likely die before it gets a chance to implement them. With other games likes Blade n Soul and Black Desert being just released sadly newer games like this literally stand no chance at gaining a playerbase .\n\nNo I would not recommend this game to others til there is alot more to offer class wise and content wise, and til there is actually a population in game.\n\nPros:\nLow Spec pcs will have no trouble running on max\nPvP (if population grows)\nEarly Mount\nAchievements\nHonestly thats all the positive things I could think of\n\nCons:\nNo playerbase\nPoor character customization\nAwkward and Wonky movement\nSlow poorly animated combat animations\nGeneric Questing\nUnique features game claims to offer poorly done\nCash Shop\nItem prices ridiculously high to have no playerbase\nPretty Grind Heavy\nQuest are story driven but offer a genericly poor story plot","March 14","false","10.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

First,the game boots into a low resolution that required me to change my font settings on my computer to 100% to get everything on the screen. The graphics are outdated,it looks like a game from 2002. The gameplay was nothing new,the same boring questing,kill x number of mobs,talk to this person etc....
