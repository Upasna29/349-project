However, I will warn the Sherlock purists that this game has only a very passing relationship to the book so if you're looking for a HO-version of the classic, you very well might hate this.  The story is really very different.\n\nIn terms of general gameplay this is a pretty standard game for the genre, with HO scenes mixed with minigame puzzles and the usual inventory-based puzzles.  Where it departs from the norm is with a handful of special "powers" unlocked throughout the game that add to the puzzles; while in some cases it's apparent what you have to use and when, other times it took some thought and I appreciated that.\n\nPuzzles and minigames themselves are average difficulty, not hard but not too easy, with the exception of one or two of the minigames that were just obnoxious; however there is a skip button or if you're intent on getting a no-skip achievement, there are solutions online (I confess to being guilty of looking up one or two solutions for that reason).\n\nSound and voice acting is nothing stellar but definitely better than the average, if you consider that most HO games have extremely poor voice acting.\n\nAll in all, a great game with some unique aspects that make it stand out.  Worth it if you're a fan of this style of game.","January 23","true","7.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The story is appropriately ludicrous (and has nothing but the name in common with the book), but all in all it's rather inoffensive. The art is nice enough, the music and voice acting less so, but they get the job done without being jarringly bad. But most importantly, both the HOG scenes and the puzzles are decently done. I did find them to be mostly on the easier side even on the hard difficulty (with the exception of one or two puzzles towards the end that actually provided some challenge), but nonetheless they were enjoyable.\n\nSo for anyone who doesn't normally play HOGs: This might not be a good enough game to get introduced to the genre with. (Though it is much better than the average HOG slop nonetheless, which may be a useful thing to keep in mind.)\n\nFor HOG players: This is actually a fun game, with acceptable production values and enjoyable puzzles. The gameplay feels streamlined and doesn't ever get frustrating, plus it has some decent length. I'd still wait for a discount, but ymmv.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're playing with smaller children you may wonna pre-screen. There are no real scares, but some gore, which is suspiciously absent from the Steam screenshots.","June 11, 2015","true","4.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I got the sense that the developers really enjoyed creating this point and click, hidden object tale. The puzzles are done cleverly, and without being too easy or mind numbingly hard. One or two of them actually gave me pause in a good way. The colors are wonderfully lush, the atmosphere eerie, the music pretty, and the vocal talent/cast does a good job from beginning to end. Watson's dialogue is a treat in a few scenes. However, I won't spoil it for you. I finished the game within a few hours and was not disappointed in the least.

This time Frogware is just a publisher not the developer and this choice is evident in many ways inside the game.\n\nThis short adventure starts With Henry Baskerville asking Sherlock Holmes to help him to break the curse of his family which involves a big Hound that brutally kills all of the Baskerville family members from generations. Now, for those who are familiar with Sherlock Holmes and the original novel, yes: this is not exactly a faithful transposition but it's more like an interpretation... Which works good and bad at the same time. Good beccause the adventure in a big mansion where a Demonic dog is supposed to be is quite a good idea giving the game a good dark atmosphere. Bad because this interpretation involves magic and time travel (without any particular consequence, so it's just an excuse to have another room with riddles with a few minor graphic differences), which really don't belong in a Sherlock Holmes adventure.\nAs a Hidden Object game The gameplay doesn't need much explanation. You need to explore rooms or other ambiences, pick up items, interact with various objects and when you focus on determined zones you will be requested to find a long list of items very well hidden in the screen. Besides that you can find a very long list of puzzles and riddels, some of them are quite easy, but there are few VERY TOUGHT ones that forced me to get some help to deal with them.\nThis title can count on a good soundtrack most of the times trying to give a tense atmosphere, maybe even more than necessary. Besides that Holmes, Watson and Henry Baskerville will often talk during the adventure and not just with captions as already happened with the persian carpet, but we can hear the original voice cast for our two protagonist, which is really appreciated.\nThe worst side of this title I believe is the menu and game system, where you don't save because it's an automatic progress but you can't start a new game befor you completely finish it first unless you erase and create a new game profile... An operation that will delete your (ingame) achievements, which is the reason that took me 5 runs instead of just 2 to fully achieve the game.\n\n+++PROs+++ GOOD ADVENTURE. All in all this title represent a good adventure, with tough Hidden Object sections, Some very Hard Puzzles and Riddles, with easier ones, various dialogues with characters and a nice soundtrack.---CONs--- MAGIC. Actually This version of the Hound of the Baskervilles doesn't really suit a Sherlock Adventure mostly because it doesn't give an explanation at the end even though for all the time Sherlock says there Must be an explanation.\nSAVE SYSTEM AND MENU. This game doesn't have a way to restart the game unless you finish it first and the only way to do that is to erase your ingame profile and make a new one. But this way you will lose all your ingame achievements, and I don't recall being informed of this at the moment.","May 12","true","9.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a perfectly good game for its genre with good HO scenes and logic in puzzles. The puzzle type and difficulty varies greatly throughout the game; most are doable without guide or hints.\n\nThe story follows Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson as they go with Lord Baskerville to his mansion to find out why his bloodline has apparently been cursed and his ancestors all died to this curse by being attacked by the creature known as the Hound of the Baskerville.\n\nAs a Sherlock story it's a bit... blasphemous; the story has heavy focus on supernatural theme and there no logical solution is found (this is not really a spoiler),\n\nThe game has good visual progress with throughout the game you complete "badges" to unlock powers to get into new rooms. Not really sure if this is good or not as it reminded me a bit too much of the much more child-friendly Princess Isabella games.\n\nAll achievements are easily earned; the one it says you get for "completing the game" is actually earned for Easy mode only, and as it has an achievement for completing Hard mode, you'll have to play it through twice to get all achievements. All dialogues can be skipped and as I accidentally clicked away a sentence said by a character, I can only assume that the "do not skip" achievement is only messed up if you click "skip" on dialogues entirely and not for normal left-click for skipping the sayings individually.\n\nI didn't have too much problem with the voice-acting; Sherlock is a bit more enthusiastic in this game than he is in the later P&C games Testament and Crimes and Punishment. The sound effects and music is pretty good, but if you play League of Legends it might annoy you that in one musictrack there are sounds almost identical to "found a game" and "game invite" in LoL.\n\nBuy more for the Hidden Object genre than for it being a Sherlock Holmes game. You may wanna buy it on a discount as it's getting a bit old, but it's a very enjoyable game.","February 21","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Any hard-headed fan of the books should probably stop and not look too hard at the plot here which bases itself around mystical murders, summoning, magic, dimension hopping and ghostly goings on. Its less Sherlock and more Doctor Who style of a story.\n\nIn any case I probably should talk about the gameplay, the whole thing plays as a mix between an Adventure title and a casual Hidden Object game. As such theres a good amount of scenes where you have to scour for items, however theres also a good amount of puzzles to back the whole thing up. Theres nothing too difficult here but the scenes are varied and colourful enough and the game runs by at a fast enough pace to avoid players being too bored.\n\nEssentially if you dont mind the odd Hidden Object title, its one to pick up.

Apart from the presence of Sir Henry Baskerville this game has nothing to do with the novelâ€“ not only the titular hellhound is an actual demon, but Holmes even uses magical powers to battle it.\nDespite this rather unique use of artistic freedom, the writing is the main strength of this title: both the short plot and the large number of dialogues are great and the actors do an excellent job as well.\n\nThe game itself is just a glorified item gathering: you visit rooms to collect things either from the scenery or by playing meticulously crafted hidden object scenes, assemble them into some fairly challenging puzzles, which reward you with even more items. This pattern is repeated from start to finish with not change in the concept.\nDonâ€™t be fooled though, the game isnâ€™t easy. It is aimed at the more experienced hidden object players, who will undoubtedly have several hours of great fun with it.","January 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

More an Adventure/RPG type of gamer. But this game is done very well. It is very loosely based on 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (actually so loosely that it has little to do with it ), however the creators just made a game that is fun to play and that is more important than trying to make a game realistic or following some story.\n\nContrary to most adventure/casual games this has quite a lot of different kind of puzzles. For instance, one based on planar graphs, a puzzle based on rotating groups of tiles (which I found the most difficult yet solvable after a little thought), a few about identifying objects in a scene etc. It is nice to see a game with such a variety. The renderings are awesome. Don't expect much animation though the game is mainly still pictures with some animation happening when you solve a puzzle but the game still looks gorgeous.\n\nAnother thing is that the game isn't too easy yet can be solved without a walkthrough. There are also buttons that let you skip a puzzle when you are stuck or ask for help. I skipped one puzzle ( the one where you have to compare, the painting of a vase, to the 'real thing' and find the differences) because I needed to quit).\n\nI clocked in about 16 hours.","March 29, 2014","true","15.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/209230/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","Yeeeah. I had to play through it 3 times to get the last achievement (Golden Hound - for having all the other achievements), which would not unlock despite me indeed having all the other achievements, because my two games (normal and hard) were done on two different profiles and they needed to be done on the same one. And the only reason I needed to do more than one anyway was that apparently finishing it on hard does not count as finishing it on normal.. what? That and the "finish 10 hidden object puzzles in under 3 minutes each" achievement is dumb since you get no feedback to tell you if you fail.\n\nOh, and I couldn't find the actual save game file, no idea where it's hidden, so good luck to you if you mess up! I did find the save game screenshot thumbnail folder (inside %appdata%\roaming\frogwares\sherlock holmes and the hound of the baskervilles), and when those thumbnails were deleted/restored, it messed up and broke my existing test profiles, so that was fun too. My profile reset to a player name of "Katy" or something just before it broke completely. I wonder who that is.\n\nNot sure where the data itself was though. Apparently other people have save corruption or achievements not unlocking sometimes, thankfully I didn't have any other issues besides having to run it 3 times or I'd have had an aneurism.\n\nThere is a reference to an easter egg.. somewhere.. as well, But I have no idea what/where it was. It just shows as a hidden achievement in game, but not on Steam, as far as I can tell.\n\nAchievements aside, the story breaks the realms of reality, going with Sherlock in a world with various magical powers. If you ignore the way they stomp all over the Sherlock lore, the story was okay, and one play through of the game will normally take you between 3h 30m to 4h or so, but the ending was absolutely terrible, an anti-climatic cutscene that made no sense and prematurely ended the game right at the climax of the plot, after all the build up to that point. Again.. what?\n\nVoice acting was halfway decent, but there were a couple of animated shorts at the start and end of the game, and they were TERRIBLE. They should have left it just as static scenes flashing from one to the next, that would have fit better with the rest of the game. I think that the animated shorts were so awful that they actually hurt the game in the end.\n\nGameplay was mediocre, it's a really generic hidden object game, plus a few easy to medium difficulty puzzles, loosely covered in Sherlock Holmes wrapping paper. There is exactly one "Sherlock Holmes-esque" leap of deduction made by the Great Detective in the game - right at the start, when Henry arrived and was introducing the case. That's it. Hint and puzzle skipping mechanics seemed to work fine, no issues except that some of the items were actually unfamiliar to me and I had to Google them up to find out what I was supposed to look for since the list of items didn't include what the item looked like.\n\nThe developer of the game was Waterlily Games, described by Wikipedia as being a sub-studio of Frogwares which "focused on casual, hidden object, and light adventure games for PC and iOS". In that light, they probably did a good job on the game, leaving the parent Frogwares to work on the "true" Sherlock adventure games.\n\nThe only other Sherlock game I've played (and also 100%'d) before this is The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, and I loved that one very much. This one however, I cannot recommend. Even as generic hidden object or puzzle adventure games go, there are other better and more engaging ones out there for the same price, like Jolly Rover, Machinarium, Puzzle Agent 1-2, and others.","July 7, 2014","false","13.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Both settings are enjoyable,with the hard setting throwing a couple decent challenges at you.\n\nIf you look at this game as a typical adventure game, it does its job well. The puzzles were about the right difficulty, you had to combine items you had gotten before, use the "amulet powers" and you can beat the game using only your logic. I do not care much for the highlight object mini-games though, since most of the time you find the item you want easily but still have to collect random stuff like lamps and feathers for no apparent reason.\n\nThe pallete and textures are decent and most of the items in the highlight object mini-games can be seen clearly. Some are harder to see, but still it is more an issue of clever use of environment rather than not being able to distinguish something from the environment (unlike previous games like Dracula: Origin).\n\nWARNING: The following contains spoilers.\n\nMuch like Baskerville Hall, not everything is sunny though. My biggest problem is how the source material is used. As I said, this is a solid adventure game, but not a very good Sherlock Holmes story. There are supernatural elements that are left unexplained, the main plot is not given a rational explanation as one would expect from Holmes and so on. I was very dissapointed by the ending, but it became apparent in the middle of the game that either this must be a dream or there is no way that there is a rational explanation for all of this. Even if we ignore this and treat this as a typical non-Holmes detective story, there is not a final verdict on who used the hound or something like that (in contrast to the book). In the end, you feel more like a ghost hunter than a detective.\n\nIf you are a casual adventure games player this game is worth it, especially if you find it on sale or bundled. I am afraid hardcore adventure players will just breeze through it, so only get it if you have finished harder games and want to kill some time. Sherlock Holmes fans should probably best avoid it, since the source material is not treated well.\n\nFinally, one can see that Frogwares has evolved from earlies titles and continues to evolve to the much better "Testament of Sherlock Holmes". I am at least happy to see this as a stepping stone towards a better future for a small developer.","July 7, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The supernatural story is an affront to Holmesian reason, the voice actors are poorly cast, and the visuals are often of poor quality. Moreover, the hidden object scenes are roughshod and the puzzles range from dirt simple to frustratingly unintuitive. There are certainly some redeeming qualities here and there - an excellent map, for example - but the overall experience is just a little sub-par.","November 14, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have a couple interesting tack-ons, such as the Elements, and a couple tough puzzles, particularly towards the end.\n\nArt is decent and I didn't find the HO scenes too dark, which can absolutely ruin a HO game.\n\nThere are only two difficulty levels - Easy and Hard.  Hard is more like Casual in other HO games.  Hints are available, and without penalty, an auto-hint will alert your next move if you take too long in a room, and the map notates rooms that have a current puzzle or object available.\n\nAs a couple others have stated, the story is rather ludicrous, but worst is the voice acting.  Now, Frogwares, I'm sure you didn't have a large budget for the voice acting, but you could have at least had the actors slow down a little and use the punctuation properly when they were speaking.  It was like they were speed reading the script.\n\nLastly, I was very disappointed with the end.  It just kind of...ended.","November 1, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the other hand, a lot of it is just a hidden object game, and the story (what little there actually is of it) has basically nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes. All in all, it's cheap, but you just can't help but get the feeling there should be more to it.","September 26, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is considered a casual adventure game and it is unclear if this game is considered cannon or not. This game is made and could chronilogically be after Sherlock Versus Jack the Ripper.\n\nThe issue is that at the end of Sherlock Versus Jack the Ripper the Sherlock told Dr. Watson to cover up Jack the Ripper's story with a story about magical hounds refering to the story The Hounds of Baskerville. Playing this game could have easily be "fiction" in the Sherlock universe to cover this up, however during the game Watson refers to the Jack the Ripper case in this game thus putting this game in a type of limbo within Frogware's Sherlock Holmes universe.\n\nAfter playing Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of the Persian Carpet, I was cautious to play another point and click adventure game by Frogware. I was happily suprised immediately when I start the game that all my worries were for not. Frogware fixed everything that was wrong with the Persian Carpet. There are slight animations instead of still frames, voice acting, and unique setting and puzzles. This game is probably one of the best examples of a point and click adventure and hidden object game. You need to find hidden objects and then some of those found objects are used and combined to solve another puzzle.\n\nThe graphics are great, even better than the 3D counterparts. The 2D graphics are rich with colors and gloomy. The sound is very atmospheric.\n\nThe story is great. I would say the journey is more important than the destination. The ending was satisfactory but this game was really about the experiance. It is difficult to talk about this game without ruining it.\n\nThis game is worth full price and should be in, any fan of Sherlock Holmes, gaming library.","August 13, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
