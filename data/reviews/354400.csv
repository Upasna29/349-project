Each song is catchy, fun and makes the soundtrack alone worth the price of the game.\nA ton of hidden objectives and unlockables that make the game have a surprising amount of replayability. Additional game modes and developer commentary for each level just to name a few.\nFree demo of the entire composition mode available at: http://bitfinitygames.com/composition-mode-demo/\nCONS:Composition mode songs are shared through QR code which may make it virtually impossible for those without a webcam or smart phone to share songs in addition to being a general pain overall.\nYou can only save up to custom 12 songs locally, meaning it is impossible to build up a big library of user created music.\nSUMMARY:	Tadpole Treble is the epitome of what an aesthetic and music focused game should be; simple gameplay made fun by good game design and an outstanding soundtrack.  Each world encompasses a completely different genre and theme that throws a new challenge at you keeping each level fresh even though the gameplay is simplistic. Backwards levels, giant turtles, angry piranhas; I’m hard pressed to find even a single level that is the same as another.  But what really separates the levels is the music. Almost every song in the game is of some of the best written music I have seen in an indie game. Most of the songs are extremely memorable, so much so that I’ve actually downloaded a few of my favorites for personal listening. My only real issue is that the composition mode could be more user friendly, but gameplay wise for 10$ the game is definitely worth a play.\n\nEXTRA NOTE: Game was provided by the developer solely for review purposes with no compensation or incentive to give a positive review. If you have any questions or concerns about my journalistic integrity please feel free to ask.","May 6","true","21.1"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","35","36","2","0"

My favourite music-based game. While it's true that you'll be "through" in a little more than an hour, you'll be far from finished as collecting all the things is in fact damn challenging. Since you'll never have the time to see all the funny and cute details in the back- and foreground, pay attention to the music and to collect all the bubbles and whatnot at the same time, repeating a level over and over is actually quite fun. I'll come back to this very often and encourage everybody to do the same.\n\nOh yes - this is by no means "Early Access" by Steam standards - it's actually a finished game, only lacking some Steam features.

Yes, the main story is small (I could probably have finished it in about an hour had I not gone back and replayed many of the levels in order to get at least an "A" rank on each one), but the addition of "Composition Mode" is really fun to play with, and there are plenty of online levels that can be played if you scan the QR codes. Not the most efficient system, but I'd say it works for now.\n\nAlso, I'll probably end up buying the soundtrack at some point. The music here is top-notch.\n\nAnyway, despite the short length, I'd say this game still justifies the $10 price tag, and I do indeed recommend it. If rhythm games aren't your favorite or you don't really enjoy music-centered games (there is at least one person out there like this), I would still say to maybe wait until the game goes on sale and then give it a shot. It is definitely worth it.\n\n\nAfternote: This game is indeed a finished product, despite the "Early Access" tag. This is not a scam or a trick to get you to buy the game before it has all of the gameplay features; the game is complete and surprisingly polished.","May 10","true","5.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's brimming with creativity, originality, challenge, and fun. I was genuinely surprised that it was considered an early access title given it's fun and unique gameplay, level variety, and all the little secrets and tidbits. I can safely say that this is the best indie title of the first half of the year.\n\nIt's great for children, as well. I'm sure if only this was more popular, it'd be a hit with the younger crowd. For adults, you can definitely appreciate the amount of effort and passion put into the game, even if it may come off corny, but the challenge is still real.\n\nIt's a breath of fresh air in a market filled with shallow and soulless design/aesthetics.\n\nIf I were to give it criticism, however, I think that the controls are a little iffy. There isn't much of an incentive to hold down the up/down key as it's incredibly inaccurate, the superior option being to tap the button instead. The problem with this is that this can put a lot of strain on your hands.\n\nAside from that, it's a pretty fantastic game.","May 17","true","4.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Each and every level has it's own unique music that makes all the more worth while when swimming from point a to point b. I personally loved chiptune lagoon, midnight bayou, piranha jungle and  saltwater cape not only for it's  music but it's level design is also great (and those flytraps singing are amazing 10/10). The graphics in of itself made me feel I was a kid again with literally every single thing in the game being drawn by hand and the overall atmosphere feeling like an old educational game but with music instead of the abc's.\n\nEven though the game is relatively short (about and hour or two on your initial playthough) the level editor is amazing. The fact that it's basically a mario paint music maker but with a tadpole sold me and the only real complaint that I have with the game is there's no option to purchase the music by itself on steam (and ik that you can buy it on itunes and amazon but having a steam option would be nice).\n\nOverall, if you like really good music and a short but simple game give this game and even if you end up not liking it you can always refund it so there's no harm no foul.","May 19","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level's obstacles are musical notes, and the levels is a scrolling musical score. Get through the level without dying. That is all. This game puts a LOT of focus on music, and I like that. it has a beautiful soundtrack.

That's all I have to say.\n\nA little bit of backstory: I was reading BITF (Brawl in the Family) almost every day since around #100 when I heard that Matthew (the developer of the game and comic) was making a game, I was really hyped for it. I waited a long time, some people criticized him for taking so long but I waited patiently. The wait was worth it.\n\nThen I got an email from Steam, the message was clear. Tadpole Treble was out. Instantly bought it and started playing it. The game seems pretty short but is really fun (and challenging), but I'm planning to complete it.\n\nWhen you open up the menu you see Story, Composition, Extras, and everything else you'd expect on a menu.\nStory is, well the story mode. Short but fun (I haven't quite finished it yet).\nExtras, I haven't checked them yet to see if I've unlocked anything\nAnd Composition mode, a mode where you can make your own stages using almost everything in the game. Currently I'm working on some songs to have for friends or when steam workshop support comes out (I wouldn't be surprised if they added it). The song I'm working on now is the original Legend of Zelda Dungeon Theme. It's going really smoothly, the UI for composition mode is very simple and easy to use.\n\nI highly recommend this game to music lovers, BITF lovers, or just about anyone.\nThe game is currently on Steam and Wii U.

It's full of personality, the characters are adorable and hillarious in turn, and the soundtrack would be amazing even on its own. (Thunder Creek is my new favorite song.) The Treble Charge mechanic is tricky to pull off, especially in the faster paced songs near the end, but it's very rewarding to be able to plow through everything that's giving you a hard time. The final boss battle is a joy to behold, if a little confusing your first few attempts. The art and musing being from the genius who gave us Brawl in the Family is just the icing on the cake!\n\nSadly, it's not without a few flaws. Despite the obvious amounts of polish that went into this game, there are a few bugs that can't be eaten by Etude. Firstly, I noticed a few times that a cymbal would project a location, only to send me a half-step just above or below where it was listed. In a game where positioning is everything, this can very easily wreck a run of a song. In Piranah Jungle, this happens consistantly on the second cymbal, completely preventing you from grabbing all the bubbles! This needs to be fixed ASAP! Also, I noticed occasionally while talking to Etude that his text would bug out and skip a line of dialog. This isn't too bad, as that option is just there for fun and flavor, but it is frustrating to miss the setup to a punchline.\n\nAnother little detail is that it can be somewhat tiresome on the later songs to sit through their intros whenever you have to restart, due to missing one lousy bubble. That's more a problem with trying to be perfect in rythm games in general, though, and the songs are so good, It's not like it's a chore to get to hear more of them.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the money. Just fix up the bugs and you've really got something special here, Matt!","May 7","true","51.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Tadpole Treble has some of the best music that I've heard in a game for some time now. Each song is different, memorable, and very catchy.\n\nThe composition mode is also a great touch, allowing friends to share their own musical ideas. Though it is a bit tricky to use, and knowing how to play an instrument or read sheet music does help.\n\nBesides that, the only real con is that overall the game is rather short. I managed to beat the game within 2 hours of playing it, with a small portion of that just sitting around listening to the song.\n\nI'd highly recommend Tadpole Treble to anyone and everyone.","May 7","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ultimately, I was rather pleased with the result! The game is simple to understand. Up and down move you up and down the staff, left, right, and space are all for your tail slap. Not too hard to figure out.\n\nRegarding the game itself, it was a really fun time, and the atmosphere and music are what really make the game special. Each stage has some other animals and marine life that you interact with in some way, save for a couple, and even though everything except Baton really only shows up in one stage, everything is so expressive that you can get a full feeling of each of their characters. However, I should note that the game itself is fairly short, at 12 songs long. You could argue that's enough seeing the low price of the game, and the amount of love that very clearly went into the game. Besides, the Composition Mode allows for theoretical infinite playability.\n\nI enjoyed it.

The core idea is to move along the stages of sheet music and dodge the notes as they play, while also collecting pickups and slapping target objects to keep things engaging.\n\nThe graphics are fairly simple but well realized, the soundtrack is delightful, and I don't suspect the campaign will be very extensive but you also get the editor to keep you busy, all for under $10. My only gripes are lack of any graphics options, the screen scrolling gets pretty jerky sometimes, and the editor is a tad cumbersome (and rather limited if you want to share levels via QR codes).

The songs are catchy and fun, I find myself humming some of them already without realizing it sometimes, and the gameplay is very simple to make it easy to just pick up and play. For the casual player, it offers several stages each with very different styles of music, while the more experienced player will find themselves striving to get 100/100 bubbles in each stage or every challenge fly (which can be very difficult to get).\nAside from those two challenges, there's also the leaderboards to take a stab at, or you can challenge yourself to get the lowest score you possibly can on a stage to get an F rank (it's harder than you think).\n\nThe only problems I've really had with this game are purely cosmetic, and I have already mentioned them to the developers. There is currently no resolution settings, no windowed or virtual fullscreen mode, and for someone like me who doesn't have a widescreen monitor there are some parts of story elements that get cut off. None of these problems effect gameplay.\n\nNow go, little tadpole!","May 7","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I Kickstarted it! For $75! And you know what?\n\nI honestly still feel like it was worth it.\n\nThe music was wonderful, the game is gorgeous, and the gameplay changes pretty constantly. the game is significantly harder than it looks, tricking you into thinking that it's simply moving up and down. But there's so much to distract you, there's so much different about each level, that the game can, and does, throw you for a loop whenever it feels like it.\n\nThe characters, appearing however briefly, are filled with life. The dialogue isn't obtrusive most of the time, and everything is more or less intuitive.\n\nThe one and only thing I had trouble with was a single aspect of how Baton controls. When you hold the button down, she shifts smoothly between lines. When you press the button, she shifts deliberately from line to line, one at a time. This was a little disjointing, even though it was intuitive and made sense. So perhaps it's my failing, and it just felt unnatural to me.\n\nEven so, when everything is said and done, Tadpole Treble is a wonderful game, that, much like Portal, suffers only from being too short, which is also a blessing in and of itself.\n\nWith Composition mode to create your own levels and songs, as an interestingly powerful composition tool, the replayability based on variety alone is, in theory, as limitless as Mario Maker.\n\nWith Concerto Mode, there's something to go back to once the game ends.\n\nAnd with all the medals to get, the rewards from Etude for bubbles and challenge flies, the extras... This game is a wonderful addition to the library of anyone who likes music or likes games. Get it.

Every little detail of this game has obviously been carefully hand-crafted, and you'll find little tidbits of style to enjoy all throughout Baton's adventure. (If you're not aware, one of the primary developers of this game is Matthew Taranto, creator of the webcomic Brawl in the Family, and the style of that comic has very much carried over into this game.) I found myself smiling at little details like how Baton's facial expressions would change in response to events in the level around her, or little moments of synergy between the level design and the music.\n\nThe music deserves special attention, as it's one of the primary focuses of the game. I personally highly enjoyed the soundtrack throughout - I never had the impression that a song, or even part of a song, had been composed as filler, sound to fill a space where it seemed sound should go. Note that this is not the typical electronic-music heavy material you tend to get from music games on Steam. I would actually peg this as closest to high-quality children's music, not unlike the music of old Disney films or one of Sandra Boynton's albums.\n\nTadple Treble is short, but offers considerable replay value - and it's in that replay value that the gameplay is at its best. Your initial runthrough of the game's 12 stages will likely take you a little over an hour. Most of my deaths on my first playthrough came from an unusually punishing scenario involving shaking off a pack of piranhas - otherwise, simply completing the game usually just requires staying out of the way of obstacles. The interesting challenges come when the game requires you to start taking risks to meet more completionist-style goals.\n\nIt should be noted that Tadpole Treble is Bitfinity's first game, and it ocasionally shows in small rough patches - an occasional not-quite-intuitive menu, or a loading screen where it seems odd that the game should need one. Composition mode probably shows this most clearly, with understandable but less-than-ideal limitations to sharing levels, and controls that work well enough but fall a little bit short of a smooth level/music-creating experience. Overall, however, these issues are small, and shouldn't dissuade anyone interested in buying.\n\nLong story short, if you were a fan of Brawl in the Family, enjoy music games, or even just think the screenshots look appealing, Tadbole Treble comes highly recommended.","May 7","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's just that charming.\n\nI've been a big fan of Matthew Taranto's work for a few years now-- Brawl in the Family was one of my favourite webcomics,  and I've stumbled upon some of his musical work as a result of it. When he announced that he was working on a game of his own, let's just say, the hype was real.\n\nI'm glad to say that my faith was not misplaced. The game's art style and music are top-notch, as to be expected from Mr. Taranto and Co. Perhaps more importantly, however, the game is incredibly well designed.\n\nIt's one of those games that's easy enough to beat, if all you want to just to rush to the end (aside from the last couple of levels). But for those wanting to see everything Tadpole Treble has to offer, it's got just the right amount of challenge for old salts like me. It's like the lovechild of Audiosurf and the musical sections from Rayman Legends, and it nails the blend perfectly.\n\nHave I mentioned the grin I was wearing from beginning to end? The game has TONS of character, and even more heart. It's clear that this was a labour of love, and love is the operative word here. Charm oozes out from every pore, the artstyle is adorable (as to be expected from the hand that brought us Brawl in the Family, one of the best gaming comics of all time and easily THE best family friendly one)\n\nIf there's any complaint I have so far, it's that, occasionally, the screen comes across as a bit "busy." With notes to avoid, bubbles and health to grab, stage specific obstacles to navigate, and often some other sorts of things to keep an eye on, it can be a little difficult to keep track of it all. It's also a bit short-- clearing it will only take a bit over an hour, though completionists will have a field day and the level editor should help it last longer.\n\nTadpole Treble is a great game in its own right, but as a first foray by an independant studio, it's absolutely fantastic. BitFinity is going to be a studio to keep an eye on in future years, and I, for one, am looking forward to every step they take.","May 9","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What they did successful as well is that each of the levels is able to distinguish itself very clearly from all the other levels; truly, no two levels give the same experience. Thus, even though the length, may be lacking, the level design more than makes up for it.
