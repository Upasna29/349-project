I used the mouse to click and drag the blocks.  There are 9 worlds or sections or whatever you want to call them, and in each one they introduce a new concept that makes the game harder, such as blocks that are linked and move together or sticky blocks.\n\nFor completionists there are 2 more facets of the game other than just solving the puzzle.  1. Find all the white orbs that are hidden behind the blocks.  There is one orb in each level.  2. After you solve the puzzle try to get the blocks so that they cover the weird symbols to get illumination.  That's where it gets tough.  There are multiple ways to solve some of the levels.\n\nThe graphics are nice and colorful.\n\nThe music is whimsical but does not intrude on the game.  It's really nice background music for a puzzle game.  I like it a lot.\n\nI've got over 7 hours so far and have just started the 7th world.\n\nUPDATE:  Finished all the levels in all 9 worlds.  Now trying for all illumination--very difficult.  Some seem impossible.  But after getting all of the moon pearls (the white orbs hidden in every level) it revealed a secret 10th world!  This game is awesome.  One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.","July 3, 2015","true","34.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/377660/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Blockwick 2 is a logic game made by (yet unknown) indie studio Kieffer Bros.\n\nGameplay revolves around moving differently colored blocks that, in the end, should end up connected to all blocks of the same color. Although it's already offering a good challenge on the basic principle, there are more optional objectives for those who seek bigger challenge - there is a hidden pearl in every level, that can grant you a hint in any level, and there are special marked places on the level, on which you have you connect the colored blocks if you want to feel really proud of yourself. (You can connect them anyway on the level and feel proud too, you won't just "illuminate" the level.)\n\nDevelopers made a definitely great work on level design and overall game design, it feels really polished, and both relaxing and stressful, depending on your patience with harder levels and illumination. There are hundreds of levels, so don't be afraid this would be just a fun for few hours, especially if you'll want to illuminate all the levels - expect tens hours of gameplay!\n\nBlockwick 2 is definitely a sweet puzzle game with a low price tag. There's nothing that would keep me from recommending this game, so... buy it, it's worth it!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 16","true","6.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

The game starts you off with a very short tutorial even before you get to the main menu. Levels are unlocked sequentially, and you can either progress the easy way (move blocks around until you find the moon pearl), solve a puzzle by making all blocks of the same color touch (interesting when there's more than one color), or you can find and cover up 3 mysterious floor marks with your solution pattern (illumination). This can get tricky because for some reason those marks are in hard-to-reach places - I wonder why. ;-) There are also special blocks in later levels to keep things interesting, but I find that even with the not-so-special blocks, the levels are very well crafted and not boring.\n\nThe interface looks clean and never gets in the way: since you have these three levels of completing a puzzle, you tend to want to keep fiddling with it after you solve it to get the illumination, and the game lets you do that. It simply never pushes an intrusive "you're done now" window in your face, but it does let you know when you've solved it in an unmistakable way. There is no timer or move counter to bug you, you get the task done (or not) and move on. This probably plays well on smartphone screens, but it plays equally well with mouse control: the precision comes in handy when you need to funnel small objects through narrow spaces.\n\nThis game distills everything that's enjoyable about block-moving games in one colorful package. If you enjoy this kind of puzzle, there's no need to wait for a sale: Blockwick 2 is well worth its price.\n\nThe game contains 160 base levels and another 144 levels from a "basics" set that is slightly easier. A more difficult DLC could be ported over if enough people buy the PC version.","November 25, 2015","true","26.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Every aspect of this game is spot on: the basic premise, the visual execution, the amount of variation, the difficulty and learning curve, the music and the sound effects. They all contribute to feeling it's fun to play the game and it's satisfying to solve the puzzles.\n\nOne very noteworthy thing about Blockwick 2 is that the game doesn't need to end if you're stumped by one particular puzzle. In each puzzle, there is a pearl hidden underneath one of the blocks. Find that pearl and click on it and you can move to the next puzzle if you want. Sometimes it's a good idea to skip a puzzle for now and move on, just to be able to focus on a different problem for a while. At the end of each chapter (= a collection of 16 puzzles) you can check the overview and go back to the puzzle(s) you skipped to complete the chapter.\n\nWhen I got a bit frustrated by one or more puzzles in a chapter, I went and did something else for a while, but it never took long before I was drawn back to Blockwick 2 to give it another go. This is a rare thing for me. So yes, I certainly recommend Blockwick 2 to anyone who even remotely likes puzzle games.","May 25","true","21.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If your looking for a game to challenge you to your limits; look no further! Blockwick 2 is a perfect blend of challenge and fun and allows players to decide for themselves how difficult the game is. If you just want to have fun and pass the time a little bit you can just find the moon pearls and solve the puzzles. I enjoyed just listening to the music and admiring the artwork while I solved the puzzles. There is also another way to play the game; now I may just be really bad at puzzle games, but I found this way to be very difficult. If you are a huge fan of puzzle games or are a completionist and want a real challenge, try illuminating all of the puzzles. By not only placing the blocks next to each other, but also lighting up the symbols on the floor you essentially 100% the level. The game is very rewarding when you finally beat a level, and seeing the cleared, illuminated chapter screens is a very satisfying sight. The duality of this game; being a fun and casual puzzle game, and being a great challenge by going for 100% completion makes it perfect for anyone to enjoy! 9.5/10","June 26, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After completing each set of levels (16), the game introduces a new mechanic - first multiple colors, then blocks that can only move together, sticky blocks, etc. Finally, for a bigger challenge, you can seek a specific solution to each level where the position of the blocks also matters - you need to cover 3 floor symbols.\n\nThe visuals of the game are spartan but tastefully done, the music is good, and the controls are well executed - drag and drop works seamlessly on the PC, and I assume the touch controls work similarly well. Where the game really shines is the level design, though - the learning curve for each mechanic is properly cared for in the first 2-3 levels, and the remaining 13-14 challenges in the set (at least in the later sets) are generally quite good, occasionally bordering the fiendish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/377660/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","A brilliant execution of the block-pushing puzzle genre. STRONGLY recommend if you like that kind of puzzle.\n\nI never played the (mobile only?) original, so the title and developer were unfamiliar to me, and I don't know exactly which features were already present in that first entry.\n\nThe premise is fairly simple: join like-colored blocks together in contiguous groups (white blocks are the neutral exception).\n\nThis game does something that many puzzle games (at least on Steam) often overlook: offering several different puzzle gimmicks, easing you into them, and giving you lots of different use cases for each one without getting repetitive. Each specialty block concept has a set of 16 stages dedicated to exploring how that block can function. Once you've mastered a specialty block, that block type might make an appearance in a later zone, so you'll get to see how it interacts with (or obstructs) your current block type.\n\nSome stages feature huge blocks that are difficult to maneuver; others are claustrophic - loaded up with so many blocks that there's very little room to move; others are partitioned into multiple rooms that don't connect but must function together.\n\nPuzzles are unlocked in sequence, but the devs have mercifully included, in every level, a hidden pearl that will allow you to skip to the next puzzle if you get stuck (though even if you don't get stuck, you might want to seek them out anyway). A puzzle is considered "solved" once all the colors are grouped, but each puzzle also has a "true" solution which requires solving the puzzle while all 3 of the floor's glyph spaces are occupied by a colored block. This is a nice added challenge for the compulsive completionists.\n\nThe "Basics" level pack has also been added in, bringing an additional 144 puzzles. Basics puzzles are less complex and don't make use of all the specialty block types (which is fine!), but they do have glyphs and pearls.\n\nThe visual style is clean and bright. The art isn't cluttered, so you're able to keep your focus on the blocks. The backgrounds are just slightly tinted, and you can differentiate between the white blocks and the "island" walls. The music is pleasant and ambient but not boring. There's a surprising number of tracks in the soundtrack, too. I wouldn't have expected a block puzzle game to have 18 different tracks. Here's the Bandcamp page[kiefferbros.bandcamp.com] for the soundtrack, if you want to hear more than what's in the demo video.\n\nNote: I don't know if this game (as of this writing) will be accessible to colorblind players. I haven't seen any colorblindness options in the menu, and differentiating color is an absolutely integral part of every puzzle. Many of the colors appear to be roughly similar in value, so they might not be very distinguishable in greyscale.\n\nIllumination out of ten.","March 19","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
