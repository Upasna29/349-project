It doesn't use steamworks so it will require some port-forwarding;  However, the multiplayer does work.  Steam overlay doesn't work (tested on win10).  I'm glad it's being resurrected to Steam!\n\nThe Celtic Kings RTS franchise from Haemimont Games has a few mechanics that are true throughout all 3 titles: Celtic Kings: Rage of War, Celtic Kings: The Punic Wars (aka Nemesis of the Roman Empire) and Imperivm III: The Great Battles of Rome (which was only released in Italy and Spain, has no official english translation).\n\nThe mechanics are as follows:\n- When game starts, there are neutral buildings and villages to take.  Some are defended by neutral oppositions and some are not and can be yours when one of your units gets close enough.  When you press space it opens are really well designed level map that is generated just like the level.  In this view, you can direct the buildings you control to supply resources back to your base, if you so choose.  Some buildings train units to be higher level, some generate gold if you supply it with 2000 gold to start off it's "business", some convert gold into food.  Putting units into a building does the age of empires thing and sends arrows flying from the fortification.  The more men in building the more arrows get thrown.\n\n- There is no actual construction of buildings in this franchise.  It's military-based, the buildings all start fully constructed.  It's about conquering them to use them to overpower the enemy, eventually taking their camp for the win.  You hire a hero, attach units and try to progress the hero (and hopefully the units) to have field experience that levels them up to be stronger.  What doesn't kill them, makes them stronger after a fight.\n\n- Buildings cannot be fully destroyed.  They can be damaged and repaired, but mostly, buildings stay alive.  What gets destroyed/killed are the units inside the buildings you are trying to invade.  When you bring ur hero or unit to a building taken by enemy, you have to right-click on it to "intimidate" the building back into your color.  If there is enemy approaching and is a substantial force/army, the intimidation will fail and the enemy color numbers will regenerate to 100%.  If it's not as substantial as the intimidating force, the building will succum to changing colors/teams, although slower, if there is enemy military presence nearby.\n\nThose are the mechanics that stay true throughout all 3 titles of the Celtic Kings series.\nThat's the gist of it.\n\n\nI'm a long time player of Celtic Kings: Rage of War, Celtic Kings: The Punic Wars (also known as Nemesis of the Roman Empire aka, this one) and  Imperivm III GBR.  Both Celtic Kings games were more polished even pre-steam release then Imperivm III GBR;  Nemesis of the Roman Empire and Imperivm III GBR introduce extremely unique game-play elements (like unit and hero skills) that make this RTS franchise standout for me and are even more interesting in Imperivm III: GBR.  Nemesis is the transition game from the CK1 mechanics into the full GBR mechanics.  It's the in-between game and rightfully so, as it's the 2nd of the 3rd installment.\n\n\n\n\nTo those not familiar with the Celtic Kings series from Haemimont Games, know this:\n\n\nThe skill-based mechanics offer unique RTS precedent.  They are historically and relligiously modeled after the civilizations of the time.  It really feels empowering, commanding an army and setting up formations to best utilize the skills against the formation and unit types of incoming enemy army;  However know that Celtic Kings 1, Nemesis, and GBR all have very different mechanics between them.  CK1 is stat-based units, Nemesis is hybrid of skills and stats (doesn't have hero-based skill sets tho), and GBR has stats, skills that give very unique gameplay mechanics to -each- unit and even hero skill sets to level up that give bonuses to hero and/or army.\n\nVariation examples:\n\nExample (GBR): Roman Hastatus has 10 points of stamina-based, called "Deflection".  Each deflection costs the hastatus -1 stamina.  Britannian swordman has the skill "Tripple Damage".  The swordsman does x3 damage, costing -1 stamina per hit.  What will happen in this case is the Roman Hastatus soldier will tank -1 point of stamina (which will recharge slowly in fight, as long as the unit is fed) and recieve 0 damage until stamina runs out, while the Briton swordman will still be losing health trying to tire out the roman's shield since the hastatus is continuously attacking the Briton swordman.  An army of only hastatus versus an army of only briton swordsmen will absolutely annihilate the Brittannian swordmen army.  The Britannian hero and units would have to severely out-level the Roman hero and hastatus army to even stand a chance in that match up.\n\nExample (Nemesis): The units have special skills that boost stats.  The hastatus shield's "Defense stance" gives bonus stats when unit is holding ground while in combat, instead of absorbing all damage for a block and not losing any health at all.  The hastatus was later changed in GBR to have "Deflection" instead of "Defensive stance".  Swordsman to swordsman, the roman hastatus vs the gaul duel will play out in a more stat-focused fashion.  The roman hastatus with "defensive stance" will take damage each time, but just less of it.  It still will win against a gaul swordsman, but the gaul swordsman will, at least, do damage to the hastatus before he dies, ergo in Nemesis there is leeway in being able to be more worthy in battle against a non-compatible unit.  The gaul swordsman in GBR has learning ability.  Each successful hit, it gets +1 experience point, eventuall gaining a level (until hitting the max level researched in the Gaul arena).\n\nIn short, GBR formations require mixed armies and then insuring that units designed to counter other unts are matched in combat, better then your opponent is doing against you.\nIn Nemesis, this is much more lenient.  There are still units that counter other units better, but overall, you successfully deal damage to the units, allowing more leg room.  I'm not quite a fan of that, I prefer the GBR mechanics more, it's the more unique one, with no RTS on the market having such an interesting skill-based counter-unit mechanic emphasis.\n\nFormations are incredibly important.  Each formation gives a certain kind of bonus stat to each unit under hero's regiment.\n\n\nIt has a level editor that allows some C++ scripting, randomly generated terrains and levels (like age of empires) a polished AI and even to this day, excellent graphics and sprite animations.\n\nAn RTS classic, what I know the bulgarian game dev company, Haemimont, best for <3\n\nPleeease bring all the Celtic King games on Steam, not just this one!  I believe, since this one is up, the other ones will be coming to steam too, and I absolutely cannot wait <3.  I hope they fix up and polish Imperivm III GBR (the AI suffered some bugs) and put it up.  That one has more factions!\n\nI give major thumbs up for this title as it does what it sets out to do and I am hoping Imperivm III: Great Battles of Rome comes to steam!\n\nThe single-player campaign scenario is fantastic for all 3 titles.  Owning all 3 gives you access to the historical battles that occured in the periods described in each of the titles and they are -great-.\n\n\nRTS score I'll give 8/10.","January 28","true","1.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","3"

I cant believe the price, worth so much more i think. Challenging AI and unlike a lot of games like this, i have to remember to bring enough food with my armies before taking a long march, It's a nice touch, Dont seem real to me that i can march a large army to battle without worrying about feeding them. Very simple controls, i was able to get into the game right after the installation. works well on win10.","January 31","true","27.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It came via one of those book order catalogs the school gave out.\n\nThe main reason I bought it was my love of history.  On that front, the game has a decent amount of actual historical information in it.  However, it also has a lot of inaccuracies.\n\nThis is a great game to kill time.  I'm no expert on RTS games (this is the only one I've spent time playing), but it feels fairly balanced.  Oh, sure, there are ways to cheese the AI, but to do that you have to play for a good amount of time to build up the resources.  You can play the campaigns (two of which contain five missions; the other four or five are single mission) or play 'scenarios.'  The campaigns have interesting logistical restrictions (i.e., you have only a certain number of soldiers and no way to create new units until capturing an objective; sending gold to a certain shipyard, triggering your home city to send reinforcements a few minutes later; etc.) and force you to think carefully.  The scenarios do not have any plot to them, though there are about twenty custom maps that can make for interesting strategic situations.  Two of them (one of Western Europe/North Africa and one of Spain) are based on historical landmasses.  If I have to criticize the scenarios for anything, it would be this; the game depends heavily on resources.  As long as you have the population to conscript soldiers, the gold to pay for them, and the food to support them, there is no real limit on the size of your forces.  On the other hand, limitations on any of those three things severely hampers you.  This means that it can be a long and drawn-out process of conquering the finals enemy city or cities (there can be up to 8 at a time), even though the eventual outcome is not really in doubt.  This kills the suspense a bit.\n\nThe music is generally pretty good.  A few tracks are quite catchy.  It helps pass the time.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the map editor.  Suffice it to say that you can create very complex and interesting maps and missions with this thing if you put the time into it.  This is a game that works for people who just want to sit down and play (that's what the premade campaigns and maps are for) or for someone who basically wants to create his own game.\n\nI've greatly enjoyed this game.  If you're into historical RTS games, give this one a shot.","May 14","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
