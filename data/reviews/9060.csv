"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9060/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Hexen 2 came out in 1997 and was developed by Raven on Quake 1 engine. It's mostly a single-player FPS with RPG flavor. Well, the way that it was done back in the day, not about plots but about wandering around. And it can also be played in multiplayer, both competive and cooperative. Sadly, there is no expansion pack for it in Steam, Portal of Praevus, so it's just stand-alone Hexen 2.\n\nNow, seeing how id handled this Steam release? You guessed it, no CD music! But on positive side, Hexen 2 actually had MIDI music in it as alternative. While I would recommend you to track down soundtrack or game CD, MIDI is still a fine.\nIt also lacks intro movie, so you have to watch that yourself on YouTube.\nIt also includes only OpenGL version of a game, there is no Software option.\nOtherwise, it's also kinda fine. Not sure about widescreen. It handles some HUD graphics badly on higher resolution screens, like it doesn't stretch intermission graphic fully. And then, it also kept all the original game's bugs.\nBoy, was that buggy. My first game-breaking bug was in the Aztec-like world, where it kept failing to load location that I visited previously properly, just erroring out. Had to restart progress there with use of console commands. And then in Egypt-like world solving clock puzzle correctly didn't open the door in another location, making it unsolvable. Yay "noclip" command. And in greece world it would randomly crash because fish would randomly try to do invalid behavior or something. I murdered them later.\nSo yea, just get Hammer of Thyrion engine port. It should fix most bugs while it doesn't change the way that game looks. So purist like me will be happy.\nOh, and since it's Quake 1 engine game, don't forgot to input "+mlook" console command for mouseview!\n\nAs for Multiplayer, well, it probably should work. This game screams for Cooperative gameplay with friend, I think. Even though it's still more of single-player experience. But since it has no server browser and isn't Doom/Quake, then I take it that community is "dead". Didn't find server with people at least.\n\nStory follows Dragon Riders saga, as you have to take on the biggest and meaniest red menace of them all. And so this time around you will have ot travel through few time periods as well, visiting dark castles, Egypt, Greece, Aztec. Hm. Well, actually you have to travel over four continents of Eidilon world. And well, just go and read the manual, find it in Internet. It's worth it.\nNothing much going on in the game though. Didn't bother with special music for intermission/ending even!\n\nSo, now about Hexen 2 itself. Great sequel. I actually think that it did a much better job than Hexen itself. The only thing that original has over this is a bit more colorful setting. Otherwise, Hexen 2 mostly improved and fixed some of the problems I had with original. It's more interesting and less repetetive.\n\nOne of the small changes, as you would expect, are classes and leveling. There are four of them now, but they all still dare to have only 4 weapons, which is shame. But now as classes level up, they will open two additional abilities. Most of which are actually pretty passive and wouldn't change your playstyle.\n\n-Paladin is mostly focused on head-on meleeing, your first hub will be spent swaying only sword. His first ability is that he swims with same speed as running, while second ability is that he may regenerade instead of dieing. So, pretty passive stuff, but still fine character.\n-Crusader is another head-on class, but not as focused on melee. His abilities are all focused on keeping himself alive. One ability is that he will randomly get health bonus while fighting, second ability is that enemies sometimes will drop Holy Power, to power you up for some time.\n-Necromancer is slow character who is stronger at range. His first ability is that health may drop from enemies. Second ability is strange, you can sometimes get health by hitting enemies with melee attack. Seeing how he is slow and weak, it's pretty much not worth it even if you are lucky.\n-Assassin is a weak direct damage output yet fast character. It's also supposedly stealth character. Character with freaking stealth abilities in a game where AI doesn't do anything to make them worth it! First ability is that she can become invinisble in darkness if she stands there for some time. Useless. And she can backstab enemies with her melee. Which is hard to pull off, at rare times when enemy isn't facing you. And even if backstab does few times more damage than usual melee hit, her puny melee weapon is so weak, it doesn't do anything good in the end. Just forget about abilities and concentrate on damage-avoiding playstyle.\n\nThis time your character will level up as you kill more and more monsters too. Leveling up increases stats like health and mana, but you will not get to choose what to do with level-up. It's just a little thing to make killing every enemy worth it. And thankfully, it's not Hexen 1.\nWhen you compare Quake to Doom, you will notice that they focused on having less enemies in each encounter. Whether it is for the better ot not is not something easy to decide. And Hexen 2, running on Quake engine, has much less enemies per encounter than Hexen, running on Doom engine. And boy, this one is actually much more fun in this case. Combat in Hexen 1 felt too repetetive, having to kill dozen dumb monsters with 4 weapons for whole game. Hexen 2 improved it by focusing on less yet smarter or just more interesting enemies. Hexen 1 would swarm you with annoying shielding centaurs, who just dumbly walk twoard you and shield for few seconds upon any damage. Hexen 2 has shielding were-jaguars, who actively jump, run and roll around, only sometimes putting on shields, with the game throwing only around 2-3 of these dangerous tough enemies at you in same time.\n\nNot only that, but Quake engine allowed puzzles to get much more varied. Hexen 1 was about finding switches to find more switches. Hexen 2 will make you run and wander around, looking carefully at walls to see breakable ones, making you bring sand to the forge to turn it into glass or solving a time puzzle in Egypt. You can agrue that it's almost same by complexity, but it's much more interesting this way. Especially the first hub and Egypt ones, they are very mysterious. it also helps a lot that Hexen 2 is more detailed, having houses filled with furnite, for example, thus making exploration more interesting.\nSometimes it lacks enough clues though, making you wander around for awhile. Or finding out that some wall was actually passable like a ghost wall. That happens. That, and it's still much much more puzzling than what most FPS players ever expect. "Puzzling" as in "Where am I supposed to go next?".\n\nMusic is also pretty good. It's mostly remixed of Heretic and Hexen music made to sound more ambient. Has some good tracks of it's own.\n\nAnd well, while I mostly like this game a lot, it has few annoying things. One of them is physics. Player control. For some reason it feels like they wanted to appeal to Quake speeders. Diagonal running is SO much faster than just running forward, it's very noticeable. And well, I don't usually like such weird controls. But well, it's for some reason is quite addictive, as in few hours I ended up strafejumping up the slopes at high speed as a way to move between location.\nWell, okay, that wasn't so bad, what is actually bad are pools of water where walls aren't lowe enough. In these cases you have to gain actual speed when you reach the surface, you have to shoot yourself out instead of just climbing out, pretty much. Too challenging. Don't forget to bind "swim up" in controls.\nAlso, ocassional unavoidable damage bring game down.\n\nHexen 2 improves a lot on Hexen ideas, not being as repetitive and more fun. While you may be frustrated while playing it, once you are done, you will remember this adventure fondly.","July 15, 2015","true","13.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","2"

Not as nostalgic as the first but gold none the less.\n\nIn the early days of Quake and Doom the games were generally a one trick pony.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/9060/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","On the plus side, the weapons are far less overpowered this time around, and the modified Quake engine allows for far more complex level design, on top of a 3D look that hasn't aged perfectly, but still is more pleasing to the eye than enemies that look like they're made from cardboard. They also played it up as much more of an RPG this time around, giving each class a set of visible stats that automatically level up when you've gained enough experience points from killing enemies, giving you an incentive to fight rather than just run past everything. The puzzles are also largely improved, most having solutions that don't require you to activate some unknown wall or something. No, this game will tell you, and you'll probably be able to figure it out without a guide.\nOn the negative side, the Quake engine. While it's good to look at and everything, you'll have to do a bit of tweaking to get the resolution accurate, set mouse controls, and all that stuff, and it all has to be done manually. It's not a huge complaint, but it's just a quick pain that you have to go through whenever you install the game.\nEven if you weren't a fan of the previous games, I'd suggest giving this one a go.","June 17, 2014","true","21.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Continuing where the original Hexen left-off, this game adds some twist in the medival storyline, expands the Hexen universe, and provides us gamers with an easily digestable narrative. Gameplay-wise Hexen II puts an emphasis on ranged combat, but melee combat also feels very satisfying (seeming as you can decapitate and quarter your foes once they're down). The leveling system isn't robust, but because the game is more action-oriented the RPG elements are more of an addition rather than a main attraction. The wide variety of enemies and open world compliments the different classes to play as, and substantially increases the replayablility. Overall if you're on the fence about getting this classical masterpiece or if you seem vaguely interested in the vintage fps genre, GET IT!!

After playing some old school shooters like Doom, Quake, Heretic and Hexen 1 itself, I cant recommend this game.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe game itself looks and plays great. It runs in an altered Quake 1 engine and is fully 3d, unlike Hexen 1, which, just like Doom, uses 2d sprites for enemies and items. I have no ploblems running this game on my machine (win. 8). The environments and enemies bring a gothic and dark feeling, with great soundtrack that emphasises the overall grim atmosphere that the game has. Just like Hexen 1 you chose a few character classes that have different weapons and use the two types of mana in different ways. Its kind of an attempt to include RPG elements in a shooter.\n\nPuzzles and Problems\n\nEventhough it looks and plays great, the reason why I dont recommend this game is that its virtually impossible to advance the game without some kind of guide or walkthrough. The shooting and killing is sporadic, and you will spend most of the time trying to solve hundreds of impossible puzzles, that require you to go to a certain location, pick up a hidden item, then teleport to another location, pull that lever... Its not a shooter like Quake, the devs pick up the simple puzzles from Hexen 1 and created something really annoying, that requires you to be constantly looking for answers on the internet as you just cant figure out by yourself using exploration. If you want a good fast paced shooter like Duke Nukem, Quake and Heretic, this game is not for you.\n\nGet Hexen 1, Heretic or Quake instead.","May 14","false","1.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

See if you can turn that off, no filtering, all sharp pixelly textures, all the time. Also see if you can get co-op running.

However all of the puzzles are searching for hidden doors to find misc items to unlock new areas... to find more hidden doors.\n\nAbout half way through the game I got tired of looking for hidden doors and swinging my sword up close & getting beat up.\n\nAs a technical side note: I had to use something called a source port to just play the game.

The gameplay is a bit strange, but nonetheless its good. Unlike the previous games, this one you can set the controls in the game rather than from other programs. The mouse look is a bit weird, but i just imagine it like the first quake where i have to hold a certain button to activate mouse look. At least the game has mouse look unlike the previous (unless if played the port version of the game in the previous and most likely in this game as well so you dont have to hold the button).\n\nThe enemies are indeed tough, if you are ready to fight bunch of enemies then go for it. There are enemies that would drop your hp down alot or end up killing you no matter how high your hp is (depends on difficulty, played the highest). You will start with low hp and manas. You can actually level up by killing enemies which eventually shows you leveled up, increasing your hp and mana at max after gaining a level up (pretty much like rpg games). The weapons are quite interesting, they do have classes.\n\nIf you are expecting multiplayer, then you came in the wrong place. Unless you know how to do local multiplayer, then its possible.

I decided I'd give this game another shot and ultimately, I still think it's a pretty good game in general. It's fun to explore and the fact each classes have different weapons gives the game some replay value. Most of the puzzles in the game are reasonable although they get a little harder later in the game. The game has some pretty good music but as far as I know, it doesn't have files for CD music so it means you might be stuck with Midi. The first attempt to clear the game might take a pretty good amount of time as well so for a first person adventure game, it's length is pretty reasonable.\n\nHowever, this is a game I'd only recommend to people who aren't impatient. There's a fair share of exploration required to do and at times and some of the puzzles can be rather frustrating or some hints can be somewhat unclear. At some point, areas might open to continue progression but it's not always perfectly clear where you're supposed to go next. The last few worlds are particularly bad in that regard but I wouldn't say it ever gets unfair. On the other hand, I'd say Hexen did a better job in general to figure out what has to be done or at least, the exploration doesn't get as tedious.\n\nStill, anyone who's willing to explore the game and have the patience to understand the puzzles will most likely have a fun experience. Some of the areas are actually memorable with how they've been designed and I'd say the maps gets even more fun to visit as the game progresses.\n","March 10, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We're talking first-person mayhem featuring fantasy-style weaponry, an inventory with loads of deployable power-ups, and lots of head-scratching as you try to figure out where to go next. Lengthy campaign is chock-full of clever enemies and differing themes (medieval, amazonian, egyptian, greek, etc) spread out over several "world" hubs as you take on the horsemen of the apocalypse. There are four diverse classes with unique weapons and abilities; I went with the obvious choice, Assassin (because why wouldn't you want to play as an assassin?) and was able to complete the game on Hard without cheats save for no-clip when I couldn't get out of wells. As with lots of these older games, the final boss in unbeatable. Still, a classic FPS from the golden age of FPS. Gamers who grew up after the 90's need not apply.","October 3, 2015","true","19.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I must say it was a hit back then and I was rooted to my 15-inch monitor salivating profusely to the awesomness this game offered. Lush, colorful graphics, great gameplay, cool puzzles and unique weaponry made this game my favourite entertainment of 1998. Then by some terrible accident  I stomped on my CD with copy of this game and didn't finished it.\n\nSo 14 years later I spottted this game on steam an thought I would give it another try,\n\nIt didn't age well. If You think about all possible nightmares of retro gaming this one has it all. Hard as hell and unforgiving in a wrong way. I can still play first Quake/Doom/DN3D without feeling cheated but this game seems to be very imbalanced. It is known for it's notorious puzzles which are very frustrating and irritating. Opponents feels sometimes awfully overpowered, especially bosses. Colors and overall graphic design seems bleak and desolate which might be intentional back then but today it just feels empty and unappealing. Apart from that overall perfomance seems to be quite choppy on lower resolutions (the way it meant ot be played by the way). If You boost the resolution up with unofficial mods it works fine but levels looks very simple and raw because texture show their age. You may think that I might be spoiled with recent AAA titles but for me it's just not that fun to play anymore.\n\nI still kinda like it for nostalgia reasons but I just can't recommend it anymore.","October 24, 2014","false","10.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","1"

Not worth your time or money.\n\nGet Quake instead.  It's a different genere of game but it's still manages to be better in every way.\n\nThe combat in Hexen II is clunky and made difficult by the inability to freely use the mouse without holding a button.\nBugs prevented me from progressing (such as doors refusing to open as scripted).  Poor level design also caused unsolvable issues - such as jumping into a shallow pool that had a ledge higher than you could jump, permanently trapping you.\n\nAt points I had to bring up the console and use 'noclip' just to get past moments that bugged.  This wasn't due to me missing  part of the puzzle either, as I referenced everything online.\n\nLiterally everything, the puzzles are so obscure and without any logical context that I had to use a walkthrough for most of my playthrough.\n\nPace is further interrupted with difficult to see switches and hidden areas that are obtusely hidden, requiring attrition and general time wasting tactics to find.\n\nThere is just no flow to anything, the combat is difficult due to poor controls, the puzzles non-sensical and the level design made to waste your time.\n\nThis game isn't worth anyone's time or money.  It may be very cheap, but why would you pay anything to be frustrated?\n\nI've written a more detailed review of this game and the series in General here:\n\nhttp://theboilingpot.net/hexen-ii/","November 30, 2015","false","13.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I am not a fan of satanic imagery in games and have thrown away games for less than the amount of said imagery that this game throws in my face.\n\nThat said, it's got a fairly solid set-up mechanics wise, and it will not hold your hand in finding the 'secret' areas that allow you to progress through the game... much less actual secret areas. It's also neat that your avatar in the game actually levels up over time, and one of the things I really like about the game. Did I mention the paladin is just awesome?\n\nObviously I like it enough to say good things about part of it, but I've long since realized that steeping yourself in games with satanic imagery is an issue, if not for yourself, then for those watching you play.
