The downward spiral had finally reached the bottom, and you'd be forgiven for wondering if we'd ever see Lara Croft return to relevancy again. But just like that, Legend was released and all was forgiven, with a tighter knit, better polished, and more cinematic Tomb Raider than we had seen in years. The follow up, Anniversary, reworked the original TR with a modern engine and a handful of additions and fixes to polish it off into something that, while not quite the hit Legend was, set the stage for the final game in the trilogy, Underworld, which fully showcases all the CD was aiming for by combining the best parts of their past two games into a fitting end to their first run with Lara, and a solid game in its own right.\n\nUnderworld is a direct sequel to Legend, which means if you haven't played the latter (and preferably Anniversary as well), you're going to quickly become lost in a sea of supernatural monsters, returning characters, and a plot that bites off quite a bit more than it can chew. All that said, it finally answers most if not all of the questions proposed by the last two games, finally giving Lara some closure for all that's happened up to this point, as well as for the trilogy, allowing CD free control to go wherever they like with a sequel. It's not going to blow your mind or keep you thinking about it after the credits role, but the narratives blockbuster mentality is more than enough to entertain and carry the game through to the end (provided you don't stop to think about why anything is happening alone the way).\n\nWhile Legends focused more on style and set pieces, and Anniversary on classic tomb raiding and puzzle solving, Underworld finally manages to meld these two halves almost perfectly, creating what I would consider the truest expression of Tomb Raider Crystal Dynamics has made. The mechanics themselves have been expanded significantly from past games, with platforming in particular getting a much needed upgrade thanks to Lara's larger move set, which feels far more natural and free form than what we've seen in the past as well as allows for a greater amount of variety in the level designs. The levels themselves have also gotten a boost, now on an outrageous scale that towers above you as you attempt to work your way through them, populated by more elaborate puzzles and a ridiculous number of hidden collectibles to find. Everything that Tomb Raider is known for has been improved and taken on a new scope, but in a similar vein, all the has been wrong with the series for years has been entirely neglected.\n\nCombat, though moderately improved, is still as mindless and unsatisfying as ever. The camera continues to be your worst nightmare, seemingly out to make navigating through levels a living hell and often sending you jumping off in entirely the wrong direction. Numerous frustrating glitches make themselves known throughout, from harmless bugs to aggravating mishaps that make progression incredibly difficult. Most disappointing though is how the level designs can often get ahead of themselves, leaving you scratching your head at the enormous size of them without the slightest idea where to begin. The hint system certainly helps in this regard, but it's an imperfect solution, and ideally one you shouldn't ever need to rely on.\n\nIf you have ever played a Tomb Raider game before though, none of this should surprise you. As I said before, Crystal Dynamics has built up what the series does best, while quietly ignoring its issues perhaps hoping they'll be overshadowed or ignored. Personally I'm more than capable of putting up with these annoyances in exchange for the rest of the experience, but I'm definitely beginning to ask myself why I'm OK doing this, or if I should have to (the answer for which is obvious). If you didn't enjoy Legend or Anniversary you will find nothing more to draw you into Underworld, but for those who have yet to tire of Lara's escapades Underworld provides a fitting final chapter in this particular story of her life, if also a signal that it's probably time to move onto something new.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 2, 2014","true","12.7"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","59","63","0","3"

Beautiful levels, fun gameplay, exploration, and amazing visuals make this game a beloved addition to the series and truly worthy of the name Tomb Raider.\n\nGameplay+ Puzzles\n+ Fun traversal/climbing\n+ Beautiful variety of levels and locations\n+ Easy combat\n+ Thor's hammer!\n- Puzzles can be irritating when you have to pick up items\n- Repetitive and sometimes frustrating combat\n\nUnderworld is like all the other Tomb Raider games in terms of gameplay. The puzzles are fun and challenging, the climbing and traversal is great, and the variety of levels, locations, and environments are amazingly well done. Combat is still the same simple lock on with right click and hold left click to shoot Thor's hammer was fun to use though, and while this is easy it can get quite boring and repetitive Plus those ****ing spiders are annoying as hell!. If you liked the gameplay in previous Tomb Raider games you will enjoy this one just as much. The main issue however, lies with the puzzles. Like other games you have to pick up a weight and set it down on a switch, this is nothing new. However a lot of times the game glitches and will either throw Lara far back, or more often than not, Lara and the block fly around the room making it just irritating to set them down on a switch.\n\n\nControls/Camera+ Easy controls\n+ Easy combat\n- Frustrating camera placements\n- Unresponsive controls at times\n\nAgain, the controls and camera are exactly like Legend and Anniversary. They are easy to learn and do what you need to do, but sometimes Lara simply doesn't do what you want her to do and while it's frustrating it isn't gamebreaking. The main problem with games like these (Tomb Raider, Uncharted, basically any game with traversal and climbing) is the camera placement. It just isn't always where you need it to be to see where you're going and again, it can be quite irritating that you miss jumps and have to restart because the camera.\n\nAudio/Visual+ Gorgeous levels\n+ Variety of locations\n+ Water well done\n- Graphical glitches\n\nThe levels and locations in Underworld are well-done in quality and quantity. You travel all around the world, see different places and architecture, and the parts where you are underwater are just beautiful to be in and explore. There is the occasional graphic glitch but nothing gamebreaking, she will get stuck in the ground a few times but if you simply stop moving it normally fixes itself.\n\nStory/Dialogue+ Engaging story\n+ Interesting history and mythology\n+ Nice length\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story in Underworld which revolved around Norse mythology, mainly Thor. It was interesting, informative, engaging, lengthy and overall was enjoyable to play throughout the whole game.\n\nOverall/Quick Review\nUnderworld is an amazing addition to the Tomb Raider series and is worth your time. It has an engaging story line with history and mythology of excellent length. A variety of challenging puzzles, climbing, and traversal in an array of beautiful locations, none looking quite like the other. The combat, in my opinion, gets boring and repetitive as it is simply hold right click to lock on and left click to shoot while dodging and flipping. The main issue I had with this game was some of the puzzles took longer than they should have because graphical glitches cause weight blocks to shoot off the switch and to the other side of the room. However the underwater levels are some of the best times in this game and are simply breathtaking.\n\n\nWonderful addition to the Tomb Raider series.\nBuy it. 9/10","May 11, 2015","true","23.2"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","42","43","3","0"

After some consideration and despite its flaws, I still recommend this game for fans of the franchise.\n\nEven though the puzzles and level design is no where near as good as in Anniversary (allthough Core is responsible for that one) it is still a solid game.\n\nMy main gripe with this is the camera. It constantly adjust itself as if it was a ballon being dragged behind a running kid. So it will always pull toward the center trying to get Lara in the center of the screen. This will make her block your view. Typically you would want your character in the bottom half of the screen to get a full view of the battlefield. In this game you have to constantly pull on your mouse to do so. Annoying.\n\nThe camera is also trying to be "intelligent" and rob you of the control at times which can be annoying. Personally I'm not too bothered with that, but it is a bit worse here than in previous games.\n\nOther than that, Tomb Raider: Underworld is an enjoyable game.","August 17, 2013","true","45.4"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

The graphics can still compete with many comparable games today, and will demand higher system specs than you would estimate.\n\nI will say this though: If you are familiar with the "old school" Tomb Raider games, the game's puzzles will be smooth sailing for you. The game is fairly easy and you always have the feeling of being Superior to your enemies, however the landscapes, architecture, and atmospherical beauty in every single location makes this game a must-have for not only Tomb Raider fans, but also graphic afficianados, RPG fans, and intricate story lovers.\n\nI rate this game with 4 of 5 possible stars, but only because of its easy predictabillity when familiar with the franchise","March 11, 2014","true","11.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

Lara is on the quest to uncover the truth about what happened to her mother Amelia Croft, and in order for that she must find a way to reach Avalon, a place only Gods are suppose to enter. In order to gain entrance there, Lara must track down the artifacts that once belonged to the norse God Thor, and these artifacts are scattered throughout the world, and hide secrets of their own. Her quest will come at a great loss, in order to find the truth about her mother, she could unleash a terrible evil upon the world. That is the story in a nutshell, and without spoiling anything.\n\nThe gameplay is good, but not perfect. Camera angles get in the way sometimes, and the controls are a little too sensitive. The weapon fighting could have had a little more polishing, but it is easy enough to handle on most occasions, however, none of these minor flaws get in the way of enjoying this game.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, but I did find them a little more simple than in previous Tomb Raider games. The action and exploration are very well done, and the locations of the levels are sometimes breathtaking, from Coastal Thailand, to Southern Mexico to the Artic, this game delivers in spades on the visual department. It's a game with a  few years, but the visuals still manage to impress. The textures are all high quality, and so is the animation and particle system, everything you walk on or touch releases debry and smoke. Crystal Dynamics went all in when it comes to detail.\n\nMusic is absolutely phenomenal. Orchestrated compositions fill the action nicely, and some tunes are truly remarkable. The sound effects are also at a high level, and another point of mention is the voice acting, which is believable and not over acted as sometimes happens. Highly recommended game.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Great Story, Music, Graphics and Sound Effects\n-Varied locations, makes exploration a joy\n-Animation is particularly life-like and impressive\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Camera gets in the way sometimes\n-Weapon fighting could have used some more polishing\n-Sensitive controls (mouse too sensitive) easily adjustable through the options screen (to a more personal preference), or by adjusting the DPI on your mouse, if you have one.\n\n8.5/10","December 10, 2013","true","20.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

I personally managed to make it through needing only to look at a walkthrough once, and it beame clear that i knew what i had to do but i didn't know how to make lara do it. literally one point in the entire game, a ledge-to-wall chimney jump that gave no indication of lara recognizing it and seemed to devote itself to making me jump in the wrong direction whenever attempted until i found the sweet-spot in the walkthrough.\nnow, about the in-game hints,\ngenerally helpful, though towards the end the standard "what do i do" observation becomes a lot more clear than the hints, not because it is easier to understand, but because it essentially restates the hints with more information. this point starts around the latter half of the mexico level.\n\nsomewhat predictable story, though with the AAA games on the market nowadays people's intuition into story narratives has really been narrowed down to a very basic level, so if you don't play story-driven games that often or play mostly AAA games, the story will blow your mind, otherwise you will be able to predict a general amount of what will happen, which isn't always a bad thing. still worth playing, even if you do accidentally spoil it for yourself.\n\nPuzzles will grant you hours of gameplay, while combat will grant you mere minutes. DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR THE COMBAT. the combat system is based on an extremely strong aim-assist that puts the standard crosshaire somewhre in front of Lara's chestal-region, without bothering to make the camera go to a better angle or making Lara transluscent. the aim-assist is clearly designed for consoles, and will feel a bit too snappy to different targets, which can be a real turn off if you want to focus on a a specific enemy, and the end of the game essentially turns into easy-mode. you'll know what i mean. It becomes so easy, that the developers chose instead of balancing the onsters, to just throw hundreds of the biggest enemies straight into the slaughter that is one very angry Lara Croft. Again, the combat will last you minutes of actual gameplay, and be a cause of about .0001% of your deaths.\n\nall in all, this is my favourite Tomb Raider game, on a scale including several different things i find important when playing a game. Disclaimer, i've only ever played Underworld, AoD, Legends, and 2013. ( order to play is AoD -> Legends -> Underworld, you don't need to finish the camplaigns, just the first few levels in legends and the opening cutscenes in AoD for the background story and references found in Underworld)\ncotrol responsiveness: 8.5/10\ncamera-not-get-in-the-way-ness: 9.5/10 (PC port issue only tho)\nStory: 8/10, a bit cheesy but hey, Lara is like Batgirl and Catwoman mixed together with Batman's wealth and gadgets\npuzzle CHALLENGE: 9/10, very balanced, though some parts will stump you on sheer mechanical issues, as they did me\npuzzle DIFFICULTY: 5/10, most of the puzzles are actually straightforward, but not very intuitive once you figure them out\nFun: exhillerating when you complete a difficult puzzle, and when you complete several in a row without thinking too much you feel empowered, but it slowly luls you into a boredom, but that will be interupted by a cutscene, or a new mechanic, or an enemy, and bam, all of a sudden you are thrust out of the puzzle mindset and have to actually think again, making you frustrated, but eventually repeating the cycle.\nDrama: catfights. literally that's about it.\nAction: QTEs are unweildy and counter-intuitive in most cases, thank goodness they were left out for the most part. Combat is bleh, basicaly you just choose how easy it is to die when selecting difficulty and then just shoot the enemies before they hit you for the same effect on any difficulty level\nspoopiness: not much, some levels give you that fear of the unknown, or helplessness, but nothing realy spoopy about it\nEngaging: very engaging, even if it makes you ragequit, you will pick it, or another Tomb Raider title up within a month of setting this one down\nCompatability: Playing on a 1.7GHz 4-core processor with 8GB RAM and a 768MB APU, this game ran surprisingly well on maximum graphics, though on a port there isn't much to change, but be careful when tabbing out, as this will cause lag spikes that will drop you from 60 FPS to about 5 FPS for anywhere between 30 seconds and 7 minutes. Don't panic if the loading screen freezes up, it only crashed on me once during loading, and upon restarting never game me the issue again. Later in the game, Attempting to manual save would sometimes crash the game, thankfully after the save. this was never a real problem for me as it usually occured when i was planning to *gasp* get off my computer /(*O*)\ and would save me the trouble of having to quit out myself. interestingly enough, a save game 5 minutes prior with n major progression or tabbing out would save normally, without crashing.\nV-Sync Recommended for more powerful computers. Works great on Win 8.1, unlike it's predescessors.\n\ngreat game, great graphics, great physics, great puzzles, most interesting story in the series, no weird fixation on torturing, beating, and killing Lara in frankly quite sociopathing ways *cough looking at you 2013* and actually did a lot of it's homework on Norse mythology (before adding artistic licsense of course)\n\ni would recommend this game before any other in the Tomb Raider series if you wanted to play from start to finish, as it is a great examply of the free-run and puzzle origins of the series, instead of being some "Appeal to everyone" flashy new thing that really holds no actual homage to the core of the series whlst attemting to create it's own origin story based on combat.","March 27, 2015","true","19.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

If you go slow and are deliberate in your joystick movements you'll learn the mapping pretty well.\n\nThe combat system does get wonky when there are more then two enemies on the screen. I recommend equipping the right secondary gun for certain enemy types to help stun them to buy more time for dogging around. Shotgun up close to knock back quick movers or leapers helps.\n\nThe puzzles do not hold your hand in any way.

As a long time fan of the franchise, this is a solid title. For those who never played the series before, here are some things you need to know. First, this isn't the Tomb Raider from the reboot. The gameplay is a bit different, a little less cinematic in it's story telling but the game is still an eye candy that will make you stop to look at the scenery despite it being a little graphicaly outdated. It is overall a good game and I recommend it.\n\nThat said, here are some of the issues that you may want to know. Because of its age, it is highly unlikely that there will be any new patches to fix it. First, the framerate. The framerate throughout the game is not stable. You will often find yourself with slowdowns under the 20fps mark. If this occurs to you, alt+tab out for a second and returning will usually fix the issue until it happens again. Secondly, I encountered a few crashes during my gameplay. Due to varying fps, I'm assuming it might be due to a few memory leaks. It's a bit annoying but only occured about 3 times during my playthrough. Then there are a few minor issues that I encountered along the way such as invisible collision (may annoy you if you are also the type to explore everywhere), a few camera collision and odd angles, a few streaming issues (unloaded textures until you are right against the object, possible issue if you are a speedrunner).\n\nThe issues stated above may break the immersion and lessen the appreciation for the game but the overall experience is still enjoyable.

The balance between platforming and other types of gameplay is better than in TR-Anniversary (which was all platforming) but maybe not quite as engaging for the masses (and me) as the 2013 reboot (which had more action). The platforming difficulty is generally good for most of us, but on the easy side for hardcore gamers. I struggled with some parts, but always got through after a while. Some environments look really nice (Thailand), but others have rather bare and bland level design. The combat is fairly bad, as expected with this series. The checkpoint save system is also annoying, but not too bad.\n\nThough some of the veterans will scoff, I find the optional “field assistance” hints an improvement over the previous games that offered no help at all - now I am less likely to need to look up solutions online when I get stuck. There is still big room for improvement in this area though. At least there are difficulty settings for specific things like enemy health and fall damage.\n\nLara's controls are a bit mixed. In some ways they are fine, but they also feel a bit nervous and she moves less natural (less inertia and animation flow) than in TR-Anniversary. As usual, sometimes the controls don't do what you want, causing many accidental deaths. Also, the camera behaviour can be disorienting, and the FOV is unpleasantly low. At least there is no mouse acceleration. The HUD is bad - you have to open your PDA to change weapon and see how much ammo you have. None of these flaws are game breaking though.\n\nTip: To improve the graphics beyond the max ingame settings, i suggest forcing AF to x4 (ingame AF setting does not work) and AA transparency  to 4x supersampling in nvidia control panel.\n\nI would say this is a game to get when on sale, and only if you are ok with a lot of puzzle platforming.","October 16, 2015","true","20.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Most importantly to turn V-Sync ON, with the port from console to PC you need to nerf the FPS for the ingame physics engine to behave the way it was designed to. A lot of people don't give this game a chance because they ran a buggy game without really optimizing the settings. If you run this game above 60 FPS then it will perform very poorly with twitchy gameplay.\n\nI love this game and this is what Tomb Raider should really be about. Not killing deer to craft handbags or making a one-time campfire, or lamenting over tear-jerking drama. TR:U is full of puzzles but like it's predeccesor (Legend) it was rather short; I reached final boss in approx. 8 hours. There are still lots of places to explore and find secrets for replay value. I liked the new engine especially with the now-added gimmick to rock climb up a wall. Human combat was a bore but thankfully there are only two levels with it. If you like the original Tomb Raider games then you'll love TR:Legend, TR:Anniversary, and TR:Underworld (in that order).\n\nIt's a shame that Crystal Dynamics felt the need to reboot Lara into a "hyper-realistic" girl-next-door. We were really approaching something great with TR:U. Instead of rebooting into a "Last of Us" copy, they should have just taken the AC:Black Flag route with an open-world tomb-raiding experience and a pulled-back camera. R.I.P this future series.","February 7","true","30.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

There is also no shortage of transformers buildings for your viewing pleasure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dimeinurear/recommended/8140/","Dimeinurear","Dime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dimeinurear/","267 products in account","TL;DR it's a good game with some fun platforming and adventure, but with annoying, frustrating combat.  Best played with a controller.\n\nThe game's platforming is overall pretty fun, but it suffers from a LOT of problems.  Namely in the chamber where you'll get Thor's Belt.  Okay, so you get an item called Thor's Gauntlet.  It lets you move certain blocks for puzzle purposes.  In this particular instance, you move a pillar so you can jump onto it later.  The problem is that it's a damn lie.  Even if you try and jump on it (which would save you a lot of time and frustration) Lara decides that she doesn't want to grab the ledge, so you plummet to your death.  In fact, the platforming overall is pretty iffy.  More than once I’ve had to do the same exact jump twice, because Lara decided not to grab the ledge that time.\n\nIf you're hanging from a ledge, you can only rotate the camera 90 degrees to either side of her, meaning you can't look directly behind her to see where you're going to be jumping.  She plays a special hanging animation when the jump is safe, but it’s really dumb that you can’t just LOOK.\n\nThe worst enemy you will fight in this game is the camera.  It is WAY too close to Lara, and it is WAY too jumpy.  Fighting any melee enemy, once they close the distance, the camera just goes bonkers.  I’ve actually fought enemies before where the camera doesn’t even look at them, it decides that the ceiling is a better place to be looking.\n\nElaborating on the combat, a lot of the enemies are bullet sponges.  There are some in particular who are especially annoying, though.  Giant spiders are the worst ones I found.  They have a lot of health (even with enemy HP set to low) and they have a leap attack that has hardly any telegraphy.  They kind of shake their abdomen for half a second, then they leap at you.  Even if you see this in time, and decide to dodge, there are no invincibility frames.  The spiders leap way too quickly, so unless you dodge BEFORE they telegraph their attacks, you’re not going to get out of the way fast enough.\n\nThis game is very, VERY buggy, too.  Maybe it’s because it’s from 2008, and it can’t deal with Windows 7, and newer graphics cards.  But in any case, it can lead to your death more than once.  I’ve had times where I get stuck entirely and I have to reload a save.\n\nThe game does not play nicely with a mouse and keyboard, so I recommend playing it with a controller.  It’s still not perfect, however.\n","November 8, 2014","true","7.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

This is without question worth 9$, even despite one particular puzzle string that can bug (look it up) but not at all often and didn't with me; I was just confused and thought it did, surprised when I read it actually could.  The puzzles are a lot less ridiculous than the old-school TR's in that there's a lot less BS like hunting for unending hours for a switch that's camouflaged exactly the color of a wall whereupon finding it you either feel the absolute thrill of success or feel unaccomplished like you just spend the past several hours on a worthless easter egg hunt getting older and deader.

I always enjoy them to at least some extent, but often gave up on finishing them, rather than look up walkthroughs and strain my eyes and/or nerves for hours and hours.\nThis game, however, I truly enjoyed.  I watched part of one video walkthrough, because of confusion, but it was my mistake as I simply wasn't fully aware of the inventory system (since I had the item the entire time, but am quite used to notifications these days.)  I played on the easiest difficulty, but that almost exclusively affects combat.  The new functions available made the fighting even easier at times, but also tempting to fool around with, resulting in Lara's untimely demise more than a few times.  To be honest, I tend to dislike the combat systems of tomb raider games most of the time, but looking back I can clearly state that if they had always had some of these abilities in earlier titles, especially the dedicated melee/spinkick/jumpkick/etc, I would have enjoyed them all much more.  To me, the best parts of this "original/non-reboot" Tomb Raider series, was the adventure aspect.  Earlier titles varied greatly in their adventure/puzzle/combat ratio(s) but never quite like this game.  Some was frustrating, even a couple parts that took dozens of attempts, but the issues were mainly my own.\n\nAll things considered, the puzzles were quite easy, levels often quite linear, and plot twists that weren't often surprising.\nBut the most important thing about each of those "negatives" is if you are comparing this game with others that specialize in one or two aspects.  Despite simplicity at times, the puzzles often required thought, patience, and were fun.  Any "linear" issues are irrelevant to me for this game, as it was more of an interactive movie, not an open world RPG.  And the story, despite it not being perfect, and often described as anti-climactic, felt more real and understandable than some big end fight.    tl;dr. enjoy it for what it is.","February 25","true","18.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But this was an enjoyable change of pace because as expected, it's more about solving puzzles then shootouts like the Uncharted series.\n\nThis game has nice graphics and design of environment, good sound, satisfactory cutscenes to make the story go along and make it not just seem like a game one puzzle solving level after another that I got from Tomb Raider Anniversary especially. Lara's movements are cool (e.g. melee kicking, able to jump off walls in tight spaces back and forth so it looks martial-arts like, can equip weapons instead of having to find them). There's a satisfactory amount of gun shooting in a game that is mostly puzzle solving and exploring. Norse mythology is used nicely as a plot point.\n\nAnd a big plus: the camera angles sometimes leads to Lara's nice ♥♥♥. and you can choose her outfit and beginning of levels (her swimsuit in particular is eye-catching :p).\n\n\nMajor gripes I have with this game: controls not 100% smooth (e.g. jumping to a moving object and she appears to have reached it but suddenly she drops to her death, and couple of times I was stuck in a random spot)\nAnd the camera auto adjusts so it gets really annoying trying to see your surrounding while moving.\n\nIf this game was in the 100% yes or 100% no pile of games to play again, I would put this in the yes pile.

I have also already played 2013 and that being said never really felt like it was a true "TR" game, it just missed the mark for puzzles and vibes in my opinion. Underworld hits the nostalgia button just right, though I was sad to see they added the hints for people too lazy to figure it out for themselves. I've learned alot about Lara Croft during this adventure- mainly that she enjoys ancient tomato soup and playing D&D. Despite the glitches, clipping and dated graphics I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the series; unless you thought 2013 was amazing, then maybe you should just get Uncharted instead.","May 13","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game does feature some awesome enviroments and some of the puzzles are actually pretty great. The combat is simple and clearly not the main focus of the game; that is until the end when it becomes a tedious shooting gallery. I felt as if the camera was my biggest enemy for most of the game as sometimes it has a SERIOUSLY hard time keeping up. You will die because of it.\n\nThe story is simply an excuse to take you to these different environments. In other words it is fairly predictable and lacks any complexity to make it worthwhile or interesting. The puzzles are most definitely the highlight of this game as it makes up the majority of the duration spent playing. Entire levels can be devoted to these puzzles and they can be massive in scale (think an uncharted game). The camera will ruin some of these puzzles and can be an exercise in frustration. The game however, features no real incentive to play through again unless you want to clear on a higher difficulty or play through the "Treasure Hunt" mode. In this mode you simply replay through the game without many of the enemies killed and all the puzzles solved, but collecting everything becomes boring extremely fast as their is A LOT.\n\nPerfect game to pick up if on sale as it is consistently marked down to 2.50$. DO NOT buy at full price, not worth it.","October 26, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At $9.99, the game is more than worth it. I'm happy they rebooted the series with the new Tomb Raider (see my other reviews for that), but this one still stands out. Great graphics (especially for a 5 year old game!), awesome (and sometimes extremely difficult) puzzles, and a good story. If you're looking for a shooter, this game's not for you, even though there's plenty of shooting to be found. This game is all about figuring stuff out. Sometimes just getting from "here" to "there" is a challenge, and it can feel silly, but once you get "there" and look back and see where you started from, it's a satisfaction you can't find in any other series. I highly recommend all of the Tomb Raider series, especially the newest. Yeah, Lara's hot, and if that's why you're playing the game, you're missing out. Just a great game all around, although some of the puzzles are just really ridiculous. 4 out of 5.

You can change your gear any time at the current level (i personally do not like this sort of games).\n\nI really dunno if i should recommend this game or not, for one time try it worths it and it feels like a good story if you have the background from Legend and Anniversary but between these 3 games this is my reconnmendation: 1st Legend 2nd Underworld and 3rd Anniversary in fact i do not recommend anniversary at all because it is just way too boring and dull. in fact if they had combined anniversary and underworld together they could make the best tomb raider which was continueing Legend story and ending it.\n\n%50 recommending it and %50 not recommending it is a bit hard to decide about this game for me","February 17, 2014","true","11.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If you are considering to buy a game of these series for the first time, please look at other tombraider-titles before playing this one.\n\n\n**************************SPOILER ALERT********************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-no bossbattles/anticlimax, The story builds up to the point that Lara has to aquire Thors hammer in order to defeat an evil goddes, after getting the hammer, Lara kills the goddes by simply throwing the hammer at her in a cutscene. The goddes instantly dies and her evil world-destroying tower falls apart haha, after that there is a vague reference to Tombraider Legend (excalibur) that doesn't make sense(to me) followed by the credits.","October 11, 2015","false","11.6"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","17","33","5","0"

It literally felt like the team had done a brainstorm on how to create the most difficult user interface (UI) in the world, combined with the least generic game design the age has seen. The amount of frustration was so vast that I actually gave up at one point. Since most of the problems fall under couple of categories, it's very clear to see which developer team didn't do their job. On top it's a game about perfecting stupid keyboard commands, how fun is that?\n\n-------\nCONS\n-------\n\nGameplay\n- It feels like an extremely poor adaption from console to PC. A true keyboard player's nightmare.\n- The climbing puzzles were challenging not because of difficulty but because of weirdly acting controls. I found myself doing the same puzzles over and over again just because the controls acted in a certain way one time and did something else the other time when i was in the very same situation.\n- Swinging on a rope is amazingly hard, sometimes it seems to work, other times not.\n- I spent 15% of time solving the puzzles and 85% to complete them due to broken controls.\n- Every jump in the game is an unforseen mystery how the controls are gonna react. I was half way through the game and still hadn't figured it out.\n- Overall controlling Lara doesnt feel smooth and natural.\n\nUser interface\n- Gamesave process is confusing and time consuming. Manual saving is possible but useless because the game always loads from some place of itself not where you saved it.\n- Bad optimization: loading a savegame can take up as much time as loading from scratch.\n- Only some of the controls have defined key combinations in the options menu. For example it doesn't tell you how to throw an object or how to lower yourself on ropes.\n\nGame design\n- Worst example of inconsistent game rules. Time and again you could climb one type of crates but not others, leaving you baffled. Sometimes there would be ledges that seem so obvious a person could hold onto, yet Lara can't handle them. It just feels like the developer didn't hire a game designer.\n- Solutions to puzzles can come as out of the box.\n- The picking up of items/ breaking loot vases is time-consuming. Further more: I couldn't care less about the collectibles because they didn't seem to add anything to the game.\n- Lara can't interact with objects that scream to have this option. For example Lara is unable to open doors IN HER OWN HOUSE.\n\nVisual\n- Reversed design logic: the objects that are closest to you (Lara, motorcycle) have the simplest textures whereas the background environment is detailed and realistic.\n- 3d character models reflect a lack of anatomic knowledge.\n\nBugs\n- Objects that allow interaction fly away when placed on the ground.\n\n--------------\nPROS\n--------------\n+ A peaceful soundscape that works great.\n+ The climbing puzzles are exciting when overlooking problems with controls.\n+ Background environments look rich and beautiful.\n+ Multi-aiming/ multi-shooting when more than one enemy is in range is original and smart.","January 17, 2015","false","14.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

This time we get to see even more detailed world and characters , you'll notice the difference as soon as the game starts .\n\n(~)Musics / Soundtracks :  Soundtracks are alright , but not as good as the earlier games . In the earlier games you could feel the adrenaline increasing as you jump on to the edges and ledges . Sadly i couldn't feel the same adrenaline playing while i did epic stuff .\n\n(+)Cutscenes :  Cutscenes have also increased to those of the earlier games . They are now better executed with the improved graphics and particle systems .\n\n(-)Story :  Story is not better to that of the Tomb Raider:Legend , nor it is different . It's literally the same thing , except this time you are looking for a different artifact .\n\n(+)Content :  The content is pretty much the same as the Tomb Raider : Legend . Nothing different here , Still the same old Lara Croft raiding tombs .\n\n(~)Gameplay :  Gameplay has been improved significantly . Here are some Pros and Cons ;\n\nPROS :\n\n+ You can now choose your weapons at the start of a level , or during the game by pressing "Tab"        and opening your PDA.\n+ You can now scan your surrounding for the treasures or special items required to get past some   puzzles by using the newly added feature " Sonar Map ".\n+ You can now use the Field Assistance by opening your PDA to get help when you are stuck at a   puzzle .\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Grappling system has changed . You can no longer double press 'space' and automaticly grapple ,   you need to throw your grapple by pressing "Q" and then press space to hang . Which makes it really   difficult for fast grappling and moving .\n- Camera .. It's horrible .. Look down below .\n- "You're not authorized to overwrite save files" What ? you mean i can't overwrite my save files , i   need to just keep making new and new save files until i am out of them ?? What happens then ?\n- Jumps off a 2 feet tall stone block , dies !!\n\n\n(-)Camera Controls :  Why ?? Why did you have to do this ??\n\nThe Camera is simply HORRIBLE. Honestly it shakes off so much you'll be feeling dizzy and nauseous . I almost , ALMOST puked all over the damn pc because my head was about to explode when i finally decided to take a break after 30 minutes .\n\nWhen grabbing a ledge , dropping from a ledge , simply running , grappling , everywhere ! Everywhere it keeps shaking like a drunk cameraman is recording and it's unbearable .\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah , Graphics , Soundtracks , Content , Gameplay all is well or at least bearable . But the camera is simply horrible and makes the game unplayable(for me at least) . Unless you are cross-eyed , then you should be fine .. If not , there is a high possibility that this game might make you one .\n\n4/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews","November 22, 2014","false","15.1"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","17","35","5","2"

Everything about this game looks rushed, from the unresponsive and buggy controls to the story, which makes no sense and leaves you with an awful anti-climax. All the content that used to be a constant feature in the series is also gone: Croft Mansion? Nope. Boss battles? Nope. Unlockable costumes? Nope, nope. All that remains is a pretty average platformer that ends in a handful of hours (took 14 hrs to me to find all the - useless - treasures, but just because I died plenty of times due to the bad controls) and has zero replayability or extras. At this point I can see why they decided to reboot the series and focus on a new retelling of Lara's origins.\n\nI suggest to play this only if you are curious to see how they closed the trilogy started with Legend, but if you just want to play a nice Tomb Raider game with HD graphics stick to Anniversary.

Gorgeous character, level design, and story. But slightly poor execution of the game. Handfull of bugs towards the end. I found myself dying more from falling b/c the game didn't recognize that I was facing a ledge completely and the jump looked plausible to make, but I fell to my death at the last moment because the camera kept shifting or because I kept getting randomly hit by Natla's fireballs. Solution to this problem would problably have to use a controller instead of a mouse to get the camera angles, straight. And another solution would have been to make being able to stun Natla from hitting you. The tutorials in game explain fairly wel how to run,jump, swim, climb, and shoot etc but the Head-shot mechanic could have been better implemented. It took me a bit to get used to looking at where my heatlh meter was as opposed to where my adrenaline meter was and I had to use Youtube to figure out how to properly use the mechanic The game's in-promptu moment weren't entirely clear to me when you could use it during the heat of battle.  But thanks to helpfull  gamers out there once I practiced it was a flawless tactic to use.\n\nMy last and particular thing though, that I will say about Underworld which gripes me beyond the simple glitches is the so called DLC that was released after the launch. Apparently after the game there's two continuing, chapters explaining more if not totally concluding the game in it's own right.After a little reasearch, apparently Crystal Dynamics had intensions of including the chapters but due to a small layoff of the deves, caused it to be DLC since Microsoft wasn't sure if the sales would cap. I've yet to find if there's a Steam port of these chapters. The ending by itself feels rushed and watered down compared to the other Tomb Raider's. There's no real explanation as to what happens to Lara, Amanda, Natla, and Croft manor when you escape Avalon. Not to mention there's no real showdown you get to have with ol' Natla who's impervious to any attack. That being said, it's a shame there wasn't better communication with the development and marking team during the release of this Tomb Raider cause it's got some really nice features that just could've been improved over time.\n\nOverall 7.5/10","September 1, 2015","false","18.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

That's saying a lot, because no game has ever made me as dizzy as this one, and i've been playing computer games for over 25 years.\n\nSo what is it about the camera? In short, it has a life of its own. As soon as you hit any of the movement keys, the camera tries to level itself out and point towards where Lara is headed. The only way to stop this behaviour is to stop moving, But walking and looking around at the same time is nigh impossible, as you're constantly struggling against the camera. It gets worse the closer you move around walls, inside tight corridors, or close to ledges, as the camera likes to suddenly flip or spin around, resulting in you running into said wall – or off a cliff. The game was obviously designed to be played with a controller, where this "camera helper" might have been a good idea, but when you're used to playing with keyboard/mouse, it becomes unbearable.","November 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","0"

If you like FPS games where that character you play jumps, stops, shoots, ducks, etc. when you want them to..............well, this game doesn't do that, nor do any of the past few tomb raiders for that matter. If you just like the "feel" of it and the environment, and are not dismayed by the mindless endless repeating of things because your quirky control of Lara committed suicide by walking off a high area, then maybe there's hope for you. For me, that's not my definition of fun nor entertainment, I can tell when I start wanting to cause physical harm to my monitor due to sheer frustration.\n\nIn other words, things do not happen as fluidly as they should.

So be far take m4 and just spam and tadaaa. story line has been really awful.. lara just surrender after few guys pointing a gun at her.. why? she can kill a hole army whit all thouse gun's what she have. the reason why I gave 1,6 is because of the game character I love the A$$ and boobs what she has lol. after 1hour and 30minutes thouse were only in my mind because the game went really shiat. and these character have really really big eye's. it looks funny :P but my point is that now its awful buggy and laggy but I'm going to finish this even whit the bugs ! and don't buy this game I dont recommend on PC","June 23, 2014","false","13.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The last thing I want to be doing when trying to dodge something is finicking around with having to press 3 buttons at once to make it happen.\nI gave up when in one of the early puzzles you had to weight down some switches with boxes (I assume, I didn't complete it) and my boxes both went flying off into space as soon as I put them down. Not just a freak glitch, it happened every time until I realized you have to wait for the (fully pressed down) switch to stop making noise before you could set them down or they would rocket off like they had a mission for the moon. I was unable to find one of them again I assume it landed in the water behind me and there was no way to get it back, at which point I quit the game.","January 6","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The controls are messy, lara is often all over the place or she doesnt go where you'd want here to go, some controls like the "throw" action arent even listed in the keybindings, resulting in utter frustration when you have to solve the cube puzzle with pressure plates right before the relic room, I had to look it up on the internet, and quickly discovered that the thow button was on the Capslock key by default, and could not be changed, who even puts controles on the capslock key right?? The camera is often all over the place aswell, and then you havent got me started on the AI yet. This is by far one of the dumbest AI's I've ever encountered in a game. I'm not even joking when I say that the AI from the enemies in Tomb Raider 1 is far better than the AI from Underworld. One of the best examples of this is when you are on the enemy ship, the guards often face their backs to you, dont see you or stand there twitching stupidly when they get shoot.","September 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokinath/recommended/8140/","rokinath","Rokinath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokinath/","269 products in account","I picked up Tomb Raider Underworld when it was on sale, wanting to finally get around to seeing the conclusion of the story Tomb Raider Legend started. The subtitle is extremely relevant, as we see Lara exploring the reality behind various cultures' interpretation of hell and the afterlife in a quest to discover the fate of her mother, once and for all.\n\nHowever, by the end of the game, the subtitle gained a second meaning to me as its where I wanted the game to go once I had finished it.\n\nPlatforming's always been a big thing in Tomb Raider, and in this game Crystal Dynamics clearly wanted to ramp things up a notch. For instance, Lara can chimney jump, balance on poles; abseil using her grappling hook or using it to run along walls - all this in addition to the usual jumping, climbing and shimmying along ledges. On paper, Lara is alot more versatile than any of her previous incarnations, but in the actual game all these moves are plagued by abysmal controls. Quite often Lara will often ignore your commands outright, or do the exact opposite.\nI recall one instance where I was running back and forth along a wall (via the grapple) and at the very end of the run, jump back off the wall to land on a bridge. I spent 15 minutes on this alone just because of how disobedient the controls were.\n\nCombine this with the fact Crystal Dynamics tried to make their levels more open ended. I think they succeeded all too well. There are times where you will feel completely clueless as to what you're supposed to do (hence the inclusion of a (scarcely helpful) 'Field Assistance' feature)) and sometimes you will be scaling up a wall only to find it goes to absolutely nowhere; a habit that becomes prevelant in the later stages of the game. I hope you're ready to reload alot.\n\nAnd speaking of, the save system is pretty stupid in this game aswell. You have about 20 slots, which seems like plenty until you realise autosaves take up their own individual slots and cannot be overwritten.\n\nGraphically the game is showing its age a bit, but its decent enough. Just pray that if you do end up playing this you don't encounter a glitch that caused my game to freeze for a split second and occured every 2 to 3 seconds. I miraculously managed to fix it but I've trawled through a few forums to see plenty of other people having similar problems on rigs that far outclass this game in terms of specs.\n\nThere are good points to this game, mind. Most of the levels are fantastic in terms of their design and scale. You'll go through ruins of various cultures and they all feel distinct from one another. The story itself is good too (better if you're coming here from Legend) and features some decent twists and recurring characters. There's even two pieces of DLC to tie up a few loose ends... if you're playing the Xbox 360 version, that is. As if there needed to be any more evidence that this is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ PC port.\n\nIn brief, I came here purely for a nice conclusion to Legend's story and I got it. Its just buried under a mountain of niggling problems that make it feel not worth the effort.","February 19, 2015","false","11.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apap/recommended/8140/","apap","Apap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apap/","76 products in account","To be honest, the game disappointed me.\n\nFor a product present on the market for so long, and one which is supposedly on its last patch, TR:U is uncomfortably buggy: stuck points, position estimation errors, weird physics at times, control problems and annoying camera behavior - you name it, it's there. You wouldn't believe how many deaths I experienced just because the camera refused to cooperate or Lara did not grab a 100% sure ledge for some reason. I don't understand how did they manage to screw it up when they had the near perfection of TR: Anniversary as a template.\n\nAnother thing is the plot. I know this is not the most imortant aspect of an adventure game, but holy smoke is the story in Underworld uninspiring. I especially love it how Lara is emotionally disconnected from her long-time co-workers and supposedly friends. An outstanding display of long-lasting bonds, built upon trust, hardships, ups and downs and life-threatening situations endured together throughout the years of working together... Not really.\n\nLast but not least, what's the point of the artifacts and relics in this game? When the former is completely useless and you basically trip over one or another every other step, the latter offers you only the "advantage" of expanding your health bar - not that this boost will ever make a difference in combat and sure as hell won't save you when falling off a ledge. Also, you cannot even view the collected stuff in your manor. One of the amazing feats of the previous games was that you could always come back to the manor and look at the unique tokens brought back from your adventures - it was like an internal achievement system and really satisfying. And here you are to enjoy collecting generic cubes and orbs. Fun.\n\nThe game is visually beautiful and most of the locations are quite interesting - I'll give the game that. However, the fact that the gameplay tends to be quite uncooperative because of the reasons listed above, I couldn't really enjoy it that much. More frustration than fun, really.\n\nTo sum up, the game seems very rushed to me and sadly is a wasted potential. They wanted to close the story weaved through Legend and Anniversary and did so but without the effort they should have put in the title. This is one game I will definitely not come back to.\n\nIf you're thinking of going for this game, do yourself a favour and (re-)play Tomb Raider Anniversary instead.","April 6, 2015","false","18.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JZemlinsky/recommended/8140/","JZemlinsky","Josh Z.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JZemlinsky/","154 products in account","This is a game i would have a hard time recommending to anyone really.\nFor a modern game, it has some very difficult puzzles at times, which is one of the only good things about the game. The other thing being Lara looking more gorgious then ever!\nThe puzzles are never straight forward, and can often be a real brainwrapper to complete. This is really nice, for an age where you are expected to progress by the push of a button.\nSadly, the game has not much else to offer.  The controlls are unusual, especially during "jumping-puzzles" where they shuffle around, literally. Changing the camera angle will change which way the controlls will have you go. This can get so confusing, and it's hard to get used to. It isn't helping much either, that the camera constantly works against you. Sometimes it is also hard to tell if you can grab a ledge or not, this has had me stuck in a few areas for unpleasently long time.\n\nThe combat system is probably one of the most boring features of the game, for me it felt incredibely dull, fighting human AI is the worst, as holding down the trigger is all you need to do to achieve victory, as every shot they take freezes them for a frame or two, allowing you to kill them before they can retaliate. Fighting wild life is a whole other game, and is almost too difficult. The camera will always do it's best to get your view as far off the attackers as possible. And it is often hard to avoid enemy strikes. There is alot of very complicated 'special move' controlls, that i never got to use as the combo was impossible to remember.\n\nIt is also littered with bugs and glitches as you'd come to expect. The worst of these, being that the ingame physics are highly(EXTREMELY) affected when Vsync is off. Carriable items will fling Lara around, fly away when put down, or clip you through the level. Often grapplehook objects can't be affected either. Why this was never caught in testing is beyond me, As it renders 90% of the physic based puzzles unsolveable. The game also lacks a Steam community GUI, it does however make up for this with flawless alt-tabing. (Have had no crashes with this yet)\n\nIn the end, the game fails to mix much of interest inbetween the endless waves of puzzles, boring fights, and difficult jumping session. Not to mention the very repeative enviroments, and areas. Most of the ruins are very alike, altho this is intentional.\nThe game's main focus seems to be on what it does best, puzzles! But for me, doing nothing else then completing puzzles can get boring very quick, and i oftenly took serval days of break from playing, due to getting bored. Before finally giving up, as i got stuck towards the end of the game. Yet another game i will never complete.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this seems like a decent console port, sadly the PC features feel untested, the shuffling controlls, annoying camera, boring combat system, repeative enviroments and too many puzzles, are not helping it at all. I feel the only two good things in the game is the most gorgious looking Lara to date, and the puzzles. which there are too many of\nBeyond that, as i already said, i think it's hard to recommend. But, for 9€ you should get your moneys worth, if you enjoy puzzles.","January 9, 2014","false","12.1"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","16","37","0","6"

Motion capture was used for Lara's animations, so there's no smooth tweening between actions; it feels really stiff. The art style skewed realistic at the expense of gameplay. There are lots of ridges visible all over objects, but only some of them are grabbable. Level design has gone downhill; things are poorly signposted, and I spent a lot of time in certain places wandering around trying to find the next area.\n\nThen there are the glitches. Lara won't consistently grab irregular ledges for some reason. The final level has lots of moving platforms that Lara "homes in on" when you jump towards them, except when she doesn't. There's a Sands of Time type mechanic when fighting undead where you have to deal the final blow after they've fallen, but half the time Lara just does a spin kick instead.\n\nThe graphics are a lot prettier than previous games, and there are no boss fights. Other than that? Just go play Anniversary.","September 16, 2013","false","12.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

The mechanics need more polish. One example is one jump might appear close enough, but since you're not supposed to go there, you'll fall and die. You will successfully leap across a larger gap if you are meant to go that route. This kind of trial an error sucks. There is a major physics glitch that nearly prevents you from completing the game.

The achievements are very solid too. However, that's about the only praise that can be given to this game. Story is naff, combat is practically pointless and non-existent throughout most of the game and the focus is entirely on navigating the levels' puzzles and platforms. This wouldn't be too bad if the mechanics, camera and level design were robust. Unfortunately, they are the game's biggest problem. Most of the time when you get stuck, it's not because you couldn't work out where you're meant to go, but the game's physics and camera angle being so obscure that the ledge or platform is glitch to try and get to. Some places which should clearly be scalable aren't, and those which are where you're meant to go are awkwardly placed and will result in many deaths due to the inconsistent directional input detection relative to the camera position. The left and right sticks are almost completely unrelated. The only reason you know where to go is because the game is very linear; there is only one way to play the level and one particular ledge you have to use every time. There is literally zero scope for creativity or playing it your own way. The levels themselves offer a good variety of environments including snow, jungle, underwater and indeed, a tomb. Overall though, Underworld is a bad game with little to offer, and is quite boring to play as well as being broken.","November 26, 2013","false","0.4"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","2","15","0","0"

A most definite "Nope".\nI played just 2 or 3 minutes effectively and cannot say anything about in-depth gameplay or story, but one thing already ruined the game no matter how good those may be: The controls.\nI'm not sure how it acts on controllers, i suspect no better though. You might have had some terrible experiences with the other, newer tomb raider games which all have poor controls, but this is a new dimension of "f***ed up". I'm playing video games for fifteen years now, several hours per day, and I've never encountered a game that made me nauseous so far. Until now.\nThe little fact that the camera automatically tries to adapt to your character movement (which is glitchy already) and tries to overwrite your controls leads to an immense clusterf*** of camera movements. I proceeded in the game until you have to pull open the door with the grappling hook before I had to quit and empty my stomach in the bathroom.\n\nI'll see if I can find a workaround for this (i.e. blocking this particular behaviour somehow), but since the game does not offer any solution or setting regarding this, it's definitely a reason not to buy the game.","April 23","false","0.2"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","8","1","13","2","0"

I don't think Underworld was the strongest of the three though. I ran into more glitchiness, like getting stuck in rocks, that I recall in the other two. I also didn't like the lack of boss fights. The closest was the giant squid, which was more of a puzzle and less of a boss fight. I'm really fired up for the reboot later this year (which hopefully evolves the combat a bit) and still need to finish Guardian of Light.\n\nIt's worth noting that Underworld is rated "Excellent" for 3D Vision and was really awesome. It makes me want a 3DTV for Uncharted 3 even more, as these type of games with the huge set pieces really works well in 3D.","April 23, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game, I've owned it on DVD since it first came out and have played it many times without any issues. I bought it on Steam, because it was on sale and I thought why not have a no disc copy as well.\n\nThe game Steam installed on my machine is unplayable. I get terrible fps drops every 5 seconds (I have a GTX 670, more than enough to run a game like this) and the controls are impossible. If there's a level where you have to carry a heavy object and place it on a specific surface - you are screwed. Lara keeps either dropping the thing or it just keeps teleporting to a random place on the map, all by itself without you having done anything. Not to mention the camera goes crazy whenever you're climbing a wall or jumping on poles, sometimes resulting in you jumping in the wrong direction and dying.\n\nThis is not the first time I've seen a Steam version of a game underperform compared to its DVD counterpart. What gives, Valve? And what gives, Crystal Dynamics?\n\nUPDATE:\nTurning vsync on does indeed fix these issues. I think it's an acceptable solution, I don't mind the delay too much.","December 31, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a whole, I thought they did an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the original Tomb Raider while significantly improving the graphics, gameplay mechanics, interface, and player control of Lara. Underworld improves on Anniversary visually with more natural textures, reflections, and light/shadow effects. The Thailand segment of the game in particular is gorgeous. It also adds some terrific new gameplay mechanics like chimney climbing, walking on and vaulting from the top of poles, and rock climbing. It also made good use of the motorcycle in a couple of the later missions.\n\nWhere Underworld falls short of Anniversary a little bit is that the puzzles on the whole aren't as intricate or elaborate. Anniversary really set the bar high with some of the most ambitiously designed puzzles I have ever seen in a game. But Underworld is still a fun challenge nevertheless. I also, as amazed as I am to say this, miss a real boss battle in Underworld. Boss fights in Tomb Raider have never been that impressive and success is always based on your figuring out the pattern to beat it. Still, having those occasional showdowns do provide a sense of closure to the bigger chapters of the game.\n\nThe ending itself felt rushed, and I was surprised after completing the final puzzle (which was a fun and visually impressive scene), it went straight into cut scenes and then the game was over. Underworld would have benefited greatly from one final showdown between Lara and Natla to bring the trilogy to an epic conclusion. (she is there during the last puzzle, but merely as a distraction while you focus on completing it) The ending does wrap up the story about what happened to Lara's mother, but it doesn't feel satisfying the way it could have.\n\nUnderworld is still a must-play for any Tomb Raider fan, it is entertaining throughout.","January 1, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You often find yourself having to blindly jump backwards because the camera angle wont allow you to turn far enough to see where to jump to next.\n\nAlso, a lot of the time throughout the climbing bits of the game I found Lara didn't respond to where I wanted to jump to and would often just jump off in some random direction resulting in a falling death.

You can't take screenshots without a workaround explained in the game forums.\n4. You should have been able to change the camera depth.  It is too close for my liking.\n5. A very contrived plot.\n6. Awful Savegame system straight out of console world.  Every now-and-then when saving, my game crashed.\n\nThe ugly:\n7. Too many enemies spoil tension.\n8. Atrocious camera heebie-jeebies in certain spots; like low corner areas.\n9. Apparently you can do headshots?  Damned if I could.","August 5, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tomb Raider: Underworld has so far proven to be very good. It's full of puzzles, great jumps, climbing and agile obstacles to pass and to figure out. Sometimes this game does make my temper raise a little but once you know what to do or get past a goal, it's rewarding and you're more than happy to face more.\n\nThis game feels rather casual and fun to play to pass some time, although some jumps can be tricky and damn right hair raising at times, it's a very relaxing experience. I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to play something different, or if you're a fan of the Tomb Raider series, or just want to climb around and explore cool ancient ruins - this game is for you!\n\nAn all-round enjoyable experience that has certainly set my mind to buying the other Tomb Raider games (when I have the money haha :D )\n\n8/10","August 17, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It works fine, it looks good, it is interesting in parts, however there is no real incentive to keep playing. I found myself annoyed at choosing two weapons before each mission, and not unlocking each skin by finding the artefacts. As a Tomb Raider fan I found the old ones similar to survival horror - you fight against the relics of past civilisations and the beast within their ruins, with your trusty pistols and extras you can pick up  along the way.\n\nThe strongest point in the Tomb Raider series for me, has always been the puzzles, and the intrigue brought up through the lore, except the newest origin story that was more about action, but pulled that off really well and remained intriguing. This game however has the problem of being neither challenging (all the puzzles are remarkably simple), nor fast paced and action filled. It toes the line between genres and as such ends up being unremarkable.\n\nOverall, its not a bad game, but not necessarily one I would ever recommend. I enjoyed it in the beginning for nostalgia sake, but the novelty wore off and I was unable to push though the game.","November 16, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a whole, I thought they did an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the original Tomb Raider while significantly improving the graphics, gameplay mechanics, interface, and player control of Lara. Underworld improves on Anniversary visually with more natural textures, reflections, and light/shadow effects. The Thailand segment of the game in particular is gorgeous. It also adds some terrific new gameplay mechanics like chimney climbing, walking on and vaulting from the top of poles, and rock climbing. It also made good use of the motorcycle in a couple of the later missions.\n\nWhere Underworld falls short of Anniversary a little bit is that the puzzles on the whole aren't as intricate or elaborate. Anniversary really set the bar high with some of the most ambitiously designed puzzles I have ever seen in a game. But Underworld is still a fun challenge nevertheless. I also, as amazed as I am to say this, miss a real boss battle in Underworld. Boss fights in Tomb Raider have never been that impressive and success is always based on your figuring out the pattern to beat it. Still, having those occasional showdowns do provide a sense of closure to the bigger chapters of the game.\n\nThe ending itself felt rushed, and I was surprised after completing the final puzzle (which was a fun and visually impressive scene), it went straight into cut scenes and then the game was over. Underworld would have benefited greatly from one final showdown between Lara and Natla to bring the trilogy to an epic conclusion. (she is there during the last puzzle, but merely as a distraction while you focus on completing it) The ending does wrap up the story about what happened to Lara's mother, but it doesn't feel satisfying the way it could have.\n\nUnderworld is still a must-play for any Tomb Raider fan, it is entertaining throughout.","January 1, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If your a completionist with collectables in the game, it has a nice feature of being able to visit ANY level after you beat the game with all paths unlocked and all enimies dead so you can just explore.

I loved the norse mythology of the crypts that you explore. even with the glitches, the motorcycle sections were pretty fun.\n\nI would rank this tomb raider game above tomb raider legends for sure, but tomb raider aniversery and the recent reboot are better than this.

I'd give it a 7.0 / 10. The game was buggy when you first run it but when I closed it and then replayed it again. Everything was sort of fixed from then on.\n\nAnyways this is not the best game to play whenever it comes to the story and how lackluster and short it is. Sadly the DLC is an Xbox360 exclusive :I so Beneath the Ashes and Lara's Shadow DLC is unavailable so I would never recommend this version considering Microsoft being an ♥♥♥ about getting more money.. If you are a fan of Tomb Raider; Get the TR collection but picky about the DLC then get the seperate games on consoles.\n\nThe music is orchestral at best and great at invoking various feelings at that; the running of the game is smooth. I'd say the gameplay mechanics is much better than the previous two Crystal Dynamic games; You can aim at two enemies at once, your swimming has a sprint boost as well as more faster and more breathing in comparison to the god awful previous system. The climbing is also a drastic improvement as you can jump in more than one way rather than a set way so this game has a praise for that..\n\nThis game would've been so good if the DLC was available, Or the game's length were playable more further and more time consuming. I'd say without speed running it or taking it deliberately slowly. This game can be beaten in at least 6 hours at best which is a bit short on my perspective so like Tomb Raider Chronicles and Tomb Raider Legend; I would say that this is one of the three most shortest to beat games in the series... So personally I am okay with this one; it's far, far better than the PS2 version and not really buggy for the most part so it's a pretty smooth running game so I can't say anything wrong with it.","July 2, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The closest was the giant squid, which was more of a puzzle and less of a boss fight. I'm really fired up for the reboot later this year (which hopefully evolves the combat a bit) and still need to finish Guardian of Light.\n\nIt's worth noting that Underworld is rated "Excellent" for 3D Vision and was really awesome.

The game was trying to go into new and interesting directions and the Playstation 2 couldn't keep up. It made the game feel more like work than a pleasure. Now a decent PC doesn't has this limitation and the game shines more like it was suppose to. But as far as the other two Tomb Raiders this third PC release is the weakest of the bunch but if you collect any and all Tomb Raider games you can't let this one go on the simple fact that your collection is incomplete without Underworld. Basicly the game isn't bad, not bad at all but after beating it you won't find yourself running back to beat it again anytime soon. You'll find yourself playing more for the storyline to see what happens next because there is a good story here. As far as gameplay you just feel like you are just going through the motions you've learned so well from all the previous Tomb Raider games. Put simply the Tomb Raider magic is starting to wear thin and her new ability to wall climb in a new way annoys me more than her old way of climbing. It's nice new eye candy but the game wouldn't of suffered without it. As far as recommending this game? Yes but not as strongly as past titles.

It uses a different, newer engine to the first two which for the most part works better. Acrobatics are fantastic, there are lots of interesting physics puzzles rather than Anniversary's simple "find the key/switch to proceed" puzzles. About the only downside to gameplay here compared with Anniversary and Legend is that combat is absolutely pants this time around. And the underwater sections are rubbish.\nThe story is just as unbelievable as the previous two games, though the writing has continued to improve since Legend.

However, Underworld is in my opinion better than the previous two in the Anniversary/Legend/underworld trilogy.\n\nAn honest and accurate review? This is the Dark souls of Tomb raiders. You will die plenty, not by enemies but mainly ....well just stupid crap that you may or may not have pressed on your controller/keyboard. A seemingly obvious jump just won't hit the mark and you'll plummet to your death. This has been an inherent problem in the Tomb raider series and no matter how accurate you think your jumps may be, sooner or later you'll do something that should work but doesn't.\n\nA big gripe I have is that the two chapters of DLC are xbox exclusives and they wrap up the Underworld story and tie up some lose ends, some big loose ends. If you decide to get this game and finish it, I'd suggest checking out a letsplay of the DLC chapters if you're interested in the story.\n\nOn that, the story itself is not too bad, a nice dose of Norse mythology and a few surprises...and anti-climaxes.\n\nThe graphics for a game of it's age are still pretty impressive, some nice textures and shadows, decent enough sounds and the music isn't overbearing.\n\nKinda felt that this game went back to it's Tomb raider roots in the feeling of adventure, epic levels with decent puzzles and a feeling of awe when you enter a huge room or area and see where you are and where you have to be. Also, there are plenty of opportunities for treasure hunting!\n\nThe gameplay was ok when I wasn't dropping off cliffs and dying by not even pressing the wrong button.....\nI enjoyed the combat, the headshot ability is a little to un-used once you get mjo....I mean towards the end of the game. The motorcycle was a bit lame, I hated having to get off it every few seconds to pick up relics or treasure and the levels didn't even feel big enough to necessitate a motorbike....ok some areas it was fun.\n\nAll in all, I think if you're a huge fan of the series, get it!","June 1, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd give it a 7.0 / 10. The game was buggy when you first run it but when I closed it and then replayed it again. Everything was sort of fixed from then on.\n\nAnyways this is not the best game to play whenever it comes to the story and how lackluster and short it is. Sadly the DLC is an Xbox360 exclusive :I so Beneath the Ashes and Lara's Shadow DLC is unavailable so I would never recommend this version considering Microsoft being an ♥♥♥ about getting more money.. If you are a fan of Tomb Raider; Get the TR collection but picky about the DLC then get the seperate games on consoles.\n\nThe music is orchestral at best and great at invoking various feelings at that; the running of the game is smooth. I'd say the gameplay mechanics is much better than the previous two Crystal Dynamic games; You can aim at two enemies at once, your swimming has a sprint boost as well as more faster and more breathing in comparison to the god awful previous system. The climbing is also a drastic improvement as you can jump in more than one way rather than a set way so this game has a praise for that..\n\nThis game would've been so good if the DLC was available, Or the game's length were playable more further and more time consuming. I'd say without speed running it or taking it deliberately slowly. This game can be beaten in at least 6 hours at best which is a bit short on my perspective so like Tomb Raider Chronicles and Tomb Raider Legend; I would say that this is one of the three most shortest to beat games in the series... So personally I am okay with this one; it's far, far better than the PS2 version and not really buggy for the most part so it's a pretty smooth running game so I can't say anything wrong with it.","July 2, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladythecla/recommended/8140/","ladythecla","ladythecla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladythecla/","33 products in account","Underworld is quite an enjoyable game. Lara Croft controls well, though fans of the older games may find it difficult to get used to her auto-complete at first. She completes most actions on her own, with very little need for player intervention. Mouse sensitivity is high when you first open up the game, so I highly recommend adjusting that first because otherwise Lara will feel rather floaty and the game won't be as enjoyable. The worlds are beautiful and relatively easy to navigate, although those giant spiders will give me nightmares for weeks to come.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the fights are not too bad and the puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating. My main problem with combat was the lack of a cover mechanic or a proper dodge. Your sole way of dodging is to move out of the enemy's path. Medkits are scattered about the levels and if you explore, you'll have more than enough to deal with things. Speaking of damage, Lara can die rather easily, even from falling what seem to be short distances. There seem to be rather specific routes to take, rather than a more open method, but it's fine because this is a game from the 2000s, not the 2010s. Open-world routes are a relatively newer thing, particularly when it comes to parkour games.\n\nI liked Lara's outfit options, which allow for her signature shorts or a more practical look of pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Her cold attire is really practical and stylish, allowing variance between a down vest or a jacket. You do get to play a level in the Croft Manor as well, which is nice because it's good to see that Lara does have a home and is not just a nomad who goes out into the wilds seeking thrills and treasure. As in most of these older games, Lara is rather gritty and impersonable. She takes things as a treasure-hunter, a survivor, and rarely as a human. However, we get to see more of her human side here as she reconnects with her father and his quests.\n\nLara follows her father's findings and her own research to the far corners of the world, seeking out treasures of ancient gods in lands long since dead. There isn't a huge variety in terms of environment. You get two jungle levels with a manor level in between and then the epic snowy level high in mountainous tundras. True, in one jungle you face panthers and poachers and giant spiders (eugh), but the lack of variety is really staggering. The one thing I can say is that all the levels are decently sized and don't drag on. I wish the checkpoints of later levels were spaced better so that I didn't have to redo entire segments because I missed one jump, but it is still quite a good game. I'm almost finished and feel quite confident in recommending this to Tomb Raider fans, new and old. There is nothing like a classic, oh, and the motorcycle mechanic is really annoying, but you don't have to deal with damage like in GTA or Watch Dogs. Lara's health can go down if you crash into a stone pillar head-on, so be careful, but those are small issues that I can get past.","December 18, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are so many ledges that you'd think she'd be able to grab but they actually aren't programmed to be grabbable so you just end up falling to your death. And the camera is just horrible; constant zooming in zooming out moving up down all around that it legitimately makes me nauseous.\n\nWould I recommend it? Depends. I'd get it if you're a fan of the Tomb Raider series, but for others I advise you to stay away from this. If you plan on buying it, only do it when it's on sale. $10 alone isn't bad, but for this game it's not worth it at all. It's got nice looking levels I'll give it that, but other than that the mechanics are just horrendous","December 7, 2015","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was so stressed out because whenever I would pick up a block and try to set it down it would fly hundreds of feet in random directions. So I was reading some tech support forums and found that some people were saying that if they turned the graphic settings or anti aliasing all the way up, it seemed to help but not cure the issue. This got me thinking. Maybe it has to do with framerate?\n\nI usually display my framerate in an OSD with a monitoring app and realized that I was getting hundreds of frames per second even with the graphics and AA settings maxed out. So I started experimenting with VSYNC.

Decided to finally play through it after putting if off for a few years.

The environments the game takes you through are pretty breathtaking for their day in design, scale and scope, plus they all are filled with puzzles and climbing routes that sometimes span the entire level.  Didn't take me too long to complete, maybe 8 hours or so.  A couple of frustrating areas had me looking at a walkthrough for pointers, including the end sequence which was rather confusing at times.  I'd highly recommend it if you like adventure games and exploration - if you can pardon the somewhat crazy magical story.

It uses a different, newer engine to the first two which for the most part works better. Acrobatics are fantastic, there are lots of interesting physics puzzles rather than Anniversary's simple "find the key/switch to proceed" puzzles. About the only downside to gameplay here compared with Anniversary and Legend is that combat is absolutely pants this time around. And the underwater sections are rubbish.\nThe story is just as unbelievable as the previous two games, though the writing has continued to improve since Legend. It neatly ties up the trilogy's storyline (though it ends rather abruptly). Having said that, the character of Amanda's motivations remain largely unexplained.\n\n7/10","May 30, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a huge deal, just something that irks me a bit.\n\nHowever, the locations are beautiful, and I love that you can revisit all of the locations you've been to after you've finished the game without having to actually replay the level.\n\nBasically, I'd say it's a good game, but not exactly a must-have. It's probably a good idea to try the demo to see if it interests you before deciding, since there are better games in this series that I feel are more worth the money (most of those pretty old, though).","February 7, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lara seaches accompanied by her partners Zip and Alistair for Avalon, the mythical place King Arthur's sword Excalibur is held and her father searched for years ago. Concluding the Tomb Raider Legend storyline she furthermore is on a treasure hunt for Thor's hammer Mjölnir, an artifact which holds superhuman power and shouldn't fall into the wrong hands.\nOverall the story is pretty mediocre. It delivers enough reason to visit exotic places around the world and to raid sunken temples and long forgotten tombs. But none of the characters actually does more than to serve their purpose in being the villain, the more or less funny sidekick or the friend who gets killed. It's a pity that Underworld fails to deliver a compelling storyline with interesting and charismatic characters as the original Indiana Jones movies or the Uncharted series (PlayStation exclusive) did. Nevertheless the story clearly isn't the main acpect why you play a Tomb Raider game.\n\nGameplaywise you get everything you'd expect from the successor of Anniversary and Legend: Cool setpieces around the world with puzzles, enemies and gunfights. The combat feels really dated and does not deliver any actual thrill resulting in a total revision in the series next entry. But the jumping and climbing mechanics work - besides some glitchy and buggy situations - really well. Unfortunately some settings get recycled meaning you don't encounter the exact same levels twice but you get two pretty good underwater levels (don't be scared, they're really nice) and you raid a big overgrown jungle temple twice, one at the coast of Thailand and one in the jungle of Mexico on a motorcycle.\n\nGraphic and Sounddesign are obivously dated because of the game's age but still are good enough to deliver the joy of being on a world-spanning adventure. I played the game on full settings and use Windows 10 (64-bit) as an OS and did not expierience any major bugs, only in one level I had some strange and extraordinary frame drops. Apart from this I played constantly with 144 fps, my screen's limit.\n\nAltogether Tomb Raider: Underworld is not a really surprising adventure and does not deliver any really new features to the series but this isn't always required to give you a good time. The story is forgettable boring but the gameplay itself holds this adventure alone. I've played better games but I also played games much worse. A worthy addition in the Anniversary-Legend-Underworld trilogy. If you like the old school Tomb Raider games you get what you'd expect and possibly what you want.","March 10","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lara seaches accompanied by her partners Zip and Alistair for Avalon, the mythical place King Arthur's sword Excalibur is held and her father searched for years ago. Concluding the Tomb Raider Legend storyline she furthermore is on a treasure hunt for Thor's hammer Mjölnir, an artifact which holds superhuman power and shouldn't fall into the wrong hands.\nOverall the story is pretty mediocre. It delivers enough reason to visit exotic places around the world and to raid sunken temples and long forgotten tombs. But none of the characters actually does more than to serve their purpose in being the villain, the more or less funny sidekick or the friend who gets killed. It's a pity that Underworld fails to deliver a compelling storyline with interesting and charismatic characters as the original Indiana Jones movies or the Uncharted series (PlayStation exclusive) did. Nevertheless the story clearly isn't the main acpect why you play a Tomb Raider game.\n\nGameplaywise you get everything you'd expect from the successor of Anniversary and Legend: Cool setpieces around the world with puzzles, enemies and gunfights. The combat feels really dated and does not deliver any actual thrill resulting in a total revision in the series next entry. But the jumping and climbing mechanics work - besides some glitchy and buggy situations - really well. Unfortunately some settings get recycled meaning you don't encounter the exact same levels twice but you get two pretty good underwater levels (don't be scared, they're really nice) and you raid a big overgrown jungle temple twice, one at the coast of Thailand and one in the jungle of Mexico on a motorcycle.\n\nGraphic and Sounddesign are obivously dated because of the game's age but still are good enough to deliver the joy of being on a world-spanning adventure. I played the game on full settings and use Windows 10 (64-bit) as an OS and did not expierience any major bugs, only in one level I had some strange and extraordinary frame drops. Apart from this I played constantly with 144 fps, my screen's limit.\n\nAltogether Tomb Raider: Underworld is not a really surprising adventure and does not deliver any really new features to the series but this isn't always required to give you a good time. The story is forgettable boring but the gameplay itself holds this adventure alone. I've played better games but I also played games much worse. A worthy addition in the Anniversary-Legend-Underworld trilogy. If you like the old school Tomb Raider games you get what you'd expect and possibly what you want.","March 10","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd give it a 7.0 / 10. The game was buggy when you first run it but when I closed it and then replayed it again. Everything was sort of fixed from then on.\n\nAnyways this is not the best game to play whenever it comes to the story and how lackluster and short it is. Sadly the DLC is an Xbox360 exclusive :I so Beneath the Ashes and Lara's Shadow DLC is unavailable so I would never recommend this version considering Microsoft being an ♥♥♥ about getting more money.. If you are a fan of Tomb Raider; Get the TR collection but picky about the DLC then get the seperate games on consoles.\n\nThe music is orchestral at best and great at invoking various feelings at that; the running of the game is smooth. I'd say the gameplay mechanics is much better than the previous two Crystal Dynamic games; You can aim at two enemies at once, your swimming has a sprint boost as well as more faster and more breathing in comparison to the god awful previous system. The climbing is also a drastic improvement as you can jump in more than one way rather than a set way so this game has a praise for that..\n\nThis game would've been so good if the DLC was available, Or the game's length were playable more further and more time consuming. I'd say without speed running it or taking it deliberately slowly. This game can be beaten in at least 6 hours at best which is a bit short on my perspective so like Tomb Raider Chronicles and Tomb Raider Legend; I would say that this is one of the three most shortest to beat games in the series... So personally I am okay with this one; it's far, far better than the PS2 version and not really buggy for the most part so it's a pretty smooth running game so I can't say anything wrong with it.","July 2, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After finishing TR : Legend ( a somewhat smooth but short experience ) I wanted to give this one another try. Could never finish it because most of the time I end up ragequiting, and here is why :\n\n- the controls sucks sometimes and Lara dies\n- the balancing mechanics on wooden beams sucks and Lara dies\n- the wall multi-jump mechanics doesn't work and you have to start over, or Lara dies\n- the headshot system sucks and is completely useless\n- you have to fight the camera constantly, and Lara dies\n- Ai is mindless or berserk\n- the save system sucks\n\nIn fact this game could have been called Tomb Raider : Lara dies a lot. I died more time in the 2 first levels than in the entire Legend game, only due to bad controls, camera, or design. Maybe it's a good thing that they rebooted the series with the 2013 TR, because the next "normal" TR game would have been a real mess full of useless gameplay mechanics just for the sake of adding something new, even if it doesn't work.\n\nAt least Lara looks good, when she doesn't die.

However, do expect to rage over unfair deaths caused by the bad camera. I would probably rate it 8/10 though, as the positive really outweighs the negative in the long run.\nI would actually go so far as to say that this is THE BEST Tomb Raider game in my opinion (Tomb Raider 2013 does not count since there is no actual tomb raiding involved, and Underworld would even outshine this if not for the camera).\n\n8/10 would definitely smash huge amounts of randomly placed pots again","April 20","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not maybe the present photo realistic visual quality, but it has a charming cartoon quality to itself, that I'ld compare to the 3D animatd Star Wars TV-Shows. The gameplay itself is also very good, hindered onyl by a shacky camera, that isn't always helpful.\nBut the puzzles are all there... much more than the present TR-games.\n\nI can only recommend this as it is a fitting finale to Anniversary and Legends.

I have the other two in the trilogy - Anniversary and Legend. However, this one is for the PC, my others for PS2. To compare them:\n\nStory is best in Underworld, but also great in Legend. Anniversary I found did not have enough story, with a basic plotline, but I get it was a remake of a classic. There's always something happeneign in Underworld, cutscenes in every level. So many surprises in Underworld, and I like that it takes a darker turn.\n\nRewards are not as good. There are a larger amount of treasures to find than in Legend, but I can't remember in comparison to Anniversary (are there more in Anniversary?). The rewards are all concept art and character designs. No unlockable outfits, bringing me to ...\n\nOutfits. Smallest selection available in the trilogy. You cannot 'unlock' any, but the selection is available from the start. At each level you are given a choice of 2 - 3 outfits corresponding with the location (you can't play with winter clothes in Thailand).\n\nGraphics are amazing. I love the difference. I'm not usually one interested in graphics, but this changed me. I don't know if it's just PC vs PS2, but they helped so much for me. Seeing Amanda again with better graphics really changed the game for me. Although, seeing Lara in some scenes she looks so much older!\n\nMoves have definately been improved. Lara is able to do more with the controls. More jumps, climbs, etc. Fantastic, everywhere. She can now walk/balance on the poles you only used to swing on.\n\nWeapons are interesting. With the entire selection available from the start, unlike outfits you can use them all anywhere. They all (except her classic pistols) have limited ammo, and ammo cannot be found throughout the level.\n\nLevels are a good length as well. They are fairly restricted (corridor levels), but it's better than Legend. Longer than Legend, not as big as Anniversary.\n\nOverall, this one is my favourite. I couldn't decide between this or Legend, but this is great. The story is so intense and exciting, even though ocassionally predictable, I liked it. It tied together all loose ends, and didn't leave anything hanging. The level replay style is quite different to Legend and Anniversary becuase once you have played all levels, you revisit them exactly as you left them so there are no more enemies (except regenerative ones) and the puzzles are all already solved. This is the Treasure Hunt mode. If you want to replay a level with story as it was originally, you have to reload it from the load option within the game.  You have to play the other two first becuase the story won't make sense (although you may get away with not playing Anniversary...). There is less human fighting than Legend, but there is some. You mostly have to shoot spiders and bats. I would recommend this to any gamer, particularly if you like a good plot, action, combat, adventure, quiet solo play or Lara Croft. Only negatives would be restricted outfit selections and the rewards.","June 2","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a direct sequel from Tomb Raider: Legend and you might want to play through that game first. The graphics are better than any of the game's before it and more realistic. This game may be considered "old" in the Tomb Raider series now, but it's doesn't lack any of the great qualities Tomb Raider games have.","June 21, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
