I hope you don't like having fine control over your ship.  It makes the game vastly less enjoyable to play as a result.\n\n2) Enemy design is incredibly basic.  There's a lot of the same enemy from the last level, who flies the exact same way and shoots the exact same way, over and over, level after level.  There are even enemies that litereally do nothing but take a bunch of hits.  Nothing remotely interesting starts to show up until you've looped the game around six times.\n\n3) Weapons are dull and uninteresting.  Leveling up your shot only increases fire rate.  No shot type selection or variety to choose from.\n\n4) Color selection.  In most games of this type, certain colors are reserved for important information (such as enemy bullets), so they are always visible and clear.  The nighttime cityscape background breaks this basic design rule, as bullets and enemies blend seamlessly into the background colors.  Lucky for us enemy fire is absurdly predictable.\n\n5) Menus ignore your button config; you always have to press enter to do anything regardless of what you set for your action buttons.  Also they use blinking text to show what you are highlighting, meaning you have to wait a second just to see what you're actually selecting.\n\nIn conclusion, The Blue Flamingo has sloppy controls and uninteresting gameplay.  Not recommended.\n\nIf you're looking for good shmups on Steam, I can recommend: Crimzon Clover, Kamui, Jamestown, Alltynex 2nd, Astebreed, Danmaku Unlimited 2, Ether Vapor Remaster, RefleX, and Satazius.","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","72","76","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #27 - The Blue Flamingo\n\nPlaying The Blue Flamingo reminds me of playing old shoot 'em ups from the 80s in the arcade like Galaga or Galaxian.   Instead of having lives, your ship takes damage from every hit, and there's no way to repair that damage, so it's really a test to see how long you can dodge being hit before you eventually die.\n\nWhat sets The Blue Flamingo apart from other shooters is the presentation.  It takes a rather unique approach of using hand-crafted models for most everything, from your ship to the backgrounds.  It makes for a pretty cool art style that's not your typically cartoony art.\n\nThe music style is pretty soothing and again not something you would see in a typical shooter.  At first it really threw me off just because it's so different, but after some time I came to appreciate it.\n\nThere's a little bit of strategy in the gameplay in that as you clear each level, you get the choice of whether to spend coins upgrading your guns and bombs, or saving up your money and getting 10% interest on it when you get through the next level.  Practically speaking though, I don't think this makes a huge impact on the gameplay because your survival is really about being able to dodge things.\n\nMy main concern with the game, however, is that I don't feel it's terribly replayable.  It's just like with those arcade shoot 'em ups from the 80s, you pump in some quarters for a few games, and then you go home.  It's not really something you spend hour after hour with.  It's a shame you couldn't spend money to repair your ship because I think that would have added another layer of strategy to the game (health versus firepower), and made it more likely to get to some of the farther levels without having inhuman dodging skills.\n\nI only played half an hour and I already feel like I've seen what the game has to offer.  Sure, if I keep playing I might get a little farther and see a different enemy or background or two, but otherwise it doesn't seem like there's going to be anything else.\n\nIf you can catch this game on sale, or you just happen to be a really big fan of shoot 'em ups, then I think you'll find this game is worth picking up.  But otherwise based on my concerns I can't really recommend this one despite how cool it looks.","July 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","45","56","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/302010/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1577 products in account","The Blue Flamingo is a neat "art game" that has a unique artstyle created by actually building the terrain and all the ships in miniature and then converting photographs and video of them into the background and sprites used in the game. Somewhat defying the tendencies of "typical" art games, it's actually a shoot-'em-up, rather than a puzzle platformer or walking simulator.\n\nUnfortunately, that's around where the neatness ends - it's a fairly short score attack game, where you play through more or less the same two levels repeatedly, just getting slightly more difficult each time, with very clunky controls. The shortness in terms of content is likely due to the limitations of the artstyle, which constrained them to only having one model for the terrain because building an impressively detailed 32-foot-long model is hard and only so many models for enemies, as those too had to be hand-built and hand-painted, but the loose controls are less forgivable, as they combine with the lack of ability to restore your health to make a game where you're rewarded for playing very conservatively, which ends up feeling rather boring.\n\nIn the end, I can't really recommend The Blue Flamingo because ultimately it doesn't hold up as anything except a neat visual experience.","January 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/302010/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","Short Review of Blue Flamingo\nGameplayThis game is a simple shoot them up game, and that gameplay persists throughout the game. Unlike using the concept of "life" as in some classic series, this game use the concept of "repair level" or "damage" where each hit will damage your aircraft. Each hit can't be repaired, in line with classic shoot them up games. In addition, there are no power ups in the game, the only power up you may receive is after completing a level, where you can upgrade your weapons or bombs.\n\nThe Good of the Game Brilliant art\nThe game is handcrafted, and its shown in the game. I really love how the game is designed, and the design in the game itself. The game is not photo-realistic, but not cartoony, the art is a very good. You can see for yourself how the developers of this game create the terrains and such, it's a very good video. On how the design of the game itself is also looks very good, a perfect balance between realistic photographs and drawn animation (because the developers of this game do use their handcrafted terrain as a basis for the design of the game).\n\nI don't like the looks of the Blue Flamingo (it have too much round shapes) but I do like how the art of it. There are also interesting small details in the background of the game (trailers in the middle of mountain, trains, cars, etc.) that makes the art, even more, interesting.\n\nBrilliant music\nThe music is simply brilliant. It fits to the theme of the game, and the music is relaxed enough to be able to be easily listened.\n\nThe Bad of the Game Gameplay is Boring\nSadly, gameplay is boring. There are not much enemy types, and there are no weapon upgrades for you. You can upgrade your guns, but visually it changes nothing, you fire the same "yellow" standard gun, just the DPS is increased. You don't have "lighting blue" "spread-out red" "purple laser" weapon upgrades as in Raiden game, you only use your regular weapon from beginning to finish. The enemy is also not varied, they have the same shape, do the same tactics, over and over.  While I can understand that enemies AI could be similar, but at least the color, or the shape, of enemy between levels should be different.\n\nControl is a bit weird\nFrom my play, the default control is click to fire, but you have to use your keyboard to steer the plane, you can't use the mouse. It's weird to play like that. Some people complains about how the controls are a bit off, but I don't think the controls are problematic, just how they map it.\n\nLimited to Score Attack\nWhile I praises the game's dedication to classic shoot them up, surely they can invent something novel? Personally I am not interested just to "increase my score while getting nothing". There are no ends on this game, just grind to get the best score. No new type of bosses, no stories, nothing.\n\nAt this moment I am not recommending this game, if you see it purely from the gameplay point of view. Personally I get this game from a bundle, so price is not an issue when I purchase this game. On the other hand, this game is very cheap (under $5) and have a good art, and in my opinion, have a good developer and development team behind it.","April 6, 2015","false","0.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","18","19","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/302010/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","The Blue Flamingo is a bit of an experimental game. Not gameplay-wise but in the way it was built. You see, the game was built entirely using handcrafted models. Effects, explosions and rocket flares were all made with firecrackers and other pyrotechnics and objects like cars are being pulled forward by strings with magnets. It’s really ambitious. But does ambition automatically produce a good game ?\n\nAt its core The Blue Flamingo is a shoot ‘em up, meaning you control an aircraft that you can move across the entire screen and by pressing (and holding) a button you’ll shoot bullets (or drop a bomb) while enemies keep approaching in waves. After a few levels the speed in which these waves approach will increase and things get more hectic. If you’ve ever played a shoot ‘em up before you’ll notice the game doesn’t really reinvent the genre. Except for one thing: scoring points.\nBy killing groups of enemies successfully you’re awarded a coin that you can pick up by moving your aircraft over it. These coins act as your score.\nAt the end of each level, of which there are just two (day and night), you get the opportunity for some target practicing. Targets will move across the screen in all kinds of directions and it’s your job to hit them all. I’m not sure what happens yet if you hit them all, but I’m sure it awards you extra points or maybe even a bomb. Let it be clear that there are no boss fights in this game.\nAfter each level you can invest your collected coins to purchase upgrades (which will then lower your score with that same amount of money) or you can decide to continue without purchasing anything and then receive interest over it. So do you want to spend money on upgrades in the hope that you can earn it back or do you take the risk and hope that your current aircraft will do the trick as get you as far as you can. It can be a difficult choice, especially later on when levels get harder and harder.\nUpgrades are limited to better guns and extra bombs by the way. So you can’t make your aircraft fly faster or give it extra armor.\nIt’s an interesting concept but there aren’t any real rewards. It’s just to get a better high score. And while this might be enough for some people for me it isn’t. If you introduce a risk & reward system I want the reward to something better than just a better score. Give people new skins, different aircrafts or different guns, things like that; something to play for and something that keeps people coming back. But then again, for a small game like this it’s understandable. I just don’t think people will play it for hours and hours, which is a shame considering the amount of effort was put into creating it.\n\nI’m not going any further into the graphics, at least, not so much. Most of the things I wanted to say about it have already been said anyway. The game has a unique look, but because of the filming of the backgrounds things have become blurry, unfortunately. This was to be expected and I’m not blaming the developers here. It was an artistic choice and that should be respected.\nSounds are basic and the music doesn’t really fit the game as far as the atmosphere is concerned, but there’s nothing really wrong with it.\nAnd the controls are smooth and navigating the screen works just fine without any problems. Collision detection is also good.\n\nIn the end Might & Delight managed to give us a cute little shoot ‘em up with The Blue Flamingo. It gives us a unique choice on managing our scores but ultimately falls short because it doesn’t really offer any replay value except for the fact that you can beat other people’s high scores (or your own) on the leaderboards. A bit more variety and content rarely ever hurt a game, but for this price we can’t really complain.  Just don’t expect anything revolutionary here.\n\n[Rating: 64/100]","November 24, 2014","true","1.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","1"

That's about it really, and for asking price and what it is, I'm satisfied with it.\n\nWhat i really like about the game is the graphic style with how most of it is hand made in real life, and then recaptured to play in the game. With the graphics, the soundtrack is just fun and nice to hear, really goes well with the game's name which I find extremely amusing for some reason. The gameplay videos on Youtube doesn't do the game justice in terms of how the game actually looks like, it really does look nice.\n\nThe gameplay, the shooting itself is nothing special but it's good, it's a normal good shmup. You get bullets, missiles, and a bomb that will destroy everything on screen, where you only get one or two at first in a level. A few variety of enemies/objects to shoot at, and a few different levels (don't know how many but going to say five max). Also, I'm not sure if there's a boss to kill at a certain point as I haven't lived long enough to confirm it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNNc8H8AAo\n\nAs I mentioned in the begging, for what the game is, and it being reasonably good, I think it's well worth it and I'm happy playing it.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 21, 2014","true","0.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Don't worry about missing any of the outstanding visuals in the fray of combat, because all you have to do is sit on the bottom right corner of the screen to avoid 95% of the gameplay.\n\nThese scenes are accompanied by an original flamenco soundtrack that even amidst the chaos of battle stands out as being delightful and upbeat, yet exceedingly soothing. Again you need not worry that the nuance will be thrown out with the beat as unrelenting machine gun chatter takes focus, you can rest assured once your mouse finger begins to cramp from constantly holding down the button you will soon discover that you don't actually need to fire your weapon 95% of the time.\n\nYou must now be interested in the remaining 5%, where it would seem the cream awaits. Well the game runs out of original content long before you reach it, in fact there's only about 3 levels with unique miniatures and music, after which point you have only repeats as the level number continues to increment. This is perfect though, because there aren't any checkpoints.

Like, literally appeared on the Steam store with no prior acknowledgment to its existence, somehow having been developed in secret alongside developer Might & Delight's upcoming Shelter 2.\n\nWhat The Blue Flamingo is might be even more unexpected, that being a highscore centered shmup crafted entirely out of real handmade models. It's probably right above saxophone simulator and multiplayer only FPS on the list of games I wouldn't have envisioned coming out of such an esoteric studio, but here it is and, well, it kind of bums me out to be here writing this review.\n\nI don't mean to imply that The Blue Flamingo (let's just call it TBF from now on) is an awful game, but it's rather hard to dismiss its extremely limited design and dull construction as anything but underwhelming. Consisting of a single level (repeating indefinitely until you die, with only the lighting changing between rounds), TBF is immediately repetitive to almost sleep inducing extremes. Enemy types are few and introduced agonizingly slowly, beating you down with hundreds of the same uninteresting baddies that are only so threatening as to the unpredictable number which are forced on you at a single time.\n\nThe almost random difficulty spikes creates an annoying cycle for a game for which the only objective is obtaining as high a score as possible, removing the feeling of satisfaction that you managed to achieve a new record because of your skill, as it's possible you simply got a lucky draw early on. The pitter-patter of your ships bullets colliding with an enemy provides a rather unexciting effect of clearing a screen, feeling somewhat akin to firing a squirt gun at a paper airplane. I enjoyed watching my enemies explode as much as I typically find it entertaining when things go boom, but the actual act of causing them to combust never caused me to elicit even a marginal level of interest.\n\nThere are further issues I could touch on about TBF, like the tendency for enemies to blend into the background or how removed characters seem from what they're flying over, but I don't think it's really necessary and criticizing games made by developers I have a strong affection or is never fun. Might & Delight has always had trouble connecting their artistic visions with compelling mechanics, and that's never been more apparent than in what is easily the most gameplay driven and forgettable game they've ever made. I remain hopeful for what the studio does next, but I strongly hope it plays more to their strengths instead of some persistent, crippling weaknesses.\n\nFull disclosure: The Blue Flamingo was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.","November 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","2"

The hand crafted models and backdrop create a really memorable experience! The music is fitting and I find it quite enjoyable, the sound effects are fine (love the bomb one!). The controls are tight and fully remappable, even those on your gamepad. The game recognizes my universal gamepad without a hitch - I wish, I could say the same for all those "full controller support" AAA games on the market.\nAs a classic shoot em up, The Blue Flamingo uses a top-down view. Enemies come from the top in waves and try to shoot you down, although I have not seen any homing projectiles yet and most of the enemies just fire straight forward in a line. That's easy to dodge, if you're just trying to survive, but if you want to get a proper highscore, things can get hairy, as you try to kill as many enemies as possible. You have a bomb, that as far as I know, clears all enemies on screen, and has a significant cooldown after deployment, so use wisely!\nKilling all enemies of a wave ( usually they are all from the same type) will drop a coin on the screen, that is way more valuable (I think), than just single kills, so going for a full wave annihilation will be your top priority.\ni have only reached level 6 for now and have seen 6 different enemies + 1 flying obstacle. The different combinations of enemies, and your urge to kill them all to get the coins, create a reasonably entertaining / challenging experience.\nThe damage you sustain to your plane "The Blue Flamingo" is permanent, and, I think, all enemies do equal amounts of it.\nAt the end of each level there will be target practice for that extra burst of dosh ;) Targets will fly around without damaging you, as you try to turn them all green by shooting them. Shooting a target repeatedly will alternate it's color (red->green->red).\nThe interesting economic system for the upgrades / highscore, will make balancing your greed a tough decision, and probably will require a lot of experimentation.\nSince the game is all about the highscore, I would love to see a bigger scoreboard, as the current one only shows 5 rows on screen, but maybe that's just me.\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video, where I reach level 6 :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343853387","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

All the aircraft, missiles, laser platforms and other things you encounter are actual models, and all the explosives etc. are also made from miniature pyrotechnics. You're also flying above what looks to be model landscapes as backgrounds.\n\nThe music on the other hand is uninteresting and the soundeffects are decidedly standard, but not to the point of annoyance.\n\nThere are too few enemy variations which is perhaps understandable since everything had to be photographed from actual models but worse is that they all use the same patterns. The challenge in most shmups comes from the variance in enemies and their different patterns, here the challenge is simply increased by giving you more enemies to deal with at the same time.\n\nThat in itself is not a big issue, worse is that like any shmup, The Blue Flamingo lives and dies by the accuracy and responsiveness of its controls. That is where I have issues with this game. Controlling it with an Xbox360 controller works decently enough, but several times I got damaged or lost because I ran into a bullet or missile which I was sure I had dodged -- and I had, but the control was a little laggy in registering.\n\nThis will not be much of an issue for the first two levels or so and you might not even notice it but as soon as the sceen becomes busier, you will begin getting annoyed by how unresponsive your ship feels.\n\nIf you get this at a decent price, TBF may be worth your time if you want to check out a unique visual style, but I cannot recommend it to people looking for a serious shmup.","January 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

I just dig that handmade look, just what I also loved in The Swapper and The Dream Machine. But where as The Swapper and The Dream Machine are actually great games, with great design, The Blue Flamingo unfortunately isn't, and it's a shame, it really is. The look and the soundtrack had a great foundation, especially from athmosphere point of view, but the game and level design part fails hard. It is just boring to play, unsatisfied. I hate to be this mean with my assumptions, but to me it almost looks like the developers have not played a lot of classic shoot 'em ups, haven't got what makes those games great. The controls feel also somehow a bit off, also collision model. But those are minor gripes compared to the downright bad level design.\n\nBuy it for the art, but don't expect to enjoy it more than 10 minutes.","November 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The premise is that you are a pilot and you come to shoot some flying objects and get a high score … so you do.  It keeps it short and sweet.  Get the high score and compare it to your friends and the world on the leader board.\n\nVisuals\nThis game looks beautiful!  There are gorgeous desert landscapes that you fly over with excellent details that you probably miss as you focus on dodging bullets and missiles.  The game essentially has 2 levels; rust colored desert landscape and a dark blue night flight.  The design gives a very steam punk feel.  Almost like you are playing in the world of Lost Exile (Look it up. It is a great series.  See pic below).  All of the graphics for the bullets, ships, environment and explosions are crisp clean.  The simplistic color palette, crisp details and beautiful environments are the highlight of this game.\n\nVan Ship\n\nAudio\nThere are two soundtracks in this game.  One for each level.  They match perfectly with the overall theme.  On the rustic southwest level you have some old time guitar rifts that fit right in.  The colorful night level has a more upbeat jazz sound track that makes me continually want to dance my ship across the screen when there are no targets.  The sound effects are really crisp.  I feel like I can hear every nut and bolt ping off the rocks below.\n\nControls\nThere is not much to say about the controls in this game.  They are simplistic controls that use 1 joystick for navigation with 2 buttons to attack. They were very responsive and need to be as the game gradually progresses from simplistic shooter to bullet hell as you complete each level.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is very simplistic and also very clever.  The idea is to get the highest score which in this game is represented through money.  You collect money by shooting down aerial objects.  You also collect coins when you shoot down “teams” of targets.  You get bonus money at the end of each round by testing your skills in target practice.  All of this is pretty standard fare for a shooter.  Blue Flamingo has one caveat that makes that quest for the highest score that much more interesting.  At the end of the level, you have the option of spending your points to upgrade your weapons.  By upgrading your weapons you stand a better chance for surviving.  The problem is that you just spent a chunk of your score to have a better chance at the next level.  You also collect a small amount of interest on your money while playing.  So if you choose to improve your plane than you also choose to make less money on the points that you have already earned.  That simple twist makes this game endless fun.  It allows you to try new methods of spending your points to maximize your overall score.\n\nOverall\nI definitely give this game 4.5/5.0 Bricks.  The catchy music and beautiful environments make this simplistic shooter a joy to play as you find that perfect balance to achieve your high score.\n\nFor more go to http://brick-media.com/blue-flamingo/","November 20, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The audio is great as it doesn't distract from the game itself, the music doesn't drown out the sound effects, nor does the reverse happen, it's a great balance.\n\nAs for the controls being imprecise, grab a deck of cards guys, deal. Play it enough and you'll learn to cope, I have and I've only played maybe 45 minutes at this point. That's not to say I'm very good at it, I've never been particularly good at shmups but I like them well enough I guess, and this one I particularly enjoy.\n\nGive it a decent chance and you'll most likely enjoy it as well!","January 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

I'm not the greatest Shoot 'Em Up lover but I do like some more than others. The main formula is mostly the same in most games of the genre, so why would you buy this game?\n\nFirst thing you will notice is the beautifull handmade models. The graphics are most likely the best I've ever seen in a Shoot 'Em Up game, although in a game like this it's quite personal what you think looks good.\n\nAside from the graphics 'The Blue Flamingo' doesn't do much different from other Shooters. Kill enemies, Dodge bullets, collect coins and score points. One thing I did like is the fact you can spend the coins on either upgrades or just keep them for your overall score. Making the right decision could get you a higher or lower rank in the online leaderboards.\n\nThe worst thing about this game and obviously, the most important one is the gameplay. A shoot 'Em Up should be fluid and easy to play, yet something about the controlls is just off. Playing and configuring your controller is a pain in the ♥♥♥.   In the options menu, my controller just went nuts and it was hard to select the right options. In-Game, the controlls were pretty bad aswell, it seemed like it would skip small parts while moving around, which makes it hard to enjoy a game like this. This game is probably best played with mouse+keyboard.\n\nOverall the game looks great but the gameplay just spoiled it for me.","March 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I crashed on day 6 and I encountered 7 different enemy units. In between the days you can either upgrade your gun or the mandatory bomb cooldown for points.

The most noteworthy thing about this game are certainly the looks, which I immediately liked. You can tell a lot of work went into the landscape, effects, and models, and it looks spectacular.\n\nThere is no way to heal your ship between levels (at least as far in as I got), which makes not getting hit the most important objective and can be a bit unforgiving in the beginning. The gameplay is not unfair, however, and chiefly about skill. Apart from this, the score/coin system is a fun game mechanic: The score points are also the in-game currency. This makes for an interesting dilemma after each level, because upgrading the ship decreases your score and because you get 10% interest on your score between levels.

It reminds me of games that were bundled onto freeware 1000-in-1 CDs in the mid 90s, only not as good.\n\nThe mechanics are extremely light. You move, you shoot, you collect money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/302010/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Blue Flamingo is a game that came out of nowhere, from Might & Delight. Previous efforts being PiD and Shelter, this one yet is another addition to the unique looking games that they usually produce!\nUnfortunately, this one is by far the weakest, in terms of mechanics. It's far too limited in what it does, and tries to counter that fact by the old philosophy of "make it hard to make up for content". If you're very much into climbing leaderboards, this might be for you. Otherwise, unless you want to give it a go for the visuals alone, I'd say look elsewhere.\n\nAlso, it's NOT a bullet-hell. It's a more traditional shoot 'em up, without the level design. You have a big hitbox, and enemies don't shoot bullets in intricate patterns.\n\nContext\nFor those not aware, Blue Famingo's models, particle and soundeffects were all homemade, even the levels! (Of which there are only 2, and understandably so)\nAs an art project, it's amazing. The game ended up looking really good, but there are few technical issues that I'm inclined to believe that were due to making the game "by hand".\nNonetheless, you can probably find the photos of the development (they were free on the Humble Bundle, when this game was featured) and it's certainly interesting to see. They also have a few videos on their youtube channel.\n\nThis is clearly a passion project. Their intentions were probably to make something different and unique, although they've given little thought to the game itself, as it seems. I wanted to recommend it, but that's only possible with very big restrictions.\n\nPresentation\nThe screenshots don't make this game justice. Everything looks really good, from the models, to the lighting and the particle effects made with firecrackers... It looks really, really good! Unfortunately, while pretty to look at, it creates some important issues when it comes to making a shoot 'em up.\n\nThe music and sound effects were equally good, unsurprisingly. Retro Family are the ones behind this game's music once again, with a jazz-y lounge music approach. There are only two songs, but they didn't seem to get repetitive (although I didn't spend that long with the game). The sound effects also complement the visuals very well.\n\nEverything feels very mechanic, in a good way! It also feels almost like a realistic shmup, weirdly enough. The sound effects seem similar to the WW2 cannons, giving your plane a nice punch.\nI'd advise turning them down a bit, as they overpower the music too much. Fortunately, there are separate sliders!\n\nSo, what are the issues with the visuals?\n1.Framerate\nFor one, the 2 levels were filmed. They built the level, and they've then filmed it, from bottom to top. I'm not sure if this was a problem with the camera they've used, but the game is locked at 100 fps. This is not a smooth framerate at all! Either 60 or 120 would be great, but 100 just feels weird, clearly a problem in a shmup.\n\n2.Lighting and Explosions\nAlso, the explosions from the destroyed ships seem to make the game stutter. The effects from these explosions, while pretty, have a tendency to obsfuscate the screen, hiding enemy bullets. The same issue happens when your bullet hits an enemy's bullet. Yours explode in smoke, while theirs keep going, now hidden.\n\nAnother related problem, is that the enemies have a very similar color scheme to the background. At night, the enemies feature a small presence light, but are otherwise easily blended with the playing field. Again, it looks good, and gives it a very realistic (like) feel, but encumbers gameplay.\n\nI think this covers the issues I had with its presentation. Again, it's one of the prettiest games I can recall. But it's certainly flawed.\n\n\nGame's Structure\nThere are only two levels in this game (visually), and the field is the same. One, is during the day. The other, during the night, with all the colorful lights that come with it.\nIt's an endless score attack game, so it simply alternates between them.\nLevels have a fixed length (since the real field was only so long). You start in the hangar, with a few seconds of preparations, and then the level starts, with enemies coming. When you reach the sea, the level is ending, and there will be a "target" round for you to simply gain $$.\n\nAt the end of each level, you'll have 3 options: keep all of your money (with a 10% increase by the next level), spend it to upgrade your weapon, and spend it to buy another bomb.\nThere's no way of repairing your ship, which makes the games very short, for people who are not into these kinds of games.\n\nThat's basically it. Weapon upgrades simply increase your rate of fire, and by very small increments too.\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nIn Blue Flamingo, you just move and shoot, with the optional use of a bomb to clear the screen, when in a tight situation.\nYou have a Health Bar and can withstand a decent number of hits. Unfortunately, since you can't repair (not even between levels), you die fairly quickly, most of the time.\n\nThere are several waves of enemies (some with 3, 4, 5, etc.) and isolated enemies. When you manage to defeat a full wave before they leave the screen, they drop a coin, which gives you more $$. You also get a smaller amount of $$ per successful hit.\n\nSome enemies shoot in front, some have lasers with a slow recharge, some shot directly at you (although their bullets are destructible), and others are simply large, tanky enemies. I didn't get to feel overwhelmed, per se, since you don't have to destroy every enemy, as they leave the screen after a few seconds.\nI'm not sure how many more enemies there are, since I didn't get very far. Regardless, there doesn't seem to be very much variety.\n\nOther than that, there's a Target Practice section at the end of a nivel. Several target travel uniformely on the screen. Your job is to shoot them (from red to green), so that they leave the screen with a green color. In the end, you're given some money, depending on your performance.\n\nThere are a few other points I want to touch on.\n\nThis is an horizontal shooter, set in a vertical plane\nI never even thought about it, despite being obvious. Making an horizontal shooter in a vertical plane is an awful idea! I mean, if makes it much harder to reach enemies, and give you much lesser time to think about where to go and what to shoot. Overall, it's a bad idea. They could have simply made it a vertical shooter, but I guess the filmed level would have to be longer, which may have created issues for them...\n\nScore vs. Upgrades\nYour score is calculated on the amount of money you have, which means that you have to choose between upgrading, and just keeping your score. The upgrades get increasingly more expensive as well. The thing is, the upgrades are so minimal, that it's almost set in stone that you'll do much better by simply keeping your money. As it is, it makes the game even more repetitive.\nI like the idea, but it doesn't seem very finely tuned.\n\nVery bland mechanics\nThis is another big issue. You shoot your cannons if front (left and right, alternated) and occasionally some missiles. The upgrades simply increase your rate of fire. There's nothing else to it... It's way too barebones, for me. There could be powerups, or perhaps different weapons to keep the variety up a bit more, but there's nothing.\nMaybe some people are into that, but I thought the game got stale too quickly, for me.\n\n\nI don't think there's much more to say. It works, more or less, but provides nothing noteworthy as a game. This was clearly a sideproject for the team, focusing more on the fun of making it than the experience and game as a whole. And to be honest... that's fine. It's good that some companies do that, but wait for a sale.\n\nJust know what you're getting into!","January 9, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perhaps the MOST honest appraisal will be a the result of discussing TBF AS a new player, updating as my experience grows. (My considerably longer offline play is NOT calculated.)\nTBF is quite possibly the MOST beautiful game I've played. My understanding is that the DEVS actually built physical aircraft models, and it shows. It's a fairly small game, so great care can be applied throughout at reasonable cost. What I don't understand is how the beauty of the landscapes matches the beauty of the planes. It is BETTER than photo-real because of the artistic touches applied. The colors are SO vibrant, the explosions so realistic. The night skies, the desert landscape, the cars passing below all add SO MUCH to the game.\nAdmittedly, my first impression was "Great. Like I NEED another PONG....". And in a very broad sense that's what it is. They come at you, you shoot at them as you move from side to side and front to back. BUT.....\nThe Blue Flamingo is a fairly hard game (so far, for me), and if there are hints or instructions, I haven't found them. I've made it as far as level 3, shot down over 1,500 craft, and I still DON'T even have a score! I don't know how far I'll have to get to be able to regain health, but until I do I'll be crashing ad infinitum. So far, goal #1 is MAINTAIN HEALTH! But simply avoiding bullets and explosions won't do, and wouldn't be much fun. (Blowing up a plane in close proximity=BAD NEWS.) What's obtained as enemy(?) craft are shot down are points (as money) and coins to be grabbed swiftly resulting from special... somethings. At the end of levels they can be exchanged for guns or bombs, but not health. At least not as of Level 3. Money NOT exchanged increases according to the interest rate, a feature new to me, and possibly an intriquing twist yet to be explored.\nThe variety of planes (or whatever term might best be applied to the aircraft) and their movements makes it almost seem as though they convey personalities, and THAT'S what elevates this far beyond PONG type arcade games. I expected to be bored after 2 minutes. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Between the bullets, the screen-clearing (and limited) bombs, the new enemy craft and weapon varieties on each level, and the end-of-level target practice, player skills can be felt growing with each attempt.\n(I've had no experience with the control issues I've read of.)\nHopefully to be continued....\n(Be aware that I'm using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine the game would be even more interesting with a more appropriate controller, such as XBOX. Hopefully I'll report on that as well.)\n(4JJ)","January 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Just... an all around pass.\n\nI am one of those people that think a 50/100 score means that a game is average, and that there's nothing wrong with that. That would make this game 8 points below average, and I think it deserves to lose every single one of those points, if not more.\n\nThis game is below average in every single regard. The graphics are the type of low-res CGI-esque stuff you would see in the early 2000s, the music (while not offensive) is typical elevator-fare muzak, the sounds are generic and forgettable at best, the enemies and levels feel completely copy-pasted, there is no urgency to the game at all, and the controls are TERRIBLY floaty and loose (even with a controller).\n\nPlus, one of this game's only options is that it lets you set 16:10 resolutions (1920x1200, for example), but it doesn't actually SUPPORT those resolutions; it zooms in on the entire 16:9 frame and cuts off the sides (including some text). Why even bother putting that in there?\n\nWhen games are decent, they can still be enjoyable, and it's even possible for games to be so terrible that they're fun. This game, however, falls prey to the cardinal sin of gaming: Being completely colorless, and so average that they're boring. There is nothing worse than a game that accomplishes nothing but helping you while away hours of your life until bedtime. I'm not lying when I say that I'd rather spend the time organizing my Steam backlog into categories than playing this game.\n\nIn case it's not clear, I would recommend playing every other shmup first. You could certainly force yourself to play through this game, but why would you? It is just straight-up not fun, and so many other shoot-em-ups actually ARE.","January 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

However I also have come to appreciate that their products often lack a certain detail or orchestration which seperates a good game from a great game.\n\nThere are a LOT of negative reviews to this game which I simply do not concur with. Most of them are aimed at control response. Having used a controller myself I found no such issues and if there ever was controller issues, they seemed to have been fixed.\n\nThe second major complaint is replayability, this critique actually has some weight behind it. The problem is that it takes too long to raise up the ranks again and the game never changes. Not many people have that much time to dedicate to a game like this and there is no saves, ability to repair ship or kept upgrades which allows a gamer to explore the later levels more easily or quicker. So for many it feels like there's a Lot to the game which they have paid good money for which they will never get to enjoy or experience.\n\nThis top down shooter requires you to traverse the same 32 feet beautiful model of a landscaped town over and over again raising the ranks and alternating between night and day. Each level prsents more or new enemies. Your simple clunky ship known as the blue famingo has two weapons available. Simply normal fire which can be upgraded for more quicker fire and you have infinite bombs which reload capability can be quickened through upgrades after each level. You will immediately start to earn 10% each level for any money unspent meaning it might be in your best interest to save the money for a few levels and rely on some skillful dodging and selection of which enemies you blow up and which ones you leave.\n\nYou also get rewarded coins for any collections of enemies you take down. For instance if you come across a flight of 3 enemies in close formation and you blow up all three, then you will recieve an additional reward of a coin you need to collect before it disappears,  if you blow up only two of them you do not. On top of all this each level is seperated by a target practice session where the object is to turn all the flying discs that are red to green and if they are already green to leave them. Here your bombs can also help. Each disc you get right your rewarded with $100.00 .\n\nPersonally I have finished level 12 and did not discover any new enemies after level 9, instead it just challenged me with more of them. I have messaged developers requesting any information if there are greater enemies after this but no one has replied, so in all honesty level 10 may be all that this game has to really offer. For those that want to challenge themselves by raising their ranks through the high score will be greeted by scores off this planet thanks to cheaters. Hence very little replayability for the honest gamer here.\n\nStill its a decent game which I have enjoyed. Presented well but the mechanics lack that certain finesse which rewards some people from thinking that they have got all their monies worth from this game. Still recommended by me nevertheless... Why? Me level 12, my room mate level 4. I never let him live it down...\n\nhttp://mightanddelight.com/the-blue-flamingo/","December 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

As it stands, I would be really disappointed if I had paid full price. As part of the humble bundle, for $.50, I'm not that mad. But for an arcade shoot-em-up with only one background music track and a super linear set of upgrades that evaporate upon death, $.50 is pushing it.  No way to heal/repair between stages... all stages are almost identical.\nThe art is great and the one music track is a good loop, but that can't carry a game IMO.

If you die you lose all progress of all levels. And guess what, there is no healing or way to restore health......yes they were that stupid in game design.

So, I can't critique The Blue Flamingo based purely on its performance compared to other games in its genre. However, what I can say is this:\nThe Blue Flamingo has an interesting aesthetic, a neat soundtrack, and is mildly fun to play. Unfortunately its biggest problem is a lack of any variety. There are two levels, which are virtually identical save for one being during the day and the other during night; these same two levels are repeated over and over again. There isn't a wide variety of enemies either - just the same handful being thrown at you in increasing frequency and numbers as you progress. Furthermore, the soundtrack, albeit nice and fitting of the aesthetic, also lacks in variety. This is all very unfortunate, because the game is fun, but it's far too repetitive to be fun for very long. Ultimately, unless you get it at a discount or in a bundle, I can't recommend this game - there's just not enough to it to warrant the price.\n\nTLDR; Interesting game, cool aesthetic, mildly fun, but too repetitive and lacking too much variety to recommend.","January 7, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, what I can say is this:\nThe Blue Flamingo has an interesting aesthetic, a neat soundtrack, and is mildly fun to play. Unfortunately its biggest problem is a lack of any variety.

If I had paid full price this would be a thumbs down review. The game looks beautiful, the music is relaxing, tasty and a bit old-school (you'd have to hear it). Where things fall apart a bit is in the controls and the UI.\n\nIt's an amazingly beautiful game, and the soundtrack's very nice as well (kind of relaxing and charming, strangely enough - without being boring). The backgrounds look like they're hand-painted.\n\nController use is a bit wonky, but I can reassign those as others have suggested (and the fire buttons to something my fingers would expect). X fires bullets, B fires bombs. I suppose I could change this to A and B, or right trigger left trigger? One user's suggested mapping movements to the digital stick. That'd probably make me less likely to damage my controller while playing it...\n\nThe most annoying quirk the game has is the main menu's UI. After you die, it drops you back to this screen, where it defaults to highlighting the Options key. This seems like a rather odd choice, as once you've got that bit settled you really don't want to go in there. With the controller bieng as "jumpy" as it can be, I've actually exited the game accidentally a time or two.\n\nAside from everything else, the game needs a way to fine-tune the stick's reactivity. I may want to try playing this with keyboard and mouse, I can't believe I just said that...","January 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not played far enough to say if that variation per level continues with some randomised algorithm or if that too goes back to the beginning after a surprisingly short period.\n\nEven at a couple bucks in a sale, I was disappointed by the lack of content the devs seem to have put in; the quality is quite nice (main menu interface is not very honed) but there's very little of it. From a gameplay perspective - if this hasn't been patched - the inability to repair your shields with money between levels seems just a wrong choice.\n\nI also had technical problems on first install where the scrolling and music stuttered, until I moved the game files from HD to RAMdisk.\n\nJust because the levels don't change, it's vertical scrolling and quite slow paced, I can see myself playing this again. But if you can cope with sideways scrolling instead of vertical and want what this trailer looks like but moreso, I recommend Platypus for same idea, more content +did it first.","January 20, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't recommend it regardless.\n\nStory\nNon-existent, besides a few lines explaining why you fly your plane and why you shoot stuff coming at you.\n\nGraphics\nNice, but repetitive. All the objects in the game were conceived using real-life models. It looks neat, but you only get two levels (so far as I've seen), and the only difference is you play them at various times of the day, and under different weather conditions. I may be mistaken, but in that case the levels all look alike. Aircraft and enemy models also lack variety and become extremely repetitive.\n\nSound\nProbably the only saving grace of this game. The soundtrack is fantastic, if you like the kind of easy-going rock music. But since the soundtrack has only 2 songs and is 7 minutes long in total, it's not really worth getting the game for (at least not at the regular price).\n\nGameplay\nLaggy. Boring. You can forget about precision-controlling your plane. You want to squeeze just in between those tow parallel shots the enemy sent at you? Well, you're gonna get hit. There's a slight lag in response time when you press the button, and the there's a slight delay when you release the button. The movement is kinda floaty.\n\nOther than that, you gain money by beating levels, you buy one of the two available upgrades: a machine gun, and a bomb. Can't say I saw much of a difference after upgrading the MG a few times. And there's all there really is to this game.\n\nConclusion:\nHalf an hour of this game, and I had enough. The only time I recommend buying it is in a bundle, and then only if you get the soundtrack alongside it.\n\n\n\n","January 4, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, my poor skill level doesn't make it a bad game.\n\nBlue Flamingo's game assets are beautiful. The people behind the modeling & music are to be commended.\n\nThe game itself is not terrible, but there's not a lot to it. Overall Blue Flamingo is an alright Atari-esque shoot'em up(only goal is high score). With a little bit of a gambling gimick(bank points? or spend them on upgrades?). The people that are claiming the controls are terrible are just heavy on their thumbs. The controls ARE sensitive. The ship will move, when you touch the stick. If you touch the stick TOO HARD, your ship is going to move TOO FAST. After a few runs you will get used to it.\n\nI don't think a lot of people will stay around & play this as a long term game. Blue Flamingo doesn't offer a ton of replayability unless you're the type that can rack up a massive score & enjoy defending it. To the mediocre of us, there's not a lot of point.\n\nI do recommend this if it's on discount. However at $4.99 the gamer isn't getting their money's worth. I feel like crap saying this.

I thought my game was glitched at first because the third level looked the same as the first level, but it turns out that there are only 2 levels in the game (at least in the first 6 or 7 rounds). The game adds new enemies but are nothing special and take about as long to kill as the starting enemies. Another issue is that there are only 2 upgrades you can buy and really don't feel like they do much of anything. I felt like it took as long to kill the enemies I fought in the start no matter how much I upgraded the gun (which doesn't change appearance).

The game consists of 1 ship, 3 weapons, 5 enemies, 2 (short) stages, and 1 soundtrack.  For the Shmup genre, this is really barren.\n\nWhat IS in the game is really nice... the level and sound design are fun and casual, and make playing the first few levels very enjoyable.  If you are looking for depth and complexity, you wont find it here (but they really don't advertise it).\n\nThere are some game design tropes that are missing... things like a small hit box, very visible bullets, or boss battles are painful in their absence.\n\nI'm recommending this game because it owns what it is: a fun, casual way to blow 20 minutes for $5","April 10, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you get past level 2 you have seen everything\n- embarrassing controls: the game difficulty is not in the mechanics, but in how awkward it is to pilot your ship\n- horrible gameplay: you get money for the kills, but you get to use them only for extra firepower and bombs (no repairs, for instance). It looks as if they where trying to hide how short the game is by making it more difficutl than it needs to be.\n\nNow, I understand how difficult it must be to put together a game with digitized contents, but on the other side, but this game is an embarassment (even more so after I played "The Swapper").\n\nIt would be worth 1-2E top, but for the current price tag, it's a fraud (good thing I got it in a bundle with better games in it...)","April 4","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the background wasn't particularly striking (in that I didn't notice it much while playing). The scolling was jerky and there wasn't enough variety between levels.\n\nI didn't like the way the ship handled, the aiming was annoying because the bullets came from your wings when you first shoot but switch to firing from the nose of the ship if you hold the fire button down. The bullet hit box was too narrow which made aiming harder. This might improve when you upgrade the ship enough, but I didn't feel compelled to do so.\n\nIf an update is made I will try the game again, because as I said I do want to like this. I wish the developers success because I would like to see more games made of graphics with real-world elements.","April 15","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hope you don't like having fine control over your ship.  It makes the game vastly less enjoyable to play as a result.\n\n2) Enemy design is incredibly basic.  There's a lot of the same enemy from the last level, who flies the exact same way and shoots the exact same way, over and over, level after level.  There are even enemies that litereally do nothing but take a bunch of hits.  Nothing remotely interesting starts to show up until you've looped the game around six times.\n\n3) Weapons are dull and uninteresting.  Leveling up your shot only increases fire rate.  No shot type selection or variety to choose from.\n\n4) Color selection.  In most games of this type, certain colors are reserved for important information (such as enemy bullets), so they are always visible and clear.  The nighttime cityscape background breaks this basic design rule, as bullets and enemies blend seamlessly into the background colors.  Lucky for us enemy fire is absurdly predictable.\n\n5) Menus ignore your button config; you always have to press enter to do anything regardless of what you set for your action buttons.  Also they use blinking text to show what you are highlighting, meaning you have to wait a second just to see what you're actually selecting.\n\nIn conclusion, The Blue Flamingo has sloppy controls and uninteresting gameplay.  Not recommended.\n\nIf you're looking for good shmups on Steam, I can recommend: Crimzon Clover, Kamui, Jamestown, Alltynex 2nd, Astebreed, Danmaku Unlimited 2, Ether Vapor Remaster, RefleX, and Satazius.","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","72","76","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #27 - The Blue Flamingo\n\nPlaying The Blue Flamingo reminds me of playing old shoot 'em ups from the 80s in the arcade like Galaga or Galaxian.   Instead of having lives, your ship takes damage from every hit, and there's no way to repair that damage, so it's really a test to see how long you can dodge being hit before you eventually die.\n\nWhat sets The Blue Flamingo apart from other shooters is the presentation.  It takes a rather unique approach of using hand-crafted models for most everything, from your ship to the backgrounds.  It makes for a pretty cool art style that's not your typically cartoony art.\n\nThe music style is pretty soothing and again not something you would see in a typical shooter.  At first it really threw me off just because it's so different, but after some time I came to appreciate it.\n\nThere's a little bit of strategy in the gameplay in that as you clear each level, you get the choice of whether to spend coins upgrading your guns and bombs, or saving up your money and getting 10% interest on it when you get through the next level.  Practically speaking though, I don't think this makes a huge impact on the gameplay because your survival is really about being able to dodge things.\n\nMy main concern with the game, however, is that I don't feel it's terribly replayable.  It's just like with those arcade shoot 'em ups from the 80s, you pump in some quarters for a few games, and then you go home.  It's not really something you spend hour after hour with.  It's a shame you couldn't spend money to repair your ship because I think that would have added another layer of strategy to the game (health versus firepower), and made it more likely to get to some of the farther levels without having inhuman dodging skills.\n\nI only played half an hour and I already feel like I've seen what the game has to offer.  Sure, if I keep playing I might get a little farther and see a different enemy or background or two, but otherwise it doesn't seem like there's going to be anything else.\n\nIf you can catch this game on sale, or you just happen to be a really big fan of shoot 'em ups, then I think you'll find this game is worth picking up.  But otherwise based on my concerns I can't really recommend this one despite how cool it looks.","July 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","45","56","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/302010/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1577 products in account","The Blue Flamingo is a neat "art game" that has a unique artstyle created by actually building the terrain and all the ships in miniature and then converting photographs and video of them into the background and sprites used in the game. Somewhat defying the tendencies of "typical" art games, it's actually a shoot-'em-up, rather than a puzzle platformer or walking simulator.\n\nUnfortunately, that's around where the neatness ends - it's a fairly short score attack game, where you play through more or less the same two levels repeatedly, just getting slightly more difficult each time, with very clunky controls. The shortness in terms of content is likely due to the limitations of the artstyle, which constrained them to only having one model for the terrain because building an impressively detailed 32-foot-long model is hard and only so many models for enemies, as those too had to be hand-built and hand-painted, but the loose controls are less forgivable, as they combine with the lack of ability to restore your health to make a game where you're rewarded for playing very conservatively, which ends up feeling rather boring.\n\nIn the end, I can't really recommend The Blue Flamingo because ultimately it doesn't hold up as anything except a neat visual experience.","January 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/302010/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","Short Review of Blue Flamingo\nGameplayThis game is a simple shoot them up game, and that gameplay persists throughout the game. Unlike using the concept of "life" as in some classic series, this game use the concept of "repair level" or "damage" where each hit will damage your aircraft. Each hit can't be repaired, in line with classic shoot them up games. In addition, there are no power ups in the game, the only power up you may receive is after completing a level, where you can upgrade your weapons or bombs.\n\nThe Good of the Game Brilliant art\nThe game is handcrafted, and its shown in the game. I really love how the game is designed, and the design in the game itself. The game is not photo-realistic, but not cartoony, the art is a very good. You can see for yourself how the developers of this game create the terrains and such, it's a very good video. On how the design of the game itself is also looks very good, a perfect balance between realistic photographs and drawn animation (because the developers of this game do use their handcrafted terrain as a basis for the design of the game).\n\nI don't like the looks of the Blue Flamingo (it have too much round shapes) but I do like how the art of it. There are also interesting small details in the background of the game (trailers in the middle of mountain, trains, cars, etc.) that makes the art, even more, interesting.\n\nBrilliant music\nThe music is simply brilliant. It fits to the theme of the game, and the music is relaxed enough to be able to be easily listened.\n\nThe Bad of the Game Gameplay is Boring\nSadly, gameplay is boring. There are not much enemy types, and there are no weapon upgrades for you. You can upgrade your guns, but visually it changes nothing, you fire the same "yellow" standard gun, just the DPS is increased. You don't have "lighting blue" "spread-out red" "purple laser" weapon upgrades as in Raiden game, you only use your regular weapon from beginning to finish. The enemy is also not varied, they have the same shape, do the same tactics, over and over.  While I can understand that enemies AI could be similar, but at least the color, or the shape, of enemy between levels should be different.\n\nControl is a bit weird\nFrom my play, the default control is click to fire, but you have to use your keyboard to steer the plane, you can't use the mouse. It's weird to play like that. Some people complains about how the controls are a bit off, but I don't think the controls are problematic, just how they map it.\n\nLimited to Score Attack\nWhile I praises the game's dedication to classic shoot them up, surely they can invent something novel? Personally I am not interested just to "increase my score while getting nothing". There are no ends on this game, just grind to get the best score. No new type of bosses, no stories, nothing.\n\nAt this moment I am not recommending this game, if you see it purely from the gameplay point of view. Personally I get this game from a bundle, so price is not an issue when I purchase this game. On the other hand, this game is very cheap (under $5) and have a good art, and in my opinion, have a good developer and development team behind it.","April 6, 2015","false","0.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","18","19","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/302010/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","The Blue Flamingo is a bit of an experimental game. Not gameplay-wise but in the way it was built. You see, the game was built entirely using handcrafted models. Effects, explosions and rocket flares were all made with firecrackers and other pyrotechnics and objects like cars are being pulled forward by strings with magnets. It’s really ambitious. But does ambition automatically produce a good game ?\n\nAt its core The Blue Flamingo is a shoot ‘em up, meaning you control an aircraft that you can move across the entire screen and by pressing (and holding) a button you’ll shoot bullets (or drop a bomb) while enemies keep approaching in waves. After a few levels the speed in which these waves approach will increase and things get more hectic. If you’ve ever played a shoot ‘em up before you’ll notice the game doesn’t really reinvent the genre. Except for one thing: scoring points.\nBy killing groups of enemies successfully you’re awarded a coin that you can pick up by moving your aircraft over it. These coins act as your score.\nAt the end of each level, of which there are just two (day and night), you get the opportunity for some target practicing. Targets will move across the screen in all kinds of directions and it’s your job to hit them all. I’m not sure what happens yet if you hit them all, but I’m sure it awards you extra points or maybe even a bomb. Let it be clear that there are no boss fights in this game.\nAfter each level you can invest your collected coins to purchase upgrades (which will then lower your score with that same amount of money) or you can decide to continue without purchasing anything and then receive interest over it. So do you want to spend money on upgrades in the hope that you can earn it back or do you take the risk and hope that your current aircraft will do the trick as get you as far as you can. It can be a difficult choice, especially later on when levels get harder and harder.\nUpgrades are limited to better guns and extra bombs by the way. So you can’t make your aircraft fly faster or give it extra armor.\nIt’s an interesting concept but there aren’t any real rewards. It’s just to get a better high score. And while this might be enough for some people for me it isn’t. If you introduce a risk & reward system I want the reward to something better than just a better score. Give people new skins, different aircrafts or different guns, things like that; something to play for and something that keeps people coming back. But then again, for a small game like this it’s understandable. I just don’t think people will play it for hours and hours, which is a shame considering the amount of effort was put into creating it.\n\nI’m not going any further into the graphics, at least, not so much. Most of the things I wanted to say about it have already been said anyway. The game has a unique look, but because of the filming of the backgrounds things have become blurry, unfortunately. This was to be expected and I’m not blaming the developers here. It was an artistic choice and that should be respected.\nSounds are basic and the music doesn’t really fit the game as far as the atmosphere is concerned, but there’s nothing really wrong with it.\nAnd the controls are smooth and navigating the screen works just fine without any problems. Collision detection is also good.\n\nIn the end Might & Delight managed to give us a cute little shoot ‘em up with The Blue Flamingo. It gives us a unique choice on managing our scores but ultimately falls short because it doesn’t really offer any replay value except for the fact that you can beat other people’s high scores (or your own) on the leaderboards. A bit more variety and content rarely ever hurt a game, but for this price we can’t really complain.  Just don’t expect anything revolutionary here.\n\n[Rating: 64/100]","November 24, 2014","true","1.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","1"

That's about it really, and for asking price and what it is, I'm satisfied with it.\n\nWhat i really like about the game is the graphic style with how most of it is hand made in real life, and then recaptured to play in the game. With the graphics, the soundtrack is just fun and nice to hear, really goes well with the game's name which I find extremely amusing for some reason. The gameplay videos on Youtube doesn't do the game justice in terms of how the game actually looks like, it really does look nice.\n\nThe gameplay, the shooting itself is nothing special but it's good, it's a normal good shmup. You get bullets, missiles, and a bomb that will destroy everything on screen, where you only get one or two at first in a level. A few variety of enemies/objects to shoot at, and a few different levels (don't know how many but going to say five max).

Again you need not worry that the nuance will be thrown out with the beat as unrelenting machine gun chatter takes focus, you can rest assured once your mouse finger begins to cramp from constantly holding down the button you will soon discover that you don't actually need to fire your weapon 95% of the time.\n\nYou must now be interested in the remaining 5%, where it would seem the cream awaits.

Like, literally appeared on the Steam store with no prior acknowledgment to its existence, somehow having been developed in secret alongside developer Might & Delight's upcoming Shelter 2.\n\nWhat The Blue Flamingo is might be even more unexpected, that being a highscore centered shmup crafted entirely out of real handmade models. It's probably right above saxophone simulator and multiplayer only FPS on the list of games I wouldn't have envisioned coming out of such an esoteric studio, but here it is and, well, it kind of bums me out to be here writing this review.\n\nI don't mean to imply that The Blue Flamingo (let's just call it TBF from now on) is an awful game, but it's rather hard to dismiss its extremely limited design and dull construction as anything but underwhelming. Consisting of a single level (repeating indefinitely until you die, with only the lighting changing between rounds), TBF is immediately repetitive to almost sleep inducing extremes. Enemy types are few and introduced agonizingly slowly, beating you down with hundreds of the same uninteresting baddies that are only so threatening as to the unpredictable number which are forced on you at a single time.\n\nThe almost random difficulty spikes creates an annoying cycle for a game for which the only objective is obtaining as high a score as possible, removing the feeling of satisfaction that you managed to achieve a new record because of your skill, as it's possible you simply got a lucky draw early on. The pitter-patter of your ships bullets colliding with an enemy provides a rather unexciting effect of clearing a screen, feeling somewhat akin to firing a squirt gun at a paper airplane. I enjoyed watching my enemies explode as much as I typically find it entertaining when things go boom, but the actual act of causing them to combust never caused me to elicit even a marginal level of interest.\n\nThere are further issues I could touch on about TBF, like the tendency for enemies to blend into the background or how removed characters seem from what they're flying over, but I don't think it's really necessary and criticizing games made by developers I have a strong affection or is never fun. Might & Delight has always had trouble connecting their artistic visions with compelling mechanics, and that's never been more apparent than in what is easily the most gameplay driven and forgettable game they've ever made. I remain hopeful for what the studio does next, but I strongly hope it plays more to their strengths instead of some persistent, crippling weaknesses.\n\nFull disclosure: The Blue Flamingo was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.","November 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","2"

The hand crafted models and backdrop create a really memorable experience! The music is fitting and I find it quite enjoyable, the sound effects are fine (love the bomb one!). The controls are tight and fully remappable, even those on your gamepad. The game recognizes my universal gamepad without a hitch - I wish, I could say the same for all those "full controller support" AAA games on the market.\nAs a classic shoot em up, The Blue Flamingo uses a top-down view. Enemies come from the top in waves and try to shoot you down, although I have not seen any homing projectiles yet and most of the enemies just fire straight forward in a line. That's easy to dodge, if you're just trying to survive, but if you want to get a proper highscore, things can get hairy, as you try to kill as many enemies as possible. You have a bomb, that as far as I know, clears all enemies on screen, and has a significant cooldown after deployment, so use wisely!\nKilling all enemies of a wave ( usually they are all from the same type) will drop a coin on the screen, that is way more valuable (I think), than just single kills, so going for a full wave annihilation will be your top priority.\ni have only reached level 6 for now and have seen 6 different enemies + 1 flying obstacle. The different combinations of enemies, and your urge to kill them all to get the coins, create a reasonably entertaining / challenging experience.\nThe damage you sustain to your plane "The Blue Flamingo" is permanent, and, I think, all enemies do equal amounts of it.\nAt the end of each level there will be target practice for that extra burst of dosh ;) Targets will fly around without damaging you, as you try to turn them all green by shooting them. Shooting a target repeatedly will alternate it's color (red->green->red).\nThe interesting economic system for the upgrades / highscore, will make balancing your greed a tough decision, and probably will require a lot of experimentation.\nSince the game is all about the highscore, I would love to see a bigger scoreboard, as the current one only shows 5 rows on screen, but maybe that's just me.\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video, where I reach level 6 :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343853387","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

All the aircraft, missiles, laser platforms and other things you encounter are actual models, and all the explosives etc. are also made from miniature pyrotechnics. You're also flying above what looks to be model landscapes as backgrounds.\n\nThe music on the other hand is uninteresting and the soundeffects are decidedly standard, but not to the point of annoyance.\n\nThere are too few enemy variations which is perhaps understandable since everything had to be photographed from actual models but worse is that they all use the same patterns. The challenge in most shmups comes from the variance in enemies and their different patterns, here the challenge is simply increased by giving you more enemies to deal with at the same time.\n\nThat in itself is not a big issue, worse is that like any shmup, The Blue Flamingo lives and dies by the accuracy and responsiveness of its controls. That is where I have issues with this game. Controlling it with an Xbox360 controller works decently enough, but several times I got damaged or lost because I ran into a bullet or missile which I was sure I had dodged -- and I had, but the control was a little laggy in registering.\n\nThis will not be much of an issue for the first two levels or so and you might not even notice it but as soon as the sceen becomes busier, you will begin getting annoyed by how unresponsive your ship feels.\n\nIf you get this at a decent price, TBF may be worth your time if you want to check out a unique visual style, but I cannot recommend it to people looking for a serious shmup.","January 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

I just dig that handmade look, just what I also loved in The Swapper and The Dream Machine. But where as The Swapper and The Dream Machine are actually great games, with great design, The Blue Flamingo unfortunately isn't, and it's a shame, it really is. The look and the soundtrack had a great foundation, especially from athmosphere point of view, but the game and level design part fails hard. It is just boring to play, unsatisfied. I hate to be this mean with my assumptions, but to me it almost looks like the developers have not played a lot of classic shoot 'em ups, haven't got what makes those games great. The controls feel also somehow a bit off, also collision model. But those are minor gripes compared to the downright bad level design.\n\nBuy it for the art, but don't expect to enjoy it more than 10 minutes.","November 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The premise is that you are a pilot and you come to shoot some flying objects and get a high score … so you do.  It keeps it short and sweet.  Get the high score and compare it to your friends and the world on the leader board.\n\nVisuals\nThis game looks beautiful!  There are gorgeous desert landscapes that you fly over with excellent details that you probably miss as you focus on dodging bullets and missiles.  The game essentially has 2 levels; rust colored desert landscape and a dark blue night flight.  The design gives a very steam punk feel.  Almost like you are playing in the world of Lost Exile (Look it up. It is a great series.  See pic below).  All of the graphics for the bullets, ships, environment and explosions are crisp clean.  The simplistic color palette, crisp details and beautiful environments are the highlight of this game.\n\nVan Ship\n\nAudio\nThere are two soundtracks in this game.  One for each level.  They match perfectly with the overall theme.  On the rustic southwest level you have some old time guitar rifts that fit right in.  The colorful night level has a more upbeat jazz sound track that makes me continually want to dance my ship across the screen when there are no targets.  The sound effects are really crisp.  I feel like I can hear every nut and bolt ping off the rocks below.\n\nControls\nThere is not much to say about the controls in this game.  They are simplistic controls that use 1 joystick for navigation with 2 buttons to attack. They were very responsive and need to be as the game gradually progresses from simplistic shooter to bullet hell as you complete each level.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is very simplistic and also very clever.  The idea is to get the highest score which in this game is represented through money.  You collect money by shooting down aerial objects.  You also collect coins when you shoot down “teams” of targets.  You get bonus money at the end of each round by testing your skills in target practice.  All of this is pretty standard fare for a shooter.  Blue Flamingo has one caveat that makes that quest for the highest score that much more interesting.  At the end of the level, you have the option of spending your points to upgrade your weapons.  By upgrading your weapons you stand a better chance for surviving.  The problem is that you just spent a chunk of your score to have a better chance at the next level.  You also collect a small amount of interest on your money while playing.  So if you choose to improve your plane than you also choose to make less money on the points that you have already earned.  That simple twist makes this game endless fun.  It allows you to try new methods of spending your points to maximize your overall score.\n\nOverall\nI definitely give this game 4.5/5.0 Bricks.  The catchy music and beautiful environments make this simplistic shooter a joy to play as you find that perfect balance to achieve your high score.\n\nFor more go to http://brick-media.com/blue-flamingo/","November 20, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm not the greatest Shoot 'Em Up lover but I do like some more than others. The main formula is mostly the same in most games of the genre, so why would you buy this game?\n\nFirst thing you will notice is the beautifull handmade models. The graphics are most likely the best I've ever seen in a Shoot 'Em Up game, although in a game like this it's quite personal what you think looks good.\n\nAside from the graphics 'The Blue Flamingo' doesn't do much different from other Shooters. Kill enemies, Dodge bullets, collect coins and score points. One thing I did like is the fact you can spend the coins on either upgrades or just keep them for your overall score. Making the right decision could get you a higher or lower rank in the online leaderboards.\n\nThe worst thing about this game and obviously, the most important one is the gameplay. A shoot 'Em Up should be fluid and easy to play, yet something about the controlls is just off. Playing and configuring your controller is a pain in the ♥♥♥.   In the options menu, my controller just went nuts and it was hard to select the right options. In-Game, the controlls were pretty bad aswell, it seemed like it would skip small parts while moving around, which makes it hard to enjoy a game like this. This game is probably best played with mouse+keyboard.\n\nOverall the game looks great but the gameplay just spoiled it for me.","March 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The audio is great as it doesn't distract from the game itself, the music doesn't drown out the sound effects, nor does the reverse happen, it's a great balance.\n\nAs for the controls being imprecise, grab a deck of cards guys, deal.

Invest your score in upgrades, or save it to gain interest with the risk of losing it all.  - Very Highly Recommended!","November 21, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The handcrafted models idea is cool but the few levels I played were rather bland visually.\n\nGameplay-wise, a really boring shoot'em up.  I mean really boring.  Enemy attack patterns and placement were uninspired, simple, and very easy to deal with.  Controls felt slightly floaty and the game committed probably the biggest design no-no for a shoot'em up, that being your shots coming across as very weak and piddly.  There's no sense of satisfaction from blowing stuff up and for a genre built around the satisfaction of blowing stuff up, having such a wimpy default shot is a gamebreaker.\n\nKind of hard to figure what the audience of this was.  The shoot'em up elements are very simple and easy and won't satisfy most shoot'em up fans and the boring gameplay won't draw in casual fans of the genre and the visual design is disappointing.\n\nDefinitely a pass.","January 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The most noteworthy thing about this game are certainly the looks, which I immediately liked. You can tell a lot of work went into the landscape, effects, and models, and it looks spectacular.\n\nThere is no way to heal your ship between levels (at least as far in as I got), which makes not getting hit the most important objective and can be a bit unforgiving in the beginning. The gameplay is not unfair, however, and chiefly about skill. Apart from this, the score/coin system is a fun game mechanic: The score points are also the in-game currency. This makes for an interesting dilemma after each level, because upgrading the ship decreases your score and because you get 10% interest on your score between levels. The keyboard and mouse controls are spot-on, no complaints here, although a gamepad might work even better.","January 11, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The photographs used to make the sprites and backgrounds must not have been particularly high-res, as had I not been told it was stop-motion, I would have just assumed it was ugly. It reminds me of games that were bundled onto freeware 1000-in-1 CDs in the mid 90s, only not as good.\n\nThe mechanics are extremely light. You move, you shoot, you collect money. That sounds reductive but it really is as basic as a shmup can possibly be. Upgrades (more gun or more bomb!) make no appreciable difference and enemies are samey and uninspired, coming in wave after repetitive wave until you die due to poor hit detection or you succumb to boredom.\n\nTechnically, it is very unimpressive. Menu design is abysmal and, despite the fact that it is sprite-based, cannot keep a stable framerate on a modern PC. Projectiles rubber-band across the screen as though I were playing it on a potato. That and the aforementioned hit detection put a couple more superfluous nails into this game's coffin.\n\nDon't buy it.","January 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Previous efforts being PiD and Shelter, this one yet is another addition to the unique looking games that they usually produce!\nUnfortunately, this one is by far the weakest, in terms of mechanics. It's far too limited in what it does, and tries to counter that fact by the old philosophy of "make it hard to make up for content". If you're very much into climbing leaderboards, this might be for you. Otherwise, unless you want to give it a go for the visuals alone, I'd say look elsewhere.\n\nAlso, it's NOT a bullet-hell. It's a more traditional shoot 'em up, without the level design. You have a big hitbox, and enemies don't shoot bullets in intricate patterns.\n\nContext\nFor those not aware, Blue Famingo's models, particle and soundeffects were all homemade, even the levels! (Of which there are only 2, and understandably so)\nAs an art project, it's amazing. The game ended up looking really good, but there are few technical issues that I'm inclined to believe that were due to making the game "by hand".\nNonetheless, you can probably find the photos of the development (they were free on the Humble Bundle, when this game was featured) and it's certainly interesting to see. They also have a few videos on their youtube channel.\n\nThis is clearly a passion project. Their intentions were probably to make something different and unique, although they've given little thought to the game itself, as it seems. I wanted to recommend it, but that's only possible with very big restrictions.\n\nPresentation\nThe screenshots don't make this game justice. Everything looks really good, from the models, to the lighting and the particle effects made with firecrackers... It looks really, really good! Unfortunately, while pretty to look at, it creates some important issues when it comes to making a shoot 'em up.\n\nThe music and sound effects were equally good, unsurprisingly. Retro Family are the ones behind this game's music once again, with a jazz-y lounge music approach. There are only two songs, but they didn't seem to get repetitive (although I didn't spend that long with the game). The sound effects also complement the visuals very well.\n\nEverything feels very mechanic, in a good way! It also feels almost like a realistic shmup, weirdly enough. The sound effects seem similar to the WW2 cannons, giving your plane a nice punch.\nI'd advise turning them down a bit, as they overpower the music too much. Fortunately, there are separate sliders!\n\nSo, what are the issues with the visuals?\n1.Framerate\nFor one, the 2 levels were filmed. They built the level, and they've then filmed it, from bottom to top. I'm not sure if this was a problem with the camera they've used, but the game is locked at 100 fps. This is not a smooth framerate at all! Either 60 or 120 would be great, but 100 just feels weird, clearly a problem in a shmup.\n\n2.Lighting and Explosions\nAlso, the explosions from the destroyed ships seem to make the game stutter. The effects from these explosions, while pretty, have a tendency to obsfuscate the screen, hiding enemy bullets. The same issue happens when your bullet hits an enemy's bullet. Yours explode in smoke, while theirs keep going, now hidden.\n\nAnother related problem, is that the enemies have a very similar color scheme to the background. At night, the enemies feature a small presence light, but are otherwise easily blended with the playing field. Again, it looks good, and gives it a very realistic (like) feel, but encumbers gameplay.\n\nI think this covers the issues I had with its presentation. Again, it's one of the prettiest games I can recall. But it's certainly flawed.\n\n\nGame's Structure\nThere are only two levels in this game (visually), and the field is the same. One, is during the day. The other, during the night, with all the colorful lights that come with it.\nIt's an endless score attack game, so it simply alternates between them.\nLevels have a fixed length (since the real field was only so long). You start in the hangar, with a few seconds of preparations, and then the level starts, with enemies coming. When you reach the sea, the level is ending, and there will be a "target" round for you to simply gain $$.\n\nAt the end of each level, you'll have 3 options: keep all of your money (with a 10% increase by the next level), spend it to upgrade your weapon, and spend it to buy another bomb.\nThere's no way of repairing your ship, which makes the games very short, for people who are not into these kinds of games.\n\nThat's basically it. Weapon upgrades simply increase your rate of fire, and by very small increments too.\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nIn Blue Flamingo, you just move and shoot, with the optional use of a bomb to clear the screen, when in a tight situation.\nYou have a Health Bar and can withstand a decent number of hits. Unfortunately, since you can't repair (not even between levels), you die fairly quickly, most of the time.\n\nThere are several waves of enemies (some with 3, 4, 5, etc.) and isolated enemies. When you manage to defeat a full wave before they leave the screen, they drop a coin, which gives you more $$. You also get a smaller amount of $$ per successful hit.\n\nSome enemies shoot in front, some have lasers with a slow recharge, some shot directly at you (although their bullets are destructible), and others are simply large, tanky enemies. I didn't get to feel overwhelmed, per se, since you don't have to destroy every enemy, as they leave the screen after a few seconds.\nI'm not sure how many more enemies there are, since I didn't get very far. Regardless, there doesn't seem to be very much variety.\n\nOther than that, there's a Target Practice section at the end of a nivel. Several target travel uniformely on the screen. Your job is to shoot them (from red to green), so that they leave the screen with a green color. In the end, you're given some money, depending on your performance.\n\nThere are a few other points I want to touch on.\n\nThis is an horizontal shooter, set in a vertical plane\nI never even thought about it, despite being obvious. Making an horizontal shooter in a vertical plane is an awful idea! I mean, if makes it much harder to reach enemies, and give you much lesser time to think about where to go and what to shoot. Overall, it's a bad idea. They could have simply made it a vertical shooter, but I guess the filmed level would have to be longer, which may have created issues for them...\n\nScore vs. Upgrades\nYour score is calculated on the amount of money you have, which means that you have to choose between upgrading, and just keeping your score. The upgrades get increasingly more expensive as well. The thing is, the upgrades are so minimal, that it's almost set in stone that you'll do much better by simply keeping your money. As it is, it makes the game even more repetitive.\nI like the idea, but it doesn't seem very finely tuned.\n\nVery bland mechanics\nThis is another big issue. You shoot your cannons if front (left and right, alternated) and occasionally some missiles. The upgrades simply increase your rate of fire. There's nothing else to it... It's way too barebones, for me. There could be powerups, or perhaps different weapons to keep the variety up a bit more, but there's nothing.\nMaybe some people are into that, but I thought the game got stale too quickly, for me.\n\n\nI don't think there's much more to say. It works, more or less, but provides nothing noteworthy as a game. This was clearly a sideproject for the team, focusing more on the fun of making it than the experience and game as a whole.

Perhaps the MOST honest appraisal will be a the result of discussing TBF AS a new player, updating as my experience grows. (My considerably longer offline play is NOT calculated.)\nTBF is quite possibly the MOST beautiful game I've played. My understanding is that the DEVS actually built physical aircraft models, and it shows. It's a fairly small game, so great care can be applied throughout at reasonable cost. What I don't understand is how the beauty of the landscapes matches the beauty of the planes. It is BETTER than photo-real because of the artistic touches applied. The colors are SO vibrant, the explosions so realistic. The night skies, the desert landscape, the cars passing below all add SO MUCH to the game.\nAdmittedly, my first impression was "Great. Like I NEED another PONG....". And in a very broad sense that's what it is. They come at you, you shoot at them as you move from side to side and front to back. BUT.....\nThe Blue Flamingo is a fairly hard game (so far, for me), and if there are hints or instructions, I haven't found them. I've made it as far as level 3, shot down over 1,500 craft, and I still DON'T even have a score! I don't know how far I'll have to get to be able to regain health, but until I do I'll be crashing ad infinitum. So far, goal #1 is MAINTAIN HEALTH! But simply avoiding bullets and explosions won't do, and wouldn't be much fun. (Blowing up a plane in close proximity=BAD NEWS.) What's obtained as enemy(?) craft are shot down are points (as money) and coins to be grabbed swiftly resulting from special... somethings. At the end of levels they can be exchanged for guns or bombs, but not health. At least not as of Level 3. Money NOT exchanged increases according to the interest rate, a feature new to me, and possibly an intriquing twist yet to be explored.\nThe variety of planes (or whatever term might best be applied to the aircraft) and their movements makes it almost seem as though they convey personalities, and THAT'S what elevates this far beyond PONG type arcade games. I expected to be bored after 2 minutes. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Between the bullets, the screen-clearing (and limited) bombs, the new enemy craft and weapon varieties on each level, and the end-of-level target practice, player skills can be felt growing with each attempt.\n(I've had no experience with the control issues I've read of.)\nHopefully to be continued....\n(Be aware that I'm using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine the game would be even more interesting with a more appropriate controller, such as XBOX. Hopefully I'll report on that as well.)\n(4JJ)","January 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

The art style is unique and fantastic, but unfortunately that's not the only thing that makes The Blue Flamingo different from other shmups.\n\nThe controls are horrendous and it feels like you're on ice. Lack of accurate controls is rage-inducing. It's extremely easy to make simple mistakes like flying into an enemy because of it. To make things worse, there's framerate stutter. It makes the game unplayable.\n\nLots of potential wasted, I could only stand 5-10 minutes of gameplay before calling it quits.

In this one you can upgrade your ship between levels a little. The background you're flying over is pretty cool and fits the "old movie" theme, but the animations of stuff exploding are pretty substandard and look a little weird as a result. The music is pretty cool imo. There's no downside to just holding down the firing button in this game and apart from dodging and shooting there's not much to do, so it's very simple bordering boring for me.

Just... an all around pass.\n\nI am one of those people that think a 50/100 score means that a game is average, and that there's nothing wrong with that. That would make this game 8 points below average, and I think it deserves to lose every single one of those points, if not more.\n\nThis game is below average in every single regard. The graphics are the type of low-res CGI-esque stuff you would see in the early 2000s, the music (while not offensive) is typical elevator-fare muzak, the sounds are generic and forgettable at best, the enemies and levels feel completely copy-pasted, there is no urgency to the game at all, and the controls are TERRIBLY floaty and loose (even with a controller).\n\nPlus, one of this game's only options is that it lets you set 16:10 resolutions (1920x1200, for example), but it doesn't actually SUPPORT those resolutions; it zooms in on the entire 16:9 frame and cuts off the sides (including some text). Why even bother putting that in there?\n\nWhen games are decent, they can still be enjoyable, and it's even possible for games to be so terrible that they're fun. This game, however, falls prey to the cardinal sin of gaming: Being completely colorless, and so average that they're boring. There is nothing worse than a game that accomplishes nothing but helping you while away hours of your life until bedtime. I'm not lying when I say that I'd rather spend the time organizing my Steam backlog into categories than playing this game.\n\nIn case it's not clear, I would recommend playing every other shmup first. You could certainly force yourself to play through this game, but why would you? It is just straight-up not fun, and so many other shoot-em-ups actually ARE.","January 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

However I also have come to appreciate that their products often lack a certain detail or orchestration which seperates a good game from a great game.\n\nThere are a LOT of negative reviews to this game which I simply do not concur with. Most of them are aimed at control response. Having used a controller myself I found no such issues and if there ever was controller issues, they seemed to have been fixed.\n\nThe second major complaint is replayability, this critique actually has some weight behind it. The problem is that it takes too long to raise up the ranks again and the game never changes. Not many people have that much time to dedicate to a game like this and there is no saves, ability to repair ship or kept upgrades which allows a gamer to explore the later levels more easily or quicker. So for many it feels like there's a Lot to the game which they have paid good money for which they will never get to enjoy or experience.\n\nThis top down shooter requires you to traverse the same 32 feet beautiful model of a landscaped town over and over again raising the ranks and alternating between night and day. Each level prsents more or new enemies. Your simple clunky ship known as the blue famingo has two weapons available. Simply normal fire which can be upgraded for more quicker fire and you have infinite bombs which reload capability can be quickened through upgrades after each level. You will immediately start to earn 10% each level for any money unspent meaning it might be in your best interest to save the money for a few levels and rely on some skillful dodging and selection of which enemies you blow up and which ones you leave.\n\nYou also get rewarded coins for any collections of enemies you take down. For instance if you come across a flight of 3 enemies in close formation and you blow up all three, then you will recieve an additional reward of a coin you need to collect before it disappears,  if you blow up only two of them you do not. On top of all this each level is seperated by a target practice session where the object is to turn all the flying discs that are red to green and if they are already green to leave them. Here your bombs can also help. Each disc you get right your rewarded with $100.00 .\n\nPersonally I have finished level 12 and did not discover any new enemies after level 9, instead it just challenged me with more of them. I have messaged developers requesting any information if there are greater enemies after this but no one has replied, so in all honesty level 10 may be all that this game has to really offer. For those that want to challenge themselves by raising their ranks through the high score will be greeted by scores off this planet thanks to cheaters. Hence very little replayability for the honest gamer here.\n\nStill its a decent game which I have enjoyed. Presented well but the mechanics lack that certain finesse which rewards some people from thinking that they have got all their monies worth from this game. Still recommended by me nevertheless... Why? Me level 12, my room mate level 4. I never let him live it down...\n\nhttp://mightanddelight.com/the-blue-flamingo/","December 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

No way to heal/repair between stages... all stages are almost identical.\nThe art is great and the one music track is a good loop, but that can't carry a game IMO.

About complaints on controls, the ship's movement is fast and precise, it have some inertia but nothing problematic, responsive enough, the basic shot in the first levels has a low fire rate and can be imprecise until upgrade it, the game has its rules. Adapt or perish.\n\nThe Blue Flamingo is not a typical Shoot'em Up. Well, at first impression the mechanics seems to be primitive, or maybe simple, but is not that simple or primitive. The game doesn't fit in modern Shoot'em Up doctrines and standards nor in the japanese stylish games and influences. Forget about big bosses, leave to others the hells and powerups everywhere, or colorful appearance, none of them are in this game, no lifes, no continues. This is about beating an endless challenge, one life, one scenario, day and night. How far you can get?\n\nLike I said everything seems to be simple or even typical, two weapons, the basic shot and "bombs", like any other. The basic fire can be upgraded by fire rate, and the bombs by recharge speed, nothing special on that. The enemies are simple, each one with easy-to-learn patterns and recognizable shapes, nothing uncommon. The gameplay presents in levels of three minutes that ends in a targeting bonus stage. In every loop the level will be raise up and new enemies will appear in different mixing layouts with more high difficulty, and believe me, it will be challenging. Then the simplicity, becomes complexity.\nThe single life-bar, the rate of fire and its upgrading, the strategic use of bombs and its recharging, the score points for the upgrading, the endless level upscaling, the simple but effective enemies, the mixing of those enemies. Everything in this mixture is only simple on appearance. This game have some unusual characteristics with a result in a very satisfying gameplay, if is what are you looking for.\n\nThe Blue Flamingo has a very special personality, not to everyone's taste. At first glance looks a very simple and empty game, even repetitive, but while you're playing and progressing it shows from where comes and where it goes. Replayability, an endless game on Shoot'em Up shape with classic shine and charm.\n\nChallenging game,\na different one.\nCharming game,\na good one.\n\nA good different charming game, that is The Blue Flamingo.","February 2, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, my poor skill level doesn't make it a bad game.\n\nBlue Flamingo's game assets are beautiful. The people behind the modeling & music are to be commended.\n\nThe game itself is not terrible, but there's not a lot to it. Overall Blue Flamingo is an alright Atari-esque shoot'em up(only goal is high score). With a little bit of a gambling gimick(bank points? or spend them on upgrades?). The people that are claiming the controls are terrible are just heavy on their thumbs. The controls ARE sensitive. The ship will move, when you touch the stick. If you touch the stick TOO HARD, your ship is going to move TOO FAST. After a few runs you will get used to it.\n\nI don't think a lot of people will stay around & play this as a long term game. Blue Flamingo doesn't offer a ton of replayability unless you're the type that can rack up a massive score & enjoy defending it. To the mediocre of us, there's not a lot of point.\n\nI do recommend this if it's on discount. However at $4.99 the gamer isn't getting their money's worth. I feel like crap saying this.

Although to be fair, my technical first was for a game that's since been removed from Steam, so that's another story for another time.\n\nThe Blue Flamingo is a prime example of "style over substance." Yes, the game is very pretty to look at, I will give it that much. It definitely fits the bill of the "Eye Candy 2" Humble Bundle I got it in. But that's where my cheers for this thing end, I'm afraid.\n\nAt it's core, the game is astonishingly mediocre in terms of content and originality. You fly across the screen (we'll get the that bit), you try to shoot stuff, you earn money to upgrade your plane in arbitrary and quite honestly hard-to-notice ways, and repeat until you crash. Which you will, because you don't recover damage in between levels for some asinine reason.\n\nYour weapons feel very miniscule in comparison to your targets (that is, I felt like I was pumping several seconds worth of rounds into any given enemy on screen). Not to mention that nothing seems all that impressive about your arsenal save for the bombs, and I've seen better examples in a host of other games; there's nothing that made me say, "Oh wow, that was neat" or anything along those lines.\n\nThen there's the four ton white elephant in the room: the controls. Any miniscule movement you make will send your plane shooting across the screen with little control over it. This will cause you to be hit by kamakaze pilots, missiles, death rays (just go with it), or any number of other obstacles you will see if you have the patience. At the moment, there seems to be no way to adjust the sensitvity, meaning that I'm doomed to either keep crashing on the first couple levels or leave it be and hope that the devs fix this problem eventually. That factor simply makes the game frustrating to play, and a chore to leave open while I wait for the trading cards to come in.\nTo be fair, I was using an Xbox 360 controler for this, and can't say how the keyboard controls are (although other reviews claim that it's even worse with the keyboard).\n\nI'm glad I got this as part of a Humble Bundle. That is, I barely paid anything for it, and plus I'd feel guilty if I gifted this to one of my friends. Don't let the amount of time I spent playing this fool you; I've played enough of this game to completely condemn it.\n\n*UPDATE* It dropped a foil card, which makes the experience worth it in my book.","January 7, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had paid full price this would be a thumbs down review. The game looks beautiful, the music is relaxing, tasty and a bit old-school (you'd have to hear it). Where things fall apart a bit is in the controls and the UI.\n\nIt's an amazingly beautiful game, and the soundtrack's very nice as well (kind of relaxing and charming, strangely enough - without being boring). The backgrounds look like they're hand-painted.\n\nController use is a bit wonky, but I can reassign those as others have suggested (and the fire buttons to something my fingers would expect). X fires bullets, B fires bombs. I suppose I could change this to A and B, or right trigger left trigger? One user's suggested mapping movements to the digital stick. That'd probably make me less likely to damage my controller while playing it...\n\nThe most annoying quirk the game has is the main menu's UI. After you die, it drops you back to this screen, where it defaults to highlighting the Options key. This seems like a rather odd choice, as once you've got that bit settled you really don't want to go in there. With the controller bieng as "jumpy" as it can be, I've actually exited the game accidentally a time or two.\n\nAside from everything else, the game needs a way to fine-tune the stick's reactivity. I may want to try playing this with keyboard and mouse, I can't believe I just said that...","January 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not played far enough to say if that variation per level continues with some randomised algorithm or if that too goes back to the beginning after a surprisingly short period.\n\nEven at a couple bucks in a sale, I was disappointed by the lack of content the devs seem to have put in; the quality is quite nice (main menu interface is not very honed) but there's very little of it. From a gameplay perspective - if this hasn't been patched - the inability to repair your shields with money between levels seems just a wrong choice.\n\nI also had technical problems on first install where the scrolling and music stuttered, until I moved the game files from HD to RAMdisk.\n\nJust because the levels don't change, it's vertical scrolling and quite slow paced, I can see myself playing this again. But if you can cope with sideways scrolling instead of vertical and want what this trailer looks like but moreso, I recommend Platypus for same idea, more content +did it first.","January 20, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay and the actual graphics are very simplistic - while that is not necessarily a bad thing, it doesn't seem to match up with the overall design. After attempting to navigate the menus with a controller (partial controller support), he background images and stills give the impression that this will be a different type of shooter. Once the game starts, you realize this is not the case as the player's ship/enemies/projectiles stand out from the interesting backgrounds that they are flying over. The backgrounds themselves appear to be grainy avi video (I assume the grain is the look they were going for) that have no real effect on the gameplay (you cannot crash into anything). The player/enemy ships are way too clean and sharp which makes them stand out from the grainy video background (if the backgrounds are generated, then why aren't don't the objects match the graininess and such?). A better way to describe it would be think about those old school point-n-click adventure games or hidden object games where the object you need stands out from the background ...\n\nFinally, the controls are very floaty & loose.

They lack responsiveness in any way and don’t feel like any effort was put into them. This was the first sign that I made a wrong choice to pick up this game. I jumped into the game too see what else was wrong. Unfortunately the game doesn’t hold a candle to the enjoyment that I get out of simple flash games from miscellaneous websites because of it’s lack of dept. I played for only 10 minutes and couldn’t stand the game any longer. It’s your run of the mill shoot-em-up but with some of the most shotty and floaty movement and the weirdest feeling enemies. The particles used for the destruction of enemies look like some image taken from old DOS games and caked into the game at the last minute.\n\nOverall the game part of the game doesn’t feel good at all.

A standard subject we've seen time and again in overhead shooters like this, the major issue here is with the control. It's so floaty it's to the point of absurd. With a controller I even find it hard to select anything on the startup screen without it floating through other options other than "start". Between levels when you choose upgrades it's the same. You'll find yourself even drifting to "end game" by accident.\n\nNow imagine a shump that feels almost like your ship is sliding on ice. It starts easy enough, but when you hit about level 6 when precision flying is needed to avoid fire it's damn near impossible to preform. If for some reason this was done on purpose to amp up the difficulty it's a pretty cheap shortcut.\n\nAs i've said the graphics being all hand made out of organic models look fantastic. BUT.... you'll see the asme handful of enemies over and over again. Same goes for the visuals of the levels, which are only 2. Day and night.

The game adds new enemies but are nothing special and take about as long to kill as the starting enemies. Another issue is that there are only 2 upgrades you can buy and really don't feel like they do much of anything.

However, my poor skill level doesn't make it a bad game.\n\nBlue Flamingo's game assets are beautiful. The people behind the modeling & music are to be commended.\n\nThe game itself is not terrible, but there's not a lot to it. Overall Blue Flamingo is an alright Atari-esque shoot'em up(only goal is high score). With a little bit of a gambling gimick(bank points? or spend them on upgrades?). The people that are claiming the controls are terrible are just heavy on their thumbs. The controls ARE sensitive. The ship will move, when you touch the stick. If you touch the stick TOO HARD, your ship is going to move TOO FAST. After a few runs you will get used to it.\n\nI don't think a lot of people will stay around & play this as a long term game. Blue Flamingo doesn't offer a ton of replayability unless you're the type that can rack up a massive score & enjoy defending it. To the mediocre of us, there's not a lot of point.\n\nI do recommend this if it's on discount. However at $4.99 the gamer isn't getting their money's worth. I feel like crap saying this.

Most of the background art looks ok, but it is slightly blurred.\n\nMost of the enemies are bland and don't shoot anything (this game is the opposite of a "bullet hell"). The game does start to pick up at around level 5, but there's no way I can tell to skip to level 5. You can collect coins for killing groups and upgrade your guns and bombs, but it doesn't really seem to do much. Shmups should be precise, but the bullets and rockets shot by the “guns” are somewhat random. The ship itself is also somewhat “floaty”, so you never totally feel like it is your fault when you get hit.\n\nI only played like three times.

Each kill grants you cash which is both your score and your means to upg your ship. With a small bonus after each level in the way of a % gain to your total remaining cash. The idea being that you need to balance your score / upgs and greed. For the most part this system works very well unfortunatly that is the whole game.\n\nI personally very much enjoyed the artistic approach to the game and it functions just fine for what it is. If you are looking for a very simple shoot'em up to relax and play this is a good bet. If you are more interested in an intense shoot'em up with various levels / ships / weapons etc this is not the game for you.\n\nOverall 5/10\nThe Blue Flamingo is a very bare bones attempt at a shoot'em up. Well there really isn't anything wrong with it and the art direction is something to enjoy, it really does not offer much more than the basics.\nGood for a relaxing easy to pick up and play shoot'em up.

A standard subject we've seen time and again in overhead shooters like this, the major issue here is with the control. It's so floaty it's to the point of absurd. With a controller I even find it hard to select anything on the startup screen without it floating through other options other than "start". Between levels when you choose upgrades it's the same. You'll find yourself even drifting to "end game" by accident.\n\nNow imagine a shump that feels almost like your ship is sliding on ice. It starts easy enough, but when you hit about level 6 when precision flying is needed to avoid fire it's damn near impossible to preform. If for some reason this was done on purpose to amp up the difficulty it's a pretty cheap shortcut.\n\nAs i've said the graphics being all hand made out of organic models look fantastic. BUT.... you'll see the asme handful of enemies over and over again. Same goes for the visuals of the levels, which are only 2. Day and night. And both will repeat over and over with the same 2 scores in the background.\n\nIt had potential, but personally for me does a belly flop into a thumbs down.\nLuckily I obtained it through a bundle with a few other better games I know i'll play.\n","January 5, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay and the actual graphics are very simplistic - while that is not necessarily a bad thing, it doesn't seem to match up with the overall design. After attempting to navigate the menus with a controller (partial controller support), he background images and stills give the impression that this will be a different type of shooter. Once the game starts, you realize this is not the case as the player's ship/enemies/projectiles stand out from the interesting backgrounds that they are flying over. The backgrounds themselves appear to be grainy avi video (I assume the grain is the look they were going for) that have no real effect on the gameplay (you cannot crash into anything). The player/enemy ships are way too clean and sharp which makes them stand out from the grainy video background (if the backgrounds are generated, then why aren't don't the objects match the graininess and such?). A better way to describe it would be think about those old school point-n-click adventure games or hidden object games where the object you need stands out from the background ...\n\nFinally, the controls are very floaty & loose. I might have played the game longer if the controls were tighter or maybe if you could control the ship with just the mouse.","May 21, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay itself, however, is a bit bland. The intended effect of handmade models being used for the game's assets isn't as noticable as you may hope when purchasing the title. The lack of extra lives (maybe you can get them with a high score but I haven't played enough to be very good at it to unlock them if so..) as well as a lack of end-level bosses is a bit of a dissapointment, as huge end level bosses seem to be a staple of this genre of game. Cool concept, and if you want to support the artists endeavor then go ahead and pick it up, but when considered as an actual game is when it begins to lose its luster.","November 17, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/302010/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","As with all forms of entertainment media, games come in a wide variety of different flavours. There are genres, and then there are sub-genres, and even sub-genres of sub-genres. Not every game is for everyone. In particular, the shmup genre is known for its niche appeal. Yet strangely, The Blue Flamingo is one of the few games that may find appeal across a surprisingly wide spectrum of audiences, due in part to the simple nature of its core gameplay mechanics and soft difficulty curve.\n\nThe titular Blue Flamingo is a wingless aircraft operated by a nameless pilot competing against their fellow peers in a challenge to complete a course, populated by hostile combatants. Each pilot takes their own turn at tackling what the course has to offer, and retires once their craft sustains too much damage. That’s as far as The Blue Flamingo’s story goes, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s a simple story for a simple game.\n\nIndeed, simplicity is the heart and soul of The Blue Flamingo. The core gameplay itself is as simple as it can get for a shmup: you shoot enemies who primarily appear from the top and sides of the screen, all the while earning points with which to upgrade the Flamingo between stages. Enemies range from small craft that only shoot in a straight line, to much larger ones that bring up the rear and shoot in multiple directions at once. Most of the time you’ll find yourself relying on the Flamingo’s two guns, but when things get nasty you can fall back on the use of your bombs, which deliver a powerful, screen-clearing attack. The upgrades themselves come in two varieties: one which boosts the fire rate of the craft’s main guns and one that decreases the length of the cooldown period in between bomb uses. While upgrading improves one’s chances of survival, it also eats into their score, thus the player is forced to choose between spending their hard-earned points in hopes of ensuring a smoother ride during the next stage, or take the of risk foregoing any upgrades in favour of racking up a high score. Unlike a lot of other shmups The Blue Flamingo expects you to die, and die you will. There are no lives in this game and damage sustained is irreparable - that is to say: once you’re done, you’re done.\n\nThis simple gameplay loop works wonderfully well. The ‘pick-up-and-play’ feel of the game is no doubt a major part of its appeal. There’s something about The Blue Flamingo that makes you want to have ‘just one more go’.\n\nThe obvious downside to having such a straightforward take on the core gameplay experience is that some players will inevitably find themselves running into boredom relatively quickly. The Blue Flamingo doesn’t have the complexity or the longevity that others of its ilk possess, and as such those looking for something more than that described above are likely to stay for a few rounds before moving on to something more in-depth.\n\nOne of The Blue Flamingo’s most distinguishing features is its use of real-life sources as graphical and audio assets – each and every one of the sprites seen in the game has been made using still images of hand-crafted, real-world models. The same goes for the environments and explosions. The end result is something that’s quite unlike anything previously seen in a shmup. The models look great when set against the environment backgrounds and it would be difficult not to argue that the explosions easily get the job done. If there’s one area that The Blue Flamingo does excel in, it’s in the graphics department. The real-world audio also adds a good touch to the game’s aesthetics, and is complemented by a charming musical score that fits quite nicely with the setting while feeling relaxing at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion it can safely be said that The Blue Flamingo is a nice little game that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, whether they be a dedicated, hardcore fan of the shmup genre or an individual who has yet to immerse himself/herself in a computer game of any sort. Given the standard asking price of £3.99, it’s hard not to recommend The Blue Flamingo.","February 2, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/302010/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","The Blue Flamingo is one of those games with a TON of potential but fails to deliver on many levels. It has some of the most unique art I've seen in a long time, especially when it comes to vertical shooters, but the gameplay just doesn't feel fun. It's more of a chore to play than a pleasant experience, as the gun is obnoxious to use (since it has no spread, very narrow missiles, and the bullets alternate back and forth from left to right so there's no constant stream of fire), and it cannot be fixed.\n\nIt's a very "grab-bag" style game, meaning you start a new game, play through until you die, then repeat. Each time starting from scratch. It's more of a mini-game than a full game, and is basically priced as such ($4.99). For the asking price I wasn't too upset with my purchase, also considering it came in a bundle that I got even a better deal on, but the game just isn't as fun as it should be. Needless to say I would never pay full price for this game.\n\nThere is no variety, it's the same thing over and over again, with very little change in enemies in the later levels if you're lucky enough to get that far. But aside from that, there is only one gun, upgrades only upgrading it's damage, not it's looks or speed, and there is one super weapon, which is a bomb which can also be upgraded but the upgrades only speed up the recharge rate. You only have one playable ship, and from what it looks like-one playable map (though the enemy patterns change each level, and later levels introduce a few new ones).\n\nThe controls are also terrible, and in a bullet-dodging vertical shooter, controls mean everything. You have to use the WASD (re-mappable) keys to move, and left-click to fire, right-click to drop a bomb. The problem I have with this is that you can't move with the mouse which allows for SO much more precision in games like these. Though I can usually deal with the keyboard movement in most vertical shooters, I can't in Blue Flamingo, because it's extremely sensitive which makes you fly across the screen and smash into incoming bullets and enemies if you're not very cautious.\n\nOverall, The Blue Flamingo is one of those incredibly pretty games with a lot of potential, but it seems unfinished and has very wonky controls and gameplay. It's not an enjoyable experience and I'm sure if you buy it you'll get about an hour or two of playtime out of it before you uninstall it and probably forget about it. That's what I did, then I came back and played it for a bit more and decided it was time to call it a day, forever.\n\nI would honestly look forward to a new vertical shooter by Might and Delight, assuming they learned from their mistakes this time around, because as I've said many times now, they clearly have the potential to make an awesome game.\n\n5.0/10","December 25, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are genres, and then there are sub-genres, and even sub-genres of sub-genres. Not every game is for everyone. In particular, the shmup genre is known for its niche appeal. Yet strangely, The Blue Flamingo is one of the few games that may find appeal across a surprisingly wide spectrum of audiences, due in part to the simple nature of its core gameplay mechanics and soft difficulty curve.\n\nThe titular Blue Flamingo is a wingless aircraft operated by a nameless pilot competing against their fellow peers in a challenge to complete a course, populated by hostile combatants. Each pilot takes their own turn at tackling what the course has to offer, and retires once their craft sustains too much damage. That’s as far as The Blue Flamingo’s story goes, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s a simple story for a simple game.\n\nIndeed, simplicity is the heart and soul of The Blue Flamingo. The core gameplay itself is as simple as it can get for a shmup: you shoot enemies who primarily appear from the top and sides of the screen, all the while earning points with which to upgrade the Flamingo between stages. Enemies range from small craft that only shoot in a straight line, to much larger ones that bring up the rear and shoot in multiple directions at once. Most of the time you’ll find yourself relying on the Flamingo’s two guns, but when things get nasty you can fall back on the use of your bombs, which deliver a powerful, screen-clearing attack. The upgrades themselves come in two varieties: one which boosts the fire rate of the craft’s main guns and one that decreases the length of the cooldown period in between bomb uses. While upgrading improves one’s chances of survival, it also eats into their score, thus the player is forced to choose between spending their hard-earned points in hopes of ensuring a smoother ride during the next stage, or take the of risk foregoing any upgrades in favour of racking up a high score. Unlike a lot of other shmups The Blue Flamingo expects you to die, and die you will. There are no lives in this game and damage sustained is irreparable - that is to say: once you’re done, you’re done.\n\nThis simple gameplay loop works wonderfully well. The ‘pick-up-and-play’ feel of the game is no doubt a major part of its appeal. There’s something about The Blue Flamingo that makes you want to have ‘just one more go’.\n\nThe obvious downside to having such a straightforward take on the core gameplay experience is that some players will inevitably find themselves running into boredom relatively quickly. The Blue Flamingo doesn’t have the complexity or the longevity that others of its ilk possess, and as such those looking for something more than that described above are likely to stay for a few rounds before moving on to something more in-depth.\n\nOne of The Blue Flamingo’s most distinguishing features is its use of real-life sources as graphical and audio assets – each and every one of the sprites seen in the game has been made using still images of hand-crafted, real-world models. The same goes for the environments and explosions. The end result is something that’s quite unlike anything previously seen in a shmup. The models look great when set against the environment backgrounds and it would be difficult not to argue that the explosions easily get the job done. If there’s one area that The Blue Flamingo does excel in, it’s in the graphics department. The real-world audio also adds a good touch to the game’s aesthetics, and is complemented by a charming musical score that fits quite nicely with the setting while feeling relaxing at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion it can safely be said that The Blue Flamingo is a nice little game that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, whether they be a dedicated, hardcore fan of the shmup genre or an individual who has yet to immerse himself/herself in a computer game of any sort. Given the standard asking price of £3.99, it’s hard not to recommend The Blue Flamingo.","February 2, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay itself, however, is a bit bland. The intended effect of handmade models being used for the game's assets isn't as noticable as you may hope when purchasing the title. The lack of extra lives (maybe you can get them with a high score but I haven't played enough to be very good at it to unlock them if so..) as well as a lack of end-level bosses is a bit of a dissapointment, as huge end level bosses seem to be a staple of this genre of game. Cool concept, and if you want to support the artists endeavor then go ahead and pick it up, but when considered as an actual game is when it begins to lose its luster.","November 17, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some of the most unique art I've seen in a long time, especially when it comes to vertical shooters, but the gameplay just doesn't feel fun. It's more of a chore to play than a pleasant experience, as the gun is obnoxious to use (since it has no spread, very narrow missiles, and the bullets alternate back and forth from left to right so there's no constant stream of fire), and it cannot be fixed.\n\nIt's a very "grab-bag" style game, meaning you start a new game, play through until you die, then repeat. Each time starting from scratch. It's more of a mini-game than a full game, and is basically priced as such ($4.99). For the asking price I wasn't too upset with my purchase, also considering it came in a bundle that I got even a better deal on, but the game just isn't as fun as it should be. Needless to say I would never pay full price for this game.\n\nThere is no variety, it's the same thing over and over again, with very little change in enemies in the later levels if you're lucky enough to get that far. But aside from that, there is only one gun, upgrades only upgrading it's damage, not it's looks or speed, and there is one super weapon, which is a bomb which can also be upgraded but the upgrades only speed up the recharge rate. You only have one playable ship, and from what it looks like-one playable map (though the enemy patterns change each level, and later levels introduce a few new ones).\n\nThe controls are also terrible, and in a bullet-dodging vertical shooter, controls mean everything. You have to use the WASD (re-mappable) keys to move, and left-click to fire, right-click to drop a bomb. The problem I have with this is that you can't move with the mouse which allows for SO much more precision in games like these. Though I can usually deal with the keyboard movement in most vertical shooters, I can't in Blue Flamingo, because it's extremely sensitive which makes you fly across the screen and smash into incoming bullets and enemies if you're not very cautious.\n\nOverall, The Blue Flamingo is one of those incredibly pretty games with a lot of potential, but it seems unfinished and has very wonky controls and gameplay. It's not an enjoyable experience and I'm sure if you buy it you'll get about an hour or two of playtime out of it before you uninstall it and probably forget about it. That's what I did, then I came back and played it for a bit more and decided it was time to call it a day, forever.\n\nI would honestly look forward to a new vertical shooter by Might and Delight, assuming they learned from their mistakes this time around, because as I've said many times now, they clearly have the potential to make an awesome game.\n\n5.0/10","December 25, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the background wasn't particularly striking (in that I didn't notice it much while playing). The scolling was jerky and there wasn't enough variety between levels.\n\nI didn't like the way the ship handled, the aiming was annoying because the bullets came from your wings when you first shoot but switch to firing from the nose of the ship if you hold the fire button down. The bullet hit box was too narrow which made aiming harder. This might improve when you upgrade the ship enough, but I didn't feel compelled to do so.\n\nIf an update is made I will try the game again, because as I said I do want to like this. I wish the developers success because I would like to see more games made of graphics with real-world elements.","April 15","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
