"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkgirl/recommended/213650/","linkgirl","Muselord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkgirl/","214 products in account","Dwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.\n\nThe way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but, you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.\n\nThe F2P version has the two easier difficulties unlocked and each can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).\n\nThe only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.\n\n[NOTE: If you buy the full version, your personal scores and achievements will transfer, but the F2P version has different global leaderboards, and your global score will not transfer.]\n\n[EDIT: For those wondering, I personally own the full version (non-F2P), which is why my play-time on the F2P version is so low.]\n\n\nConcerning the DLC...\nDwarfs - F2P Skirmish Pack (Recommended): Comes with 3 modes (Sandbox, Rush, and Dark). Rush and Dark modes bring new challenges to the game and can be a lot of fun. In Sandbox, you can experiment. In Rush, dwarfs spawn CONSTANTLY and you can only let 200 die. In Dark, you cannot see where caves or minerals are located.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Difficulty Pack (Recommended): Unlocks the two harder difficulty levels (Hardcore & Tedi Hardcore) for Arcade mode.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Endless Mode Pack (Not Recommended): Exactly like Arcade mode, except it's endless and you're allowed to pick the map size as well as the difficulty. Beware lag. Also, no high score is recorded.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Summer Carnival Pack (Extremely NOT Recommended): Was a prize for a Steam summer sale years ago; a very simple mini-game that is completely different than the base game.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Base Defend Pack (Not Recommended): A cute little tower defense mode that's rather different from the base game.","November 25, 2013","true","0.9"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","98","120","0","0"

What isn't fun is having to stop lava and water from getting through to your hometown and killing everything in its path, its sad having to risk a life of a little dwarfy just to seal the cave up.\n\nIt gets harder throughout when the dwarves start digging deeper in, you have to be more cautious of lava, water, boss fights etc. That is why we have a tower! A tower that can send your dwarves flying over into the cave where the boss is just to beat the heck outta those ugly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

I have played for over an hour, and I made a video for it on my YouTube channel. It's a game that takes from many other games, and is a great RTS.\n\nWARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE SPOILERS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION, FELLOW DWARF!\n\nYou are the dwarf overseer, and you see what the dwarfs be doing. If they start doing something you don't like...\nSTOP THEM!\nThis game does require a legitimate strategy, and due to the system of caves that appear, you never know if something will make you the richest dwarf in existence, or doom you and your hall. A dangerous cave can be many blocks away from the town hall, and depending on the danger inside, you can have an entire minute to deal with the situation at your own pace before it becomes a worrying threat. Sometimes you will uncover enemies. This can be a troop of 2 spiders, to 3 orcs and to a powerful warlock. To truly tackle these requires you to use fighter dwarves, which are very powerful fighters (and good miners). They cost 100 gold each (which by the time you encounter enemies you will have enough of), and are instantly available to fight.\n\nYou can place a battle tower in an area that you have mined for 500 gold, and this is VITAL to beating powerful enemies such as the warlock, as you can have up to 8 enemies. Of course, in a five minute arcade play-through, you may not need this. But in a 60 minute play through, you definitely will.\n\nMy one complaint is that you can't zoom out enough to view the whole arena at once, and this can be annoying when you have a load of dwarfs doing there own thing on multiple ends of the map. This has lead to many deaths in my playthroughs.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10.\n\nAnd to top it all off, this game has a cameo from the ultimate dwarf: Yogscast Simon! :D","September 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

(Ex. On a flight, long car ride, or a night to yourself.)\nThe random challenges can get a bit repetitive, but will always keep you on your toes.\nThe exploration factor and vast variety of enemies give the randomly generated maps an extra bit of flare.\nSadly, the game itself looses it's charm and challenge after a few rounds. The extra modes are priced cheaply, but I myself did not find the base game convincing enough to invest any money into any of the DLCs. I suppose that's something you'll have to decide for yourself after trying the base game!","November 30, 2013","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is pretty simple.\nThere are only two types of buildings and only two types of dwarf's.\nThere are miner dwarf's and warrior dwarf's. Miners spawn automatically as you get more gold. Warrior's are obviously more adept to fight can be spawned at the main base (max 8) or, be spawned from the other building type, outposts.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get as much gold as you can within the time limit or before your base is destroyed. The miners will dig around randomly but you can guide them to caves or minerals. However, giving them directions costs precious gold. This is where it gets incredibly fun. There are really not that many different types of hazardous areas. There's caves full of water or lava that can flood your mine and there are caves full of enemies. What's fun is that you won't see what's in the cave until a dwarf has dug into it. But the caves may have treasure within and gold is what keeps your mine in order.\n\nOnce a dwarf has discovered a cave full of water or lava it you need to block it off with a wall, blow up a pit with dynamite (which require sacrificing a dwarf) and then solidify the rock around the area so your miners don't blindly spring another leak. These caves are certainly the most hazardous, especially when your mine has branched into something quite complex where water could be flowing through several shafts which all need blocked off.\n\nCaves with enemies can be dealt with warriors. You can build an outpost where you can spawn 4 warriors, train them and (best of all) shoot them out a cannon towards the enemy area. Shooting them out the cannon isn't accurate so you may get a dwarf or 2 in shafts without enemies. Again, this is where gold is much needed. Being able to build outposts allows you to be tactful with the placement.\n\nIt's all really easy to control with shortcuts to items being labelled at the bottom, it's very easy to pick up and play. There are also time controls. You can pause the game for a brief moment, if things are getting a bit hectic, to look around and work with your mine. Best of all is the ability to speed up the game. It allows you to be as greedy as you can be. Both these controls don't affect your time limit per game. Which is perfect as these are tools to help your mine rather than alter the match itself.\n\nThe F2P version probably has what most people want. You are only limited to Easy and Normal difficulties but Normal is good enough. There's no reason why people shouldn't give this a go. The game also features some humorous tutorials with a dwarf voiced by Yogscast's Simon which was a nice surprise. With games being timed from 15 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour, it is certainly a lot of fun to pick up and play.","February 14, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/recommended/213650/","THPPFT","JakkelR4psc4llion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/","82 products in account","Dwarfs!? is a simple yet fun game where you don't LEAD an underground kingdom of dwarves to victory and wealth so much as you BABYSIT them. You start out with a single great hall while miner dwarves slowly come into existence and dig their way outward, discovering caves, treasure, valuable minerals, not so valuable minerals, floods, lava pools, monsters and so on. All the while YOU are responsible for hiring warrior dwarves, trapping the floods (water or lava) and directing the miners toward valuable stuff, and away from the harmful places (although it costs money to give orders or directions). The F2P game is a pretty good snag, as you get the general arcade mode on the easy and hard settings, as well as tutorial and a few challenge maps. If you want more than that, you have to buy the corresponding DLC to get the harder settings and the other modes offered in the game, which sadly the future Tripwire is leaning toward. Overall, fun, challenging little game that can offer more if you buy the entire game (with all DLC), and if you're a Killing Floor fan, this game has the achievement that will get you the Dwarven Axe on Killing Floor.","March 6, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/concinus/recommended/213650/","concinus","Concinus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/concinus/","70 products in account","This is a game for people who think fast and act faster. The player does not have complete control over the dwarfs mining; you may guide some of their actions but ultimately you will have too many of them to guide every single one and then they'll dig in whatever direction they want. Your job is to guide them to gems and precious metals and see to it that they don't dig into caves with lava or water, thus flooding the cave and killing all dwarfs. To avoid floods, you have to block or blow holes in the ground. This, however, comes at a cost and thus is one of the reasons to why you have to find gems and precious metals early in the game.\n\nThe game's graphics has an old look to them, with a horrendously old-fashioned main menu design, which put me off at first. However, while playing the game the design is not bad and has a more "retro" feel to it. I rather liked the different maps and tutorials. The game seriously tested my patience, though, and I did not enjoy playing under constant pressure.","December 24, 2013","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not really worth it IMO, wish I'd just loaded the longest arcade game to get the 40,000 gold required to unlock the achievement and weapon.\n\nAs soon as I got in I had to mute everything, the narration and music was a little grating. The tutorials were odd as well, as I maanged to complete a couple of them without even doing anything, think that might need looking at. All in all it doesnt seem like a bad game but it desperately needs a film or some music to go along with it.

This is an overall good game that I reccomend you try out.","November 27, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is pretty simple but a lot of fun.\n\nBasically you pick a time limit for yourself (up to an hour) and see just how gigantic a mine you can make with your little bearded buddies. You build defensive outposts, guide miners towards mineral nodes, block off water-filled caves and volcanic caves before they can hurt your men, and so on. Simple enough but the town hall is constantly spawning more miners who dig faster and faster as they level up. What starts out small becomes a gigantic mining complex in a surprisingly short amount of time.\n\nIts definitely worth a try and, hey, the price is right. :P","April 21, 2013","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can have a five minute round if you're in a hurry all the way up to hour long sessions if you have some time to kill. Not really something I would spend money on but that's why DLC is optional. Luckily, you still get most of the game for free and it's just the extras that are, well, extra.

I only played the free version (which only has easy/normal modes), but even this is tons of fun.\n\nThe gameplay is not really much to do with Dwarf Fortress, as one might think -- there is no base-building involved aside from planting outposts. This is more about micromanaging dwarfs to maximize mining efficiency (exploring caves, making outposts, getting away from danger) and guard against various hazards (floods, lava caves, underground citters, occasional boss-type critter). You play for a fixed time (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes) and try to maximize your score and not get killed.","July 31, 2013","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are various other game modes, and different difficulty levels which change the prices of certain items, but in general it is a fun little time sink. Just be careful, your dwarfs are about as dumb as Lemmings, and won't hesitate to leap down death holes or into lava en masse. Try to mine as many treasure caves and minerals as you can for a chance to get on the leader board! Best part is, this is free to play, so doesn't hurt giving it a shot.

Very simple but addicting game, especially if you get excited about leaderboards and high-scores. I only played the free version (which only has easy/normal modes), but even this is tons of fun.\n\nThe gameplay is not really much to do with Dwarf Fortress, as one might think -- there is no base-building involved aside from planting outposts. This is more about micromanaging dwarfs to maximize mining efficiency (exploring caves, making outposts, getting away from danger) and guard against various hazards (floods, lava caves, underground citters, occasional boss-type critter). You play for a fixed time (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes) and try to maximize your score and not get killed.","July 31, 2013","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As an idea, this works. You control dwarfs that will mine into caves filled with either treasure or tragedy, and also get gold. You can build towers to get warrior dwarfs, who will fight off goblins when your digger dwarfs mine a cave full of them. You can play a round for up to an hour.\n\nAnd this would be a great game... if the dwarf digger AI wasn't so stupid.\n\nI mean, you bust open a cave full of water, you put a wall down, should be good. But for some reason, digger dwarfs think it's a good idea to mine through your walls even if you placed it to block lava right in front of them. Water poured into my base and I started getting spammed with messages of a group of 10 dwarfs trying to break through the walls every 2 seconds.\n\nYou can't explore or fight when you need to keep babysitting dwarfs that can't realise that walls aren't something to stick their pickaxes through. Your best bet is to hold CTRL and create unbreakable walls around said problem, but here's where that doesn't work:\n\nThe lava is pouring into your base. You've already sacraficed a decent dwarf to create the hole to divert the lava's flow. And then, it heads for your base from many directions. You can't make unbreachable walls out of nowhere as you can walls, so if it happens, you might as well let it pour right in.

This game is pretty simple but a lot of fun.\n\nBasically you pick a time limit for yourself (up to an hour) and see just how gigantic a mine you can make with your little bearded buddies. You build defensive outposts, guide miners towards mineral nodes, block off water-filled caves and volcanic caves before they can hurt your men, and so on. Simple enough but the town hall is constantly spawning more miners who dig faster and faster as they level up. What starts out small becomes a gigantic mining complex in a surprisingly short amount of time.\n\nIts definitely worth a try and, hey, the price is right. :P","April 21, 2013","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gets very intense when you have to contain the water and lava, and you also have to defend yourself against a variety of enemies along the way. There\'s always this fear of the unknown because you don't know exactly where you\'re digging up to.\n\nIt\'s a great and fun game, lots of replay value! :)","May 31","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
