With that up my sleeve, I'll be bold enough to say that I know a thing or two about this game and ready to try and write an adequate review. So gather round, grab a cup of hot chockolate and have a listen to what uncle Chern's got to tell ya :)\n\nI'll split my review into three sections - pros, cons and things that are considered negative by some reviewers, but not necessarily are.\n\nLet us start with the cons, because this list is the shortest... and because I am grumpy old b*****d who likes to criticize. So...\n\nCONS:\n\nMAP - Map in the current version of the game is not very large. There are only a few points to explore and salvage from. So after you have visited them all (which can... and probably should... be done in the first few days of your survival), the game becomes a bit repetitive. Go find meat - go collect some wood - cook - eat/drink - sleep - repeat from step one. Saying that - it does add to realism. Real survival in the wilderness is far from glorious and comes down to just that - get food, cook, keep sated, hydrated and warm. But still it would be nice to have more areas to poke your nose around :)\n\nLOOT (sometimes) - Loot in the game is mostly random... which is a good thing and adds to realism and replayability value, but at some playthroughs it can get bloody stupid. Sometimes you may have enough ammo to get out of Canadian wilds, venture to Afghanistan and assist several ISAF operations, have three knives, 5 packs of MRE rations, ton of medical supplies and good gear. Sometimes it may be evenly and fairly spread-out - so you find a good bit of everything in moderate ammount... And sometimes it gets silly. On my previous to last playthrough i found 5 can openers, no MREs, no repair tools, one almost broken knife and ton of degraded clothing. I still managed 41 days and died of stupidity (went to bed while freezing, and hoped I'll warm up... I didn't), but be warned - never know what you might get and life isn't always fair :)\n\nLONG DARK - No matter what you do, in the end your character is goind to punch that snuff button and check out. That can be quite depressing, that after toughing it out for 2-3 months, heroically navigating through blinding blizzards, savagely fighting wolves for half frozen (and half eaten) deer carcasses, you still going to die. I know - it wouldn't be "The Long Dark" game if you didn't fade into the long dark in the end and it makes this game highly competitive among the players, but it would be nice if there was an option for some sort of happy ending to the game. Maybe they'll do it for story mode later on.\n\nFLUFFY - I am not going to spoil it for you. You'll get to know him as you play the game. Be afraid... be very afraid... and never let your guard down. Cause the very moment you think you're safe and relax, the cruel reality will bite you in the ***... literally.\n\nOther than that - there are no bad things about this game. I wouldn't even use a word "bad" to describe all of the above - there are no bad things, just areas for improvement (just please don't change fluffy - leave him where he is - we all love him really... ok, he's completely evil ***hole, but it wouldn't be so much fun without him).\n\nNow, that we are done with those negative waves, let us switch to the positive side and see how beatiful this game is :)\n\nPROS:\n\nREALISM - Ok,.. let's get this straight - no simulator will duplicate the real thing - ever. As an ex-marine and keen climber and outdoorsman, I could have listed countless things that can be added to this game, from the realism perspective. But, so far, this game is as close as computer game can get to real-life survival (if you know anything better - please feel free to suggest). It is not casual, it is not skyrim with most hardcore "eat, sleep, drink" mods, it does not hold your hand, nor cuts you any slack. It's simple - "ok, you're in **** - get surviving"... and if you can't - hey, it's natural selection for you. So forget all the fancy Bear Grylls shows - no climbing cliffs, no running butt-naked through the winter forest and then trying to replenish your calories by munching on a squirell. Conserve your calories whenever and wherever you can, keep warm and hydrated, keep your gear in working order and adapt adequately to anything the wilderness throws at you - no heroics, no pointless wondering or taking chances, just timely well-planned actions... or it's game over.\n\nIMMERSION - The atmosphere of this game is absolutely marvellous. Nevermind cartoon graphics - sound, tension and your imagination (if you have any) totally do their trick. Howling of the wind outside at night, does set the mood in, whilst howling of the wolves at dusk, will send that tingle down your spine and motivate you to keep your rifle handy and get inside as soon as you can. And there is a really cosy and safe feeling, when you are sitting by the fire late at night, cooking your meal and celebrating your survival for yet another day.\n\nREPLAYABILITY - As mentioned before, the loot is pretty random. So every time the gear made available for the picking would be a little different and so will be your situation. Sometimes it will be bad and other times it will be just plain awful... Deal with it :)\n\nFLUFFY - Well, you know... :)\n\nFinally, let us take a quick look on things, that have been criticized by many players, but that are not entirely that bad.\n\nBALANCE - There have been numerous complaints from the players about calories ticking away too fast or equipment degrading too fast. It's a fair point, but guys - let's not forget that this is a game and players should be kept occupied. There would be a lot less to do if your equipment didn't degrade overtime and so the game would be just repetitive cooking and wood-foraging almost from start to finish. And that's a bit boring - don't we all agree?\n\nIf we are talking realism, then how about adding the fact that your clothing will be soaking wet after couple of hours outside, thus will become a lot colder not overtime but right away and will require good bit of drying to become warmer again? Or how about the fact that your ammo may get damp and unusable, or your rifle itself will require good thorough cleaning regularly, or wood that also will require drying, before it can be set on fire with a match and paper? And so on, and so on... Full realism will make some things easier, but will make a load of other things the hell of a lot harder. So stop wimpering, fix those damn woolen socks with a bit of cloth, patch up can opener with some rusty scrap metal and get out there :)))\n\nWOLVES - To my surprise I've seen quite a few complaints about abundance of wolves in the game and the wolf AI. Personally I do not know why anyone would complain about wolves - wolves in this game are your best friends, right after your winter coat, rifle and knife. In fact you may not need rifle when you got those guys around. On my last playthrough I have run out of ammo, by about 70th day. I survived for almost 30 days more. Guess how? I waited untill some wolf takes down a deer, then scared him off with a flare or fought him off with my fists and hoooray - 8kg of free venison every time. All thanks to wolves... poor buggers - I owe them some beers.\n\nAs to complaints about a wolf AI, I don't see what's wrong with it. Yes - the hungry wolf in the middle of the winter will try to have you for lunch - if there's no easier prey to be had, they will attack human (both in this game and for real). Once again - be thankful for "non-realism" and having to deal with lone wolves every time. In real life you'd have a whole pack of them on your ***. Do you feel lucky? :)\n\nIt seems like my word limit is up... Shame :) Anyway - get this game and play it. It's 100% worth it.\n\nThanks for reading :)","October 13, 2014","true","37.6"," 956 of 982 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","956","982","4","25"

When I stop playing The Long Dark, I feel exactly like that. Not really of course, but my brain believes it. The Long Dark is really immersive.\n\nThe difficulty is also something to savour. You don't have to fight a single living thing and can still die an embarrassing death. Just today, I managed to walk in big circles twice. In a game. Jesus.\n\nI was also too afraid to go out at night because of big bad wolves and cold, but then I finally did go out. And the game stunned me with the sky. I wished I could just lie down on the snow and gaze.\n\nThen the music started playing. The beautiful soft music by the amazing Cris Velasco & Sascha Dikiciyan.\n\nI couldn't stay in one spot for too long, though, because I'd freeze soon. So I started walking when, on the horizon, I saw a house! With smoke coming out its chimney, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it was beautiful. Should be some food in it so I was definitely not going to die of hunger. At least not tonight.\n\nBut then I realized it's the house I took off from. God dammit.\n\nUpdate: Two negative reviews have gotten to the top and they raise some understandable points with regards to gameplay mechanics and features. I strongly suggest you watch some gameplay videos to see if these issues might be game-breaking for you - you never know. The game cannot be 100% realistic in all manners and makes some adjustments to some of the mechanics such as durability of tools and clothes, etc.\n\nPersonally, I really don't mind them because to me, The Long Dark still offers lots of beautiful experiences, great gameplay and immersiveness which I'm oh so enjoying. But, be warned, you might be expecting something a bit different from the game than what it offers and these might not be due to the game being in Alpha but simply a core aspect of the game itself - so read/video up on it and decide for yourself!","September 22, 2014","true","26.5"," 930 of 998 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","930","998","0","20"

How long can you last against the wrath of Mother Nature until you succumb to the Long Dark?\n\nIntroductionIn The Long Dark, a survival & exploration game, the initial set-up is quite simple. You can choose to begin your story from either the Mystery Lake or Coastal Highway and then maintain your health (condition) by dealing with:\nhunger (as displayed by remaining calories)\ncold\nthirst\nexhaustionAt the same time you must explore your environment for critical supplies and beware of wandering too far from a shelter. In this game the worst threat won't be anything living but rather the general inhospitable surroundings. A roaring blizzard, threatening to put you to a cold shallow grave of ice, can be just as deadly to get lost in as to take shelter from in a cabin without any food, water or firewood.\n\nThere exists a constant risk/reward status where you must weigh just what can you do and what you MUST do that puts you in a fairly stressful (and even frightening) situation.\n\n\nSurvival mechanics 8/10After a few deaths and then surviving over 50 days, I can say the threats can be tough but are in the end fair. There are multiple ways to greatly enhance your odds of survival, namely finding better clothes and tools, but there's no substitute for exploration and familiarizing oneself to the surroundings. There are no maps or compasses so remembering landmarks is imperative for finding your back to safety...\n\nThe balance of staying outside to scavenge, hunt, fish and get firewood for cooking, heating and melting&boiling snow for drinking water while also tending to your clothes, tools and potential medical conditions isn't easy, but perhaps one of the finest points is the slightly reduced need for the tiniest of micro management. Getting firewood, melting snow, fixing, sleeping and even harvesting can be set to take place for a predefined amount of time or quantity, which makes managing your ever-dvindling energy more straight-forward and makes organizing easier.\n\nThere's also a day-night cycle and even if the sky is free of clouds, without a flare or lantern it will be all but impossible to see anything once sunlight's gone. During the night it will also be potentially much colder and also harder to spot the hungry predators. The sight of glowing eyes approaching is enough to chill your blood from a whole different reason than the cold...\n\nWhile it can be easy to survive for some time with scavenging alone, it will eventually be a near must to hunt for your meals. And even then the management of limited resourses like medicine and cloths will potentially either make or break your survival. Luckily you can improve your own effectivity at lighting fires, crafting tools and repairing items to make longer term sustainibility possible but long-term thinking is a necessity to survive.\n\nA bit of a heads-up so your not caught off guard, being in strong wind or a blizzard will wear down your clothes rather quickly even if you take windcover in a broken shack or the hut of an icefisher. Hopefully this will see a change in the future updates as it will limit your range to the vicinity of shelters that can be closed properly.\n(Oof a blizzard, I'll take cover from it in this hut with a furnace in it and fish... oops, my jacket, hat, shirt, shoes and everything just ripped from the wind wear in this OBVIOUS wind trap causing me to freeze to death despite a burning hot furnace next to me. -_-)\n\n\nAsthetics - (9/10)The Long Dark has somewhat stylized graphics, giving it a small pseudo-2D impression that plays very well with warm shades in light and cold shades during dusk. A lit fireplace won't light the surroundings as much as an open flame, but it has its own beutiful profile against an otherwise pitch black cabin. A very impressive view unfolds from high-up, overlooking the costal winterland.\n\nAlso, even though there's no story mode, the sandbox mode contains quite a bit of lore on its own. Finding a frozen corpse, collapsed against a tree; an abandoned home with a cooked meat still in its oven or a run-down power-station share their own silent bits of story. There are also multiple named locations around the world, not only to make navigation a bit easier but also dwell futher into the lore of the environment you stroll in.\n\n\nMusic - 8/10This game doesn't have an abundance of varying tracks but if one were to categorize them, they should be call mystical. The somber and somewhat distant-ish music serves as a great auditive tool that greatly supports an image of a seemingly unreal frozen world which might just be a dream. The cues inform you about a dawn breaking, a night approaching, a grievous end or perhaps about a dire situation among many other things that can only be found out by exploring this lonely world.\n\nIf I close my eyes, when I wake up all the snow will have disappeared and the town'll look like nothing had happened...\n\n\n\nAs a closing statement, this game can be surprisingly tense and stressful when fighting against all odds to keep you alive. I recommend this game to anyone interested in asthetics, mythical music and eager for a survival story in the now quite lonely cold world. The most successful survivors have lasted over 100 days. Perhaps there might be salvation if you last long enough...\n\n-This review is from up to v.166 early access and covers the sandbox mode of the time. The upcoming story mode and tweaks / additional features to the mechanics aren't.-","December 1, 2014","true","169.5"," 573 of 602 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","573","602","0","13"

I WANT to like it a lot more.  It's by far the closest I've gotten to a "true survival" simulator -- just you against the elements, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t zombies or getting insta-killed every spawn by naked dudes.  But as many (recent) reviewers have said after spending a few hours in-game, the "realism" starts to quickly fade.\n\n--Clothes do not fall from your body into tattered rags after four days of exposure.\n--Hatchets do not shatter after cutting up three pieces of wood.\n--CAN OPENERS DO NOT BREAK AFTER OPENING SIX CANS.  I still have the same can opener I bought 12 years ago and use it almost daily.  It still works.  It has not broken.\n--Fires can be rekindled from hot embers.\n--Boiling water you just boiled doesn't make it "safer".  You already boiled it, remember?\n--Falling down the equivalent of a few feet does not sprain/break one's ankle.  The human body can take more than that, or we'd all be extinct.\n\nI could go on and on but I'd just be parroting what others have said already.  The game WANTS to be an "uber-realistic take on what IRL wilderness survival would be like" but it consistently makes baffling and unrealistic design choices in order to ratchet up the "hardcore difficulty".  I'm not saying I'd do very well surviving on my own in a freezing wasteland -- just that my sorry, untrained ♥♥♥ would probably still be better off than The Long Dark's protagonist that has to deal with wooden things he can't burn, weapons he can't swing, and (again) METAL TOOLS THAT BREAK AFTER BEING USED, LIKE, TWICE.  I've used plastic sporks IRL that lasted longer than the STEEL CROWBARS in this game!\n\nAlso -- fix the ♥♥♥♥ing wolves' AI or take them out of the game entirely.  Unfair, unfun, and the definition of unrealistic.  Or let me fight them off with the hatchet and knife I have on me.  ANYTHING except the inevitable attack and subsequent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini-game to punch them off of me.\n\nThis all sounds incredibly negative, yet I'm still recommending it?\nYes, I am.\n\nLike I started off saying, this game is still the closest thing to my dream "survival simulator" I've ever played.  But Hinterland?  You guys need to either focus on "simulation" or "difficulty", because they are not the same thing.  You might think it would make it more boring, but bringing the gameplay mechanics closer to "realistic simulation" instead of "hardcore difficulty" could be the thing that takes this from "yet another survival game" to "THE most realistic survival simulator ever made".\n\nWhich do you want to make?  Which would we gamers rather spend our money on and play?\n\nDon't buy this game yet, guys.  But definitely keep an eye on it.  It has potential out the ♥♥♥, but right now it's just kinda......♥♥♥.\n\nI like this game, I do.  But I WANT to like it so much more.\n","September 24, 2014","true","96.3"," 638 of 678 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","638","678","0","29"

This game drops you in all alone with little to no knowledge of how to live (unless you read a bunch of guides like me). The not knowing what to do part of the game is what makes this game the most satisfying when you finally get a couple days in. Ok time to stop writing this like a high school paper I'll make this review a simple bullet point guide of the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros\n- In depth hunger, thirst and cold stats in game\n- Beautiful Graphics (Not much of a machine hog either)\n- Immersive HUD (meaning almost no HUD except for little indicators for when you're getting cold or hungry)\n- Nice and simple inventory system\n- Perfect first-aid system\n- Time consuming crafting\n- Simple hunting system (Skinning and drying)\n- Nice weather system\nCons\n- Wolf AI still needs work\n- Not many crafting options (I can understand why there isnt a lot but a few more would be better)\n- Early Access (bugs)\n\nThere is not a lot of cons when it comes to this game but I'm sure there is a few minor cons on this game.

It seems like there's a new survival game coming to Steam's Early Access every single month. The majority of these games are virtually identical and most have zombies, or something zombie-like. It's almost comical. This is exactly why a game like The Long Dark is so refreshing.\n\nThe Long Dark is a survival game in the truest sense of the word. There's no zombies. There are no monsters. You don't start with a stone age weapon and craft your way up to an assault rifle. It's simply man versus nature. You must stay warm, find food, and stay hydrated. All while enduring terrible conditions and potentially deadly wildlife. You'll freeze to death. You'll bleed out after fending off a wolf attack. Maybe you'll find yourself wandering aimlessly, lost, eventually succumbing to exhaustion. The Long Dark is a cold, visceral game, with an incredibly absorbing atmosphere. It looks gorgeous and it sounds amazing. Everything about the game experience is engrossing and artfully designed.\n\nThe Long Dark is one of the best designed, beautiful, and atmospheric games on Steam. And it's certainly one of the best survival games of all time.","May 26, 2015","true","20.3"," 405 of 423 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","405","423","13","2"

If anybody is interested, check my screenshots.*\n\nThe single most terrifying game ever made. And not cheap terror like a teleporting white guy in a suit that magically kills you no matter what you do. Not random jump scares. Not even with a monster or killer. Your own mind scares you. You're alone. You don't really know why, but everybody is dead, covered in frost and dead. All of the wolves are rabid and deadly, sure, (9/10 deaths will be to wolves) but they arent the scary thing. the cold isnt the scary thing. Nothing in the game is scary, and yet it's terrifying. It's the isolation. You. Are. Alone.\n\nAfter a few hours in a session if you've got a headset on and no distractions, every bookself becomes a serial killer. The creaks and groans of the old buildings are a monster creeping up on you. You know you are safe yet you are terrified. You set up your sleeping bag in the corner of a building so nothing can be behind you when you wake up. You waste matches or lantern oil to see in a building you've already looted and know the route of because the dark is scary. The isolation is simply torture, and i love to dread it. 10/10 for atmosphere.\n\nAs for the game itself... well, you're in northern canada and there's no electricity, and everybody is dead. Don't freeze. Don't starve. Don't get mauled by a wolf. The game is fairly realistic, one killed deer or wolf can sustain you for a long time, their hides are warm, and the wolves aren't zombies. They run if you throw a flare or swing a torch. All the mechanics are solid and they still claim it to be alpha. It's worth a purcase now, and they still regularly add things - just imagine what it could become. If you are any kind of fan of indie games, sandbox survival games, or real psychological terror, then this game is a 100% neccassary purchase. Wishlist it, right now, or better yet buy it.\n\nIf you want to see some footage as preview to see if its worth it, i reccomend "Splattercat" he's an ex geologist meaning he knows a lot about how to not die when you're in the wilderness hours from a town, and so he mentions what makes sense and what doesnt. But seriously, toss these devs a bone, let's make them rich, so they can finish the game and go on to make more awesome games. These guys put actual heart into the game, and that's rare lately.\n\n*New Addition to Review* Clarification on the three "difficulties" the "easy mode" is minecraft peaceful, nothing to kill you but your own stupidity. not reccomended. "Normal" is wolves and bears, wolves rabid, bears cool as long as you dont shoot them - and you back off if they stand on hind legs and roar (basically them saying "f*** off") - they're cool and wolves even avoid them, so keeping one near your base isnt an awful idea, although killing one will sustain you for weeks.  Hard mode is zombie apocalypse basically. if you want to be mauled to death every five minutes, go ahead. All this review is refering to the "normal" mode, i don't advise either of the others aside from if you think you want a real challenge... of luck (If you find a rifle before you find 60 wolves).","October 30, 2015","true","44.6"," 382 of 397 people (96%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","96","382","397","29","29"

As you might have guessed, I am very fond of the game. I've held off on writing a review because I just don't think I can do the game justice, but I'll try.\n\nSo what do I love about the game to warrant such an embarrassing amount of hours in the game? I'll try to explain:\n\nThe graphics. They are beautiful and with the recent upgrade to Unity 5, the graphics became absolutely gorgeous. The beautiful snow-frosted branches of the trees swaying in the breeze; the stark mountains against a beautiful sometimes stormy, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes sunny skyline; The beautiful, but scary nighttime with the aurora borealis, moon, and stars smattering the sky; the bright green, glowing eyes of the wolves...er wait...more scary than beautiful those critters are. :)\n\nThe sound. The voice actors are Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale at the time of this review. Veterans of the industry, with titles such as Mass Effect under their belts. The beautiful stinger music that signals a change in weather or time of day. The haunting, creepy music when you discover a corpse inside a house sometimes. The music is not overdone, perfectly placed, so you don't lose that feeling of abandonment. The sound effects, the creaking and groaning of the trees, the wind, footsteps crunching in the snow, the lonely hoot of an owl, the ringing in your ears when you shoot the rifle indoors, the skin-crawling sighing and muttering when in the "creepier" locations, the snarling, howling, and barking of the wolves. The sounds and music in the game are one of my most favorite aspects of the game and it's hard to list them all or describe the feelings of immersion you experience. You must experience them first-hand to truly "get it".\n\nThe game mechanics. You have to be careful, you have to be smart, you have to be patient or you die. I love this, it's the player in full control, how long you survive is based on the decisions you make. Plan ahead, learn from past mistakes. Unlike most video games I don't mind dying in this game. I don't feel cheated because I learn what NOT to do or how I can do it better. The saying "you make your own destiny" seems applicable to the gameplay. It's a sandbox, there's no linear path you are forced to follow, you can immerse yourself fully and explore to your heart's content. There are three modes of play: easy, medium, difficult. A fit for everyone- from peaceful exploration to death around every corner.\n\nThe developers. The developers have always been very involved in the community on Steam and also on their own Hinterland forum and Reddit. They are AAA title veterans who know what they are doing. The updates to the game are frequent and fun. Hotfixes practically same day. They have a zero tolerance for bugs in their game and it shows in this quality product. It's hard to believe it's an Early Access title. I haven't found a more polished one.\n\nThe best part? It's like a free gift everytime there is an update. More fun stuff to check out for free! Another "best part"...the sandbox will remain available even when story mode is released for the people who enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the story mode, but I adore the sandbox survival.\n\nTL/DR: Get this beautiful, quality game. It's Early Access with a twist - it feels like a complete game already!\n\nI hope this review helps someone. If not, drop by the forums, you'll find a wonderful and helpful community.","April 25, 2015","true","539.5"," 239 of 245 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","239","245","9","4"

I wouldn't last 5 hours in Minecraft. But this game makes you feel like you can survive anything... until you run out of matches.\n\nFor example, here is how I last died.\nI ran into the Trapper's Homestead, sprinting to get out of the freezing cold wind. I was looking for food; peaches, candy, anything I could get in my belly. I looked through the locker, the box under the bed, the first aid kit on the wall, but didn't find anything but an old can opener. Then I looked up, and I swear I heard a heavenly chorus, because sitting on a rack on the wall was something so much more valuble than a granola bar. As I took the old hunting rifle off the wall, I felt a sense of awe come over me. I looked at the nicks and dents and thought of all the stories that they contain, and how many more tales I would write with this pen of steel and wood. After looking around a little more, I decided to try my hand at cracking the safe I found next to the workbench. After several tries I finally got the code down, and lo and behold, inside was a box of 5 rifle shells. By now I was feeling like Rambo. I would not die to this cruel world!\nI survived by hunting the game that I saw in the clearing in front of the homestead that I had claimed as my home, and cooking the meat that I carved off their collapsed frames. I lived this way for about a week, until one very important setback to my otherwise flawless plan - I ran out of matches. But I wouldn't let that tiny detail stop me; I am the great VinyGroundhog! I will not succumb to the meager needs of hunger or cold! And thus my journey begain. I searched from house to house for those tiny life-sticks, but each and every one had been picked clean on a previous venture. I realized that there was only one place where I could find what I needed, one place that I had avoided like the plague. I was going to have to tackle the dam.\nAs I walked into the dam, flare in hand, I looked for Fluffy the Terrible, Killer of Men and Crusher of Souls. I searched through the entire dam for this beast of legend, but nowhere was she to be found. Not able to contain my exitement, I set about looting the dam with a newfound vigor. I looked in the main room. No matches. I looked in the closet. No matches. I looked in the control room. Still, no matches. Soon I reached the conlusion that I was going to have to go downstairs. I walked down the first set of stairs, and as I rounded the corner, there was a nightmare standing in front of me. I stared at Fluffy, and she at me. We stood at a sort of stalemate for around thirty seconds. And then I ran like a coward. I made it up the stairs and Almost made it out when I was knocked down from behind. As I looked at those menacing jaws that I had fallen to so many times before, I knew that I was nearing my end. We struggled for what  seemed an eternity, and then I finally kicked the evil beast off of me, turning and sprinting through the door as fast as I could. By now it was night, and probably had been for a while. I struggled away from that horrible place, blood dripping down into the snow beneath. I looked around in my pack, and found nothing to treat my wounds. I walked along the train tracks, freezing, starving, dehydrated, and bleeding to death. I looked around and saw that I wasn't going to make it. But I refused. I would not die on the terms of a wolf, no matter that it sent me here. And then I thought of a way that I could stand up to the tyranny of the wolf.\nI sprinted to the logging area, and then I found the hill I was looking for. I started up the hill, made it a few yards, and subsequently fell off the hill and sprained my ankle. But I wouldn't let that stop me. I started back up the hill, limping this time, and made it farther, and farther, and farther without falling. And as I hobbled up the last few yards of the hill, freezing, starving, dehydrated, limping, and tired as anything, I saw the sun start to rise. I walked over to the edge of the hill, my vision rolling with every step, and sat down, leaning against a rock. And as my life reached its dusk, the world around me reached its dawn.\n\nThat is what this game does to you. It puts you on a high, which lasts a not inconsiderable time, and then it takes away one thing, and you begin this slow descent into your death. And that's why I love it. It's an Emotional rollercoaster. Everything that happens in the game impacts not only your in-game effigy, but you, as a living, breathing human being. However, there are a few things that I wouldn't mind changing...\n\nHinterland, If you're reading this, Please take note.\n\nThe game world is easily the loneliest one I have every encountered. It even beats pre-NPC Minecraft. Please fix this. Give me a dog, or better yet, multiplayer! What I wouldn't give to either help or hinder other players in the fight for survival.\n\nBirds. Everytime I see a bird in the game, all I can think about is the potential meat on those hollow bones. Just give me a way to hunt them, or trap them. a shotgun would be nice.\n\nAll things considered, this is a very good buy. It's probably my favorite PC game right now. 10/10","November 26, 2014","true","10.0"," 387 of 422 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","387","422","3","36"

So i'll just give you the lowdown of my favorite playthrough (Of dozens of great ones)\n\nDay 1:\nPlane crashed somewhere in the woods near a frozen pond and a hunting blind. I found (much to my joy) two granola bars and a bottle of water. Walking through the cold, i picked up a few sticks and some lichen just in case i needed to start a fire. After about 5 minutes of walking i found an old logging camp with three trailer houses. I scavenged a promising amount of food, got some matches, and even found an out ski jacket to wear over my sweater. Exhausted, i spent the night.\n\nDay 2:\nI wake up rested and thirsty as hell. I pop open a soda and head out. It's early morning and freezing, but i need to find a suitable place to bunker down, and those little trailers werent it. Following the snow covered trail through the woods, i pass a forest overpass. It's a long hike up in freezing weather and deep snow so i decide against, moving further down the trail. Right as i start to wonder if i had made the wrong choice, i hit a small frozen lake full of Ice-fishing huts. I dot through them and find a good set of stuff before i decide to bunker down in one for a little rest. After a few failed attempts i get the fire in the furnace going. I hear the wind picking up outside, but thinking nothing of it. I lay out my bedroll by the fire for a few hours sleep.\nI wake up to what i was sure to be my death.\nThat light pickup of wind was a precursor to a blizzard. A bad one. The little hut was shaking and creaking in the storm, the opening (there was no door) let in frigid air and snow, putting out my fire and freezing me to the core. I gather my things in a panic. The storm is so fierce it's picking up snow that had settled on the ground, whiting out everything. I culdn't see five feet in front of me. Knowing staying in the hut would be my end, i blindly push into the storm, assumingly towards some camping lodges i saw when i first arrived. The wind cut straight through my clothes and the snow soaked my jeans, shoes and socks. My body trembled uncontrollably as heat was quite literally ripped from my body. After a few minutes the ice of the lake gave way to snow and i was sure i was close to salvation. I keep walking forward, waiting to see a beautiful log cabin any second.\nThen i walk straight into a rock wall.\nPanicking and wondering how the hell i got so turned around, i follow the wall, hoping beyond hope to find something to keep me safe until the blizzard gave way. I wasn't going to die yet, not here. I willed myself on, even when i felt so tired from the powerful wind i was ready to just drop. Eventually the rock wall gaveway to a some kind of house. Nearly collasping from relief, i get inside and fall asleep immediately, no energy left for anything else.\n\nDay 3:\nApparentely this used to be a park ranger station. It was obviously abandoned in haste, as plenty of things were still left over. The blizzard is still raging, but im safe inside, with a decent supply to last me a few days. I cut up some furniture for wood with the hatchet i found in the closet and get the fireplace roaring. A get some snow quickly from outside and boil it for water, then i eat a hardy meal of beef jerky and a candy bar. I stay up a bit to assess my gear. Somehow i don't have hypothermia, but my pants looks a little worse for wear. I pathc them up with cloth then call it a day, i'm still exhausted from yesterday.\n\nDays 5:\nI'm stuck in the ranger hut for another full day. Finally, on Day 5 since my crash, the storm lets up to beautiful weather. I pack my things and head out, the Ranger station now depleted of useful things for me. I crunch along fresh now and a warm sun for a while, reminded of why i used to love skiing in New Mexico. After a while i find train tracks and few wrecked cars. It must of been carrying aid to somwhere becuase scattered amongst the snow i found antiseptic bottles, bandages, a bottle of painkillers and 3 flares. I rest for a bit and have a snack and a sip fo water, and move on. A little past 12ish i find what looks like an old hydrodam. Knowing there could be emergancy supplies and food inside, i make a beeline towards it and walk in, shutting the old iron door behind me.\nThe place is pitch black. I have to light one of my flares just to see. I look around for a bit, find a prybar and some other useful items including some workers old scarf (My new scarf now), and decide i'm going to spend the night here.\nWrong decision.\nAs i preparing to set my bedroll down i hear a growl behind. Spinning around, the light from my flare provides me a eerie and terrifying look down the nearby hallway, where a wolf is looking right back at me, growling dangerously. Slowly, i begin to back out towards the door, and he charges me. I panic and throw the flare at him, which seems to scare him long enough for me to fly out the door and across the snow as fast as my damn legs could carry me. I run into the train tunnel and slow to a walk, trying to catch my breath, thank god the weather was still nice. I come out the other end just as the sun begins to set, and find myself in a massive ravine.\nAfter some hopping and skipping and a scary balancing act on a tree that feel across a 50 foot drop, i find a sheltered area behind a old train car and set up camp. I start a fire and give it enough wood to last the night. As i eat dinner i watch the sun set over the horizon. The light reflecting on far distant snow creates a beautiful allusion of fire, as if the horizon around me was burning briliantly. When it sets i am treated to freezing tempertures and a starry sky. I crawl into my bedroll and shut my eyes, hoping to god the weather treats me well.\n\nDay 6:\nI was lucky, i woke up to a light snow and nothing else. Hardly any wind. No wolves dragged me away last night so that was also a positive. Thanking my lucky stars i pack up and begin my journey west, to the coast. From there i planto keep heading down south to warmer weather. After traversing a particuarly large and rickety wooden train bridge (And almost falling to my death twice) i go through another tunnel and break out into the coastline.\nIt was a beautiful sight. The sun glowing over all that sea ice. I would have watched forever if i wasnt freezing. Crawling down the mountain, i find another small trailer house (For the train unloading crew, i presume) and rest there. It felt nice to be inside again after almost 2 days in the wilderness.\n\nDay 7:\nOne week after my crash. Woo... Anyway, i woke up to howling this morning. More wolves. I headed further down the hill, another flare at the ready (I didnt even bother wielding an Axe, im not a swordsman). Sure enough, i run into one near the highway. It circles me before charging. I throw the flare at it and it runs away. Relieved, i walk over to pick up the flare when suddenly another wolf turns the corner, running after me full speed. I turned and ran like hell towards a cabin down the road. But right before i got to the door he grabbed my leg and i tried. In moments he was on top of me, ripping at the arm i threw up to defend my body. I hit him over and over until he finally let go, running away and barking angrily. Bleeding and hurt, i crawled into the cabin to treat my wounds, sure this was the end. I treated my wounds with antiseptic, bandged them up and took some painkillers. Then i slept.\n\nI survived, and made my way to a cabin on a small island across the frozen bay. On my way, a white out struck. I couldn't see anything yet again. Walking slowly in hopes of not opening my wounds again. I pressed forward. Little did i know i had long past walked by the island, and was on thin ice.\nAs the whiteout cleared, I looked up. It was as if every star in the universe was looking down at me. Somewhere in my mind, as the cold enveloped me, i wondered if anyone was out there...\nThen I fell through the ice.","September 11, 2015","true","14.5"," 297 of 315 people (94%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","94","297","315","67","4"

It can and will catch you unawares, even if you consider yourself one of the most prepared.\n\nIt was on my 79th day that things started to go horribly wrong. I wandered off from the gas station I had for the past 40 days considered safe haven. I had a gallon of water, a rifle with plenty of ammo, and enough food to last me a night should I get stranded. It wasn't enough.\n\nI always thought it would be the wolves that would get me. They had been traveling in packs of 2-3 lately; if all of them came at me, surely I would take down one, maybe two, but I knew if a pack came at me I would be wolf bait. I was wrong. As I wandered up the coast, it started to get cold, as night drew closer. I heard an eerie baying close by - a wolf. I prepared myself, searching in all directions. It came charging, snarling and snapping its jaws. I took it down, but then I heard more growling - its pack. I knew standing my ground was a death sentence, so I ran, and I ran. To my luck, I came across a sea side cottage, to which I quickly escaped the snapping jaws of death in its enclosure.\n\nI thought to myself "I'll just stay the night here, let the wolf pack wander off." I foraged around for food - there wasn't much. Some salty crackers, a soda, and some frozen cooked rabbit. I drank half of my water, and ate some of my cooked wolf jerky that I had in my pack and began to kip for the night.\n\nI awoke to the screaming howl of the wind the next morning. I poked my head out and surely enough pure white out conditions. It had to have been at least -40, and going out would be just as surely a death sentence as the wolf pack was. I hunkered down, sipped my water and gnawed the last bits of the jerky as I drifted off to sleep to the symphony of cracking trees and ice falling. I woke a few hours later. The wind had died down! It was time. I drank the last of my water, and ate the cooked rabbit I had retrieved from the freezer previously.\n\nThis was a mistake. Not long after I finished the rabbit, there was the gut wrenching pain. I knew instantly: Food poisoning. I forced down some antibiotics I kept in my med kit, laid down praying for it to go away, or the release of a quick death. The wolves didn't sound so bad, now. I drifted off to darkness...\n\nI awoke several hours later, the sun was just rising. I was starving, thirsty, and the howling wind was louder than ever. I had no choice. I steeled myself, eating the last few saltines in my pack, greedily drinking the soda I had found before leaving the house.\n\nI immediately bolted. I knew with this cold, I had very little time to get to safety. I ran and ran, only stopping mere moments to catch my breath. I was soon freezing, and I had no idea how much further I had to go. Soon, numbness set in, I stopped shivering, my body was giving up. I knew I had to keep pressing on. Finally there was a familiar car in the road. I was almost there!\n\nI was exhausted, I stumbled past the car. I could see the feint outline of the gas station through the wind and snow. There was hope! A few steps from the door I heard a growl; I turned around but it was too late. I couldn't fight  the wolf. I was too tired, too cold, too numb. On my 82nd day, I faded out, into the long dark.\n\nThe wolves got me after all.","April 11","true","95.4"," 212 of 219 people (97%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","97","212","219","34","11"

Here's how it works...\n\nYou wake up in the snow after your plane has gone down. WIth no idea as to where you are, cold, shivering, you need to find shelter fast and keep a sharp eye out for predators. Once you've found a cabin or such, you need to start thinking about the basics of survival. Water. A warm place to rest. Food. Clothing that can survive the harsh blizzards. A weapon to fend off wolf attacks. To gain the answer to these problems you must explore. At first you'll find yourself raiding abandoned cars and houses, trying not to think about the dead bodies scattered here and there following an as yet undetailed catastrophe. But the cans of pop and candy bars and such you scavange are only a temporary answer. Soon you'll have to look to be self-sufficient.\n\nSurvive the first few nights and odds are you can survive a couple of weeks. Survive those two weeks and you might survive a month. Survive that and... who knows? The genius of the game is that it perfectly balances risk, need, fear and greed. You can get carried away and suddenly discover that you've neglected something vital - something life endangering. Forget to stay stocked with fuel and you could perish from being marooned in a cave by a blizzard. Fail to carry bandages with you and you might bleed out from a wolf bite on the snowy wastes. Dehydration especially is a danger. (And no, like in real life simply eating snow will not save you.)\n\nIt can be a punishing game at first. Nothing is explained. I didn't know how to make tinder plugs or melt snow in my first game and quickly died after I ran out of my last can of fizzy goodness. But I made darn sure I figured it out the next game. The more you play, the more you find yourself thinking logically and weighing up the risks. Which is all well and good until you become obsessed about getting a bearskin bedroll and end up dooming yourself to be a chewy snack for DiCaprio's growly chum. Happily there's an excellent forum at the Hinterland website, which is very friendly. I strongly recommend it if you have trouble sussing out the game mechanics.\n\nLastly I want to talk about what makes this game truly special. It's the marriage of beautifully crafted graphics with to my mind the best sound design since Battlefield: Bad Company 2's War Tapes. At first glance the graphics appear simplistic. But you quickly come to appreciate them as being truly evocative, especially in terms of weather. Seeing the deep tread of your footprints as you hear the muffled scrumpf of snow underfoot. Watching a sunrise from the porch of your farmhouse in the morning; a hot cup of coffee a personal treat to celebrate narrowly surviving a blizzard the previous day, as you finally recognised the tell-tale signs of an oncoming storm. Looking up to see the high altitude trade winds carrying aloft the first wave of a fresh snow. And the chilly haunting fog that closes in as you return home in the late evening, a brace of coneys over your shoulder. Even simple things like waking up in the cabin and hearing the walls creak and the windows rattle as the wind blows outside... man, this game is the most atmospheric I've ever played.\n\nSo sure it's tough. And yes, wolves are unnaturally terrifying. But as soon as you come to terms with your inevitable death. As soon as you begin to treat it not as a game but as a real question of survival for yourself. And as soon as you learn to let go of trying to max everything out and just enjoy... existing... in this wonderful world HInterland have crafted. Well, then you'll find you've made something really special. Plus you can keep a journal in game!\n\nAny gripes? Each map could do with a forge, and whetstones really shouldn't break after a couple of dozen uses. (I know, game mechanic, but it's unnecessarily cruel.) Also rifles should have a longer effective range and arrows should be more available. Some items, like the maple needed to make a bow, seem unnecessarily rare and tricky to find.) And there should be a little starter guide with a few early-game lifesaving tips bundled with the game in the main menu. And I wish my character would quit complaining all the time about being hungry! It's good to be ravenous and make supplies last!\n\nDespite these niggles the game as it stands at this point in Early Access really is something quite magnificent. It is a transporting game that will have you feeling terrified at times, proud at others and most of all have you feeling that the little farmhouse in the valley has become a place of your own, a place that you can call home in a hostile world. With a story mode to come this game only looks set to become better, but for now I feel that I've definitely got my money's worth on the entrance fee. Congratulations HInterlands for recognising that surviving the natural world can be more thrilling than surviving yet another rehashed zombie invasion, and that the simple joy of felling a deer and filling one's pantry with venison as significant a victory as saving the planet in a shoot-em-up from the evil Emperors RaxinFraxin and Dixdastardlax.\n\n9/10\n\nP.S: You can find answers to many of those early game vexing questions here: http://hinterlandgames.com/join-the-community/\n","April 25","true","61.5"," 191 of 194 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","191","194","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/305620/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRummaging through garbage is a long and storied tradition in video games. Players have been raiding shelves and garbage cans for decades now, and it's hard to argue the popularity of Elder Scrolls and Fallout games is not thanks in part to the immense amount of junk you can scavenge. The Long Dark feels like an entire game built around looting, giving your lizard brain tingles every time your progress bar is interrupted by a new item. That's selling the game short, and I'll fix that, but when you're on a somber trek through a featureless snowfield, aching for a dresser to upturn, you'll remember I said that.\n\nThe Long Dark strands you in the northern wilderness of Canada in the wake of a mysterious geomagnetic event. All the people are dead, all the animals are acting weird, and all the electricity is out. You have four bars to manage if you want to survive: Temperature, fatigue, hunger, and thirst. Scrounging up leftovers and boiling snow will cover the latter two, sleeping in beds and not running everywhere will keep your fatigue down, but traversing the wilderness will freeze you fast, making warmth your most sought-after resource. The game offers a pretty robust survival sim, with many interactions between objects. You can break things down for materials to repair other things, craft tools like bows and fishing lines, and cook and store food. Just making a fire is its own skill, involving starters and fuels and accelerants and chances to fail based on all that and where you're making the attempt. A clean and slick menu interface keeps you from staring at lists too long to accomplish all this, which is some very welcome design.\n\nA big part of the game (at least early on) is indeed finding houses to loot and clicking on all the containers, while being mindful of how much you can carry. In between looting sprees, however, are journeys across the frozen wilds. The Long Dark does not screw around here, as getting lost in the woods or running into some unpleasant wildlife can very quickly be the end of you. You need plenty of daylight for exploring, and if you're lacking warm clothes you really cannot stay out very long. When one of your resource bars, such as temperature, bottoms out, it starts a percentage countdown. When that hits zero, you die. Just being outside on a windy day for an hour or two can take your bar to zero, so you have to plan all your actions carefully. Intensive activities like chopping wood or fishing are abstracted to take up to an hour unto themselves, too. The constant threat makes the game an intense survival simulator, but the barren wastes between shelters that facilitates this design can get kind of boring to traverse.\n\nThere are three difficulties to play on, depending on how eager you are to have wolves snap your appendages in half. You can also start in different areas once you find the paths to them from the starter zone, which can change your experience dramatically. The maps are not randomly generated, so having a few hours of exploration under your belt will most definitely help you survive longer. It seems that the game is designed around scavenging and getting your bearings for the first few days, and then transitioning to hunting and foraging for food and wood in true mountain man style to survive further. It's a long road to get there, though, with a lot of traipsing across snowfields and forest paths, but the painted art style and minimalist soundtrack make the solitude meaningful, and give the game a somber, melancholy feel. If you have the patience for planning long, deadly walks through the wastes, this is a solid survival choice.","November 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 169 of 176 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","169","176","12","1"

At 30% condition, exhausted, she slowly dragged herself to the barn.\n\nThe laughter soon turned to cursing, as a black bear appeared over a nearby ridge. She dropped all but her essential kit, swallowed the last few painkillers and sprinted for the door, the bear's footsteps thudding behind her.\n\nHere she was able to sleep in an abandoned pick-up, waking occasionally to chew cat-tail stalks and drink soda.\n\n24 hours of nursing later, she is fit to face the outside world once more - Eating the last of the dog food she found inside a tool chest, drinking dirty water, she resolves herself to find a new pair of trousers.\n\n-----\n\nJust as I thought this game was starting to get boring - Mystery Lake isn't very big - I found a door I'd not used before.

Not everyone does but if you are like me then you may appreciate this reveiw. I have enjoyed my short time playing it and realize the game is alpha. Maybe this will help guide your decision. Reviewed on 12/23/15\n\nCons:\n\nIts not a real sandbox. Just linear maps with fixed looting spots. You have the border around the map keeping you penned in other than the areas where you transition to the next map. The maps are small IMO.\n\nThe crafting is very limited. Stand next to a work bench and you can make only a handful of items and clothing.\n\nThere is no building, no making shelters and no tents etc other than fixed cabins and loot spots that you will quickly memorize on the map.\n\nYour goal in game is twofold: At first you will be scavenging all the loot spots for food and items like matches, weapons and tools. There aren't many different items in the game so you are basically looting the same stuff over and over. After you have exhausted your looted resources you should be at a point where you can hunt deer for food using a crafted or looted bow and arrow. That is the second part of the game.\n\nThere are no surprises, no rare loot (unless you count the prepper cache that is hidden in every map), no real goal other than to eat, drink, sleep and stay warm. That's it. Period.\n\n"Surviving" isn't very logical with some things: You stay warm based on clothing stats, so if you have a really nice coat you can go outside with no pants or shoes and still stay warm. You can be full from drinking water and sleep for 8 hours then wake up literally dying of thirst. If you have an inury just bandage it or swallow pain pills and it's instantly healed with no lingering negative effects. An example is I jumped off a 3 foot ledge landed in snow and sprang both ankles. Popped pain pills and instantly cured.\n\nYour very basic gear like bedroll, rifle, some food water, prybar for looting, medicine etc will fill your maxium weight so basically any loot you acquire will burden you and make you very slow to walk.\n\nWolf fighting without a gun is just a game of how fast can i click the left mouse button. Regardless they almost always leave you dead then run off. They eventually die from the fight but far away and you usually cant track them because you are half dead as well. Just once in a while it would be nice if I could stab the wolf to death with my knife. Just once comon.\n\nEverything decays and ridiculously fast. Pick up a box of matches and good luck if they last a couple of months before rotting. Canned food does the same. EVERYTHING you inspect by clicking on it even if you dont pick it up begins to rot. It's dumb really. Guides will tell you not to even inspect the item if you dont need it right away so it doesnt rot before you need it. If I was really surviving I would go out and gather every tool and food item I could find and bring it back to my shelter but the decay in the game makes this impractical.\n\nThere's no long term survival. Kill a bear and have tons of meat but no way to preserve it. No salting, No freezing even thou the entire earth is a frozen ball of ice. No growing vegetables indoors in a green house. No way to really sustain you other than killing an animal (which will only feed you a couple of days).\n\nThere's no other NPCs or AI other than 3-4 animals.\n\nThere are no goals other than achievements on how many days you survive. It boils down to boredom with the game. I have no interest in achievements so why would I need to keep doing the same thing over and over and over?\n\nBetween Pros and Cons there is:\nPermadeath...\nYes that's right. Spend a few days hunting and gathering and make one wrong step, go afk suddenly because your kid is crying or your cat is climbing the christmas tree and you could find yourself dead and the game automatically deletes all your saves and you have to start over with a new character. Alot of people like this because its adds real tension to playing. Some people hate it and have to go through an annoying step of copying the save files everytime they sleep or enter a building then paste them and reload entire game if you do die just to circumvent permadeath. It should be an option plain and simple.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics are really nice. They are very artistic and beautiful in their own way. Love the moon btw.\n\nWeather is really immersive. You have to plan on your outings and pray you dont get caught in a blizzard. Wake up planning and outing looking for food and you could be trapped inside due to a blizzard and starve to death.\n\nWolves will make you very paranoid as you travel from loot spot to loot spot.\n\nIts fun until you loot everything, craft everything then hit the boredom brick wall.\n\nIt has potential. And lots of it. The devs seems to update a lot. The are taking it in a nice direction.\n\nThe game is pure quality and it's in alpha? Very impressive and almost zero bugs.\n\nA storymode is in development.\n\n\nAll in all I feel that if its going to be a game about survival you need more tools to survive. Eventually all your looted knives and hatchets will break. All your matches gone. You should at least be able to craft every tool into some kind of primitive couterpart but right now that's not the case. No bow saw to make fire? I really hate fixed maps. If the game loaded a random map that was really huge it would be a lot more fun. Ill check back in from time to time as they develop it and Im actually hopeful it gets better. Wait til it goes on sale periodically is my advice.","December 22, 2015","false","59.5"," 1,384 of 1,724 people (80%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","80","384","1","64","131"

Hence why I included the date in it originally, part of the problem with early access. So take it with a grain of salt, and I'll certainly update it when I get back to it all for another peek.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nIt seems "not recommended" reviews get downvoted to hell but I'll try my best to explain ASAP.\nEarly Access review as of early January 2015:\n\nTLD has a very outstanding art style, reminiscent of Telltale's Walking Dead games, and is largely a PVE scavenging game. There's unfortunately very little motivation to go very far as it is. There's very little crafting, no building, and you're not so much 'lost in the wild' as you are just moving from house to house with some stuff in between, scavenging.\n\nI realize it's in alpha and there's more to come...but at the moment there isn't much there. However...what IS there is very good, the art style, UI, the world and levels, the mechanics behind the survival aspects like hunger and warmth, etc. There just isn't too much level interaction, creativity, and a lot of just waiting around. Lots of waiting. You don't actually gather wood, you wait. Cooking food? Wait. Sleeping, crafting, scavenging.. is all waiting.\n\n"Not recommended" is NOT the same thing as "this is a bad game" or "I don't like it." It's just at this particular moment, I wouldn't say there's enough in there to really get it. Will edit my review as time goes on and mechanics change. I like what there is so far, and it looks promising.","January 21, 2015","false","5.7"," 1,485 of 1,874 people (79%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","79","485","1","39","41"

It's gameplay mechanics have been altered completely, completely new areas have been added, and I see bug fixes almost instantly. The one thing that hasn't changed, however, is the fear it evokes. The devs completely nailed atmosphere. The music is eerie, the sound of your footsteps crunching on the snow urges you forward, and when it's pitch black and you wake up to a lone wolve's howl, well, it forces chills down your spine. You either press on, or you die. Fire is your best friend. Your attentiveness to the noises around you may save your life. The art leaves you looking forward to the sunrise the next morning, or paranoid as shadows dance over every shape around you.\n\nThe gameplay is solid. The hud is minimal. The little details truly make it an immersive game. The voice acting when your character is over-encumbered or thirsty, the descriptions of all the items you pick up, and the first-aid system are all lovely examples.\n\nThe Long Dark is personable.

I like to think The Long Dark is the only survival game that does it right. Games like Rust have elements of hunger and thirst, but are also multiplayer games where stuff like that is hard to balance without it being unfair; they become afterthoughts and the real focus of the game becomes the interaction with other players (which, more often than not, just end up in being griefed and losing everything you may have worked for).\n\nThe Long Dark is lonely, not because its a singleplayer game, but because of the environment it sets you in. The canadian wilderness, freezing and full of snow, is probably not the most ideal place to be if you aren't smart enough to survive. Within the first ten minutes of playing, your goal should be to find shelter to shield yourself from the cold and scavenge for provisions. Warmth is essential in this game, just like hunger, thirst, and sleep is. Achieving a delicate balance is hard because you are always going to be needing something so you don't end up catching hypothermia, or dying of thirst and hunger.\n\nThose aren't the only threats in the game, however. If you play on the normal difficulty, you'll have a nice grace period before things like wolves and bears start spawning and making it much harder for you to traverse the wilderness. The hardest difficulty has these things up and running right off the bat. Wolves are especially dangerous, because they are more than willing to chase you down to the ends of the earth unless they lose sight of you mid chase. Things like decoys help to distract them but you end up losing food as a result; rifles can also be used to take them out from a distance, but you end up wasting ammuniton which is a precious commodity.\n\nThere are small details in this game that show you just how well they crafted this. Things like how the items you carry make different sounds, the way you can interact with your environment like harvesting shelves and tables for wood, and how the more tired you get, the less you can carry until you are well rested. These small things make such a big impact on how you play the game at times.\n\nFor whatever price they are asking, The Long Dark is absolutely worth every cent. There is a lot of replayability with the different environments you can play in, and there will be more to do with every update and when story mode finally hits. If you love survival games, or perhaps this is the first time you are going to try one, its essential you pick up The Long Dark.","December 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 142 of 149 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","142","149","7","5"

The last major "improvement" to the game was the addition of a new zone.\n\nMy problem with this game is that it is extremely limited in it's current state and it seems like the devs have drastically slowed down in their progress. In it's current state this game is worth about 5-10 hours of gameplay to most people. The problem is that after you find good clothing and a gun there truly is nothing left that this game offers. It turns into an endless cycle of forage wood -> melt snow for water -> kill a deer/wolf for food -> sleep. Sadly the only other thing there is to do is "explore" and loot, however the cabins and other buildings around both maps are quite generic. In the new map I exit out of the game after 30 minutes of running around and searching 30 drawers per house, because that's all there is to do.\n\nI'm not saying this isn't a nice game, it has a lot of potential and for the first few hours it is quite fun but I wouldn't buy it if you're expecting to get a lot of hours of gameplay. You'd be better off going for one of the thousand generic zombie survival crafting games because although they all basically do the same god damn thing and 95% of them aren't finished games, there is still 10x more to do in them than in The Long Dark.\n\nIf the devs didn't quit on this game yet it can turn into something great, for now I would not recommend. Let the down votes begin, someone had to say it.\n\n***EDIT*** Feb.10/2015\n\nAs per request I am gonna do a short update on this review. There was a large new region added a few days ago. This region doubled the sandbox size. Apart from the new region I've noticed you can now craft a few pieces of clothing that you can't get as loot, and some sort of medicine you can make using plants that you find. Apart from this the only new thing I've noticed is the addition of bears. Everything else is exactly the same, you forage wood, kill animals/fish, melt snow, and loot generic cabins and houses. As I expected this update simply gives a larger total sandbox size, yet does nothing to enhance the gaming experience.\n\nIf the devs are reading this, you guys need to do something new. Stop working on generic maps that give you close to nothing new to do, finish the storyline cuz that ♥♥♥♥ sounds like it could be fun as hell. Work on a more complex crafting system, and in general start thinking outside the box because currently you guys just seem to be adding more of the same ♥♥♥♥ with the smallest of changes. It's just sad to see a game like this that has a lot of potential follow a one way street that is taking it nowhere. I hope anyone reading this review doesn't misunderstand me, I personally like this game and I am rooting for it. However, the way it is going it's just simply not worth the money, anyone considering this game should wait until it's fully released (comes out of early access).\n\n***Update on review***\n\nThis is not an update for the game, just wanted to comment on all the feedback that this review has been getting. First off let me start by thanking everyone who contributed to this review, I am amazed at how much attention this has gotten! Getting to the point though, a lot of you have been posting stupid replies that in no way contribute to the effectiveness of this review. If you want to comment on my opinion, by all means. I will leave comments up here that disagree with me because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you comment repetitive spam that does not contribute to this review it will be removed. Stuff like "youre stupid man this game is awesome dont listen to him" is not useful for people doing research on this game. If you want to dispute my opinion at least put in some time and give reasons as to why you think I am wrong, I will gladly leave those kinds of comments up.\n\n@Hinterland, all of your comments will be removed because this a non-biased review written by a consumer who supports your game and wants it to grow. That being said, it is unfair that 90% of other reviews, gameplay videos and stuff like that misrepresent what the average consumer will get out of this game. I suggest you take all the criticism you get from all of your negative reviews with grace and use them to further  the development of this game because the negative reviews are the ones that help you guys figure out what needs to be improved on.\n\nBig thanks to everyone for the support, you guys are awesome! :)","January 27, 2015","false","15.7"," 2,138 of 2,744 people (78%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","78","138","2","104","52"

Perhaps we find a dedicated team who is working non-stop on their project, but then we ask ourselves, what do they offer us unlike the other hundred titles?\n\nThe Long Dark captivated me since the first time I saw it. The art style looked unique in the genre, and Early Access was going well, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe game starts with us selecting the mode we want to play (Sandbox is the only one currently available) and then we customize it by choosing the difficulty between: Pilgrim (Easy, meant for exploring and learning the basics), Voyageur (Medium, for intermediate players) and Stalker (Hard, for those who are well known of the game mecanics). Then we get to choose the Region, each one offers a different experience basing on the safe places and resources we can find. After we finished selecting all the options, the game starts.\n\nWe are alone without any idea where we might be, there's no map and we only have a few resources in our inventory. We start feeling cold as we walk trough the snow looking for a shelter... and then we wonder if anybody else survived from the plane accident.\n\nIn The Long Dark we need to take care of four main needs: Hunger, Thirst, Sleep and our body Temperature. But here's a new addition to the formula: Calories. These are bound to our needs and it will be constantly changing. We regain them by eating and lose them by sleeping, just like real life. They also decrease faster if we are out in the cold, and every action that we perform will cost us calories, such as running or destroying a furniture to obtain wood.\nBut that's not all, there is also a  tab where we can check the current temperature and how it affects us, the percentage of Windchill, and bonus we get against cold depending on the clothes that we are wearing, among others. And then we have the Condition/Affliction tabs, and they will change if we get hurt or ill, from food poisoning or hyphotermia to name a few.\n\nIn terms of Gameplay, there's always a sense of vulnerability when we are out in the open, and not just from the weather. Wildlife is a very important aspect in The Long Dark and it affects both Combat and Crafting. Pack of Wolves and Bears are going to haunt us if they get to see us. If we were lucky enough to find a rifle or a bow and we succesfully defend ourselves, the player gets food and fur, which can be crafted in clothes or even a bedroll.\nAlso, the animals can interact with themselves and the player can use this in his own advantage. Wolves get terrified when there's a bear nearby, for example.\n\nThere is a lot more to know about the Combat and the gameplay itself, but I'm not going to spoil the experience. I want to talk about what  The Long Dark creates around the player. The atmosphere is the best part of the game and something that shouldn't be left behind but get improved in Early Access. Both characters have their own voice with a decent voice acting and they often make a comment while they are performing and action or are in need of something.\nBut what really shines about The Long Dark it's the Sound and the details.\nThe game also has Music but it only appears in certain moments (And it does it very well). At first I didn't like this decision, but it really helps creating the atmosphere. Also, the sound of our surroundings is really important in the game.\n\nFinding a place to spend the night and hearing the wind crashing against the windows, starving in the middle of nowhere, hearing Wolves nearby when a few hours ago we fell from a cliff and we still couldn't get patched up, or lighting a Storm Lantern that shows to us a corpse in the ground. This is what the game is all about, our personal experiences with it and the constant feel of desolation and loneliness.\n\nThe Long Dark also provides the player with a tab that includes all Stats per day. How long we managed to survived, the locations we came across, the calories we burned and the percentage of how much we have explored. It also has a Notes section, and the player is allowed to write anything in it. It's a great detail for keeping track of details and locations we want to explore next, or just for writing our every day story.\n\nWhat are the plans for the future?\nThe Story Mode will be launched in Spring, and it's going to offer around 3 to 4 hours of Storyline. The remaining episodes will be released over the course of 2016. We will get to play as the bush pilot Will Mackenzie, and Dr. Astrid Greenwood, alternating between them and experiencing the story from their own perspectives. This content is going to be free for Kickstarter backers and players who supported the game during Early Access. You can watch the official teaser of the Story Mode here: http://store.steampowered.comhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzxD7VFVrCw\n\nThe game really surprised me, and it's a great choice if you are looking for an alternative in the Survival Genre.

It uses this kind of cell shading graphics yet it impresses for how much it feels real.

Covered in almost 8 inches of powder snow. You wipe the newly landed snow off your face then get up briskly, shaking the layer of snow off yourself like a large dog, You take a moment to look around this unfamiliar frozen land to orient yourself. Towering trees and majestic mountains as far as the eye can see, with no signs of life in any direction.\nYou open your camping backpack and check to see whats inside. Finding nothing except a plane ticket to Jasper, Canada, a bedroll and a cell phone which doesn't turn on. "Of course my iPhone is dead when i need it" you say with a smirk on your face. Surprising yourself that you still have a sense of humor in a moment like this. But that humor quickly dissolved when you realize you are alone, in a place that looks like something out of a national geographic documentary.\nYour instincts  kick in, "The Sun rises in the east, sets in the west. lets head east." It must have been 10 minutes before the snow storm cleared away enough to see a building not too far in the distance. It was a large metal structure covered in icicles. Trekking through the snow to the entrance door you start to feel your denim jeans get soaked, and boots becoming very heavy. This find couldn't have come at a better time, you grab the frosted door handle and turn it.\n\nYou step inside the building and begin to close the door, only for the gale force wind to take hold of the door and slam it closed. The windchill is instantly gone. "Is anyone there?" you ask before taking another step into the lobby, your voice echos throughout the building. You notice opposite of you a room with a frosted glass window, a gentle ray of sunlight shines on the floor. You enter the room and begin to scavenge whatever you can. An hour passes and you find a good amount of canned soda, and energy bars, thinking to yourself "Almost sounds like what i lived off with during college."\nIt takes another hour to scavenge the place finding a box of matches, beef jerky and a brochure with the writing "Jasper Hydro Dam" on it. you make your way to a large heavy door in the buildings engine room. You use most of your strength to turn the large wheel clockwise to open the door, only to see a man sitting on the floor face down. It Startles you to the point where you fall back, screaming "HOLY $%*&" landing on your butt. With the mysterious man frozen in place, you slowly approach and check his pulse. His skin was as cold as the ice and hard to the touch, this man must have been here a while. Next to him lay a hunting knife,  a bottle of painkillers, and note saying "I wish i could've seen you on your wedding day, I'm Sorry - Love Dad". The quiet room suddenly became even more silent as you grab the items and exhaled deeply in grief. You pick up your backpack and head back toward the entry door. As you walked into the lobby the window that had a ray of light no longer was shining,\nthis would be your first night alone.\n\nIt was then you decided to use one of the empty metal barrels to start a camp fire for the night. A spark dances off the match as you strike it, gently placing it on the newspaper youve managed to find in the structure. You knew this fire wouldn't last long if you didn't have some wood to keep the fire going. You foraged for the next two hours gathering reclaimed wood from the feet of chairs to shelves. ending up with a good pile of wood that would last you the night. You place the logs down on the crackling fire. I curl up inside my cotton bedroll on the floor which rested next to the radiating heat. You fall asleep minutes after laying down.\nThe smell of charred wood lingers in the cold air as you wake up. Looking across the room, you notice the light in the window returns. You gather your belongings and head toward the entry door once more. You grip the handle and turn it, opening the large heavy metal door to a much more calm beautiful morning. You take a big breath of fresh air and let it fill your lungs with a refreshing coolness.\nYou take a step outside, and another.

Because it's so different from all the others, where you have to fight hordes of zombies, monsters or cannibalistic mutants. In this game the only enemy, you're facing is nature itself. Although it is an alpha-game and you only can play "Mystery Lake" in the sandbox-mode so far, it's still the best game I've seen for long. Also the graphics style very is different, but very beautiful, looks just like an oil painting.\n\nYou're a lone survivor in the northern canadian wilderness and have to stand against the elements. Explore the (damn cold) area of Mystery Lake, find shelters and loot anything useful, you can find. But be aware of the hungry wolves scouting around as well as "Fluffy" , who resides in the dam. Try to use the found goods as best you can and try to stay alive as long as possible.\n\nAs mentioned, it's alpha, BUT I can't understand people, who give this game a negative rating, just because It's alpha. Most of them say, they enjoyed the game, but it needs work. But when it's fun, why then the negative rating???\n\nIn my 42 hours of playing, I had lots of fun so far, especially in my first try, when I met "Fluffy" right at the start in the dam, he bit me twice, got me down to 4% condition, I walked to camp office, froze me down to 1%, got to camp office, entered and died right in front of the potbelly stove after only 6 hours survival time.\nThe next tries went way better, made 16 (!) hours in 2nd try and 37 (!!) hours in 3rd, but best one is my current run, in which I am currently at day 91, but with no more ammo.\n\nAt the beginning, the most fun is, when you explore everything, find new places and loot anything you can carry, then you develop you own way of playing, make it better the further you get, of course make mistakes, but nevertheless it is huge fun. All the mistakes, that you make, will help you doing better next time and this is even more fun. Then, after maybe 20-30 days, you have a routine in the game, because you can't explore anything new and your days only contain hunting, cooking, melting/boiling water, eating, drinking, sleeping and foraging wood, maybe repairing, if you're lucky.\nBut even this is kinda fun, cause you are just trying to survive as long as you can with less and less goods. You see the end coming and asking yourself: "How much further can I go? Will I live to see the next day?"\n\nAs I said, even though it's an alpha build, it's a huge fun to play this game and I can't wait for new updates, that'll make this game even better!","October 24, 2014","true","336.6"," 108 of 112 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","108","112","0","2"

However, the design deserves some discussion: This is not a survival game, but an adventure game with a survival theme, and the design reflects that.\n\nThese are just a few things that occurred to me while playing, from the perspective of a survivalist.  Some of these are due to the early development of the game, whereas others are design decisions which reflect the minds of the author.\n\n* Tools degrade in a matter of days; in the real world, they degrade over years or decades.\n* Tools, such as knives, can be repaired with wood and scrap metal; actually, you can make a new knife that way, but you cannot repair it in such a manner.\n* You cannot make knives or axes with wood and scrap metal.\n\n* Weather can destroy a large sailor’s coat; in the real world, even a hurricane is unlikely to do so.\n* The sleeping bag acts like a bivy, but looks like a sleeping bag.  A sleeping bag, outdoors in this weather, would freeze through with body moisture in short order unless put inside a shelter or by a fire, whereas a bivy would be safe.  I’m a bit confused.\n\n* Cordage is made only from gut; normally, cordage can be made from a great many things.\n\n* You cannot manipulate the snow to build a windbreak for a fire, or for yourself, or to build a snow-grave, or a quinzee.\n* Regardless of wood on hand, one cannot create either a lean-to windbreak shelter or a kennel-shelter.  The method is simply not in the game.\n* All of the trees are tall, old, and bare at the lower trunk.  Normally, there are many smaller trees in the area, especially near rocks, and many bushes.\n* The wind seems to be as strong in open areas, such as railroad tracks, as it is among many trees.\n* I’m not sure why the land is completely smooth; normally, you’re stumbling over rocks and logs, and chunks of burnable wood.\n\n* If you have newspaper, matches, kindling, and logs, you have a thirty percent chance of failing to start a fire.  I've never been that drunk.\n* Starting a fire is equally easy when one is warm or cold; normally, when hypothermia sets it, starting a fire becomes extremely challenging due to freezing fingers.  If you wait until frostbite starts to set in before you build a fire, you waited far too long.\n* Firewood is shown as cordwood; normally, I use deadfall almost exclusively, and can easily sustain a fire all night with only a half-hour to an hour of gathering.\n* There is no fire-tending skill; normally, tending a fire properly makes it last much longer, and allows for coal banking.\n* Dead fires do not make fire-lighting easier; in reality, there are usually lingering coals (especially if properly banked) and there is often charcoal to help ignite the next fire.\n* A fire cannot be put out to reclaim the wood; I do this often, to generate charcoal and to conserve fuel when I need to move on, and this allows me to leave behind fires ready to light.\n* Firewood takes hours to gather; even in snow, this process generally takes minutes.\n* A hatchet speeds firewood collection; in reality, this is only marginally helpful, given that most environments have a great deal of deadfall and standing deadwood that can simply be yanked down.  I rarely have to cut firewood; it’s just under the snow, especially under trees.\n* It is possible to freeze to death beside a large fire, or even in a closed (but open-doored) fishing hut beside a large wood-stove with a roaring flame.  This is not realistic.\n\n* Dead bodies are shown clothed; there is no way to salvage their clothing.\n* There are many beds; there is no way to cannibalize the mattresses for cloth or to remove the sheets, nor can one lay one mattress on top of another and sleep between them for added warmth.\n* One cannot stuff one’s clothing with the batting from mattresses.\n* One cannot upgrade the insulation of clothing at all, despite this being a staightforward (if somewhat time-consuming) task in reality.\n* One cannot wear multiple sweaters or layer multiple pants.  I do this often in cold weather; one loses some mobility, but it works.\n* It is possible to fail to sew a piece of cloth.  I love my Jack Daniels, but I’ve never been too drunk to sew.\n\nThis is a very good and fun game, but survivalists should not mistake it for a bushcrafting game, and should not try to use a real-world survival mindset to predict the game's behavior.\n\nStill, as video games go, it's fun, well-crafted, finely drawn, engrossing, and well worth playing.  I would recommend this game.\n","May 10, 2015","true","22.2"," 194 of 229 people (85%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","85","194","229","36","7"

You load into a world based on a few different spawn points. The weather will be random upon loading in, so depending on a little RNG - you might find yourself in a very bad situation. However, this is a good thing, this lets you know very quickly what your goals are in this game. You have to stay alive.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand for the most part, and you have to be able to think on your feet, and make life and death decisions on a daily basis. You're contending with the weather, hunger, thirst, and your overall "health" - which can change based on injury and various other ailments.\n\nThe only RNG I have really seen in the game is when it comes to weather, loot placement; which loot does NOT respawn in game, so you must use it wisely/strategically, and things that require a skill - such as lighting a fire, or repairing an object. The more you do a skill based task, the more skill you gain in doing so, much like real life. This is perfect because it means that you won't die simply due to RNG.\n\nThere is plenty of content to see in game, especially with the added maps (for free!). The free maps they added also allow you to transition from one map to the next, you're free to go back and forth as you please. This gives you the ability to setup a base in one map, then move to a whole other map once you feel like you've depleted the resources on your first map. And there is a sense of wanting to keep your survivor alive for as long as possible. Death is permanent, and when it does happen, it's very upsetting - but it also leaves you retracing your steps that led up to it. You learn from your deaths, and you learn what mistakes to not repeat.\n\nI haven't experienced any game breaking bugs, and only a few minor crashes (2 in nearly 20hrs of play time). I have to recommend this game because it has everything; solid mechanics, good loot, nice graphics, minimal bugs, tons of content, and it's actually a survival game.\n\nI'm going to end this review with a little comparison if you will. The issue I have with other games in my library is that they market themselves as survival games, when in fact they are open world sandbox games with a couple survival mechanics thrown in. This game isn't about building fancy houses, it's literally about staying alive. You're not going to be crafting guns out of soda cans and a few nuts and bolts laying around. You won't be taming dinosaurs, or fighting cannibals with an Emergency Hatchet. You will be moving from location to location trying to gather enough supplies to keep you alive for another day.\n\nThe balance is very fair, and there is a lot of realism to the game. Yes, it's still just a game at the end of the day, so they had to account for that with some elements of game-play (otherwise no one would survive a week), but for the most part they kept it as realistic as possible.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid survival game, that focuses on actually surving - then I don't think you'll find a better game. If you're tired of "survival" games where you're stuck crafting up a tech tree, constantly building bases, and walking around with no purpose, then this is the game for you.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSolid mechanics.\nNo RNG deaths.\nSeveral maps that all connect in game.\nTrue sense of survival.\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a real survival game.","February 7","true","25.9"," 111 of 118 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","111","118","11","2"

It throws you into the wild nature of snow mountains  and all you have to do is survive by eating food, drinking water, staying in warm places and being healthy. It may sound easy, but believe me - it's not. There are a lot of different ways of dying and you never know what will kill you this time, so the game itself makes you feel nervous. The graphics isn't on a high level, but it's pretty stylish and accurate, sometimes it can demonstrate you some really good-looking sights, and its sound is just fine.

I don't know when this started but somehow they mixed Survival with Zombies and whatnot. Of course i like "good" Survival Zombie games but there was still something missing in this Survival aspect (for me) and that was realism. Before i go further i want to mention that no game can be more realistic than the real life itself and if there were a game with such a realism it wouldn't be enjoyable at all. However in this case, Hinterland Studios did a really great job with The Long Dark. I would call this a "real" survival experience compared to other games. This game gives you a indescribable feeling about surviving. You're alone, you have to survive somehow and it's cold.. there are wolves outside so you have to hide yourself, find water, food, wood. You have to prepare everything everyday to survive a bit longer... no other survival game could give me such feelings like this one to be honest.\n\nI also never visited Canada before so this was basically like a sightseeing for me. When i go there I'll take at least my sewing kit with me.\n\nThis game is still in Early Access and there isn't any story related content out yet but it's highly playable and enjoyable in Sandbox mode. I haven't seen a single serious bug while playing this game and that's really unusual for an Early Access title. The developers / team are really kind and nice to you if you have questions or suggestions.\n\nThe only minus point to mention is the balancing currently. The Animals, Items and overall the whole system needs to be more balanced. But It's EA and they're most likely working on that.\n\nFinally i just want to say thanks Hinterland Studios for this game, keep up the great work.","December 5, 2015","true","64.9"," 122 of 134 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","122","134","11","6"

The tension of trudging through a blizzard while freezing and starving to death has never been so fun! If you are not interested in a fairly punishing experience of scavenging for food and shelter just to survive then this game is not for you. It is not exactly real life but it most certainly is on the simulation end of the spectrum. There are no supernatural or magical elements; they are going for real life so wolves not zombies. The screenshots capture the beauty of the stylized wilderness in TLD and while it does look good in game, realize that this is the Unity engine and not Cryengine so it is very basic and somewhat grainy and ugly at times. The music certainly adds to the experience and I am excited for the story mode which is acted by veteran voice actor Mark Meer and others. My largest disappointment would have to be the lack of different maps or a system for procedurally generated maps. In sandbox the loot and materials you gather to survive are random, however the layout of the map is designed for the story mode and so it is the same every time. This means that once you learn the map it informs gameplay as you know what items can be where, and you lose that sense of exploration. It's not the end of the world but it is a legitimate gripe however it is understandable for a $20 game from new startup studio who was crowd funded through Kickstarter. Perhaps it can be a DLC addition down the road if everything goes well. Despite this there are still many hours of enjoyment within the game, after only a few play sessions I have survived for around 8-9 hours and am looking forward to many more as the game develops.","September 22, 2014","true","44.1"," 122 of 135 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","122","135","0","0"

If you are looking for a survival game that follows all of the cliches (Zombies, Monsters, punching a tree with your bare hands to get wood, Etc..)  You've come to the wrong place. This is a more realistic approach to the survival genre.  This game pulls no punches when it comes to long term survival.  From the second that you are thrusted into this unforgiving enviroment, you simply have to survive on your own.  No tutorials. No microtrasnactions that give you a leg up. Just the clothes on your back and the will to survive. It's quite refreshing actually.\n\nObviously there are some things that could be implimented to make gamplay a bit more enjoyable.\n(Its early access for crying out loud)\n\n- Co-op Multiplayer (even though the devs refused the idea)\n- More firearms\n- A bigger map\n- Survivor NPCs\n- More crafting recepies\n\nBut with that said... The sandbox mode alone is worth the $20 pricetag. Imagine what future updates will bring.\nThe devs have already promised a story mode, and the game is updated pretty frequently.\n\nFantastic game even in early access.\n9/10","November 9, 2014","true","40.7"," 102 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","102","108","0","4"

And my verdict still stands.In survival you do anything and everything you can to survive. Ofcourse a game has limitations so you will be limited as to your options as to how well you can perform, however The Long Dark puts so many on you, its more about surviving the games mechanics and not the evironment the game puts you in. Also many ask why only a few hours in the game. Simple, its just not fun. Heres why:\n\n-Time passes far to quickly. Hinterland claims it doesnt. However go to a sunny area and just watch the shadows. They are moving incredibly fast as the sun is blazing through the sky. Nightfall in an area like this is almost a death sentence especially if there is a storm. There are not enough hours in the day to prepare for the night. Your already set up to fail here.\n\n- No layering of clothing. If i was stranded in the middle of a frozen mountain and found clothing. Id be wearing it. Regardless if its mens or womens, or a Hello Kitty beanie. I would be wearing it. First rule of cold survival is layering. They keep you warm, and as you heat up you can remove them to avoid sweating.You also come across several beds with blankets on them that you cant pick up and wrap around you. Another way the game has set you up to fail.\n\n- Update *Slightly Improved* Wasting of flares. Flares are incredibly useful in a survival environment. They can be used to signal, start fires, or scare off super fauna (aka bears.) If confronted by a wolf, a lone wolf mind you, if in the extreme rarity i would be attacked, all i have to do is make myself seem bigger and yell, why would i waste a flare? Wolves are incredibly skittish of humans and wolf attacks are more extremely rare, even when they are in packs. Unfortunatly "The Grey" which was a trash movie from a survivalist stand point, used wolves as the "bad guy". This couldnt be farther from the truth. This irritates me not only is it because its not realistic but also promoting a stereotype that is incorrect.\n\n- Update *Slightly Improved* Tools wear down far to easily. I have a hatchet from 20 years ago that still holds an edge and cuts down trees with the best of the new fangled fiberglass counter parts. 20 years. Hatchets in game can take a 10% durability hit each time you use it... per log. So 3 logs can cost you over a quarter of your hatchets durability (30% that is). Why? Its doing the job it was created to do. Same with can openers, and prybars. Each take durability hits that are simply unrealistic. Unless they are made of paper mache im sure they're going to last longer then 2-3 uses. This should be enough to make me say, "Ok this game isnt hard, its just blatently unfair". But wait. Theres more.\n\n- Update "Some what fixed" You can now choose what weapon before combat, but its still a button mashing contest. Combat. Or more like "combat". Sure you have a crowbar, a hunting knife, a hatchet, and wooden logs and sticks you could sharpen to a crude spear on you so you should be safe if attacked by a wolf. Right? No. You cannot equip them to defend yourself. Instead you need to wait for the wolf to attack you and then play a button mashing mini game to fight the wolf off bare handed. You essentially need to punch him to death. All the while why trying to fight off this wolf, your life is dropping like a college girl after 5 beers. So now they have removed the ability to defend yourself adequately.\n\n- "Stealth". Or lack there of. You can crouch to make yourself seem detectable but you move so slowly if your spotted, you then need to stand, and try to run. Ever try to outrun your dog? Not gonna happen. So stealth isnt really an option either.\n\n- No jumping. Wanna get up high to get a "glassing spot" (aka a spot to map out the terrain or spot landmarks) on the land? Or perhaps climb some rocks to get away from ol' Fluffy McAngry? You cant. Dying from a wolf  because you cant jump on a porch 4 inches off the ground and need to run around to get into a cabin can get old fast. First game ive ever seen that is survival based with no jump mechanic.\n\n- No means of long term survival. You are going to die. This game sets you in a relatively small area, that is sparsley populated with cabins, fishing huts, ect. However, once you loot them. Thats it. Your bullets will run out, your food will run out, and then you wont have enough strength to get fire wood, or boil water. There are no bird nests to exploit, no berries, roots, or wild vegatables. There is no extraction to a safe location. It will be game over at some point or another and it wont be because your a poor survivalist.\n\n- Harvesting wood. You now have a hatchet. So you would think harvesting is pretty straight forward. Walk over to a tree and hack some limbs off, or go over to that desk/chair and chop em up. Nope. You need to your menu and choose "Forage wood" then select your tool. Though it does seem in this patch you succeed more then you fail, its still a mindless mechanic of "roll the dice". Not only that but if you do fail, your hatchet still takes a large percentage of durability damage. Honeslty i can harvest enough wood in one day to set me for a week, by making a small fire in an enclosed area. In this game, you will harvest wood spending around 800 calories for 4 hrs of wood. Another way you are set up to fail.\n\n-Food poisoning from jerky, beans, and other pre prepared foods. Not sure if this is a bug or implamentation at this point but i have gotten sick from eating beans. Canned beans. If this is an implamentation then why cant I cook them first? They are in a can.  Also warm water, and warm food will raise my body temp giving me a better chance to survive the cold. Yet another mechanic setting you up to die.\n\n- Corpses galore, but you cant go "Hannibal" on them. Watch the movie "Alive" or "The Road". Meat is meat. You will find numerous corpses of humans that have died. Is it fun, or nice to do? No. Not at all. But this is survival. If im starving and Frank over here is a frozen dinner, yes. Im going to eat his chubby little arms and legs. Will i brag about it at work the next day. Probably not. But, anything to survive. Yet you cant. The game doesnt allow this. So much for "How far will you go to survive".\n\n- Water. You can find water in bottles, but youll mostly hydrate from snow. Which you need to melt (which takes a substantial amount of time and calories), but then you need to boil it. Boil the snow you just heated up and melted. Why not leave it in the container to boil? Why boil it anyway? White snow with little debree in it is usually safe to drink once its in liquid form. Dirty or discolored snow isnt safe and neither is ice due to the fact parasites and disease can live in ice for a very long time and reactivate due to the heat of the fire. You also cant leave the snow to boil/melt while doing other chores like chop wood, or forage. You need to babysit it. Another mechanic that just takes up time, calories and effort for no reason.\n\n- No fires indoors unless in dedicated areas. Appearently Smokey the Bear is still big during the apocalypse because you cant make a fire on a concrete floor (IE, the dam or bunker), and can only make one in a stove, or barrel. If your outside you can make one almost anywhere but its pretty useless without cover especially with a snow storm raging around you. The best places to make a fire, are the areas you cant make one. For instance a small enclosed area with ventilation.\n\n- Fuel issues. Kerosine and Accelerant (or lighter fluid) isnt interchangable but yet do the same thing. They can both fuel lanterns, and can both start a fire. Yet in this game they only serve 1 purpose each. It would be easier to remove Accelerant, and just let Kerosine do both jobs since in this game they both seem to be in liquid form.","September 23, 2014","false","14.9"," 798 of 1,073 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","798","1","5","159"

It's really hard, atmospheric and visually quite beautiful. It's completely unlike most other survival games: you can't build almost anything, you have practically no weapons (unless you, by some freakish accident, happen to find a rifle, which is completely useless if you don't also find bullets) and are therefore pretty much the weakest ♥♥♥♥er on the bottom of the food chain. You're like the rabbits, except slower.\n\nLearning to survive in the game takes a while: the first few times I played I died within 24 hours or so (couldn't find shelter). I started out with the Mystery Lake map, but  I suggest trying Coastal Highway first, because it appears to be more newbie-friendly.\n\nWhat sort of bugs me are the wolves. Don't get me wrong, I like them because they make the player super paranoid when walking outdoors, which is absolutely great. The problem is that once the wolf is attacking, it will not give up, no matter how long it takes:\nI had this one incident when I was on top of the lookout tower in Coastal Hightway, and a wolf down on the ground spotted me. It attacked, but since I was in the tower it couldn't get to me, so it stayed at the bottom of the tower, running around and waiting for me. This went on for a day or two. Finally I went down and managed to beat the ♥♥♥♥face up, but another two took its place almost immediately. After another day or so I tried to escape the tower but was eaten. This isn't technically a big thing, but it can be a major annoyance. I hope it gets fixed.\n\nBut, all in all, I wamly recommed this game if you like a bit of challenge and don't get frustrated easily.","December 17, 2014","true","22.3"," 99 of 107 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","99","107","2","0"

I'm guessing you have some questions for me about it.\n\nIndeed. We want to know how good it is.\nFair enough. Let's get started.\n\nFirst off: what is it?\nIt's a first person survival + exploration simulation, with mild walking simulator and horror elements, in which you're stranded in the middle of the Canadian wilderness, struggling to preserve your life in the bitter environment.\nMost of the time you find yourself lost, confused, and unsure of where to go.\nSo pretty much Life Simulator 2014.\n\nHow does the gameplay compare to the other profuse survival games nowadays?\nAlthough there are many survival games that could be dubbed similiar to the Long Dark, nothing is truly like it, and most likely, nothing is as good as it either.\nOne of the main differences is the environment. It's set in an Artic wasteland. Little shelter. Few supplies. Most survival games are either deciduous forest, or zombie based. This fits into neither of those categories.\nThe weather is brutal, with harsh wind and immense temperature drops at night. You can fall through ice, get attacked by wolves, and fall off cliffs. But if you're smart, you can survive it.\n\nAnother thing that I really love about the Long Dark's gameplay is the exploration. Granted, in the most challenging difficulty settings there is little time for exploration, but the beauty of the world is truly captivating, and it's a joy to wander through the treacherous landscape. Ironic, isn't it?\nFinally, the last major gameplay element I'll mention is how incredibly realistic this game is. You have to worry about everything. EVERYTHING. Wind. Temperature. Shelter. Hunger. Thirst. Fatigue. Broken bones. Infections. Hostile wildlife. Giant man eating ducks.\nOkay the latter poses much less of a threat than the previous ones but I think you understand what I mean.\n\nThey have a calorie counter for crying out loud, what else could you want?\n\nHow do the graphics stand?\nThe Long Dark may or may not be a huge troll. And I'll explain why.\nThe developers set you up against very difficult challenges, inside a cruel and unforgiving world, but they make it so beautiful. It's like they show you how beautiful the sword is, before they chop off your head. Irony, you see.\n\nBut, really, the world is gorgeous. You're not blown away by the realism of it (like you are by the gameplay, more irony, you see), but it sure is stunning. I have the sceenshots to prove it.\nThe lighting is phenomenal, the textures are masterfully constructed, and the landscape is truly a work of art.\nI also really like the almost hand-drawn feel of the visuals. Feels kind of rustic.\n\nI also should mention, though it's not visual based, the sound design of the game. Absolutely brilliant.\nThe sound mixing is astounding. The way that the sounds of the wind and the distant wolf howls and your foot prints on the snow and the opening of your backpack all blend together so fluidly and dynamically really adds to the experience.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about Early Access games is their bugginess. Does the Long Dark glitch much?\nFirstly, I don't think that stereotype really is fair. I've played a decent amount of Early Access in a decent amount of games and have not run into very many bugs.\nAnd this needs to be said: I have never run into any glitches or bugs in the Long Dark.\nWhat more needs to be said? It runs stably and has never crashed on me, even on my horrible laptop, and I'm impressed.\n\nIs the Long Dark worth the $20?\nI only have 5 hours on this game, and I honestly don't know why. I think I could spend hundreds of hours on this game. It's got so much room for learning and exploring, especially with regular content updates being released so often. I would say yes, it is worth the money. Especially on sale.\nBut for the full price, I would say it wouldn't hurt for you to know you like survival games, as you may be frustrated by the brutality of it.\n\nDoes it have any replay value?\nWell, as of yet, it has no campaign. So I can't really review that yet.\nBut I can say that I am drawn to continue my game after I survive long enough to actually have to save it and quit.\nThat doesn't happen often.\nThe game is addicting, despite it's difficulty, and will draw you back in to continue, or more likely, try again.\n\nSo after all these questions, what's the verdict: is the Long Dark a good game?\nYes.\nIt's phenomenal.\nThere's a reason why it has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, it's absolutely fantastic. A fresh breath of air from the numerous, and mostly far less well designed, survival games out there.\nThe gameplay is unique and innovative, the graphics are artfully designed, the sound mixing is exceptional, it's not that expensive, and, get this, it's not even done.\nIt's in Early Access. There's a whole new game mode yet to come out.\nI would say buy this now, and watch it grow into it's true, colossal potential.\nThen you get to be a hipster: "I liked it before it was cool!".\n\nTake a break from Call of Duty, and play this masterpiece.\nIt's worth your time.\n\n~ caleb4est","July 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 94 of 101 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","94","101","11","2"

I first bought The Long Dark during the 2014 Christmas Sale way back when because I saw a video from a YouTuber saying it was good and had far, far too much money to waste. (which was all wasted in that very same sale. DAMN YOU GABEN.)\n\nOn March 8th, 2015, I finally decided to make my first attempt at playing this game. I had been binging on a number of other games recently and finally decided "Eh, I'll see what this whole thingamabobber is about."\n\nNow, I was essentially going into this thinking "indie survival simulator" and getting terrible flashbacks of all the BAD attempts at the same genre that the indie community (and even the professional community) have made in recent years. Yes, the screenshots looked pretty and stylized, but I wasn't about to judge a game by graphics alone; if I did, then most entries of Call of Duty would suddenly jump above everything else from the very bottom of my list.\n\nI was going into this expecting to laugh my ♥♥♥ off at a poor attempt at gameplay and quality and tension in general.\n\nI was so, so, SO wrong.\n\nThis game. This. F***ing game. This game is AMAZING.\n\nMy first sandbox playthrough lasted about a day and a half, at which point I had run out of resources, was stuck in the middle of a blizzard with no firewood or starters, and was freezing my ♥♥♥ off. I decided to go quietly, laid down my bedroll, went to sleep, and never woke up.\n\nIn that moment, I felt a part of my soul die with my character.\n\nThis is not a game to be laughed at. This is not a game where you play it and look for all the bugs and errors to make fun of. This is a game that, within the first half-hour, will have you so incredibly and undeniably hooked that you care about your character in such a way that the game over screen reads like a gravestone of a close friend.\n\nThree pieces of advice for new players:\n\nFirst, expect a challenge. Even on the lowest difficulty where the wolves DON'T attack you, this game is punishing for your mistakes. As stated above, my first playthrough lasted about a single in-game day because I failed to account for resources properly. My second playthrough has lasted about five days, but I still don't see myself living past fifteen. This is not a game to mess around with: make EVERY MINUTE COUNT. Otherwise, you won't last very long at all.\n\nSecond, expect to be surpised and stunned by the visuals. This is not a game that has ULTRA-REALISTIC 3D where EVERY SNOWFLAKE IS RENDERED AND DRAWN DOWN TO THE ATOMIC LEVEL. No, this is a low-poly, low-res-texture game, even on ultra graphics settings. And yet, despite ALL of that, the style alone makes up for it. During my first playthrough, one of the very first things I did was climb the tallest mountain I could reach. I made it up there at sunset and... well, I just stood there. I broke my very own rule of making the time count, because I was so shocked at how GORGEOUS this game can be. In my second playthrough, with even more time to explore, I have had my mind blown over and over and over again as this game delivers stunning view after stunning view. Despite not having AAA ultra-complex graphics, I can easily say that TLD is more beautiful than any AAA game on the market.\n\nThird, expect to become attached to your character. Seriously, you WILL come to care about your character. And THIS is why I truly love this game so much. In my ENTIRE GAMING CAREER, there are less than five games to EVER make me shed a tear. But when my first playthrough ended and my character passed away in his sleep, I did indeed shed a tear. I shed MANY. This game forges such a strong emotional bond between player and protagonist that I simply can't praise it enough. You have to play it and EXPERIENCE it to understand.\n\nSo play it. For the love of every god I can think of and/or name, fictional or otherwise, PLAY THIS GAME. In an industry filled with parody games and vanilla, generic copies of old classics, The Long Dark delivers such an original, strong, and emotional presence that it simply cannot be ignored. So, to Hinterland Studio Inc., I applaud you for creating an experience unlike anything else I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.\n\nYou will not be wasting your time playing a poorly-concieved indie game here; you, as a living being, DESERVE this game. Do not deny yourself this experience. Enjoy The Long Dark in all its frozen glory.\n\nNow, with that said, I'm going to go back inside my fishing hut and eat some more delicious rainbow trout.","March 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 104 of 116 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","104","116","27","5"

I made it to around day twenty, having gone through three of the available areas at the time, and I was doing good, but it was not long lived. My resources were dwindling as I made my way to the last supplied area at the top of a mountain, a lone radio station secluded from the rest of the map. It was starting to get dark, and my body temperture was dropping fast, so I lit my lantern and started to run. Out in the darkness I heard a howl, followed by another that seemed much closer. I put away my lantern and took out my rifle, aiming it towards the origin of the noise. I heard a growl about ten feet away, so I fired a shot. A whimper pierced the whirring of the cold winter air around me, then silence. Not taking any chances, I lit a flare to see what was around me. Five feet in front of me was a pair of wolves, one was bleeding profusely from his gunshot wound, while the other was preparing to leap onto its would be prey. Being only fifty feet from the radio station, I decided to make a break for it. I threw the flare at the wolves face and sprinted away. The rapid stomping of my feet began to slow as my stamina quickly depleted. No heat for miles takes a toll on the body, and I was slowly dying just feet from my salvation. I heard fast taps on the ground behind me as the wolves closed in for the attack. I was almost there, just a few more steps until I could get into the station and shut the door, then the wolf pounced. I was on the ground, hacking it apart with my axe as it took gnawed on my half frozen flesh. It was a bite away from ending my long journey, when I took one last swing with my hatchet and killed it. I got up and limped toward the door, just barely making it into the station before the other wolf had a chance at killing me. I made it. Inside was much needed health supplies, and much needed food. I started a fire and cooked some venison, all the while warming my body temperture to its original state. I then went to sleep in the nearby cot, gaining health, yet also gaining thirst and hunger. My supplies were low, maybe a few energy bars and a few cans of soda, definitely not enough to last a voyage out into the unknown, so I decided that my journey had come to an end. I quit the game and said goodbye, for I knew that if I continued I would surely perish. I couldn't watch my character die, after all we had been through, he didn't deserve to fade into the long dark. So I let him live in that save, untouched and undying, until I decide that it's time for his journey to come to a close. Until that moment, I will always cherish my adventure I had, and I hope that one day I will have the courage to once more venture out into the unknown, making my way through the barren landscape, and surviving the long dark.","February 3","true","19.6"," 86 of 91 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","86","91","14","4"

The Long Dark, abbreviated herein as "TLD," is one of the exceptional ones.\n\nObjective  Survival is the name of the game here. You have a backpack with a fairly large capacity, and clothes that won't keep you alive for long. Much like "The Forest," TLD requires you to find sticks, branches and fuel to craft fires and new items. Unlike most survival games, you may see the world as somewhat familiar to you - at least, it was to me. If you have experience with survival/adventure games, you will love this game, and coming from other atmospheric games, TLD is the ideal survival game for me.\n\nMany Challenges This game is easy. This game is hard. This game is everything in between. Each "region" of the world that you play in has its own difficulty; some have prebuilt shelters for you to keep warm, and others are nothing but desolate wilderness. You can find yourself stranded on a frozen lake, or sipping coffee in the log house. The more you play, the easier you will find the game in general to be, regardless of the difficulty of the region you begin in. For instance, it took two playthrough attempts for me to realize that for some odd reason, the water in toilets is considered potable. Huh. Sleep is key in this game; oversleep and you will burn too many calories, but undersleep and your health will decline. If you are skilled at balancing different aspects of a character, such as hunger v. sickness and agility v. pack size, you will have no trouble with starting on at least a moderately difficult region.\n\nAudio, Graphics, and Performance This game is, in one word: atmospheric. From the calming to somewhat-creepy background audio to the smoothness of the main character's voice, the audio in this game is absolutely fantastic. I would highly advise you to wear your best set of headphones/earphones when playing this game, as you will notice a difference.\nAs for the graphics, well, I'm simply amazed at the simplicity yet the spectacular attention to detail in this game. I actually purchased this game solely for the visual quality, and after playing I knew that it was the right choice. Surprisingly, this game is made with UNITY. Yes, you read that right -- Unity. From screenshots, most might say that it looks like a Source 2 engine game. In that regard, I feel like the devs did a great job pushing Unity to its limits to make this game.\nOne of my personal favorite areas in the game to explore is the forest house by the Coastal Highway and Log Yard area. It's very home-y, and although I was definitely creeped out when I first went upstairs and came across a corpse, it's one of the more calm locations in the region. Outside of shelters, one of the very unique aspects is something that usually goes unnoticed: footprints. I love the fact that your footprints stay in the snow, and maybe it's just me, but I feel that it definitely adds a lot to the game with just one added detail. I have not noticed yet whether the footprints will stay for a certain time duration or if it is based on basically a graphical asset limit, such as 100 or 150.\nSpeaking of Unity, let's talk about one of its downfalls: performance. I play this game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M card, and I do get a steady 60fps. However, at some points textures glitch out and frames drop. My GPU/CPU are not throttling, which leads me to believe it could just be a bug or the result of Unity's poor optimization. It's definitely not the developers' fault. My system does run hot when playing, much hotter than while playing titles such as CS:GO and Saints Row 3/4, but at a similar temperature as when I run Metro 2033/Last Light Redux. If you have at least a 700 series card and proper cooling and ventilation, you'll have no issues.\n\nValue At this stage of the game's development, I feel that it warrants a price tag of maybe $15 instead of $20. Having played it and seen fairly fast development progress, this IS an early access game that you do want to cash in on because, as many other Early Access games, the price will go up.\n\nAspect        Rating                Originality        High 9                Difficulty Options        9                Graphics        10+                Audio        10                Value        8                Overall        9\nFinal Points on the Game TLD is glorious in its appearance, unforgiving in its challenges, and sensory magic at heart. Don't miss out.\n\nBe sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

This is definitely one of the best survival games I've ever played and the Gnu/Linux port is very well done. I haven't encountered a single bug and it's probably the best optimized unity 5 game on Gnu/Linux thus far.\n\nGame Highlights:\nVery good voice artist work, though it is minimal as of yet (until the story mode is added).\nThe audio production is top notch, makes all the difference having well produced audio and ambiance, snow crunches, flares sizzle, wolves howl to send chills down your spine, etc.\nArt is stylized (not photo-realistic) but it isn't a negative, I think that only adds to the character and experience. Unique survival mechanism and so on..\n\nGame play:\nIt can be brutal and punishing! Which I really like, the second time I played it started me in the middle of a fierce blizzard in pitch dark with only one flare to try and save myself - I did manage to find shelter in the Carter Hydro Dam (after a night in relative safety, I made my way to the Camp Office located on the western side of Mystery Lake).\n\nSometimes you get a nice easy start, sometimes a nightmarish struggle to survive what seems like the impossible! If you fail, there is no reloading a save you've simply got to try again (but you can quit any time and continue on another sessions if you have not perished - so a save of sorts).\n\nI really like the change of pace from all the usual gaming fare, this one makes you think about what you need to do to really survive in the game. Supplies are always in the back of your mind, do you stay put in a comfy cabin with the supplies you have - or risk the outdoors to be proactive in your scavenging to prevent a situation where you could starve or freeze to death? There are no zombies, ghouls, or other such fictional monsters - just you versus the brutal arctic and occasionally a wolf or two (best to avoid them if possible).\n\nTons of fun if you love a challenge and an open world to scavenge up what you can to survive. I can't wait for the campaign story that will be added later in development - going from the current experience it should be amazing!\n\nI can full heartedly recommend The Long Dark to all of you who are interested in the survival genre.","October 29, 2015","true","13.6"," 79 of 82 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","79","82","5","0"

It was already on my wishlist for some reason so I just bought it. Started playing at about 11:30PM, walked around until I found the dam. Spent a good amount of time there and developed the idea that this was a safe space. It was warm, food and drink everywhere, and plenty of resources. I eventually left, unhappy with the mere 5% of the world I had explored, and sure enough, I died within a day of leaving the dam.\n\nNext playthrough, I spawned somewhere I hadn't been yet, on a large lake with a lot of fishing huts. I liked the dam but this was even better, supplying me with more tools than the dam had. So I set up shop in the camp office for a day or two, then set out exploring again. Figured I'd better stop by the dam just to stock up on supplies before heading into the unknown. I was happily greeted by my two crates at the front door, spent my time with all the lockers in the first room, then made my way to the safe on the first floor. I was listening to music because the game sounds are a bit off putting at 2 in the morning, but I had to pause this in order to crack the safe. Got it open, dissapointed to find only more forsaken newspapers. I turn around to continue looting, when a deafening growl penetrates my earholes, startling me and making me try to light a lantern with no oil in it. As I look to the door I see two little beads floating mid air. After a second I realize it's giant ♥♥♥♥ing wolf, in my ♥♥♥♥ing safe space, and in the midst of trying to climb back into my desk chair and put my headphones back on, then trying to figure out how to light and throw a flare for the first time, the thing flies across the room and tackles me. I manage to fight it off, not that that really does anything except delay the enevitable. I try to make my way to the door, as my safe space has been tainted and I wish to never return. I throw as many flares as I can everywhere, assuming the beast will just go back to wherever the hell it came from. I'm exhausted and carrying twice the appropriate amount of weight so it takes me a minute to get to the door, and despite the several flares creating what I thought was a shield around me, it returned and attacked me right as I was approaching the door. I died a few hours later of the several ailments and lack of clothing caused by the wolf.\n\nNowhere is safe. Wolves in this game have thumbs. Worse jumpscares than Amnesia/10.

I had uncovered a windfall of about 2kg worth of venison from a wolf kill the day before, and though I wasn't dressed for the weather, I needed to find any sort of food. On day three, I made my way over to the train tracks where I noticed a train that had derailed. A blizzard kicked up shortly after I arrived and I hear howling in the distance, so I lit a fire and huddled down by the derailed train.\n\nThe howling came up again and I heard the sound of running. A wolf was right behind me! I grabbed a torch from my fire and ran away from the wolf. Unfortunately, I ran through my fire and burnt off my pants. Fleeing pantsless through the trackless wastelands, I ran across the railroad tracks and over a railway bridge. The wolf must have caught my scent again, or maybe it was one of its packmates - I noticed a wolf charging at me down a hill. I brandished my torch with all the fury I could muster whilst wearing my long underwear and then fled further afield.\n\nThis is when I found an old dam. It happened to have two boxes of rifle ammunition, seven knitted wool caps, and no pants to speak of. Realizing that if I wanted to cover my junk, I would have to make my own pants, I loaded up my hunting rifle and set out for vengeance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larrythebrony/recommended/305620/","larrythebrony","Larry's Berry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larrythebrony/","339 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nInnovation is almost always a good thing, especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre. Procedurally generated post-apocalyptic worlds, need wood get wood, build block-based houses, form groups with other human players to survive, these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that I continue to wear to date. And who can forget the zombies.\n\nIt's. Always. Another. Bloody. Ugly. Zombie.\n\nAnd that is why The Long Dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips. Its art-style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the Northern Canadian Wilderness. Its rogue-like elements, such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world, shifts the player's focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode, to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in-game days survived. And instead of surviving against zombies, players in The Long Dark are tasked to survive against Mother Nature, which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards, as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains. The sound design of The Long Dark is also extremely well done. Everything from the crunch of your soles on snow, to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much-needed supplies, to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging, immersive, and realistic.\n\nYes, realism is The Long Dark's home address. Being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating, but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing. The game's hunger system is also caloric based. Foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real-life counterparts (albeit scaled up slightly). Since all activities, including sleeping and standing still, burns calories, in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day. In addition, he or she also has to drink at least 2.2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated.\n\nOn the other hand, innovation can be a two-faced ♥♥♥♥♥. If taken too far, it can detract immensely from a game's production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer's time. Reinventing a tried-and-tested wheel, or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose, are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far. As much as The Long Dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre, Hinterland Studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend, and for lack of a better word, paradoxical.\n\nThe biggest culprit lies in The Long Dark's surprising lack of player interaction with the environment. Besides interacting with the game's various containers that exist in the form of drawers, lockers, cupboards, stoves, starting a fire, and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer, there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment.\n\nNecessary activities such as the cooking of food, harvesting of meat from an animal's carcass, or the boiling of snow to make potable water, are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity. There is no farming, there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves. I could think of a hundred more things that a player, as a survivor in an icy wilderness, would be expected to do to survive better. Sadly, players in The Long Dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment. Why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering. It metamorphoses an otherwise open-world survival game, one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories, whether heroic or tragic, into a linear game of repetitive choices.\n\nThis is not to say that The Long Dark is bereft of player-made choices. In spite of the game's limited player-environment interactivity, players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in The Long Dark. For example, constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes, thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories. Similarly, being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load. Making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy. Finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players, especially the compulsive ones, for many hours on end.\n\nNonetheless, the negative effects on the game's longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest. Despite The Long Dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode, the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4-5 hours of proper gameplay. Beyond that, the game starts to devolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf, foraging for wood, cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character's physical needs, and resting in bed. There is nothing else to do. You cannot build, you cannot farm, all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end. A most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential.\n\nAt its current sale price of USD$19.99 on steam, The Long Dark is barely worth a buy. My suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard-earned money on this game. The Long Dark will most certainly become a better game with time. On the other hand, you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now. It is one of the most polished and interesting early-access survival game that is currently available on the market. And if you enjoy a rogue-like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate, The Long Dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment. I am therefore giving The Long Dark the thumbs up.","March 2, 2015","true","21.3"," 98 of 111 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","98","111","11","0"

Or maybe two?\nYou will never know because the things that happen to you in Sandbox mode are random.\n\nMost of the time, when you think: "oh well, now everything is running fine for me" something happens and you are confronted with problems of surviving.\n\nI was seeking shelter in a container home because the sun went down and it got late and all. So I repaired some stuff and went to bed, having some food in my inventory. I woke up at around 6 o'clock in the morning, opened the door and a big wolf jumped at me. I merely made it back to the shelter.\n\nSo I just thought it might be a good idea to sleep another two hours, maybe the predator would be gone then. I woke up hearing the wind making some shivering noise and when I opened the door I was in the middle of a snow storm. So I had no other choice than retreating into my "home" again.\nAt this point I had nothing left to eat. I went to bed again.\n\nWhen I stepped outside again, the storm was over and the air was clear.\nI was starving and thirsty but I was alive.\n\nOn my way to my food storage I saw a wolf far away.  Not to cross his way I took a shortage over a hill, missteped and fell. I hurt myself and could barely walk.\nI made it to my other shelter, and fell to bed very exhausted. The next morning I felt better, had a full belly and melted some snow to drink.\nthe weather was not as good, it was snowing, but without wind and again I had nothing to eat so I decided to make a short walk.\nIt was misty and I couldnt see very far.\nI went around a small group of trees when I heard that wolf gnarling behind me.\nI tried to shake him off but I was still to weak.\n\n\nThis is just one of a lot of different outcomes that are all random, nothing scripted in it. The only limits right now are the limits that influence your survival and the map size. :)\n\nI really love this game right now and I'm looking forward to the story mode.","September 26, 2014","true","9.6"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","78","86","0","0"

This game has been one of the most entertaining and immersive games I've played yet and this is just the sandbox. I can only imagine what the final, released version will be like with the story included! This review for now will focus on the early access version of the game.\n\n\nI can't think of any other games like it. A quiet apocolypse has taken place, technology as we know it is gone. The lights went out, never to return. How long can you survive against nature and everything it has to throw at you? There are no zombies. There are no mutants or aliens. Just you, nature and the need to survive. Scavenge what you can from the abandoned regions, hunt for food and find a warm place to spend the night. Just be aware that beyond the safety of your fireglow, green eyes flash in darkness, waiting for you to give them a chance to send you into the long dark. No one is coming to save you, so you'd best be ready to save yourself.\n\nFeatures:\n=======\n\n+No Zombies, no supernatural, no aliens, no occult! Just nature, and it's brutally unforgiving.\n\n+ A gorgeous art style fairly reminiscent of the Group of Seven. Iconic, refreshing and engaging, it's a nice break from photorealism and proof that games can be beautiful and immersive without being overly heavy on realism.\n\n+ Three modes of difficulty with three vastly different challenges for all types.\n\n+ Crafting of the basic survival needs, like torches and bows, and animal skin clothing\n\n+ Survival simulation with a unnervingly believable feel. Monitor your temperature, hunger, thirst and energy levels. Think carefully about your food choices and plan your routes carefully. even a small injury could lead to much worse if left ignored.\n\n+ Challenge modes for those who work better under pressure. Added in the newest update, these challenge modes give seasoned players a few scenarios to complete. For now there are 2. One involves escaping a relentless bear intent on ending you. The second is an attempt to race from one region to another, retrieve an item and make it to the goal before time runs out.\n\n+Comfortably playable with Mouse and Keyboard or with a controller.\n\n+Extremely well done voiceovers for the basic sandbox characters.\n\n+An out of this world sound experience. Every little sound you hear, from the wind in the trees to the clattering of old shutters, has a purpose and has been meticulously planned. A crow flying overhead may alert you to an approaching storm, a strange clang or clatter in a whiteout can point the way to safety. A growl in the darkness can sound your doom.  All of this atmospheric and immersive sound is punctuated by music tracks that serve to elevate the feel of the moment. Rather than play constantly in the background, these short musical interludes kick in to emphasize something and just as quickly fade out again. (The coming of night, the sun rising, A particularly lonely place, or a Change of weather.)\n+The game offers no hand-holding. You are dropped in the world and left to figure it out. You will die many times before it starts to make sense, but each time you fail, you get a better idea of how you can apply what you've learned to the next run.\n\nIt should be noted that the only real drawback aside fomr the learning curve to the game is the fact that death is permanent. When you die you start again from the beginning, but even that makes for good compelling gameplay as it pushes you to be more careful about how you go about your survival.\n\nEarly access means the game is still undergoing serious developement, but even in this current form, it's hard to believe it's an alpha. It's polished and professional with smooth gameplay and challenge that's well worth the full price. If you like sandbox/survival games, this is a great choice. If you like to simply play the game at your own pace and observe the quiet apocolypse, this game is still a great choice. And when story mode releases, I am certain those who like to play games for the storyline will also love it too. Hinterland is making a great first impression with The Long Dark.\n\nA solid 9/10, most likely a 10 once it hits release.","May 4","true","355.2"," 75 of 82 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","75","82","5","0"

Why not break one of the chairs or the table or perhaps even the counter? But this game says no. Have a Jerrycan filled to the brim with karosen? That's great!  It's too bad you can't use it to start a fire. Find a dead deer and want to drag it back to your cabin? Nope, can't do that either. How about those pesky ever-breaking can openers; god knows I go through 15 of them a month... Or the breakable and weak hatchets and pry bars. Every summer I must spend $15,000 replacing all of them I break. Skinning an animal with a knife? watchout that knife will break into usless shards after four uses... How about using 3 coats to repair the one you're wearing? Nope, better cut those coats up into 1 scrap cloth peice each while needing 2 peices to add 15% more durability.\n\nReview: For a game that is focusing on realism it falls short in too many areas. The game sacrifices realisim for difficulty. The elements and lack of food should make the game hard enough; however, the game sees fit to give you a hatchet and hunting knife that you're not allowed to wield in defense; so you better punch that wolf lungeing for your jugular. The game also surrounds you with logs and wooden furnitare that you're not allowed to burn nor are you allowed to re-ignite fires from active coals from a recently dead fire. And don't even get me started on how quickly duribility on things like you clothes goes. In a matter of days(in-game) you'll see your equiped clothes lose duribility. There are way too many things that need to be fixed and added before this is remotely enjoyable / playable.","September 22, 2014","false","9.3"," 572 of 806 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","572","806","0","27"

It happened slowly, painfully and has stuck with me since it happened forty-seven minutes ago.\n\nIt started in the afternoon of the twentieth day. I hadn't had a thing to eat since the morning before, and the Canadian camp-site office building offered nothing more for my famished stomach. The fishing lines had broken and I had no rifle, yet I had twenty rounds of ammunition. With that being said, it was time to take my chance in the wilderness again. I took one step forward and planted my sockless feet down into the snow.\n\nI wandered down the traintracks until I encountered a wreck with two carriages. I snuck into the the first, wary of the several wolves patrolling the local area. By now my health had dropped to around 80%. I knew the risks of entering the carriage with a wolf so close by, but I would have done anything for a granola bar or the like. Unfortunatley the first carriage yielded nothing. As I left, the wolf howled and began chase. I immediatley backtracked and sprinted roughly a hundred metres before running out of breath. He caught up, mauled me, and my health had dropped to 12% before I could fend him off with my hunting knife. I patched my wounds but the painkillers and antiseptic wouldn't bring my health back - only sleep would. I limped back from which I came, snuck past the wolf that had bitten me and the rest of his pack and continued up the train tracks until I discovered safety - a dam nestled between two snowy peaks.\n\nI entered with 6% health. It was looking grim, but I hadn't been here before so there was a high chance I would stumble onto some food. It was also dark, with visibility at a minimum. However, the torch at the entrance took care of that almost immediately. As I made my way further into the complex, I discovered what can only be described as a gift from God - it was a granola bar. 300 calories into the system, slight warmth from being inside - things were looking up. It didn't take longer than a minute for all my dreams to be taken away from me, however, as the devil himself decided to crush what hope I had left. It started as a growl, and grew into a nightmare as a came face-to-face with a wolf that seemed almost as large as I was. A wolf? Inside? Impossible. For a moment I thought it was a trick of the light, possibly a trick of the mind, but not a second later my doubts were gone as I felt the warm saliva of the beast as it tore into my throat and left me for dead in the dam, on a cold and frosty Canadian afternoon.\n\n9/10, a little performance upgrade possibly, (or maybe that's on my end) but this is one of the best survival games I have ever played. It felt complete, and I completely forgot it was in alpha. What these guys have now is a complete game, so whatever they decide to add will make it incomparable to anything on the market.","November 19, 2015","true","23.1"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","70","75","15","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/305620/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Long Dark is a 1st rate survival game, with a back story that already speaks; even while the game is in Alpha. Currently, you only play the game in "sandbox mode." This amounts to an open world survival experience, where you spawn at one of a variety of points on a predetermined map. A geomagnetic storm brings your small plane down in the Canadian wilderness. You are unprepared, and it's freezing cold. As if that weren't enough pressure to get you moving your worthless tennis shoes, you soon find you aren't the only creature slinking along using the hills to break the wind as you hunt for shelter before darkfall.\n\nChoosing Apocalypse:\nThough everyone is talking, and gaming, the demise of modern civilization, not everyone agrees on the possible scenarios. If you prefer an end like that described in the book The Road, by Cormac McCarthy, where you wander the beautiful countryside, quietly chronicling the passing of an era; you may choose the Pilgrim mode to sure starving and freezing.  If you subscribe to the idea of a countryside ravaged by wildlife gone mad in a frenzy for food, as in the book The China Pandemic by A.R. Shaw, then you would probably choose the Stalker mode. This is described as a punishingly challenging survival experience in the menu.\n\nThere is a good middle road for those like myself who want a challenge that is somewhere in the middle. The Voyageur mode is described as equal parts hunter and hunted. Wolves and bears stalk you as you try to scavenge for food. This is the only mode I have played, as the Stalker seems a bit over-challenging for me right now. When you go out to find food, you are stalked by the wolves and bears. You try to hibernate as much as possible, but this won’t last long. Blizzards arise at any given moment. You don’t know when you leave your base whether or not a storm will appear, so you have to choose carefully what you will take with you. If a wolf is stalking nearby when you plan to return, you may not be able to get back to your base. This is the middle choice. You have been warned if you choose the Stalker mode. For the purposes of this review I will describe my 100 hours experience in the Voyageur route.\n\nSaving your hides:\nThere is no forgiveness in this game. You will go out to find food with tools and weapons that you find. The shotgun takes a learning curve. The knife and axe are trusty. You can harvest meat and hides from carcasses you find, or you can kill your own meat. But, the game does not allow saving. It saves automatically when you enter the door of a building, and when you sleep in a bed, or fall into the Long Dark sleep of death. It’s too late when you are staring into the fangs of a wolf to use the alt-tab function and return to the last place you entered a door or slept. That route must be chosen before the wolf grabs you.\n\nSurvival methods in this game mirror real-world survival methods. First, I load up for a trip. Then I go outside the door, and immediately back inside to initiate an autosave. While I was out there, I made a quick recon of the area to be sure no wolves or bears were nearby. Then, having good info, I make some final decisions about my trip, and I am ready to venture out into the unknown in search of sustenance and survival.\n\nCrafting:\nUnlike many other survival games, TLD uses a more realistic crafting system. You must lay your collected hides out on the floor to cure them for an amount of time, before beginning to craft clothing. Then, you complete the crafting in your spare hours over a number of days, just as you would really make your own clothes. You must repair all your clothing and tools frequently, as they degrade in a realistic manner in the arctic cold winds. You are able to choose and change your clothing by degrees of warmth provided and by weight. Your stats are adversely affected by heavier weights over time, and your character is worn out by carrying too much. You must choose carefully or die sooner. You will die. But, it is better to survive and die, than to have never survived at all.\n\nNarrative\nThe Story mode is not finished as the game is in early release. But, I believe from dev comments that it is almost finished. In the year I’ve had the game, they have made frequent updates. I am very excited to see the actual story, which is already “showing through the cracks” so to speak, in the sandbox. The achievements, as well, pull in stories of their own, and provide a sense of accomplishment that is unparalleled.\n\nGraphics & Sound:\nThere are several new maps in the Sandbox mode, and each one features the most surreal and hauntingly lovely nature scenes, in an art style that is screaming for an artbook in the final release. I only hope they go all out with that idea, as the art is phenomenal! And, speaking of final release... the story mode is nearing completion. I've already spent months on end in Mystery Lake's map alone, so I can imagine the hours of game play the story mode will provide.\n\nGraphics are done in a realistic art that looks hand-drawn. The view is splendid from anywhere in the game. The music is great for this genre, as it doesn’t get in the way of game play, and yet appears at points of high-drama, like just as you near starving to death.\n\nGenre Comparison:\nI bought this at the same time I bought Stranded Deep, and a couple of other intensive survival games. The Long Dark far exceeds every other survival game I've played. Where you find a lack of resources to build anything substantive in SD, The Long Dark keeps you immersed in crafting weapons, curing animal hides to craft deerskin clothes, finding bunkers, exploring ever-changing scenery, and a realistic survival experience that promises to define a genre.\n\nThere are many survival games. But, there is only one Long Dark. Where games like the Wasteland series and Sheltered come across slightly cheesy, (not to mention often clunky mechanics) TLD is realistic in concept and execution. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a good game, with a great story, but it has more sci-fi elements to it, where TLD lives within the realm or today and tomorrow. And, some of those are not presented in life size action like in TLD’s silent apocalypse.\n\nSavage Lands is life size, and appreciable for its own unique crafting, and somewhat medieval look. Yet, I found it somewhat unbelievable that you would run-up to an unmoving deer and slay him on the spot. In TLD you must stalk your prey, as in the real world, because they will run when frightened. I think that sums up the effect: the wildlife AI is responsive to the player.\n\nPros:\n* Unmatched Survival Realism\n* Dynamic Weather\n* Hibernation Simulation\n* Stats react to loads carried and the weather conditions\n* You craft your own meds and heal yourself\n* Ice Fishing, rabbit trapping, and hunting with bows that you craft\n* You can recycle tools and weapons to repair or build new equipment\n* Frequent Updates\n\nCons:\n*The cook stove or campfire interface is “locked in” and you can’t perform other tasks while cooking.\n*The same locked-in interface stalls your view of the countryside while ice-fishing. I only hope they will improve this, but it doesn’t affect gameplay.\n* ATM, there is no ability to map your area. But, there are links to maps in the community hub. These are possibly created by the fan-base, and differ in degrees of accuracy.\n\nI recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenging survival experience with complex components. This is no simple game. Firing the shotgun takes a learning curve, and trial and error. But, once you learn to fire it, you find yourself bringing in multiple animals in one hunt.

You find yourself stranded in the northern Canadian wilderness with only the clothes on your back and a few meager supplies that will last you for a short time.  The game's intersting hunger meter (a calorie counter) provides you with an accurate measure of your character's craving for food that makes you feel more determined to actually try and endure the cold.  Speaking of cold, the weather varies from absolute blizzards that can get as cold as -55ºC to crystal clear sunny days where you're lucky enought to get a temperature that's right around the freezing mark.  Just like most people in real life, you need to have clothes warm enough to bear the freezing weather if you plan on making a trek outside for a long period of time;  that is, unless you'd rather slowly freeze to death.  As an additional way to combat the cold, you create campfires, light fireplaces, and even use kerosene lamps to warm you if you are getting too cold.  An ever growing issue in this game is your thirst.  Water can either be unsafe or potable.  Clean water can be found relatively easy as it is  prevalent in the world (Ex: drinking out of toilets).  Unsanitary water can be boiled over a fire or fireplace to clean and be made drinkable.  Soda can be found in most abandoned homes, they contain both calories and help quench your thirst.  Coffee and tea can be made as an additioinal source of liquids as well as containg special properties that make them slightly better than water.  If you're ever unable to find any of these and you have the materials needed to create a fire, you can melt snow into clean water.  Your fatigue is an important factor in determining your survival.  The longer you go without sleep and the more strenuous the activities you do are, the more lethargic and slow your character becomes.  This can be remedied by taking a nap.  If you're lucky enough to find a weapon you can defend yourself from the wolves which are your only real predator in the game.  Wolves are a surprisingly terrifying adversary in a game such as this.  Ammo for your rifle (which is the only firearm available this early in the game) is scarce and you are required to conserve and effiectively use your ammunitions for hunting deer or other smaller game or to protect yourselves against wolves.  Flares are also an effective recource to use in defending yourself from animals.  The Long Dark is overall a great survival game.  This review was written during the alpha and I'm sure there are many more features to come.  I'd easily give this game a 9/10.","January 31, 2015","true","14.2"," 94 of 115 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","94","115","11","0"

It's quite long, but it really was one heck of a ride and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n>Crash plane in probably Canada. Cold as hell\n>Run down a hill trying to find shelter, fall and sprain various limbs. Limp towards a cabin. Find some stuff.\n>Keep walking forever until I see a logging camp. Find more stuff, keep walking.\n>Find a ranger outpost, find a few bits and bobs but not much.\n>Make a fire for the night and try to sleep under a train bridge. Wake up cold after my fire goes out during the night and I'm getting cold.\n>Wander until I find the enterance to a dam facility. Dark as all night inside. Remember I have flares, use one.\n>Find more flares and a lamp with fuel. Spend my night scouring the facility for supplies, find some useful stuff.\n>I need to find supplies so I don't sleep. Wander until I eventually find my way outside to a balcony of sorts on the other side of the dam.\n>Walk down the snowy path to a frozen river. Figure something must be nearby so I walk along it and eventually find a cave with some wood. Getting really, really tired but it's daytime and I don't want to waste daylight, but I sleep anyways. Wake up with a few hours of light left.\n>Keep walking until I find a cave system. Figure it leads somewhere, it doesn't. It gets dark so I spend the night there with a fire made of wood I found and chopped in the cave. I toil the hours away sewing my clothes, cooking meat I found on dead animals, melting snow.\n>Come daylight I'm ready to roll. Wander until I reach the end of the river. I can't find anywhere it leads to. Nothing.\n>Keep searching for some buildings or something, but can't find anything. Getting cold so I decide to backtrack to the dam and try my luck on the side I came from.\n>As I ascend the slope to the balcony it gets dark and I get sleepy. A blizzard starts to set in, but I don't think it will be an issue.\n>I see another balcony across the dam, so I cross the small ledge of the dams' wall to it. Find some palettes for firewood. >I start freezing to death. I make a fire, add the wood I found and figure it will last 5 hours like it says it will.\n>Tired, so I try to place my bed roll down. Not enough room on the ledge so I move it a few feet away into an alcove in the wall.\n>Think I'm close enough to the fire so I sleep for a few hours.\n>Wake up suddenly. I'm freezing to death. My vison is blurry and my movement is lurching. Frantically make a fire. It fails so I try again. It works. Maybe I won't die after all...\n>I heat some soup and make some snow water. Unbeknownst to me, my fire is dying and I'm still barely not dead from the cold. Fire dies. I walk over (Trying my best not to fall to my death) and chop a palette into wood. Takes 45 mins and now my vison is getting blurrier.\n>Run to the fire and add the wood. Watch it all get eaten up in a matter of seconds due to the cold. Panic and run towards the door to go inside the dam.\n>For some reason it won't let me open it when clicking. I think maybe somehow it's too dark for me to find the door and open it? I don't know what's going on. I frantically chop some wood and try to make a fire. It fails. Too windy. Light my lantern, but it doesn't help. Poof lantern dies. I click on the door like a madman, but to no avail.\n>I try to make another fire, it fails. I decide there's only one thing to do. I make my peace. The door has bested me.\n>Fling myself off of the dam and fall to my death. RIP.\n\nIn conclusion, those 3 and a half hours were the most frighteningly intense and immersive I've ever experienced in any game. I felt the emotions as if they were real. Fear, desperation, hopelessness. I heard this game was good and it was on sale so I bought it. Nothing could have possibly prepared me for how great this game is. It is an absolute masterpiece. The art is beautiful, and the world feels believable. The gameplay is nearly seamless, and it's insanely fun. If you're considering this game, but it right now. I promise you'll love it. It's worth every penny.\n\nMY ONLY ISSUE- I would like to see an option for reviewing and/or saving your journal upon death. I kept a very detailed journal of my ordeal and I was sad to have it dissapear after I died.","December 26, 2015","true","13.5"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","55","58","13","0"

It's easy to find yourself completely lost when the weather turns to fog and snow, changing a nice sunny stroll in the woods to "Oh crap it's -35C and I need to get a fire started ASAP or I'm going to freeze!".\n\nInterested to see where the story mode goes when that is complete, but the sandbox mode is worth paying for already.","February 18, 2015","true","82.6"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","59","65","6","0"

I was initially kinda turned-off by the graphics\nbecause they seem a bit cartoonish. But as I've played, I've seen they are quite sufficient i.e. serve\nthe purpose.\n\nA lot of people at this point are complaining about the wolves being too hard. There is an option now\nto play without them if you wish. But seriously, they are only hard till you learn by dying a bunch of times\nhow to handle them. It's a steep and harsh learning curve. Survive or die trying!\n\nIt's hard to put my finger on WHY I love this game so much. I think it's because it's a lot simpler than a lot\nof other games. I like Skyrim, but I had to read up on it for two weeks when I started. There is not much to\nlearn with this game as the interface is quite intuitive. How to handle the wolves is maybe the only thing\nyou will want to google.\n\nI think it appeals to the prepper in me to survive another day, clawing and grabbing against horrible odds,\nwhether it be a blinding snowstorm with no shelter in sight, or being nearly out of food with a wolf outside.\n\nYou CAN handle the wolves. I've learned to avoid them from experience. On my current run, I am 53+ days\nin and only fought one once or twice at most. Most of the time you can outrun them. Don't let the wolves\ndiscourage you.\n\nI also have to mention that the audio is stunning in this game. The creak of tree branches, etc.\n\nBottomline is that you might be surprised how this game stirs you at a deep level to keep trying to beat\nyour previous record. Try it!

Every choice you make matters.  Every second counts.\n\nWhat I love most about this game is all the different elements that are combined in determining how long you can withstand the fight to survive.  There's the standard health, but that's really the least of your worries.  In a game where you can literally freeze to death, the thing you should be most concerned about is the unpredictable weather.  On top of that is the ever-present threat of hungry wolves and bears.  Sure, there's deer and rabbits, but if you're willing to downgrade to dog food as means for sustenance, then you can bet those wolves and bears won't even stop to think before trying to take a bite out of you.  Next on the list is the matter of shelter.  You're not always going to be able to hide away in cabins (and for those lucky enough to find them, bunkers).  No, there are going to be times when you're going to have to try and find somewhere to camp out at when fatigue has run you ragged.  The great thing is that fire isn't really an issue.  You have a multitude of options when it comes to making yourself your own little bonfire, and it's not all that hard to do.\n\nNow I'm going to circle back around to that standard health deal.  Water?  Yeah, it's your lifeline.  You can survive a little while when you're starving, but dehydration will kill you swiftly.  Your source of water is melting snow at the fire.  However, just that isn't enough.  You need to boil the water to make it safe, or else you're at risk of getting sick.  Are we having fun yet?  You might be thinking, "This game has way too many factors working against me.  It's not even worth it."  Not entirely true (as far as the first part; the second is up to you to decide).  The funny thing is that food isn't as big a worry as you'd think.  Remember those deer and rabbits I mentioned earlier?  Sometimes you'll run across the frozen remains of a deer and be able to harvest some meat.  When you do find shelters, then you're guaranteed to find some kind of food (and no, not just dog food).  And if you get desperate enough, you can always eat cattails you find along the edges of waterways.  Of course the level of difficulty plays a big factor in just how hard it is to survive.  My favorite is the difficulty setting in where wolves and bears won't attack you!  Unless provoked... it's not that easy.\n\nAll in all, this game is really just wonderful.  There's no such thing as too much praise.  The most exciting thing?  This game is still in the alpha stage, and there's still a story mode to be explored!","August 24, 2015","true","32.4"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","56","61","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsfutur/recommended/305620/","itsfutur","Based Futur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsfutur/","101 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been playing The Long Dark for several hours now daily for the last several days. I think it is fair to call this game a "singleplayer survival experience." Here's what I find relevant to share with the Steam Community as of now:\n\nAboutThe paralleling concept of this game is based on the premise of you, a plane crash victim, surviving in a number of environments abandoned by humanity. With the object of survival /obviously/ in mind, you spawn in a random place on the map and must scavenge for food, water, shelter, and other assets of survival for as many days as possible.\n\nImpressionsWhen I first dropped into the game world, I died within 17 hours. I was really edgy and tense playing this game for the first time, expecting wolves at every corner. I played with the lights out, and sure enough, I got a jumpscare when a wolf tackled me and tore my character apart (yay for wolves tearing characters apart!) My second game has been a lot better and I have survived just over a week so far.\n\nTime in the game passes slowly, a day in gameplay is almost a full hour. So with this game, you are guaranteed a great deal of hours that you can spend in the action.\n\nThe graphics, as far as indie games go, are pretty good. Textures are occasionally just "O.K." But what is to yell about is the art direction. This said, the overall scenery and ambience that makes up this game is stunning. The sunrise and sunset is beautiful, the snow is pretty, the lighting of user-usable items is realistic and alludes well to the general game world.\n\nIt is relevant to acknowledge that unlike some games in the "Survival-Adventure" genre title, this game is not procedurally generated. Meaning: it's not a new map everytime like games such as Minecraft. Despite this being so the case, the game has felt seemingly infinite. After playing a rather decent number of hours, I know I have only scratched the surface of the exploration on the map.\n\nWill I like it?Though it IS an early access title, I think many people will be very pleased by the definite unique style the game brings. It is a nice break from the generic multiplayer gameplay introduced and obviously found in games like DayZ and Unturned. Though it is a neccesity to acknowledge that these games are both fine titles, it is equally fair to acknowledge that their gameplays involve a number of crude dynamics turning other individuals, the environment, zombies, and other things against you in a constantly regenerating world. In the universe of "The Long Dark", once things are gone: they are gone, they will not come back. The realistic experience of limited resources and materials can only be broken by a number of actual renewable resources in the wild. The differences are fair and don't really subtract anything from the gameplay. If anything, they add a great deal of intensity and action to your experience.\n\nIt's very fair to say that your only enemy in this game is how slow you move. Failure to keep moving means definite death. You will either certainly starve, freeze, or be torn to shreds by the wild wolves of the wilderness.\n\nFinal WordsOverall, you will like this game, but only if you're up for taking long treks across big chunks of open world, exploring, potentially being attacked by wild animals, and playing with many basic survival game dynamics. At this point, as the game lies as an EAG, I would give it an 8/10. They've done a great deal of work to make this game a wonderful experience so far for myself and hundreds of others, however, there are certain things that could definitely be added, changed, edited, or completely removed.\n\nI look forward to seeing the future development of this game. I will refer back to this review as development progresses to update users here of the changes (game-wise, personally/opinion-wise, etc.) Shouts to Hinterland Studio, and best of luck!\n\nThank you, hopefully this review has served you well.\n\nSee you on the dark side!","January 2, 2015","true","12.2"," 75 of 90 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","75","90","4","2"

Can't do that. . .  yet? Have to fist fight them with your bare hands (You lose).\nThere is a gun, if you can find it and equally important, ammo. It's the only weapon in the game so far. I've plundered about 15 structures in my 2 hrs and didn't find it.\nIt seems like there will eventually be some sort of crafting system (via work bench), but its definitely not finished.\n\nPlan on being hardcore and surviving the unforgiving canadian wilderness, by living off the land or out of a cave in a realistic way, without stealing supplies from people? No chance. You are FORCED to break into random structures and steal supplies.\nIt's fine if you want to do that, but be aware, there is no way around it. I can only assume, based on the way everything is currently balanced, that there are no plans to support that. If it bothers you, as it does me, you may want to wait on purchasing.\nI'd like the option to survive off the land, because while thats impossible, I hardly consider it a survival game. You should not NEED to rely on buildings and the contents inside them.\n\nIt's rather new, so most of these problems will likely be fixed over time, but as of now, I just can't recommend it. I'm not trying to bash the game, but give useful criticism to the developers so they can improve the game and to you, so that you know what you're buying.","December 28, 2014","false","2.1"," 646 of 958 people (67%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","67","646","958","14","36"

You don't fight with any zombie or other people. You fight with weather, hunger, thirst and yourself.

You trudge into the unknown, get attacked by a wolf and die.\nNew day, new life.\nAgain, In the middle of no where, but now there is a blizzard, and you can't even see the trees, you head off, with no idea where you are going, and a few hours later, you die of exposure.\nAfter a few episodes like this, finally you stumble on a small cottage, it has candy bars!! And soda!!! and a prybar!!! Happy and prepped, you set off to find some fire wood and freeze to death.\n\nThe feeling of isolation is overwhelming and complete. You feel the cold, you feel the hunger and most importantly you feel the desire to keep playing and beat the odds, to give the cold harsh landscape one giant finger, and stubbonly keep bashing away at it. I don't know how they have done it, but the game gives you a real will to survive and keep playing. It's brutal and unforgiving, and that's it's charm.\n\nI have never played a game as utterly and immediately immersive as this one, and it's still in alpha.\n\nIn a game genre littered with alternatives and repetitive mechanisms, The long Dark manages to be refreshingly original, and beautiful.

A small team of dev's wanted to make there mark as a studio.\nThe storyline was so good I backed it right away.\nRight now there is only one map with the sandbox mode and you can play with voice acting by Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale(Geeking out there).\n\nWith Early Access build the UI has been super-sleeked up. This team amazes me with every update. With about 90 hours on the game clock and navigating a 50 day then a 72 day run back to back I never even got bored once. Every decision can result in live and death.\n\nBuying into this game now is the best investment you can make on steam right now. Big AAA companies put out cookie cutter games every year with $60 dollar price tags and bugs day one. I assure you in all my years of gaming have I never met a company that works as hard as this little indie team.\n\nI know my review will be eclipsed by "Ran into wolf, peed my pants" 10/10 but I give my 100 percent endorsement of this game as the Current all time King of the Long Dark.\n\nWhy are you still reading?

The moment I started playing though, I recognized that sound. The sound of undisturbed fallen snow, that's been there for long enough to have a crust. That familiar crunch sold me immediately that I liked this game, so I figured I'd play a bit. The wind started blowing, that harsh, cuts you to the bone wind I remember from my childhood, and I started walking. I started off towards a red shape in the distance, noting a deer that ran away as I drew near, and heard what sounded like a wolf howling in the distance. The sun was still bright and my character was already complaining about the cold, so I moved on to find some overturned train cars and a dead body and a deer corpse.\n\nThere was no shelter like I'd hoped, so I looted everything I could and hurried on down the path, burning precious calories. The sound of wolves was definite in the distance, making me nervous about the very obvious trail of footprints behind me until I finally stumbled upon a lumber camp. I went in the first building and realised with dismay this trailer would stop the wind, but I was still cold, and no useable food (just a can of peaches). Then hope came in the form of an object on a shelf across the room. I've never been happier to see a can opener in my life.\n\nOn a more technical side, my 5 year old laptop handled this game remarkably well on moderate settings. I love the style of the art and the sound design is, well... it reminds me of delivering papers in the snow, and the crunch of knee high snow as I pushed my way to doorsteps, hoping to get done before my fingers went completely numb or too much snow reached the bottom of my boots. As I play more of this I may update but first impressions are very favorable.","September 24, 2014","true","0.4"," 65 of 78 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","65","78","0","0"

I died on the first day.  The second game... I died in my sleep the first night.

However, once you get the hang of it, you find yourself in fewer dire circumstances... especially once you start crafting and get yourself established in-game with the proper gear.  However, I still have moments where I'm fully tensed, stalking some prey or approaching a tight bend in a path, and nearly jump out of my chair because of what waits for me around the corner.\n\nThis game has incredible atmosphere and good mechanics.  As has been stated in many other reviews, this is not a reality simulator, but rather a very fun survival and resource management game.\n\nI did not realize how much fun this would be.

It is not my native language but I wanted to do this "review" in English as I think it is important for everybody who is new to TLD.\nI supported TLD and bought it because I think the guys from Hinterland deserve it and I am really looking forward of getting much more out of this game.\n\nOK, I suppose you are interested in TLD or even played already a first round and tried your first steps.\nNow, start by asking yourself, "What do I expect from this game...?"\n\nIt's obvious, TLD is a different kind of computer game. It has nothing to do with the common shooter type, hunting for enemies and zombies or similar kind of more or less realistic wild west style of games. And yes - the graphics are average compared to what is possible today. And to make it even worse, TLD is a single player game in times when in the gaming industry the economic success is mainly coming from games, which are programmed to be multiplayer or even MMOGs. I mean we have all seen complex games like BF and alike and know what's in fact possible. Sure I know that Hinterland as a small company is in no way comparable to DICE or the other big game producers, but at the end of the day, it's the  game user who decides what to play for a similar price.\nSo you might ask yourself, what's the use of spending time in TLD?\n\nWell, TLD is in the alpha phase with only two playable maps so far and there are still a couple of bugs. But important as this all may appear, it's not if you know how to handle it and why you want to play this game. TLD is different, it's an indie type of game with the flavor of an exploration and survival simulation.\nYou are a pilot and a victim of an airplane crash somewhere in the northern Canadian wilderness. You don't have much with you, nothing to eat or to drink, no weapon and especially no compass or gps or something what tells you, where you are. The only thing you know is, that you are in a huge forest. Your task in the game is to survive as long as it's possible. Why all the people you will find around are dead but not the animals is unknown. Maybe the storyline will bring this up one day and may even bring you back to the civilization, but for now just accept it, it's a fact in TLD and increases the suspense. So far, so good.\n\nNow, there are several ways how to succeed in this disquieting situation. I will not go deeper into this, as there are a couple of fine guides out there from some committed community members and there is no use for me to invent the wheel twice. Please refer to these guides, they are important for a new player in TLD and really help a lot.\n\nBut you will also find some guides here and there which offer maps of the TLD landscape.\nAnd here it comes,\nmy most PRECIOUS HINT:\n\nBy all means, DON'T USE MAPS in The Long Dark or you will spoil yourself the most interesting part of this game. The idea of TLD is NOT to check a map, running to these known spots, finding all the stuff you need to survive, and at the end (hahaha)  complaining that the game is "easy, crap and boring".\nIf we are really using maps to walk around and to find all the hidden secrets - I mean don't let's be ridiculous, that's kindergarten and as I said, not the idea of the game - why playing it then when there are others around?\n\nTry to stay honest to yourself, just stay the brave adventurer who crashed in a plane and play your role. Find yourself lying in the snow underneath or near a rock after spawning, not knowing where you are and where to go. Be bold and decide the direction where to go next and you will be fine after a while. Maybe you find the sun in the sky if the weather is favorable enough to allow it, this gives you at least a certain idea about the time of day. Never walk into the night or in a storm! Learn how to prepare food and drink.\nJust allow yourself the suspense of being lost in the wilderness, lost in the cold and really try to find your way through the game. After a couple of sandbox trials you will know better and find your path anyway, since the playable maps are still small. Beware of wolves, stay away or surpass them, they are really dangerous and can end the round in seconds. At this point there is even something of a simulation in the game. Just feel the situation, feel the idea of this game and it will be YOUR game.\nThis is the little secret for me and those who love The Long Dark\n\nYou will soon see, it's not rocket science to find the first cabin or even a house and it is much more fun to play this unusual game as is instead of just looking into an offered community map, only to see that the next house is just around the next hill. These guys from Hinterland are still developing TLD but offered us the sensation to already being part of it.\nSo, my advice is, if you really want to have most out of TLD, don't use maps - ahh - by the way, our pilot doesn't have maps neither, they all burned down in the crash :-)\nHe is smart enough to find his way alone, will you also do it?\n\nSee you out there and lots of fun in The Long Dark ;-)","January 15, 2015","true","12.8"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","69","85","2","3"

I invested much, much more than $20 over a year ago, and don't regret it.\nThe game mechanics are constantly being tuned. It will only get better.\n\nLong Version\nThe Long Dark makes you focus on the things that are vital to a person's personal survival.\nFood, Thirst, Warmth, Energy.\n\nThis game is hard. Make no mistake. But survival is not easy. You are always battling having enough food and water, having enough materials to maintain your core temperature, and having enough energy to complete the tasks to provide for the aforementioned needs.\n\nThe Long Dark captures the concept of this perfectly.\n\nAre the menchanics 100% realistic? No. Of course not. This is a game. It has to be fun and challenging. Despite what you see on TV, Survival is not fun. It's a lot of time consuming monotonous tasks. I would not want to play a game that requires me to only need food once a month, drink once a week, wait 20 mins for water to boil, etc. etc.\n\nSo the game requires a bit of suspension of reality.  That being said, the focus on the core survival elements is spot on.\n\nOne of the chief complaints is that you burn too many calories.\n\nI suspect those doing the complaining are trying to maintain 100% condition.\nIn cold weather, the body needs 6000-8000 calories to mantain condition.  That's a crap ton of food. When's the last time you saw a well-fed survivor?\nIn the game, if you eat nothing, and take care of everything else, you'll live for 4 days before condition drops to zero.  This captures the real-life aspect. Sure, you're hungry, but you can push on for a while before it serioulsy affects you.\n\nIn real life lost survivors are never at 100% Maintaining 100% condition is not the goal of the game.\n\nTry this next time you play... take care of everything else, but don't worry about food until your condition drops.  Then feed yourself, ensure all other needs are met, and rest.\n\nI could drone on about this, but you get the idea. The Long Dark is not like other games where you can simply eat a snack and restore your health. It's much more real then that.\n\nAbout the DevsThe devs are all industry pros, and The Long Dark is their full time job, not something fly-by-night.\nThey are constantly engaging the community, and putting community feedback into the game.\nBugs are logged and fixed at blazing speed. (For example, a steam user reported a mouse sensitivity issue, and it was hotfixed within an hour)\nThere will be a game. Baring a geomagnetic global event, or world war 3, Hinterland has guaranteed a game release.\n\n\nThe only thing you need to ask yourself is, do you want to be part of developing this great game, and making it better?\nI hope so. I didn't regret it.","September 23, 2014","true","212.1"," 132 of 183 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","132","183","0","4"

Happy yo be alive, you're starting to lay down your bedroll when you hear a growl. Quicly you pull out your rifle, which has only one bullet inside. In an next to absolute darkness you point your gun at the doorway, waiting. Sudden movement. You shoot and miss but the wolf was scared for a moment so you grab your bedroll and quickly get out in the hurricane. There's no way out. There is a little tent right next to the building. As your last resort, with the world blurry, you collect some sticks and make a fire next to the tent. You lay down the bedroll and go to sleep being absoultely sure you won't wake up. But you do. Sick,frozebitten and hardly alive, you wake up and continue surviving.\nAmazing atmosphere, rare gem of a game.\n\nStill there are some problems.\n\n-There is still no storyline yet which means two things.\n+ It adds to the grim atmosphere of an inevitable end.\n- When that feeling is getting old, it's difficult to be motivated to play non-stop.\n- The survival system is harsh. You're supposed to keep track of things every second, which ruins the discovery aspect a   bit. You get hungry, thirsty and tired\n- There are dumb rules like you can't start a fire indoors, but you can fish and do other stuff until you die.\n- The cooking system is poor.\n- The loot is still rather poor in quantity. I get the same items all the time.\n-  Why can't I craft an arrow head straight away or just sharpen one end? Seems dumb.\n- Why is there no mapping system?

This game is the most polished "survival game" I've ever played, it is the only game where you can really feel the cold, the thirsty, the hunger. I took a LOT of pictures, because the world environment is so wildy and beautiful at the same time. I want to point out how in this game you can see wolves engage rabbits and other pacific animals. They try to escape of course. I want to say this because this is the first game after Stalker series, where you can see in action a real I.A. in the world.

GET OFF ME WOOOOLFFF AAAAAAHHH....GRRR ARRR GRRROOWL arroOoOooo...WHACK WHACK WHACK!!!! YIP YIP YIP!!!! TAKE THAT YOU SOB!!!! After such an encounter you look down at your invisible feet and see your blood staining the cold white snow...You find an underground bunker...Thankfuly theres a bed, some beans, water and a first aid kit. You patch yourself up just to squeeze some more time in your pathetic lonely life. You can hear the wind howling as you huddle in your bed and go to sleep. Its 7:47 a.m. Time to get moving. What a nice day! I should go find some more supplies. You stumble upon a watchtower that overlooks a frozen body of water. you find a rifle and a box of rifle rounds. Great! now I can defend against predators, Is it getting windy again?\n\nYou WILL die! you WILL get lost...Oh boy will you get lost. There are 3 areas that connect to each other and lots of dead ends.\n\nI give this game a cool canadian 9/10. Will give 11/10 if they add ALOT of stuff. The devs have skills and they need to add as much as possible to this game. If you like suvival games you should buy it. I challenge you to try and make it 10 days on the hardest difficulty :P You will feel like survivor man but you will want to cry when you die! Get this game!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIts Time to update my review! April 03 2015.\n\nI wrote my first review after some beer so it was a bit silly. Now I would like to make a better shorter review.\n\nFirst thing I'll say is the devs are very good at what they do. They care about the community and respond fast to bug fixes (barely any bugs :D) They recently updated the game giving it a really nice boost. It has become apperant to me that the game will grow at a happy and consistant rate. This game and its devs definitely deserve your support. It always leaves me wanting to go back to it to continue my playthrough or even restart if I fail to survive. I could go into detail about why this game is so good but I dont want to spoil anything for you. Just know that if you like survival games the $20 is 100% worth it.","March 24, 2015","true","54.5"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","44","49","13","0"

I won't deny that it can get boring fairly quickly, but that doesn't matter in my opinion. The few hours you spend playing the game before you get bored are magnificent.\n\nI start a new sandbox game. Mystery Lake. I know a few locations, but I don't know the map. I immediately begin exploring, hopefully coming across a jacket to ease the icy chill in the air. The weather isn't too bad, so I'm able to relax a little. I follow the train tracks, making a few slight detours when I spot a wolf skulking around. Eventually I come across a derailment, red cars toppled in front of me. The winds picked up now so I think it'll be a good time to huddle down and get warm for a few hours before continuing to find some decent shelter. I step into the train car and stare into the corner. A frozen body is in the corner. I quickly check his inventory, feeling slightly guilty, but I'm going to need whatever he's carry more than him now. Discovering an energy bar and a soda, I retreat to the opposite end of the car with my prize. Huddling down out of the wind I study the body. Will this soon be me?\n\nThere's a snow storm outside now, and not even the car is protecting me. I need to move or die. I stumble out into the arctic temperatures and blindly pick a direction, praying to come across some decent shelter. Suddenly, I hear a howl. Black shapes materialise out of the snow and pad towards me. Wolves. I sprint now, the snow storm the least of my worries. I'm getting tired, hungry, and thirsty, but I can't stop. To stop would be suicide. I continue onwards, my vision starting to get blurry. My movements become sluggish. I'm going into the long dark.\n\nSuddenly, I see it. Almost right in front of me, a hut on a small hill. Hope flares inside me as I try and sprint up around the path to the front door. I can barely walk now, I know my conditions frighteningly low. But I made it. The Trappers Hut. I'm safe.\n\nUntil the food runs out.","December 3, 2014","true","9.6"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","48","56","0","1"

You should get a quick grasp of the map based on your spawn points, seeing as they're for the most part pre-determined, if you don't know where you're going and plan ahead of time, your life will be miserable. Your character requires a lot of food and water, but getting it isn't hard, so long as you have an axe to harvest firewood (or move around a lot, like me.) you have to play very nomadish in this game because in order to get by you need to keep moving, every precious second can mean life or death, and I believe people hope to see the scenery too much and not focus on the main aspect, survival, and that makes people think "oh this game is too hard because I can't do this or that." It's not like that, it's a fun game, but you have to play in a way where you're a nomad, and always have a plan in case things don't go as planned (and that happens a LOT in this game.) make sure to use flares to your advantage, as well.\n\nNow what's the point of this review? Don't listen to the people saying the game is "too difficult" because it's NOT THAT HARD, you just have to have a plan for what you want to do, and from what I've seen, people aren't very good at planning ahead of time (really, go watch some of the youtube videos...) you have to expect nature to throw everything it has at you, and you have to be ready to have multiple routes if for any case one of them is blocked by wolves (which is not uncommon) you can't rely on only one plan, you have to have multiple, you have to know what you're planning to do, get a very in-depth understanding of your surroundings, make sure you have flares, bandages, and anti-septic. If for any reason you notice you're running low on food, you go out the next day, even if it's extremely windy (I literally ran through a blizzard to survive, you have to be ready to do anything to survive.) and make note, any mistake you make, can (and most likely will) cost you your life. A wolf is your worst enemy, if you get attacked by one, it's not unlikely you'll be brought to below 50% condition (health) so be ready for the worst of situations, and hope for your own sake that nature doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you over...or you can just bring a flare.\n\nNow onto the rating:\nGameplay? I'd give it a 7/10 for now, it's all I want in a survival game but it's really lacking on things to do, but keep in mind it's early access.\n\nSound? 8/10, they're realistic, they're not annoying.\n\nMusic? ???/10, I have in-game music disabled, I feel it kills the atmosphere.\n\nOverall?: 7.5/10 for now, it's a good game but it really is missing a lot of things (not to mention your character eats and drinks like a god damned bear before hibernation, but hey, as long as you plan what you want to do out it's not too bad.)\n\n\n\nNote, SPOILERS below, if you want to find things yourself, DO NOT READ THIS:\n\nYou'll need a game plan if you want to get far in this game, my usual game plan is to find the Trapper's Homestead and hope the rifle is there, if not, well, atleast scavenge up what's inside and go back out (granted that you're not freezing, if you are then take a break and get it together) I usually go from there to Max's Last Stand, and then to the trains (be careful of the wolves, there's often a few.) there's a camp office near there, and around there there's about 4-6 buildings which can all be looted, some have dead bodies, some don't, from there I usually head toward the big mountain to scale up it (by this point, if you have a rifle, you should have enough food to survive at least 3 days.) inside there's plenty of things to help you, can openers, food, water, medical supplies, and of course.. a fire place. Light a fire and hang out for the night, if there's a blizzard or heavy wind, don't go out the next day. Sleep until it blows over. Then you just gotta well...scavenge, you have enough food to go for quite a ways by this point (so long as you made sure to go over every place and grab things.)","September 27, 2014","true","1.3"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","2"

So I leave the trailer I had shacked up in, walk out into a foggy, dim haze only to slip off a slope and land on the ground below, suffering a sprained ankle. Even worse, mere yards away was a (presumably) cold and hungry wolf, growling and looking me dead in the eyes. The wolf approached, and with my ankle injured I wasn't able to outrun. With the wolf approaching more and more rapidly, I hastily take out my nearly broken hunting rifle, load it with the only bullet in my bag, and just as the wolf pounces I pull the trigger, hitting it right in the head, an instant kill. With the wolf dead, I calm down a bit, only to realize that, in my panic, I had run outside in -20 degree (celsius) weather, and I was suffering terribly from the cold. With no way to see through the fog, and a sprained ankle, no weapons, I was bound to die. Yet I brought myself to start limping forward, slowly. I slowly began to weaken, my condition getting worse and worse as the minutes passed. But just as all hope was lost, I faintly made out the shape of a tall structure. AN ABANDONED WATCHPOST! I crawled up the winding stairs to the top, and collapsed upon a shabby bed in the corner. After regaining my senses, and warming up a bit, I threw a log in the wood stove and warmed up with a can of beans and a much needed drink of water. There was still a long day ahead."\n\nI've had my eye on this for a while and I decided to give in and try it out. The game is early access which I've had 50-50 opinions on, due to buying into games that have still not really delivered.\nWhen I dropped into the sandbox mode(Only mode available so far), I felt a bit uneasy about this game as well. Highly stylized but low realism, it just seemed like another walkabout. But then as I figured out the mechanics, got mauled by wolves, froze to death, and walked off a cliff shattering my ankles, I REALLY got into it.\nThe atmosphere is FANTASTIC. Once you start playing for a while, your mind goes into overdrive trying to think up a survival plan, looking out for danger, managing your vitals, and deciding if the space in your bag will be filled with food or materials. The gameplay itslef is not at all exciting, but the mood shifts from calm, to panic, to dread, to fear, back to calm in the space of a single minute.\nFantastic, and it's still being worked on and improved. Definitely recommend, even in early access.","December 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","41","47","0","0"

There is alot of content added already and the developers is one of the best ones I've ever seen for such a game, they always keep on updating and bringing new content to the table. This game has NO zombies instead your worst enemy is nature itself, the weather can be really dangerous but so can the bears and wolves, just be careful where you walk and try not to get their attention.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_stag/recommended/305620/","_stag","Stag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_stag/","113 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Long Dark is a first-person survival game. A geomagnetic event has caused your character's plane to crash somewhere in the snowy Canadian wilderness, and armed with only a small handful of supplies, you must do what you can to stave off death for as long as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, death comes in many forms in this game. Due to the fictional geomagnetic catastrophe in-game, the weather has gone into a permanent winter, with random snow, fog and winds which vary in intensity from "mild" to "I literally cant see 5 feet in front of me". The event has affected wildlife as well, and some- especially of the 'wolf' and 'bear' variety- will attack you on sight.\n\n--BASICS--\n\nThe elements arent the only thing out to get you. In The Long Dark, you are basically tasked with survival, and to do so you must satisfy 4 ever-decreasing statistic bars: Warmth, Sleep, Hunger and Thirst.\n\n"Warmth" is affected in a number of ways. First, there is 'temperature', as well as 'wind chill'. Im not 100% certain how one affects the other, but needless to say, the lower the numbers, the faster your "warmth" meter will decrease. You can add 'warmth' by means of clothing (which some can be layered for additional temperature increase bonus), standing near fire or heat sources, eating hot food/drink, or going to an interior, closed location (in a cabin, etc). Sleeping will add warmth, but if the surrounding temperature is cold enough, you will still wake up freezing if you do so outdoors.\n\n"Sleep" stat will slowly drop as the day goes on, and can be hastened by carrying too much weight, thus making you tired earlier than usual. Sleep is possibly the stat with the least amount of worry involved with it, as you can pretty much sleep anywhere (so long as you have a sleeping bag, and you begin the game with one). It may not always be SMART to sleep, depending on circumstance, but it is about always possible. "Sleep" can be restored by... well, sleep. Hot tea can be consumed before rest to increase the effectiveness of your rest, and hot coffee can be consumed to reduce the rate at which the bar depletes.\n\n"Hunger" stat naturally drops as time progresses. In this game, hunger is represented by "calories". At the maximum 'full' level, your character has 2,500 calories. Items which you eat will replenish calories, and depending on what the item is, the recovery value will vary from 0-1000 calories per item use. If you eat something which would put your calorie count above 2500, the number caps and the remainder of that item will stay in your inventory, so you can eat the rest later. You are not going to be able to survive forever on the junk food you find in cabins, etc, so ultimately you will have to find a way to harvest those delicious animals running around the map.....\n\n"Thirst" depletes as time progresses, or if you eat something salty (IE, a box of crackers). Not certain if it drops faster with strenuous labor. Water in this game is a commodity that is everywhere- literally. Your character's main source is from the snow itself, and while you have a fire built you can melt snow into water, then boil it for safe consumption. Water can be found in a number of places including bottles of the stuff and from a toilet bowl...and all can be consumed, but if you do not boil non-pure sources before drinking, you can stand to catch disease and die without treatment.\n\nOnce any of the 4 stat bars reaches 1/4, an icon will appear in the corner letting you know it needs attention soon. If a bar reaches "empty", a percentage will appear next to the appropriate icon. It begins at 100%, and if it hits 0 your game is over. Multiple bars can be reduced to 'below empty' at once.\n\n--SURVIVE!--\n\nYou dont begin with very many supplies, there is no map in the game as of yet, and the odds are stacked against you... yet you still have a fighting chance. Your first few games will find you learning the ropes, and-- due to the fact that the game is still in ALPHA and has no much-needed tutorial-- this will either involve you dying a lot, or referring to the Wiki a lot, which spoils a lot of the surprises to find.\n\nOnce you have gotten a good feel for the game and begin to remember certain details of the maps ("if I follow these train tracks it'll take me to a bunch of cabins in a lumber yard!"), things will become much more fun, and you can concentrate on exploration rather than figuring out how the game's rules work.\n\nFind all sorts of gear to help you survive, from oil lamps, axes, knives and even a rifle, to clothes, food, firewood, medical supplies of all types and more. You can 'harvest' these items for basic materials to repair your other gear, or even to make new items altogether at a 'work bench'. No firewood, and youre indoors? Chop the tables, chairs and shelves up and burn em. Hunt for wildlife-- and then eat them, gut them and turn their skins into wearable coats, warmer sleeping bags, ETC. Loot corpses of other explorers who didnt make it. Pull a torch out of a fire and use it to swing at attacking wolves to scare em away. Find a hut on a frozen lake and do some ice fishing! Stagger blindly through a white-out blizzard with your stats all nearly bottomed-out, thinking youre about to die, when suddenly you see the shape of a house in the distance.....\n\n--THOUGHTS--\n\nThe Long Dark could REALLY stand to use a tutorial, but seeing as how it is technically still in Alpha it can be forgiven. Other than that, the game feels very solid and is quite addicting to play. The elements against you and your meters constantly draining put an urgency on you to make progress in the game, but never to the point of it making the game obnoxious to play. Sometimes your stats may be struggling and there is tension in trying to 'beat the clock' before you die, but thats part of the fun. Will you make it?? *IS* that a house you see in the distance..??\n\n*YES!!!* .....is exactly how you will react when you DO find one. My favorite aspect about this game so far is the act of DISCOVERY. After staggering through the harsh wilderness for hours up to days, fending off animal attacks, cold and starvation, it feels extremely rewarding to find even the smallest of cabins dotted around the maps. Every one of them is loaded with goodies, and item locations/ "drops" are random in every playthrough so you never know what youll find, but you always know itll be good stuff.\n\nThe graphics look nice, especially the skyboxes. Ive taken a number of screenshots of the game and for a title with "white snow everywhere" its amazing how much color gets packed in there. Weather effects look great- the snow will actually blow with the wind currents, spiral off rooftops and get sucked into the breeze... its nice attention to detail VS 'randomly falls from sky at various quantities'. Maps are massive and packed with things to see and discover, lots of interesting locations, and a widely-varying topography that will make you FEEL like youre standing on the top of a mountain, or at the very base looking up at one. Sound is very well done and is plenty convincing, from old panes of glass clattering in their window from howling winds hitting them, to the roar of a bear before he eats your face. Music is intermittant, but always pleasant to the ear. It sounds cool and mysterious, much like the game itself. Controls are solid, and the little bit of aiming which takes place is pretty accurate.\n\nOverall, I'm hooked. Its a lot of fun, presents a reasonable challenge and- most importantly- is still being worked on/updated by its developers. I purchased this game for $5.00 during the Steam Holiday Sale and it was totally worth it, but with 50+ hours already into the game and Im barely beyond map 1, I'd be willing to have paid full price.

On my first trip to Pleasant Valley, I arrived exhausted, over-loaded, and the sun was going down. The wind started picking up, but I ignored it. My character was too busy checking abandoned cars for candy bars and matches. Before I knew it, he was in the middle of a ferocious blizzard. He hopped into the nearest the car and tried to wait it out.\n\nThe temperature dropped lower and lower as the storm persisted into nightfall. The wind howled all around, and my character began to freeze. Holy cow...he's going to die out here... I realized. I'd helped him survive for over 100 days, and I was about to lose it all. He lit his storm lantern to try to stay warm. He curled up in his sleeping bag and took little naps. The night crawled on, and his condition grew worse and worse by the minute. By the time the storm finally abated, hypothermia was setting in. He crawled from the car and used one of his precious matches to light a small fire with some sticks he had collected.\n\nHe huddled beside that fire and fed it one stick at a time while the wind did its best to blow it out. When dawn came, he abandoned the fire and staggered along the road looking for better shelter - a shack, a house, a garage...anything.\n\nIt was hard to see with his blurry vision, but he found what appeared to be some kind of an abandoned farm house. He made his way inside and stumbled around the house. Upstairs he found a bed, and crawled gratefully beneath the blankets.\n\nHe slept on and off all that day and the next, and bit by bit, he recovered enough to leave the house and collect some kindling. It was a nice sunny day, and he was able to save the last of his matches by starting a fire with his magnifying glass. He melted snow and boiled enough water to stay hydrated for a few days, then decided he'd better do something about food.\n\nLuck was with him, and he was able to chase a wolf away from a fresh kill. As he leaned over the dead deer and pulled his hunting knife from his belt, I thought, alrighty - everything's falling into place. Looks like surviving in Pleasant Valley isn't going to be that tough after all.\n\nFive minutes later, he was dead. Another blizzard rolled in while he was breaking down the deer, and I was fiddling with my cell phone. I looked up just in time to see him fading into the long dark, and that was that. I stared at the screen in horror. There's no save to revert to... no retry button... no Phoenix Down to tickle his nose with. GAME OVER.\n\nThat's The Long Dark in a nutshell. This isn't a game in which you frolic about the hills, or hit the save button just in case what you're about to do turns out to be as stupid as you think it is - but you want to try it anyway...\n\nThere are no safety nets. No second chances. You have to constantly be on the lookout for danger. You relax, or get distracted… you die. So you listen to the wind. You keep an eye on the sky. You check the temperature. You look out for fallen trees you might be able to clamber up just in case there’s a hungry wolf over the next ridge. You hear one howl in the distance, and you crouch and count your bullets, or ready a torch and hope it’s more scared of fire than it is hungry. In the easiest mode, the wolves and bears act like they would in nature. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. In the normal and hard modes, a geomagnetic event has made them loopy and aggressive. In Stalker, the hardest mode, there are wolves everywhere. It can be a challenge getting through certain areas unscathed. In their eyes - you're a sloppy joe in pants - if you still have pants by that point.\n\nA few other points:\n- The graphics are stylized but attractive.\n- The community's pretty good. Most active players are helpful and friendl.\n- The developers are communicative and active. They still monitor the board to weed out jerks.\n- You can craft and cook items utilizing natural resources.\n- It’s a lonely, melancholy game.\n- After surviving for long periods, you can get stuck into routines. Fortunately there are five different regions. You can travel to another region if you get tired of the one you’re in. Each one has its own personality and challenges.\n- Each game is different. You may have found a hatchet in a dilapidated little hut on your first run, but on your second run – there’s nothing there…\n- You rarely spawn in the same place twice. In Stalker, you may spawn twenty feet away from a wolf while it's still dark outside and the temperature is well below zero. Or maybe you get lucky and spawn in the Trapper's Homestead and find a rifle hanging from the gun rack.","January 10","true","466.0"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","31","32","5","3"

Also, it doesn't feel like the game rewards me for my skill, critical thinking and creative ways of approaching the situation. Instead, it feels more luck based then anything.\n\nIn regards to the mechanics. Starting with the hunger system, good lord man, no one can get that hungry and eat that much food in one day. Also, the conditioning mechanic on items......I've had knives, can openers, rifles, hachets and other items presented in the game. Those items do not break apart after a few times of me using them in real life. Lastly, the fact I can't wear multiple layers of clothing is quite fustrating, because if I were in that situation, I'd be wearing layers upon layers of clothing to the point where it is not cumbersome. Another thing which is quite annoying is how fast your hunger and thirst rise. If this character ate this much before the plane crash, his fatass wouldn't even survive the first hour.\n\nBut, I do understand that the item condition mechanic of the game is suppose to be a way to make you go out and look for materials to repair your say, hunting rifle or knife.  Or that food supplies go out faster to give incentive to go out and hunt a deer or eat some canned goods. It's there to make you move about and explore more versus holing yourself up in a cabin and piling up a massive supply cache. (That's what I would try aiming for.)\n\nThis game has the potential to be amazing, but as it stands it's not as realistic as it claims to be and gets way too reptitive too fast.\n\nI'm going to give this game a 5/10 atm, until futher notice. I do realize this game is in alpha so changes can definitely happen.\n\nP.S. The price of the game was reasonable so it doesn't bother me much. I hope the money I put towards this game helps the futher development of the game.","October 31, 2014","false","3.4"," 299 of 472 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","299","472","3","4"

All in just one day too. I was a master at survival.\n\nI had been to the dam my first playthrough and it proved to be very resourceful, and it was a very safe place too. I could imagine starting up a life with a wife and kids here. No joke it really was that safe--or so it seemed.

The developers seem to be very involved with the community as well.\n\nNow for the actual review:\nA survival game without zombies or other players hunting you down?  Impossible, you might think.  Some might also think, screw that, where is the real threat?  From nurishment to wolves, the biggest threat is the weather.  Shelter is a commodity, offering temporary reprieve from the frozen world outdoors.  God help you if you have to spend a couple nights outside.  I loaded up my makeshift fire with plenty of wood, only to awaken after a couple hours in the midst of violent winds.  Needless to say, my fire had been extinguished, and I spent the remainder of the night inside a ruined boxcar.  As morning broke, I was nearly dead from the cold, but I managed to find an outpost with plenty of supplies and a furnace.  Besides having to share the haven with the corpse of its former tenant, I was quickly able to thaw out, boil some drinkable water, and cook up something to eat.  I have probably a day or two worth of food, and will inevitably have to venture back out shortly to aquire more wood to keep that furnace running.  I dread my next trek, but in the best of ways.  Very few games immerse me in such a way as The Long Dark has managed, and it is merely in Early Access!\n\nThe few complaints I have with the game look like they will be hashed out long before the game's official release.  And those complaints are very, very minor (as of writing this, the only thing that comes to mind is the rate at which your clothing wears down).  The developers are constantly asking for feedback, and have been quick to work out balancing issues.\n\nI have been burned by most other Early Access games, to the point that I was considering never buying one again.  I am so glad that I did some research on this game and saw exactly what it has to offer, right now, aside from the coming additions that it promises to offer.  Do some research, like I did.  Check Youtube for some gameplay.  Read up in the forums.  Anyone on the fence about this game should take a hatchet to that fence.  You're going to need all the firewood you can carry once you decide to brave the cold... ;)\n\n[Update: 05.24.15 @7:29am]\nI still stand behind everything I initially said, and am really satisfied with not only this, but several other indie developers I have since had the pleasure of watching their involvement with the community inparticular.  These guys are great at what they are doing with this.","January 17, 2015","true","23.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","31","33","4","0"

That's the last time I ignore my gut. Hell, ignore my reason, my instinct. Every inch of me was saying, "hey, bad idea; let's not put five miles between you and the ground when every other plane crashed simultaneously four weeks ago." But that's what you do when you're desperate, you stop using your God-given common sense.\n\nIf this does end up being read by anybody other than me, congrats! You are alive and I am dead. And you will probably be easier on me than I am being on myself. You might say, "Jack, you had to take that plane South. You were freezing to death. You had one good day to get the hell outta Dodge." Well, thank you. Maybe you are right, but it is what it is.\n\nEither way, my plane did what every other plane did: it crashed. By some combination of my incredible flying skills (and humility) and nothing short of a miracle, I put her down in a way that didn't crush any of my bones or major organs.\n\nI would take the time to tell you about all the crazy ♥♥♥♥ that's been happening to the world lately, but if you are alive enough to read this, then you know damn well what's going on. If, by some small chance someone deciphers this thing twenty thousand years from now, well...the world went to hell in a hurry. Some insane solar flare sent our magnetic field bonkers and managed to fry every piece of electric hardware ever (my plane is a rebuild from way back so no computer, lucky right?) Not sure what the warmer places in the globe are dealing with, but up north here the weather is about as predictable as a grapefruit squirt.\n\nSo, I'm not dead...yet. In fact, I had the good fortune of crashing and not dying in a place that had been inhabited not too long ago; that, and salvaging a few items that, like me, were lucky enough not to be crushed in my plane, I might actually have a chance. I guess I have to look at it that way so I won't give up and die right now. What's that saying? Expect the worst, hope for the best? Well, I don't even know what to expect at this point but I'm sure there's some other saying for how it can always get worse... actually, I think that's the saying. Not the most creative people making these things up.\n\nAs for what to hope for...how about another sunrise.\n\nEnough of the backstory, that's not what journals are for and I better get to it anyway before either this fire goes out or I pass out. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm out of shape. Someone shoulda had the decency to mention the world was gonna end, I would've gone for a run or two. Who am I kidding? No I wouldn't've.\n\n* * *\n\nIt's sometime mid-morning and I'm standing next to this wreck of a plane, scratching my head at how I'm not dead when I realize I might literally be freezing my ♥♥♥ off...like my actual ♥♥♥ my just fall off of me, land in the snow, and I might not realize it. So I manage to grab my survival pack with the few things I could salvage and I hoof it toward something that looks less mountain-ish and more building-ish in the distance (basically something more square and less pointy). I'm not really thinking thoughts at this point; I am just realizing how out of breath I am trudging about a hundred feet through snow and that if I stop to catch my breath I might become an icicle.\n\nBut would you believe it? A poor, insignificant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me gets lucky, like jackpot lucky, twice in one day. There is a building, which means I might have actually crashed near civilization, which means I might not freeze to death, which means I might find something that will keep me from starving after I chow down on this energy bar. Hell, I might even meet another person, and they might not even want to kill me and eat me. I should be dead, anything could happen at this point.\n\nI snapped a shot of the building[zeemodernnerdblog.files.wordpress.com] with the magically uncrushed Polaroid camera I had in my pack, though I would trade this camera and my left pinky for a hot burger right about now. Screw it, I'll give both pinkies for any amount of ground beef. Did I mention this is day 1 of me surviving out here? Not sure what limbs I'll be willing to trade if I make it ten days. I guess I'll let you know.\n\nThis thing is some sort of dam. I assume it's hydro-electric, no one builds a dam without an opportunity to generate some cash flow from it. Ah, those were the days, when you could subjugate nature for your own personal gain. Well, thank you Mr. Dam-Builder you helped me live today.\n\nBy the way, I say I assume it's hydro-electric now as I am writing this, but at the time my brain is still frozen and I believe I was thinking: "me cold, building less cold, me go."\n\nSo "me went" and "me not freeze." Me actually almost trip over a dead guy holding a storm lantern as soon as I enter the thing. I was horrified at seeing the corpse at the time, but it's really crazy how different your brain acts when it knows you need to live. Let me clarify: when I'd realized I'd tripped over this corpse--this former person with a soul who died a terrible death that I might soon die--I was both horrified and relieved. Relieved because it was dark as hell and this guy is holding a lantern with fuel in it. I don't know how he didn't leave it on, I'm not sure how he died, but all I am thinking is, "thank the sweet Lord: I have light."\n\nThen, I turn the lantern on and see a giant gash in his side and a trail of blood and realize this guy made it about four feet in here before he passed out from blood loss. The snow outside must have covered whatever trail he left out there. But, I feel nothing.  It wasn't like the movies. I know I should have curled up in a ball and sobbed for the tragedy of it all. I should have puked because it's a body and I don't see those, but really, I'm feeling nothing. Call it shock. Call me a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but unless you have been there, you can't know.\n\nThe things I should've been thinking (and not doing so nearly got me killed) was, "what made that nasty huge gash in that man's side? Could it be a thing? A dangerous thing? Could it still be around? Do I need a weapon pronto so I don't end up like this unfortunate gentleman?"\n\nBut anyway...\n\nListen, my fire is dying down. I don't want to keep you on the edge of your seat, but I'm still alive, for today. I have enough stuff at the moment that I can write a bit in the morning before I have to go continue to try to live. I'm not sure why I care so much about writing this, but I hope if you are reading it you'll... yeah, I don't know what I hope.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n\nCheck out my other Steam Reviews\nFor more stories/reviews/articles check out My Blog[zeemodernnerdblog.wordpress.com]","April 6","true","53.0"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","45","57","19","14"

How can this be fun?'  Until you start to play, then the atmosphere starts to suck you in.  The calm silence of only the wind and your breath,  a bright sunrise in the distance.  Then you hear the howl...this time not the wind...and then you just have time to see the dark shape run out of the darkness and kill you.  The first time i played I lasted 35 minutes.  Now that I am a 20 + player I have learned to appreciate the sunrise of another day.  A nice warm fire to stare in and cook food upon.  and utmost, I listen for every little sound in the distance because the thrill of this game is that death can come from any place at anytime and only your quick wits and skill will keep you alive.\n\nDo I suggest this game for others to play?

I ran to the trailers because I figured with all the snow I'd freeze to death fast with what little clothing my character spawned with.  I had great luck with gear in that play through.  I found two rifles, several knives and hatchets, but after 5 days I found 'the door' to Carter river. Unfortulately I didn't have much tinder and of course as soon as I walked out the door a storm hit.  My character survived 2 more days back there looking for a way out but ended up freezing to death lost on the river.\n\nI've since earned my 50 day badge, I even came pretty close to 100 days before I played after a night of heavy drinking.  I ended up trying to see how high I could jump from ledges and ended up falling to my death on the side of a mountain.  Lesson learned, don't drink and survive.  :)\n\nThere are several treacherous places on this map, if the wolves don't get you, the weather or starvation will your first few hours playing the game.  It's not one of those games that's so damn hard you'll get frustrated and lose interest either.  Patience is as much a virtue in the long dark as is caution.  Over time you'll craft clothes and collect what you need to make a bow and arrows.  You'll learn to conserve calories and let the wolves do the hunting for you by following one around crouched down until he takes a deer, and then you'll take him after he takes the deer to get a double meat, gut and hide harvest.\n\nA few things to know if you want tips:\n\n1) The ravine takes you to the next area, don't go that way till you've explored Mystery lake and learned the game's survival basics.\n\n2) A decent set of maps can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530202531\n\n3) Snare traps are a great way to feed your charachter.  Make at least 10 snare traps but preferably 20 or more because after a while they break down, and need to be harvested and rebuilt with new cured gut.  Your return on the gut you use to build them is at least twice and more often 3 times what you'll spend to make them.  Easy calories, set where you see rabbits and forget, check them early the next day.\n\n4) Fish are heavy and offer little calories for how much they weigh.  It's a good idea to cook the fish you catch right in the bob house and store the fish in the bob house so that you can have meat spread out on the map in case you run low on food while your out.  You won't be upset if you spread food out around the area you choose to make camp.  Storms come in fast and without warning.  Stashing food here and there will help you survive longer.\n\n5) Save processed foods in good condition for as long as you can.  Processed foods are lighter in weight than the stuff you can catch and are great for traveling from zone to zone.  Eat the stuff that's going bad when you find if for easy calories, but save the good stuff if you can.\n\n6) Rose hips are great for throwing on the ground in the snow.  They make for an easy to find trail if you're on your way home from your regular routes when a storm hits.  Rose hip trails saved my guy's tail more than once.  You'll need hundreds of them to make a full trail.  I managed to make a trail from the camp office to the first bob house in my last play through.\n\nOther thoughts for the devs:\n\nDon't take the following negatively, you guys made a kick ♥♥♥ game, I love it.  But I'm a critical prick and need to voice my opinion so here it is:\n\nA zippo lighter, flint and lighter fluid would be nice.  Who uses matches these days anyway???  We should also be able to craft some sort of friction fire starting system out of sticks, birch bark and branches or find flint and use that with a knife or hatchet.  For more info see "Dual Survival" watch Codey the giant hippy make fire from almost nothing every time.\n\nGoogle "Fire starting tools" you guys could add plenty of items for starting fires from flint magnesium blocks to those rods that shoot all the 3000f sparks (not flint) when struck with a knife.\n\nOur charachters should level up and be able to carry more weight over time.  Adding a frame pack to the clothing and different levels of bags would be a nice addition to the game.\n\nAn adult human can survive 3 days with no water, and 3 weeks with no food if he/she is sitting around and was well fed before their starvation.  Please loosen up the food and water requirements, we're surviving in the cold not running marathons.  I'm aware that we burn more calories trying to stay warm in cold places, but three steaks a day?? Really?? I'm a ski bumb and ski in New England and Canada, it's not that cold.  I've been out skiing in -20F weather; after 8 hours of that you'll look forward to a hot Irish Coffee and a warm fire, but you won't die if you break the wind properly and keep moving.\n\nRunning and other strenous activities (work) should lower the effects of the cold weather.  Keeping active sould be another way to survive the cold.\n\nMORE BULLETS PLEASE!!!\n\nThe trapper's cabin should have reloading tools and supplies in addition to the work bench so that the old .303 bolt action fir stock rifle can be used more often or those prepper caches should have multiple cases (1000 rounds per case) of ammo.  Bullets come in boxes of 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000.  Black powder, caps, and shells should be stocked at the cabin, it would be another task for the survivor to complete.  Shells should be able to be recycled if picked up.\n\nWe should be able to harvest much more metal from cars to that entire hydro factory.  There are plenty of metal objects that we should be able to melt down for bullets, arrow heads, and tool repairs.  Either that or give us a pick and hammer and let us mine ore and coal.\n\nTips for noobs at Mystery lake:\n\nSAVE THE FOOD YOU FIND FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN, JUST EAT IT BEFORE IT GOES BAD!!! I like to trap rabbits up the river, hunt for wolf and deer on the way out and back, and then catch a few fish on my way back to the Camp office at the bob house nearest the Camp office.  If you want your survival badges, do it like this.  You'll find yourself holed up for 30-40 days at a time eating the extra food you collected just passing time and chowing down.  I recomend collecting the materials you need for the bow and being patient, there aren't very many bullets for the rifle in my experience.  Once you've visited every cabin on the map above, check out the other areas.","August 31, 2015","true","383.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","2"

Why? It creates a unique atmosphere in an open-ended, realism based, beautiful environment with a challenging sandbox gameplay.\n\nHave you ever romantically thought about the experience of living in a lonely wooden cabin, far from the civilization, in the icy north of canada? Can you imagine this ambivalent mood, being in a beautiful, but also hazardous wild nature. Do you want to feel the pulse of the wilderness to experience your own limits? This is the atmosphere, the game is build around. It's not about fear or depression - it's about living at the limits and the willpower to survive.\n\nThe game achieves this by a very unique and own game art, realistic game mechanics and the beautiful northern setting with stunning varying light based on weather and day-night cycle. The realism of the game adds more depths to the decisions you make. There is rarely a strict pattern or some kind of "best practice", that you can follow - it's truely up to you, to decide if a risk is worth the reward. Even your bad decisions may bring you an exciting experience. You will die often in the beginning. But everytime you start a new game, you will be enriched by this experience, getting a feeling for the dangers out there and how to withstand them.\n\nStill unsure? Check this points:\n\nYou like to play in an open ended scenario, with no other goal, than to survive? If not, than better wait until the storymode is added.\n\nBad experience with Early Access Games? This title is nearly bugfree and in a steady development by a small, but professional and experienced gamestudio.\n\nDoes the current content justify the pricing? In my opinion it is more than enough and there are regular content updates, delivered mostly polished and bugfree. It's really high quality entertainment for an unbeatable low price.\n\nTo come to an end.. If you like this genre in general you will not regret the purchase.

Yet, action-wise, there is very litle. This is all about survival and survival depends on the tactics you employ within the game. There are no 'buddies' to ask for help. No one you can telephone. Make a wrong turn, wonder off into the forest with night falling, and you are dead. Simple as that. It's all about decisions and making the correct one at the point you are at is the essence of the game.\n\nThere are no real spoilers in the review - but there are a few tips that could be useful for beginners. Be warned.\n...\n...\n...\n...\nIn fact, the first few times you play, you are likely to end up dead very quickly... There is no real game help, as such, and it is a struggle to understand what is required of you. However, give it time and it starts to make sense.\nWhen the game first starts, you are dropped in a random location and it could be day or night. I suggest starting on the easy level as wolves don't attack you. In some respects, this is more accurate as wolves tend not to attack humans.\nThe first thing to do is find shelter. You are unlikely to survive the cold of the night (or the day) if you are out for too long. This can then be used as a base.\nThere are buildings scattered about to scavenge and hidden caves where you can find a few scraps.\nJourneys need to be planned. Never, ever, go out with just a couple of hours of light left. Darkness comes in rapidly and you are liable to get disorientated and die of hyperthermia. Also, weather can change rapidly and you need to know that you can make it back. Pay close attention to your surroundings and make a map ( I count steps).\nExplore each area thoroughly to find the exit. Carefully time when you leave the exit area.\nThis is the beauty of the game. Everything needs to be calculated carefully to survive - just as in real life.\nAnother nice feature is the lack of other people. Clearly, they were there at some point but for reasons not given, you could be the only person alive on the planet. To meet other people would spoil it and wisely, the developers know this.\nAfter all, what is more terrifying than being totally alone in a hostile environment? And that is the cleverest part of the game - the shear lonliness.\nSo why is the game so compelling if there is no action, as such? Well, you live and die by your own actions and there can be no excuses if you do die. Therefore, everything is down to you the player and we all want to survive, right?\n\nI treat the game as a real life simulator. Should the big freeze ever come, I fancy my chances. Well, maybe a little bit more than most.\n\nBuy this and enjoy one of the most beautiful and yet scariest games ever written (without a monster - or is 'cold' the monster?).\n","September 11, 2015","true","90.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

When I think; "Early Access Survival Game" I think, half-baked half life 2 engine survival game piece of garbage that somehow still manages to attract stupid amounts of attention, with devs that are only there to make a quick buck, and a community of troll snipers that will KOS even if you have zero gear.\n\nThe Long Dark throws all of that out the window. Half-Baked? In the literal sense, yes, but I think with just a few more tweaks you could bring it out of early access. Devs are supportive of the communty, and open to suggestions, KOS troll-snipers (a phenomenon which I like to call "Unturned Syndrome") are removed altogether by removing multiplayer altogether. No it's not the end of the world, belive it or not, not every video game is multiplayer.\n\nThe art style and graphics are lovley, and all of this alone would be enough to set it apart from the crowd of indie survival developers, coughcoughRustH1Z17DaysToDieTheFifthDaycoughcough.\nBut the gameplay goes further. All feels balanced, and while some argue for reduced calorie burn, some argue for increased, so I think it's best to just keep in the middle. There's no insta-craft, something I've wanted in a survival game forever, along with sleep deprivation (which this game has as well). It gives a real sense of acheivment when you finally finish the wolfskin coat you've been working on forever. I love the gunplay.\n(Because hip-firing dosen't work in real life. It just dosen't unless you're supressing, and why would you supress a deer?)\n\nThere's no base building, and this might be my favorite part. I can't tell you how many times I've stumbled across someone's giant ♥♥♥♥♥ monument in Rust. Kinda breaks the survival aspect.\nBullet balistics work,\nAnimals are scary (at night more so)\nThe map (when you consider that it's one giant linked map) is actually pretty bloody huge\nI could just go on and on.\nI could talk to you all day of every thing I love about this game but I don't have the time or the patience.\n\nI definetley recommend this game, for anyone sick of every other reskinned survival game.

I'm currently working on getting all the achievements, and am already on my fourth run.\n\nMy first run (very proud of this) I lasted seventy days, decided to go shoot a bear, got mauled by a bear, somehow survived thanks to medicine, bear died from my gunshot wound, and then I froze to death while trying to harvest his meat.

I had a rifle, and some food, however I had run out of water. I decided to trek out in the morning, as I was quite parched.

He began running but I wasn't having any of that. He tore my jacket wide open and sprained my ankle, why would I let him escape? I began chasing him, but he was ready.

This game is in Alpha stage and is already a real gem. The potential is immense. The atmosphere is awesome, right game modes. Not have music but occasionally sound a successful chords depending on the situation where you are. Currently there are only wolves, bears, deer and rabbits so much wildlife to incorporate.

If you start the sandbox mode the only goal you have is surviving by keeping you warm, finding enough nourishment and other supplies like medicine. Not just the subfreezing temperatures are dangerous you also have to watch out for wolves in the woods they are just as hungry  as you are. The graphics are simple but beautiful and emphasize the unique atmosphare. If you tramp throught the snow you always be like "please please please let me find a shelter with enough supplies for the night" and this is what the game makes so good it is hard but fair.

Personally I love this game, it's not your traditional survival game, there's no zombies or aliens, it's you agaisnt the elements and the wolfs. Currently the game is only sandbox mode but later the developer (Hinterland Studio) plans on adding a storyline campaign. Hinterland Stuidos are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and improving the overall experience. They're great when it comes to feedback and even personal dislikes.\n\nSandbox mode has a ton of replayability, every time I'm thrown into the world, I'm in a new area and I'm scrambling to find a familiar landmark. While attempting to survive you need to worry about food, water, wolfs, overall condition, and even clothing. Every decision you make, makes you second guess yourself. While trying to stay warm and keep your condition manageable, you also need to keep moving and find more supplies to keep yourself alive. It's part luck, part skill, and part making the right moves at the right time. While traversing through the beautifully done landscape you find yourself dodging wolfs, checking your condition, the time and even the weather. I personally can't get enough of this game, and I can't wait to see what the developers have instore for the storyline campaign.\n\nI can say with confidence this game won't be left by the wayside like some other early access games. I've been a victim of developers abandoning games after they were released on early access Steam but I highly doubt this game is going anywhere. Hinterland Studios is a new company with this game being their first release but if you do your research into the team at Hinterland you will be blown away. Huge names that are worked on games like: The Far Cry series, the Saints Row series, Warhammer, Red Faction, Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic, Mass Effect, God of War, and the list goes on and on. These people are NOT new to making games by any means, and it shows with The Long Dark. I've only had to opportunity to play the alpha but I'll say it's one of the best alpha experiences I've had.\n\nI hope this review has persuaded you to purchase this game early access. I will do another review once it's fully released. I hope to see this game hit huge milestones as I'm a huge supporter of this game and the studio. Thank you for taking the time to read this review.\n-Bay Area Buggs\n\nMy Playlist:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkIGJ7Ljv6Ywew9vmHlPM8HVnDZs4mqz0","September 25, 2014","true","92.9"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

The crunch of snow underfoot and the fog of your breath will make you feel like you're there.\n- permadeath. This game brings the challenge back to PC gaming that has been missing for a while.\n- femshep. Jennifer Hale voices the female character. Sorry, no bionics available.\n- challenging. It is a struggle to survive, but they have since added some gradation to the diffuculty level with three settings to choose.\n- regular updates\n- vindicates the 'Early Release' business model. The 'Early Release' concept is hit or miss (Ex: DayZ SA) and is the topic of a lot of debate among PC gamers and interested parties. 'The Long Dark' plays like a beta or even a release candidate, although they call themselves an alpha. It's easily worth the $20 tag on it right now.\n- roadmap. More areas are coming. Maps are coming; I find the lack of maps kind of exciting, there is a thrill of exploration to be had.\n- survival without zombies. Although I could play a hundred zombie shooters and be fine with it, I have to give credit to a novel concept of man-vs-environment in today's arena that is full of zombie shooters.\n\nCons:\n- will test your gamer might. You will die.\n- [This is now fixed and smoothed with weather cues to alert you to oncoming bad weather] weather model. Sometimes it goes from nice outside to foggy to blizzard with little warning.\n\nIn summary, 'The Long Dark' is probably a $30 title than you can get for $20, it's a great alpha, it will provide hours of entertainment and seconds of terror, it's a unique pc game survival experience that's worth your time and your cash.\n\n=== 9/6/15 v256 ( hotfix v258) update ===\n[read this to yourself in Cartman's(tm) voice]\nDear Diary,\n\nIt's been days since I've stepped out of my apartment.

At times, I have to just stop playing because it is exhausting being constantly focused on surviving for hours on end. Do I have enough food? Is my water supply sufficient? Will the weather turn foul while out exploring? Are there wolves in my path? Can I avoid them or must I fight?\n\nThe game only saves when you sleep, enter a shelter/building or become injured. Death is permanent with all saves erasing when you do die. Save scumming is impossible so every time I venture outdoors I am looking out for possible dangers. It's been a learning experience as I have avoided reading guides or looking at videos. The first time I died venturing out in the wilderness at night. I quickly lost my sense of direction. It is much colder at night than during the day so I froze to death. All my other deaths have been due to wolves. Generally wolves are just a nuisance. They telegraph their intention to attack from a long ways off and are easily scared off by fire. It is when you are weak from hunger, thirst, fatigue or the cold that wolves can make an easy meal of you. Even when you are in good shape if your fight with a wolf leads to being wounded gravely you better have first aid gear available. If not you will likely bleed out.\n\nThis game gets you thinking about what you would do if in the same situation. Would you end your life early to avoid the slow death of starvation or would you fight will all your might to survive no matter how much suffering you endured? You can't really hold it against the person in this situation who takes their own life. Starving or dying of thirst are horrible ways to die. Freezing to death is perhaps a bit less horrible but you do suffer quite a bit until hypothermia kicks in. No need to mention the horror of becoming the next meal of a predator.\n\nYou are stranded in the Great White North. You have few supplies and must scavenge for anything which improves your lot.\n\nWhat would you be willing to do to survive?","May 17","true","72.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","25","28","5","0"

The blizzard had been going for two hours, and only the sound of my stomach growling kept me from trying to wait it out.  The last shelter I had seen was half an hour ago and the chances of finding it in the pitch darkness were nil.  My shivering was becoming constant.  No, I would not die here in this car.\n\nOpening the door and lighting my last flare, I knew I could end up a frozen slab of meat on the side of the highway, or worse; a warm slab of meat for a wolf or bear.  Who knows, maybe dying warm would be better...no, follow the road, there is always civilization at the end of a road, but which way?  To go back was certain death, but to go foward was to make progress.  To what exactly I could not say, but it was further from death, further from the dark.\n\nShivering and walking at a limping pace, the sight of my own breath was a constant reminder that I was freezing to death, and if I didn't stop my sprained ankle would never heal.  If only the storm would let up for a just minute I could find my way...my condition was only getting worse.  I did not bother to pick up fuel for a fire anymore, what was the point?  No, this would not be how it ends, this is not how I die.\n\nI think of where I have been so far, what little I have learned about surviving in this barren wasteland.  How to start a fire, what wood is the best to use, and what clothes can protect me from the wind.  I thought about the last cabin that I last slept in, it had everything I needed.  A pot belly stove, bunks with thick sheets, and most importantly four walls and a roof to protect me from the wind.  There was so much food in it, the cans of soda, jerky, even a cooked fish.  The moment I walked in I knew I had been saved; most of the food was gone within the day.  There was no choice but to leave the cabin if I was going to survive, even had I known I was going to sprain my ankle I still had to leave.\n\nThe flare has now died and I keep walking in the dark knowing there is no going back.  All of a sudden I was hung up on something in the darkness.  Remembering the matches, I lite one and see at my feet is an overturned row boat on a frozen lake.  There must be a cabin.  I rush around in the darkness lighting matches frantically and see the small simple structure.  Entering the cold room I rush to the stove and start an emergency fire with my last acclerant.  The fire starts quickly giving me my first respite from the cold.  The dimly lit room is bare of items but under the bunk is a dusty forgotten MRE, I have hit the lottery.  Eating the packaged meal immediately the darkness slowly begins to subsides.  I purify the melted snow on the fire and drink my fill of water.\n\nThe crackling fire's warm glow begins to fill the room with heat, but it will be out in a few hours without more fuel.  I need to rest if I am going to get more wood.  I go to sleep in the bunk taking in all of its warmth.  Upon waking up the fire is out but the room is filled with light.  Eleven hours of daylight left and I have survived for three days.\n\nI go outside to find the storm has ended and the morning sky is now a pale gold.  There is a cabin is out in the middle of the lake and I am going to need more food and fuel if I am going to survive any longer.  I start walking towards it picking up whatever loose firewood I can find along the way before stepping onto the lake.  Today could be my last day here, then again it might be tommorow.\n\n\nBut with every day I spend out here, I find it easier and easier to live on the edge of 'The Long Dark'.\n\n\n\n20 minutes later I was mauled by a wolf and bled to death.","August 1, 2015","true","12.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","24","27","21","0"

I can hear many, too many, unknown noises in the distance, barely audible, which adds a shiver along my spine. It seems safe nevertheless. I walk slowly into the main room instead of going back outside in the cold ; I'd rather keep myself warm, like a fly desperately attracted by light. It's even gloomer here. Nothing happened... I feel safe now. I enter the room with the command panels. I scavange for food and supplys. After all, I know how to survive. Probably. I will need those things sooner than later anyway. I stop when I find a flare. I smile widely. I will be able to keep wolves at bay. I hear something. Footsteps. Not mine.

Here are some pros/cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- NO ZOMBIES: really, I'm sick and tired of this cliche that plagues this genre.\n- Not action/combat oriented: apart from wild animals you will only fight nature and your needs.\n- Amazing atmosphere: even if you know there's no zombie to jump on you, you'll still get uneasy feelings when going through an abbandoned place\n- Realism: there are very few other games that emulate real survival so well. Everything from hunger to weather or wildlife behavior is spot on.\n- Constant updates and feedback from developers: this is clearly not one of those alpha/EA games that is abbandoned after the first cash grab\n- Incentives to explore: the game is designed in such a way that you cannot jut bunker down in a cabin and live there indefinitely. You NEED to explore to survive and it's alaways a hard choice to leave your cozy "base" to brave the unknown.\n- The game is harsh: one moment your condition is 100%, everything is great, then you make 1-2 mistakes like you decide to butcher a deer even if it's frozen and there's only 1 hour of sunlight left, then a wolf attacks you and you're maimed and can't find your way to your precious shelter.  The cascade/butterfly effect can kill you even after 30-40 days of survival\n\nCons:\n\n- No HUD to display the hunger/thirst/energy levels. While this is intentional (for immersion), I'd like to have it as an option.\n- Needs a bit more wildlife variety and more crafting recipes.","September 17, 2015","true","40.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

The scenery is gorgeously compelling while the situation feels dire, bleak and lonely, just as it should. You're going to die, but how long can you stave off the slavering fangs of the wolves that await you in the long, cold night?\n\nHighly recommended.","January 2, 2015","true","622.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

The catch is not only are you trying to find the important aspects of survival like food and drink, but you are also being hunted.\n\nThe game spawns wolves who are just as hungry as you. The wolves will hunt in packs to try to find their next meal, which may be you. This keeps you on your toes constantly as you never know what may lurk behind you or around the corner. It is very unnerving and really gives the game a creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe fight for finding food, water, and shelter, as well as trying to fend for your life give the game the desperate struggle for survival it was trying to achieve. The maps are big with plenty of places of interest, and the gameplay will keep you coming back for more!\n\nOh, and don't die. The game has permadeath, and I mean PERMADEATH. It will delete your save the second you die automatically. Every second is a fight for survival, as well as for preserving all your hard work up to that point. I go back and forth if I like this feature or not, but the stressful and desperate atmosphere it creates is definitely worth it. Pick this game up now!

The sound of the wind is your only companion in this game, only to be occasionally interrupted by the spine chilling howl of a wolf, or wolves. This game will scare you, whether you're walking through the forest after a blizzard, exploring abandoned houses or winding your way through the dreaded 'Carter Hydro Dam' (I'll let you play the game to find out why :D) you will be on the edge of your seat. Things can and WILL go 'south' in this game very fast. In my most recent game I was warm, well fed, in perfect health... I decided to go foraging. After a while walking through the snow I came accross a black bear, I had 3 rounds in my rifle, took the shot (I was running low of food stores) but I didn't kill it, I was then mauled and left in the snow to bleed out.\n\nIt was my stupid decision but it shows that you have to be so careful in this game. Supplies are scarce, you are your own worst enemy, you have to deal with tiredness, health, hunger, thirst and of course warmth.\n\nI highly reccommend this game, as I said at the start it's thought provoking and has great atmosphere.

The reason why I recommend this game, and will be nagging my friends to purchase the title is due to the fact that the game manages to pull off a very, very impressive atmosphere that delivers a very emotional and very raw experience to the player playing the game. While I do believe that the game does have a long way to go, the copy paste buildings and the somewhat repitive environments do very little to enhance the experience, but with more unique areas such as the hydro electric dam being added into the game, I feel like this could be one of the best indie games of the year.","November 10, 2014","true","14.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","2"

Your enemy in this game is the weather, wildlife (Wolves / Bears) , fatigue, thirst and hunger.\n\nSimply walking around with no enemy in sight can cause your health to start deteriorating if you are being careless about how cold the weather is. When you are starving, the sight of even a small handful of herbs or a degraded packet of candy will get you excited.\n\nExpect to build fires, evade wildlife, monitor the weather like a hawk, inspect every nook and cranny for food / water / medicine - expect to hurl yourself into a cabin with a wolf or bear on your tail like your life depended on it. (Which it does!) Expect to traverse up large mountains in the hope that there may be a shelter somewhere. Enjoy the beautiful sunlit and moonlit views of the Canadian forests whilst reminding yourself that you need to keep moving.\n\nExpect to flounder in the darkness and traverse through mines with the kerosene in your lamp trickling away.\n\nIf you can plan ahead, if you can adapt to harsh situations and if you can handle doing as much as possible with as little as possible in your possession - you will relish this title.\n\nThis is an intelligent game designed for intelligent gamers. It is a true masterpiece and example of not only what a survival game should truly be about, but also how an Early Access title should be developed.\n\nHinterland Studios actively and consistently interact with their members on the forum and listen to inputs about any bugs and feedback about the game. And all along, they still remain true to their core vision of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. There is plenty of content in the game and it barely feels like an Alpha release.\n\n\n------------------\nSome key notes about the title;\n\n\n* One life. When your game is over, it is over.\n* Ammo is scarce.\n* The weather WILL dictate how much you can explore at any given time.\n* You can craft gear, which includes warmer clothing, weapons and food harvesting.\n* There is item degradation. All repairable... if you have the materials.\n* There is no "map". You learn by exploring and memorising.\n* What you can carry is limited. Whilst you can go over your 'maximum' weight, be prepared for the fatigue, thirst, hunger and movement penalties.\n* The game has a learning curve which would be considered steeper than most other titles - there is a bit to take in, there is no game manual - and it can be unforgiving. This is a game that intuitively makes you discover by yourself.\n* You will be monitoring your four stat bars and your health bar a lot in this game if you want to succeed.\n* There will be a lot of exploring where you do not get attacked for long periods. This is normal. (And to be honest, a welcome thing!)\n------------------\n\n\n\nThe only things I would consider as "CONS" for this title is that it's in Alpha - so you naturally want more content and there are pockets of bugs you can discover. (I don't come across very many though...) Also, once you get proficient at surviving (takes a while to get there) it can be a bit lonely and repetitive if you aren't exploring around the maps.\n\nOther than that - fantastic title. Do get it!\nIf you're a patient, planning player - then this acquired taste is more than for you. A hidden gem of a title that already has amassed a cult following.\n\nhttp://www.hinterlandforums.com/","October 21, 2015","true","132.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Still, like all early access, I am left with wanting a little more out of it.\n\nSpecifically, I find the game visually understimulating. Let me clarify. The scenery and art work are amazing. My problem is that every action I go do, I have to watch a loading bar tell me time is passing rather than show me that it is. Like when I eat a candy bar, I want to see myself take a few bites out of it. Instead I hear a few crunching noises and measure my progress on a bar. When I go scavenging for wood, maybe show me chipping away at a nearby tree. The only action I don't mind watching is sleeping.\n\nRight now the game has so much potential.

I found a knife, food, matches, a crowbar, and a lot of medicine. I had just about explored all the rooms and hallways of the dam, when suddenly my flare died out. It left me completely blind in the darkness.  I brought up my inventory to use my matches when, from the pitch black, I heard a growl.

First of all, the game is EXTREMELY immersive. However I wish the soundtrack played more than it did (because it's amazing), I think it only plays at certain times. The graphics are really great and different from most games.\n\nThe survival aspect is great, people think the wolves are OP but really they aren't (only fluffy, he scares me).  The more things you use like clothing etc the more it decays which isn't really too realistic but it forces you to scavange, explore, and repair your items often.\n\nThe Mystery Lake map is big enough to keep you interested and Hinterland has now added about what? 4 more zones?  I only have 25 hours on the game and the longest I survived was 2 days! You can sprain your ankles which requires painkillers and rest (somewhat like real life). You can get food poisoning from bad venison or wolf meat even if it is cooked! You can get dysentry from drinking tainted or unsafe water. I really wish I could describe the epicness of this game but I am a bit tired lol, if you're wondering if it is worth the 20$. IT IS! Especially with all the updates the Devs have release in just the past FEW DAYS! This game has much more to be added including a story mode.

Sadly I am dressed for 4 hours of comfort on a routine flight from Anchorage to Yellowknife, not for comfort wandering the greater Canadian waste.\n\nThough it is late in the day, fortune is with me.  As I orient to my surroundings I notice a frozen fellow face down in the snow.  Apparently, his name was Max.  He clearly wouldn't be needing them anymore so I borrowed his hunting knife and hatchet.  Nearby I find a hunters blind and some meager food supplies.\n\nBut then the luck ended.  It was dusk and night was closing in and, as fate would have it, a monumental blizzard rode along with the dark.  I started treking in the dim dusk, seeking I knew not what.  As the wind and the cold clutched at me, I staggered on until i saw the dim outline of a building.  I was cold, tired and starving when I finally found solace in a small hunters cabin.  It's meager supplies barely sustained me until morning.\n\nFor the next 16 days I wandered the Mystery lake area in search of a rifle to fire the 30+ rounds of rifel ammo I've amassed.  It would be the edge I need if I am to triumph over wilderness.  I've fended off every wolf attack, finding most later after they have succombed to the wounds my hunting knife left them.  I've lived well on plentiful venison, having stolen the kills of wolves after carefully stalking them, as well as my own kills with my makeshift bow.  I've trapped rabbits and I've fished the lake and I stand now, hearty, healthy and well equipped by Mother Nature's  bounty.  I no longer fear wolves, though I avoid bears.\n\nFinally I realize I have depleted all of my resources and my last arrow was lost in my most recent hunt.  With some small amount of anxiety I realize I must leave this place, or die here.  And so I set out for the coastal highway.  I gather my most crucial supplies, fully repair all of my best equipment and strike out.\n\nFor 4 days I trek, through ravines and over hills and down cliffs, until I come to the monstrous frozen lake of the coastal region.  I set out across the lake. I am being impatient, I know, but a promising group of buildings  in the distance has allured me.  I am encumbered, I sought to bring as much to my new area as possible and have collected more along the way.  I realize the going is too slow, I've consumed too much food and starvation is closer than I had anticipated.\n\nThe worm has turned.  Fortune has looked away from me, presenting me it's back.\n\nHalf way across, the winds kick up, temperatures drop and a blizzard sets in.  I become disoriented.  Now lost, I am unable to see and unsure of my bearings, I move towards the outline of what appears to be a fishing hut I had been aware of before the snow hit.  But alas, Fortune had fled fast from me now.  The outline was not a hut.\n\nIt was a bear.\n\nTerror gripped me as the foul beast decended.  Helpless, he mauled me repeatedly, shredding my carefully constructed clothes and llacerating my flesh repeatedly, before leaving me all but dead.\n\nAs the bear shambles off, I slowly come to my senses and fully realize my peril.  I've sustained tremendous injuries.  It is all I can do to stem the bleeding and stumble to the REAL fishin hut nearby.  Exhausted, physically traumatized, starving and numb from cold, I set about striking a fire in the pot belly stove commonly found in fishing huts.  The world spins about me as I evaluate my options.  I musts eat soon and I must rest -- or I will die.  I clear the ice fishing hole and cast.  No bites.  I am desperate now.  I cast again.  I hear the agonizing so und of my line snapping.  I dig through my gear and find I have no more tackle.\n\nSo I lie here, death slowly overtaking me.  Shortly before fading into darkness, I notice the rifle in the corner.  I take it in my hands.  21 days in the Canadian wilderness I've spent looking for a rifle.  And now as my lifeforce leaves, I hold that which I have sought.\n\nIf you should ever find yourself stranded in Canadian wastes and stumble across a fishin hut on bay in the coastal region, don't be surprised to see a wry smile on my frozen face as you pry the rifle from my hands.\n\nAnd may it serve you well.","May 30","true","60.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","14","14","6","1"

The immersion is absolutely stunning, there is just something about unreal engine that makes you completely absorbed into the game. The devs are some of the kindest, warmest canadians of all time, who listen intently to their community and are constantly involved with making the game as good as possible. This is the model Early Access game, and don't let heaps like dayZ or H1Z1 put a bad taste in your mouth, because these devs deserve every single bit of money they earn.\n\nThe game itself completely breaks the monotony of regular survival games in that there is no end game item, or one that immediately makes the game easier to play. the focus is completely on the gameplay of survival, which is done incredibly well. It isn't the prospect of getting better guns or items that keeps you playing, but just the process of surviving day to day which makes me keep coming back to this game. The graphical style they chose for this game is just phenominal. The artstyle immediately draws you into the world, all without putting extreme intensity on your rig. The ambience and soundtrack are nothing short of perfect, adding to the immersion immensely. Now content-wise, I alone spent upwards of 30 hours just on the first realm, and by the date of this review, there are 5 regions available to explore. I just finished the second region in 20 hours, just in time for them to announce Storymode for 2016. I am sure that if I got back into it, I could easily top 150-200 hours on only sandbox. Now onto bugs, they are very, and I mean VERY rare. I don't even think I ever even got a CTD. In all my playtime I can't recall a single bug or glitch that took me out of the game, or messed with my progress. It is extremely well polished, which you don't get much of for Early Access.\n\nBottom line, buy this game, but experience wise, I would reccomend you don't play it until 2016, when storymode comes out. I for one really wished I waited on playing it, because apparently Storymode will use many portions of the sandbox maps, which would spoil some exploration experience for me. waiting until storymode will promise you the best experience. Also, from my own personal experience, play the game on Stalker mode (the hardest). This is the only difficulty I've played on, and its one of the most punishing survival experiences out there, besides maybe Stalker Call of Pripyat's MISERY mod. You will be sneaking and fighting for you life every single day, and the rifle doesn't immediately promise to save you. This right here is an excellent game, and a model for all other survival games to take note from.","December 24, 2015","true","49.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

We all know how brutally cold it is in Canada but here are some things I learned from the simulator that you may not know.\n\n1) Canadians may be polite and very good listeners, but that is mostly because they are all dead.\n2) Dead Canadians are so polite, you can even store 10kg of food inside their dead bodies.\n3) Canadians eat over 7lbs of meat a day, which is probably why they are all dead.\n4) If you visit Canada, be sure to take a good multi-vitamin with D and Calcium in it because your bones brittle up just being there. I like to SAVE memories of my travels in video format but in Canada it is customary to sprain a wrist or ankle which promps the simulator to save the memory for you. Convenient but painful.\n5) Emergency preparedness training in the US stresses being willing to drink even the water out of the toilet tank in an emergency. In Canada they just drink straight out of the toilet bowl. Try it!\n6) Because of free trade and so much Chinese-made garbage flooding the N.American markets, hatchets only last about 50 chops before they break and you have to get another. Likewise, clothing can wear out in just a month.\n7) Rabid wolves are a huge problem but since the Canadian wolf has almost as much meat as a 700lb buck, your diet will mostly consist of wolf.\n\nThey are so many other differences between Canada and the rest of the world that are illuminated by this simulator, but I don't want to spoil it for you.  Buy it and find out for yourself. You get to loot corpses as well as buildings so it kind of felt like home at least some of the time.\n\nps- We all know it is ABOOT time for the story mode to come out; I for one can't wait! I hope the devs don't RUSH the story out and call it a TRIUMPH just because they promised a spring release.

I've spent 25+ years working in the outdoors of the Pacific Northwest so this was like playing in my backyard. I am not going to talk about all the aspects of this game that are great but will highlight a few. Here's the only negatives (?) imo.\n-Some players may not be satisified with the art / graphics. Personally I think they work, are simple and quite beautiful.\n-There are some oddities with movement over snow drifts / ice that I think are just minor glitches. Why, occassionally, can't I step over a 4" drift on a road?\n-The rifle mechanics are a bit confusing. I have owned and used a .303 extensively so I'm not blowing smoke when I say a wolf shot in the chest at 10 feet is, at the minimum, going to be knocked off it's feet. EDIT: Since writing this review I have one-shot 23 wolves in a row. Curious...\n-Black bears normally do not attack when shot. 95% of the time they run away from the direction the pain originated from. In this game they attack 80% of the time. And they move at the speed of light. They cover 25 yards (the distance I typically shoot them) in about a second. ?? I've been charged 6 times in RL and as dangerous as that was I can tell you: bears are fast BUT not that fast.\nThat's really all I can say that is remotely negative.\nI can tell you that the basic stats of keeping your body temperature up, monitoring your fatigue, keeping hydrated and watching your calorie intake is, in RL, critical to your survival outdoors. Reading the wind, clouds, type and intensity of snowfall, wildlife behaviour are also extremely important. The balance that this game has with making these characteristics important but not needlessly difficult to learn is brilliant.\nThe crafting mechanic is simple and useful. The amount of steep and hazardous ground and easy going terrain is well balanced. The need for light sources is well thought out but not unduly taxing.\nAfter dying on day 1.5 on my first play through I was embarassed (stood too close to a fire and burned to death). My second play through I was mauled to death by a black bear on day 59 hour 22. I was equally embarassed, I KNOW bears extremely well - what the hell was I thinking? Now I am approaching 250 days of survival.\nSome advice to new players: Just like in the real outdoors there are the obvious needs of shelter, food and water. But the real key to survival is caution and patience. Don't push that extra two hours into the hills if the weather looks sketchy. Don't take a shot unless you have the near perfect or perfect angle. You can always go exploring the next day when the weather is better and there is always another deer or bear to take tomorrow.\nGreat game Hinterland, love it. 9.5/10","November 19, 2015","true","749.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

With the most recent update released yesterday, it is very clear that they are taking into consideration every bit of critique, suggestions, and bug reports that the community has to offer, within reason (meaning that anyone who comes up suggesting they add zombies to the game won't be taken seriously, haha).\n\nThe game itself is gorgeous.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warriorvet/recommended/305620/","warriorvet","WarriorVet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warriorvet/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: A great survival game that pulls ahead of nearly every survival game I've played before. Worth every penny.\n\nMy experiences in The Long Dark have all been entirely different (albeit always ending in my demise) despite picking the same map most of the time. The maps are quite large and connect to each other. The maps are NOT procedurely generated, allowing maps to be created and upon starting a new game, you can head in a familiar direction.\n\nThe difficulty can be set depending on how you'd like to play, whether you prefer exploring or hardcore survival. Even playing on the "Pilgrim" (easy) difficulty it provides a solid challenge, eliminating only the threat of animals. My most recent experience was on the easiest difficulty and I still managed to die withing the first few days because I got carried away.\n\nKnowing when you have enough daylight to make it back to camp is essential. I decided to fish my last 2 hours of daylight, only a few hundred yards from what I decided to make my "base". That night of course turned out to be one of the darkest I've seen and of course I had ran out of fuel earlier, not expecting to need any. I lit my lantern that had very little keroseen and started to head towards my shack. Soon I realized I had went the wrong direction after getting turned around in the dark. It didn't take long for my lantern to go out, so I lit the only thing I had left, a flare. I wandered for what seemed like forever, not making any progress. Hypothermia ensued and I was becoming exhausted. I managed to find one of the many fishing huts on the lake I had been fishing on. I decided it'd be best to wait out the night in the shack rather than wandering around cold. To pass the time I decided to fish, there could only be around 4 hours of night left. 2 more hours of fishing and my situation was becoming dire. The night was still black and the temperatures had only become worse. I laid now my bedroll, hoping to rest and warm up inside the sleeping bag while in the fishing shack. Only needed to make it another hour and the sun would begin to rise, lighting the way to my base where I could be warm. As I rested my body temperature just continued to drop and I died in my sleep. This was on the easiest difficulty. (Yes, I obviously suck.)\n\nThe game runs well, but can be demanding at times due to the large world and blizzards. The graphics are artistic, but nothing that will knock your socks off, but you can capture some pretty nice screenshots during sunrises or when the night isn't so dark. The game even has a nice soundtrack that can be quite ominous, but fits the setting. The music isn't constant so it doesn't take away from the immersion. Some animal sounds aren't great, such as deer running by, but others can be quite chilling. Hearing a pack of wolves begin to howl in the night while hearing the wind screaming throught the trees creates an amazing atmostphere.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. You're thrown in and survival begins the second you start. There are community made maps, but none in game. This is not to say that it has a sharp learning curve though. Crafting is simple and item descriptions tell you how to do certain things (such as curing hides).\n\nThe developers are constantly putting out updates and doing everything to turn this into a finished product (even though it feels close to one now). Features such as story mode have yet to be added, but sandbox and challenges are more than enough to keep you entertained for more hours than many triple A titles can.\n\nThe Long Dark is an excellent game and is well worth the small price tag. A game that shows no signs of ever being abandoned as many early access games have in the past. The game can be tough so if you're aren't a fan of survival games, it's probably safe to say you should stay away. If you are a fan of survival though, this is the perfect game for you. No zombies, no aliens, just you and the Canadian wilderness.","May 5","true","8.6"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","2"

At moment I genuinely felt desperation and loneliness of a single person left to die in northern woods.\nI'm intrigued to see what the story mode will be like.\n\nAlthough, for me, the game did suffered from the same thing all other survival sims do - walking in a deserted area for way too long.

The promise of a "thoughtful, exploration-survival experience" was exactly what I'd been looking for since I've had time to pick up gaming as a pasttime once more. While I do have a few gripes with the game thus far, the duration of my experience in the game so far has been with answering a couple of questions that have been floating around since I was first introduced:\n\nDoes it live up to what it claims to be (at least in terms of my playstyle)?\n\nGiven that I've played the game almost exclusively on hard mode, and have recently reached day 30 on my current run, I'd consider myself at least a bit survivable and able to handle the game's mechanics pretty well. Did it challenge me? That's a given; my first four of five runs, each having been slightly longer than the last, each had their fun and challenging stories, which ultimately ended with my demise (to wolves every time). There seems to be a bit of a rough difficulty curve, as it starts off incredibly difficult and overwhelming, only to become basic knowledge to survive. Perhaps I haven't trying challenging myself, as my intuition within the game has been to reduced to "Gotta find buildings, gotta go fast." Judging from my experience, playing to live exclusively off the land seems impossible. Not that it should be the intended way of playing, but that I think it should be an option for the most daring of players. The game's mechanics do not allow for such a playstyle, as they do not for a lot of playstyles. A decently large game with so much potential ends up being disappointingly shallow at the end of the day. (I suppose that's the cause of Early Access, but I digress) There's a lot of room to expand and add depth.    TL;DR: Hell yeah, but could do with some improvements.\n\nDo the game's mechanics work well/properly?\n\nIf there's anything I love, it's a game that you can't learn completely just from reading a couple pages on the wiki. A game that not only requires a strong sense of intuition and logic, but also experience to apply your knowledge properly. The only real sense of progression you have throughout the game is synthesized through the pseudo leveling system for repairing and firemaking. The game mechanics work properly, only, they become very predictable and boring over time. They are not, however, without merit. There are some unique mechanics within the game that deserve some credit. Let's start off with the the environment. In my opinion, the environment is very well done and is just naturally a challenging part of the game that is always a breath of fresh air. Air temperature and windchill are both very well done and fun elements of the game to play around. Not to mention how well the environment is aesthetically, though the night time could use a little polishing (snow and breath look awkward in the dark). The environment definitely does a lot better than it's living counterpart: the wolves. On the other end of the spectrum, wolves are what I have the biggest problem with. It's great to have a constantly looming threat, especially in the harder difficulty, but they have become more annoying than threatening at this point. Randomness is a very fickle element of survival games, and should be used only when necessary; ie. wolves should not be dictated by randomness. Being the BIG threat in most playthroughs, they should be challenging and something to think about, not annoying and something you just pray to avoid. I should be praying when I'm making a run for the cabin at midnight because I've run out of supplies, not when I'm leaving in the morning for a fresh expedition. The wolves are a very flawed gameplay mechanic, as they stand right now. With semi-random spawns, arbitrary movement, and aggro radius, they act pretty much exactly like a zombie would. I understand the suspension of disbelief that has to go into playing a videogames, but wolves should act as wolves do. There's very little room to play around the possibilities of wolf attacks, since they are so random, and once they're chasing you, they never let up. Of course, when they DO catch you, there's very little threat unless there are two or more to continuously pounce you, and then you're more than likely dead at that point. TL;DR: The elements are nice, the wolves are a huge pain in the ♥♥♥\n\nOverall, the game so far has been a fantastic experience with lots of very high points where I've felt sheer awe from the beauty, pure relief from escaping the brink of death, or relaxation from sitting around a fire during a cold night. And, of course, there were some pretty frustrating low points. Wolves randomly become immune to flares, randomly become immune to torches, and randomly show up in packs right outside my door. Fun times in the Canadian wilderness. 8/10","March 21, 2015","true","52.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

It consists of a bigger area representing a more "countryside" or "rural" feeling. This area provides some good feeling of what is really surviving in an isolated zone. You have to plan anything (where to go, what to do...) in advance because being caught in a blizzard or fog, or just be surprised by the night is a certain death coming to you very quick ! I really like this area because you have to be prepared before entering it and you can't rely on modern supplies because this area is almost made of empty fields and moutains (but you will find interesting things too if you explore the zone carefully)\n2/ there are now 3 difficulty mode. The standard one, an "pilgrim" mode (easy) where you can explore without caring of anything (I don't enjoy this mode because you can't die even if you go almost naked in the wirlds), but, it is a good point to try this mode and explore zones to learn where are the "safe zones". Also, the wolves will not attack you in this game mode.\n3/ New animal : The bear ! Very slow but massive, interesting but for now, it is overpowered and don't give enough meat to be considered like a valuable resource.\n4/ new crafts : you can now gpo hunt for mushrooms and plants to make bandages and tea (and some more things I don't discovered yet). Useful when you fall short of modern medical items.\n5/ I think there are some changes in food/drink consumption. but perhaps it's just me. It seems to me that food needs are now more realistics.\n\nNow the things I consider bad or I don't like (only one :D)\n1/ wolves are now mostly invincible. If they spot you and begin to run, it's over : they can't be scared anymore after that. I think this is a bug but it's really annoying...\n\n\nAnd that's all for my rating. I red on steam forums that there are bunkers hidden in the game, spawning randomly on start on each game. But I've never found one yet. And I don't want to see the maps created by the community (because I don't want to ruin all the exploration game). Another good feature I wasn't aware of.\n\n\n======================\nOriginal review below\n======================\nThis game is very good and it's still in alpha stage.\nExplain why it's good will be a lot difficult but I'll try my chance to make you play this game.\n\nThis game is a survival without any zombies or ennemies. The only thing you will fight is yourself and mother nature. when the game start, you are launched into the unknown, in a vast canadian land cover with ice and snow and the first thing you have to do is to find a shelter before dying in this cold country. The game is based on exploration, but you are limited by food, drink, fatigue and cold. You have to manage these 4 parameters (+ day/night cycle) to advance in the game, find better tools to survive and to be able to explore more.\n\nThe weather can suddenly change to a mortal blizzard, the temperatures can go below -35°C, making you run to the nearest shelter or hill to try to protect yourself from the deadly winds, making a fire with your poor ressources to heat yourself a little... but wait, there's more : WOLFS !\nThis terrible animal will be your biggest nightmare, it can kill you in seconds (you can fight back too but your chances are not very high) and very soon, you'll be out of "modern" supplies, you'll have to hunt too, making water from snow and making it safe to drink. And many more thing I can't tell you without spoiling the end game content (but it's still alpha stage so many more things will soon arrive). And oh, each new game randomizes all items, making each death a replay value.\n\nFor now, the game has only two linked zones, a little one, easier to explore and memorise, and a larger one, more difficult, because of the distance between shelters (you have to plan all your moves before doing anything). Devs said a third zone will arrive soon but again, you'll have plenty of things to do and discover in the two zones provided with the game for now.\nWill you survive 50 days ?","December 11, 2014","true","224.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","3"

My flare worked for a little bit but it didnt last long. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. I quickly got in a car I saw. That was the the best thing to happen. I had ammo for a rifle but no rifle to use. There happened to be a rifle in the backseat. I loaded it and prepared for a fight. I had 4 bullets. I got out at the best time to do so. I quickly shot one before the other two ran at me. I managed to get a shot on one of the wolves. The first two were dead. I didnt have time to shoot the next. I knew I had to fight it with my hatchet. It pounced me. I kept swinging. I managed to kill it. Somehow I did it. I bandaged myself up and limped my way to home as my leg wasnt in the best condition.

This is the game I've been looking for. And the best part, it isn't even complete yet.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nI've had this growing interest on survival games for quite a while now, and as such, I've been looking for survival games everywhere to try out, and not more than one or two have captivated me (I could name which, but doesn't feel right on a review of another game). The Long Dark gripped me in, and oh boy, did it grip me tight.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, has a great feeling to it, and not too cartoonish, or too realistic. Very well polished.\n\nThe soundtrack will keep you interested, and every sound will keep you on your toes, wondering if there's a wolf nearby, or a storm coming. Basically, death is on every corner.\n\nThe design itself is just brilliant. I've had the chance to play about 6 sandbox games, and I decided to go in "blind", not reading anything or checking any maps. Survived 1h56mins the first time, and about 2h10mins the second time. Needless to say, wolves got me (and of those hours, one might have been sleeping!). I then decided to get some brains, and see how I could counter those wolves. Great success, stayed alive for 6hours! Until a storm killed me. From there on, I survived for days, being my current record nearly 8 days. I admit I could easily survive for a bit longer, by being smart and stashing "useless" stuff on a cabin locker, but I'm a hoarder! (all of the playthroughs were on medium difficulty, I can't even imagine the hard one!)\n\nI do have one suggestion, there should be a two player co-op mode, that would be amazing, for when you don't want to feel as lonely. Or else I'll just keep going (Hans) Solo, and immerse myself into this AMAZINGLY brutal and harsh game, that will leach the life out of me. Over and over again.\n\nTL;DR - I love this game. I recommend this game. You will love this game.\n\nPS. Wolves have a soft spot for me, and always seem to find me at the "right" time.\n\nThis is it. This is the game.

The next day I left the mine seeking food and was chased by a black bear. I found a rifle in an abandoned truck and managed to bring down a deer. The bear showed up again and I warded him off using a flare taken from the miner's corpse. I'm currently holed up in a farmstead on Day 5....\n\n^ None of that is scripted gameplay.

That patches as you go along, while also providing the developers feedback along the way both good and bad. While there is no story mode, Sandbox mode provides you a glimpse as to what you will be experiencing within story mode once it's released.\n\nYou can see just how "hardcore" the game is. This is in a sense a true Hardcore Surivial game. Sure people can play it on easy, but where is the fun in that? For the true Long Dark experience play on medium or hard. And you can see why The Long Dark remains a very highly postive game. All you have is your senses and wit as you surive the candian wilderness. There is no compass, no GPS, no fast travel, no general store to trade. Just you and mother nature. And your instinct to survive\n\nThe artistic visuals in the game is amazing and detailed. Plus a very active translation steam workshop community in order to get the game out to other steam players who want to play this game but within their own native language. Hopefully, we will see somewhere down the line with more mods besides translations.\n\nAlso like with the Darkes Dungeon it's a trial by error experience, you learn as you fail and vice versa. You need to be a critcal thinker and plan ahead in a game like this. Because if you don't, you will most likely die by the hands of nature. Or become deperived of food and drink supplies which by the way are randomly generated throughout the three maps. So don't expect each map to have the same stuff in the same location. You are also randomly teleported to a part of the map, while the terrain will remain the same, everything else will be different.\n\nThere are two issues that i have with the game. The first issue is it's "struggle" mechanic. Maybe change it to tapping a particular key, instead of relying on the mouse button.\n\nHow it goes, it goes like this....\n\nRMB (It could be LMB) is to charge up\nLMB (It could be RMB) to attack\n\nSure you could have weapons to give you an edge, but it won't do any much good. Use your brain power, rather than your weapons, this isn't Skyrim kiddies.\n\nThe other issue is the lack of 'saves' now this question has been asked plenty of times and it is being considered. This game goes on the bases of Dragon's Dogma. Where it's one save per character, but it doesn't run like a typical Fallout or Elder Scroll game or just about any game with a mutiple save option. One save for everything basically, which sucks but that's the whole point of Hardcore survival you need to heavily rely on taking the game slowly and don't treat it like a typical RPG game.\n\nLastly, The game doesn't hold your hand as well. So don't expect a tutorial. The Sandbox in every sense. IS the tutorial, since story mode isn't out yet. So pay close attention to your surroundings and you will be fine. Another thing is that the steam community has been very supportive in giving the tools you need to survive. Just hit up the guide section if your lost, because i can seriously tell you. You will need those guides.\n\nI recommend this game if you love a true Hardcore Survival Experience.","April 16, 2015","true","14.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","0"

Only to be forced back into the house by the freezing winds threatening to freeze me solid. On a final dash of hope I bursted out the front door and ran towards a house sitting on the lake. I arrived freezing and the house was beginning to be circled by wolves. Worst of all... the "house" had no door... So i continued to freeze. I found a small piece of wood and started a fire in the furnace, huddling as close to the fire as I could in a desperate attempt to regain warmth. Using the time it burned to cook some food which I soon swallowed. I was tired, I was hungry, I was thirsty, and i was freezing... I had no wood, and wolves were surrounding me. I bolted out the door in a desperate attempt to reach the next cabin. I was mauled by a wolf on the way out, but was able to fight him back before he delt me the finishing blow.

I reach the next building and quickly treat my wounds, my eyes never leave the door in fear the wolves may run in to finish the job. I then quickly search for some wood and only find a small piece.

I know it's still in Early Access, and there will be a lot of changes still upcoming (the story mode is the one I am most looking to personally), but the game in its current state is still absolutely a ton of fun. You basically crash land in an Arctic area, that was previously inhabited but now abandoned (I expect the reasons for this will be revealed through the story mode). You are woefully unprepared for the weather conditions and have to find better clothing, equipment, food, and water in order to survive another day...and more days beyond that. The environment is reasonably vast. You can definitely explore all the areas the game has to offer, but since you also have to manage your food, sleep, water, and so on...it will take a while or many playthroughs to do so.\n\nThe character management is pretty simple and yet clever. You basically monitor your calorie count, which indicates your need for food, your dehydration levels (need for water), your restfulness (as in, you will have to sleep sometime), and your body temperature. All factor in fairly equally as far as your survivability goes. You can find places to rest and recover, can find gear such as can openers, hatchets, etc...to increase your odds. You can also obviously find food (in various state of freshness....the worse condition your food is in, the more likely it is that you will get sick if you eat it). There is medicine to be found, and even some weapons (hatchet, knife, hunting rifle, flares), that will be necessary, as there are also wolves that view you as a tasty morsel, lol. Additionally, there is a pretty intuitive crafting system in the game which allows you to break down, repair, or create items. This becomes very important as the days progress.\n\nSo, that just scratches the surface of what this game has to offer. You are fighting hunger, the cold, wolves, dehydration, and weariness in order to survive from one day to the next. The decisions you make will impact how long you survive each day and are very meaningful. Even the most mundane act can have real repercussions.\n\nThe game does offer an easy mode so you can get the hang of things before going for full survival. Easy mode features more resources and you can turn off the wolves hostility as well (so they just run away from you instead). It's not a bad way to get your feelers out in this game. However, the game really shines as it is intended...resource management and survival.\n\nI very much recommend this game, even in its early access state. By far my favorite game in the genre presently, with a lot more potential to come on top of what is already provided.\n\n9 out of 10.","February 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

That's not to say that the game is neglected. Quite the opposite. In the year since the game first hit Steam Early Access there have been 49 major updates and hotfixes. That averages to nearly one update per week for a year. Hinterland (the devs) have done the opposite of abandoning TLD.\n\nThe game is beautiful and immersive. The sounds are gorgeous and occasionally bone-chilling. The devs consistently look at what the players request while not doing anything that would compromise their artistic vision for a lovely game. They have said that they are working towards a thoughtful single player, story mode experience, and while TLD is still only available in sandbox alpha everything they do to the game appears to be moving towards that goal.\n\nYou can die due to freezing, falling, failing to light a fire, wolf, bear, bear and then wolf, falling off a cliff while running from a wolf, falling through the ice, starving at your campfire, dehydration, exhaustion, food poisoning, dysentery, exhaustion or... you know, stuff and things.\n\nThe game wont hold your hand and it's not a quick fix. And I love it. At almost 400 hours of of game time, I'm still not bored with the game.","November 26, 2014","true","564.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It was 2 days since the event, and I had collected some decent clothing, had a good supply of food, and sodas, and was surviving well. I had come across an abandoned dam, so I scavenged it for anything I might be able to use and decided to make it my "base" for a short time, to aquaint myself with the surroundings and get an idea of where I might go next. 2 days passed of me scouting the general area and my supplies ran low so I decided to head out, following a set of train tracks into the unknown. I came to a collapsed tunnel just as night descended so I built a fire with what scraps I had and decided to sleep for an hour or two. I had ran out of sodas at this point and hadn't realized that I could melt snow for hydration. My health had deteriorated quickly. I froze to death in my sleep.\n\n2nd attempt at survival-\nDay 4 since the event and I've figured out how to melt snow for a water source. I have food, water, and my clothes are in great shape. I delve into a cave and come out the other end to a forested hillside. There was a wolf right in the middle, and I thought "I'll tangle with him, take his meat and hide, and be on my way". We struggled briefly and I injured him, so he ran over a small ridge to get away, and I got up and gave chase. I get to the top of the ridge and look down the other side to see him running straight at me. I'm like "You won't get away this time!". He runs right past me, bleeding everywhere. A giant bear comes running up shortly after, chasing the wolf, then turns on me and chews my stomach to shreds. I already took a good hit from my fight with the wolf, but I managed to survive the bear attack with 6% condition. I roll over bleeding and coughing and manage to get to my feet, and by the time I stood up and attempted first aid, the last bit of life force had drained from me, and I headed straight for The Long Dark.\n\n\nTL;DR\nGreat game, would definitely recommend to anyone.","February 25","true","34.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Each iteration plays and feels different, and the rogue-like style of death makes every decision matter.  The gameplay is exhilarating, the visual style gorgeous, and with regular updates from the good folks of Hinterland Studios, you can't go wrong.  I've enjoyed every minute I've put into this title and look forward to spending many more.  That said, this game isn't perfect.  A range of possible strategies for long term survival exists, but use of the rifle so thoroughly outclasses everything else that gameplay tends to revolve around it.  But this game is still in Early Access and the developers are quite active, so quite a bit can be changed and honed.\n\nThe best part of this game though, and the reason I play, is that infinite survival is impossible.  That may seem a strange statement, and I know some people would love to see the game changed on that point, but hear me out.  Every time you begin, you know you will die.  There is nothing that can be done about that impermanence, about death.  Now, you can choose to curl into a ball, to let life pass you by, or you can choose to live, to fight, to find beauty in the harsh landscape and nobility in yourself.  I've never played with mechanics that so powerfully counterbalanced realistic nihilism with idealistic determination, and so I congratulate Hinterland on their work.\n\nThat got a little philosophically dramatic, but I stand by it.  Overall, I deeply enjoy this game and look forward to watching its progression, and offer my sincerest recommendation to potential buyers.","March 30, 2015","true","39.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Both the danger and beauty of nature is fully realised thanks to glorious sound design and a lovely painting-like graphics, allowing you to appreciate both the majesty and harshness around you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tribaldancer/recommended/305620/","tribaldancer","TribalDancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tribaldancer/","109 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI used to play this game when it first came out. I died. All. The. Time. And the world was much much smaller - 1 map to be exact. I liked the concept, but got bored and frustrated (frustored? borstrated?) and quit and haven't looked at it since.\n\nWhen it went on sale recently, my husband pointed it out to me as the type of game I usually like and asked if I owned it. I said I had and mumbled something about not bothering... He brought it up again the other day, asking if I had seen if there had been any changes or updates since I played it last.\n\nSo I cracked it open...and have been obsessed with it for days on end. I had to apologize to hubby for advising him against getting it when it was on sale. But it's on his radar now. His only disappointment is that it is only single player and we can't survive together (we play 7 Days to Die together extensively, for example, as we favor co-op survival).\n\nThe game is Alpha, so is under active development and some of the mechanics and balance may be off in some players' opinions. For myself, I find it enjoyable, and have found that the addition of the new maps, and three different game modes/difficulty levels, have given this game whole new life and an opportunity for gamers of many stripes to enjoy playing. If you are not a fan of inventory management as a primary element, then you may not like this game. Your inventory is weight based, food and tools spoil over time, and you are battling the elements and mother nature (wolve and bears, oh my!) for survival. A large chunk of the tension of survival in this game hinges on having to make tough choices about what to carry with you and what to leave behind, what to repair or to scrap and harvest the resources, what to use now or try and preserve for later (with the chance it will degrade beyond reasonable use in the meantime). It's a complex combination of factors to consider, which I find compelling, but is essentially inventory management. So just be aware.\n\nAlso, this game will NOT offer you running around, banging out shiny items on the toolbench, hack n' slash melee, or shoot 'em up guns blazing. This game requires a lot of patience. Resources must be gathered over time, hides and wood cured before fashioning into needed clothes and tools. There are no endless bullet stashes, or a promise of ever finding a gun. But if you find a gun and bullets, you might have two rounds to your name and they are precious--you can't make any more bullets, and your gun will wear out eventually. Tools and clothing degrade with use and must be repaired often to maintain them. If your hatchet breaks, you can't make another. Animals are predatory and will tear your precious clothing and cause bleeding and infections--I need not tell you medicines are scarce and also lose efficacy/degrade with time, and natural remedies can be hard to procure. Eating spoiled food can give you severe food poisoning, leaving you bedridden for hours on end. Frequent blinding blizzards can turn you around, leaving you lost and struggling to stay warm enough. And if you can't find adequate wind shielding you can't start a fire to save your life (literally). Running will tire you out, make you hungry and thirsty faster, and resources are limited. If you're too tired and come across a hungry wolf, you won't be able to run away, so you preserve your energies should you need them in a pinch. Getting across this desolate, snowy terrain can be slow and even boring at times. Funny enough, it adds to the atmosphere for me that you must trudge, with purpose and restraint, toward your next shelter because to rush it risks death.\n\nThe graphics are lovely--something between a watercolor painting and paper cutouts. The ambient sounds and occasional music really add to the atmosphere and are not at all intrusive. In fact, keep your ears pricked because you may be able to hear that storm whipping up. When you are indoors, you can hear the shutters rattle, indicating a blizzard has swept through, so stay inside if you want to live. Even the quietest snarl or howl can indicate a wold is on your tail, so drop some meat as a decoy and get outta there fast. Make no mistake, the weather is a character itself in this game, and you want to get to know her voice.\n\nI look forward to seeing how this game evolves. As of this review, Story Mode has not been released. They have been promising it would drop by the end of 2015, which is coming up fast, so I am keeping my eyes peeled for some storied content in the near future. In the meantime, the sandbox mode is more than entertaining, and I recommend survivalist gamers give it a try.","November 21, 2015","true","61.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroofpixels/recommended/305620/","heroofpixels","Hero of Pixels","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroofpixels/","263 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this game.\n\nI'd heard about it a while back and I saw it, thought it looked kinda interesting, and then never bothered picking it up. My friend recently gifted it to me and if I could I would have been willing to spend up to $45 or so for the experience this game tosses at you. The only thing I can say now is that I regret not picking it up sooner. It just hits me in such a way that I can't explain. Everytime I'm walking slowly down a road and there's nothing but cars to the side and burnt houses around, and that ♥♥♥♥ing guitar picks up I just get so into it and feel like I'm actually a survivor.\n\nThe Long Dark is a gem among early access games and deserves so much attention. I knew this as soon as I'd put in a good hour. Let me start off by saying that the immersion that this game delivers is phenomenal. It has a great tone and world design to be used for story telling. While the game offers no tutorial and this can be a positive or negative thing, I personally loved it. All it did was make me genuinely want to learn about the game and the world itself more, and as I did, I felt myself get better at it and feel more confident about surviving. The longest time I've survived so far on a character is 30 days counting and there's been numerous points throughout that timespan in which I thought I was going to die and got anxious doing something because I genuinely felt like I was the person wandering through the world. Each time I spotted a bear in the distance or a pack of wolves, I felt like they were a genuine threat and therefore considered my options. Do I try to sneak around them? Do I head in the opposite direction? Do I have ammo or a weapon to fend them off just in case? This doesn't even just count with the wildlife but the environment as well which I cannot stress just how important in a survival game. Every time I saw a side road leading off of the main highway I seriously considered my options. Did I have enough food and water with me in case it's a dead end? Do I have enough daylight left to make it back to the main road if there's nothing down this way? Will I have enough firewood and tinder to create a fire if need be? When I would be staying in a cabin for the day due to a blizzard, I would genuinely consider my options then as well and think to myself if I had enough food to survive the night before I would be able to scavenge for more supplies? The game pushes you to think about these options in a way that I've never felt another survival game do before.\n\nThe game does an incredible job at atmosphere and aesthetic and is downright GORGEOUS from every early sunrise and darkening sunset to each howling blizzard or each bright sunny day. The more you're willing to immerse yourself into believing you're truly surviving in the world, the better job it does at delivering a truly special experience. There was a point in which I'd found a safe and when I was trying to crack the code, I actually leaned in on my monitor as though I'd be able to hear the clicks better without realizing it. When there's a blizzard in the game and all you can hear is lonesome ambient guitar music playing and the wind howling in you ear, you feel genuinely alone and feel cold. When you enter a cabin and all you can hear is the wind beating against the house and the creaks of wood echoing, it creates a sense of fear and paranoia because you know that there were people who are probably long dead that used to live here. When you’re walking through a cave and all you can hear is the vast echoes of your footsteps against stone and the hiss of your flare, you feel genuinely cautious.The fact that the game is able to pull this off is absolutely stunning. And above all, you genuinely feel like you're a survivor in this new world. You begin to grow attached to your character and genuinely care for them and begin to wonder if you can truly survive the wilderness. The game does an excellent job at small little stories you can pick up on when you're not expecting it. For example you can find a cave in which there's a small campfire with food beside it, or you can be walking through the woods and find a frozen corpse of a man with an axe next to a deer corpse, insisting he died of hypothermia while trying to get food. It's all of these little things that come together that truly help create an enjoyable experience and make me want to get out there and explore the world in front of me. When you walk through a town you begin to really have thoughts of, "I wonder what happened to the people that lived here. I wonder what the story of the people who made it out is" and it's like that for nearly every place.\n\nThe only two downsides to this game for me at least are there's been few bugs in which I would climb a rock and randomly sprain my ankles or wrists for no reason and it's pretty immersion breaking. And secondly, there's no randomly generated maps and all loot spawns are always the same regardless of if you were to make a new character or not. If they were to add randomly generated loot and maps, I could play this game for literal hundreds of hours not to say I already plan to, but it would definitely help with the game in the long run and keep me coming back to it.\n\nIn short, this game is truly something special for the person that wants to immerse themselves in a world where they feel like they're truly a survivor in the wilderness with nothing but their own decisions on what's best to help you survive the long dark.\nTL;DR\n\nPros-\nBreathtakingly beautiful\nIncredible sound design\nIs a true to it's roots "you versus the wilderness" game\nDownright one of the most immersive games I've ever played\nDecent amount of replayability with new characters you can create and difficulties to choose from\nDevs actually seem to care about this game\n\nDependent on you-\nNo tutorial\nPretty unforgiving, if you die it's over even if you survived over 100 days\n\nCons-\nNo story mode as of this review, only sandbox (though one is supposed to be added later)\nFew immersion breaking bugs such as randomly breaking ankles and wrists for no apparent reason","May 10","true","47.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

The art and environment are beautiful. The audio work is masterfully created and constantly evolving. The game mechanics are refined, but could use further tweaking, which I have full confidence in Hinteland Studios to do.\n\nAlthough without currently a story mode, TLD sandbox mode provides a self-generated emotional experience that tickles your visceral senses. This is the perfect game for fans of survival-themed TV shows, which would be me, or those who simply appreciate the challenges that natures heaves. Your "enemies" in this game are the choices you make. Yes, there are wolves and bears, but you have the choice to completely avoid them. In TLD sandbox, you create the story and are rewarded or punished accordingly.\n\nHinterland Studios has done an incredible job of bringing the Canadian wilderness to your desktop (I say this without ever spending a minute in the Canadian wilderness). The immersiveness of the environment is felt immediately. Audio cues, such as the music transitioning in when you come upon a key location or when the skies clear for the sun, is quite moving. This game literally gives me chills and startles me when either a wolf growls unexpectely (or you think one is growling) and chases you while you find shelter indoors. You constantly battle the sense of desperation, cold and fear against hope, warmth and relief; fighting and thinking about the former is key to survival.\n\nThe graphics, or more appropriately the artwork, is very good albeit not AAA-esque (and it isn't meant to be). For example, the sheet of ice crystals that form on your screen when walking outside, as if they're forming over your eyes, reminds you how cold it is. I would love to see the graphics be further refined to imbue more realism, but overall, it's fantastic.\n\nGame mechanics are good. Inventory system is easy to navigate, but I wish more items were made stackable. Overall, it's a very simple game that doesn't require twitch reflexes or advanced skill. The most difficult action is to shoot the bow and arrow, but with practice, one can master this pretty quickly.\n\nAs with any early access game, we should see a lot of new content coming our way, including the story mode. If sandbox is able to lure me in this much, I have high hopes that story mode will do the same and add some context to the actual gameplay. Highly, highly recommend this game.","November 24, 2015","true","125.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I love every aspect of it. I have had the  unfortune of being lost in the bush in a snow storm in real life when i was a kid. Its true, when you try to walk in a blinding snow storm, you just walk in a circle.In real life, the snow stopped and i was able to find the direction in witch i needed to travel. After 140 days in game however, near Timberwolf mountian i was was on an expedition trying to find all the steel crates when it started to storm. I had done this many times and was always able to find my way back home and i always came prepared.This time however, i foregot one important item, my bear skin sleeping bag.It stormed for three straight days and nights untill all my wood was gone and my fire went out forcing me to try and find my way home in the blizz.

You get attached to every playthrough and want to live, explore and survive as long as you can.\nDying is unforgiving and it will make you annoyed but you will start again and not get bored because the game wants you to try again and survive. The key point here is how long you survive, not do you survive, because you will die no matter what. Bugs get fixed, new features get added, bugs get fixed again and you just keep on trying to survive.\n\nThe art is magnificent, the sound is magnificent and recently, the loading times are magnificent as well. The harvesting mechanic will need more work as it is a bit unrealistic(you harvest the same amount of cloth/leather no matter the item condition).

This winter seems endless, so it's not a matter of if you survive it; it's a matter of how long. The Long Dark is a game developed and published by Hinterland Studio, focusing primarily on surviving in Canada after a climate disaster. Right now it's in early access and the story mode isn't complete, but its sandbox mode gives more than enough to talk about.\n\nThe objective of the game is simple: you're abandoned out in the middle of nowhere in a random location and you must find a way to survive. The world is freezing and you must find food, shelter, water and keep yourself going for as long as you possibly can. While this sounds pretty straightforward, it isn't because there are plenty of factors in the game that can kill you and if you're unfamiliar with the game, and when starting out you're going to have a bad time.Full Preview[www.noobfeed.com]","April 17, 2015","true","14.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Made me tear a little.\n-Durability of cloths, weapons, tools are unbeleivably poor. I'm talking the crowbar from walmart? This is that crowbar after being used to pry open vualts, broke, then reforged with alluminum repair only to be sold at a pawn shop for a dollar. I have  yet to break a crowbar and I think you could open every locker in a school before it gets remotely worn out.\n-Drink and food survival is off a bit, typically its 3 days no water 3 weeks no food but on this its like a day no water and 4 no food. Don't get me wrong we need the challenge but killing people off after six days of survival is nuts. Just because people survive longer doesn't make the challenge of doing better than others go away.\n-Food posioning. Wow. I have never experienced food posioning before in rl thank goodness but the food posioning on here is crazzzzzy. I have about 30lbs of deer meat in my garage refrig and I cook it and eat it a lot. On here in one life I suffered from food posioning 7 times. 1 from a soda? 5 from cooked deer and once from cooked wolf. I understand it's a problem in real life but I think making it that bad is a little crazy...\n-Sleep cycle is just crazy, you will understand\n-I'm sure theres more of these too but due to a recent accident of nearly cutting my thumb off I am getting tired of one hand typing...\n\nMy recommendations:\n-You are releasing a new map so if the progress keeps up I imagine map size won't dissapoint me.\n-Randomize spawns for containers and frozen bodies\n-Get rid of durability on metal tools that makes no sense on breakage ex. can opener, crowbar, hunting knife, and maybe make the hatchet a little less ♥♥♥♥? I mean I cut wood on my tree farm couple times a year before winter with a axe and have only replaced it once every couple of years with maybe like 1 fix of the head for every 200 peices of firewood? Or you could increase the number of wood you gain?\n-Make the game real life experience. 3 days water 3 weeks food. This means yes you get dehydrated before 3 days and yes you begin to get frail increasing fatigue and impossibility of working on certain projects. Ultimately leading to bedrest if not prevnted. If I was dying of thirst in this game and actually lasted 2 days longer than when it began while laying on my bed I wouldn't be upset. Same with food.\nIf you want illnesses to prevent easy survival then dull your current illnesses percentages to the %'s in real life and add things like you can't eat too much in one sitting or you will throw up or gain fatigue, same with water but different effects. Just extra research would make this mechanic much more survival like.\n-Sleep... I sleep for about 6 hours everyday and can last till night which is pretty good since 8 is recommended. I understand trekking through snow is tough and wastes energy but why is it that I can go to a bed sleep 8 hours and my exhaustion/fatigue is still not close to the minimum? I might understand if you are suffering from sleep deprivation and need to sleep longer to recover but most time I oversleep it has the same effects on me as if I undersleep. Also maybe add a slight like 1% chance to have a power nap? And make it so when your sleep is at the minimum its hard to get more sleep?\n\nFinally my last point and something I am actually not familiar with. Temperature in Canada. Is this literally winter? Can you survive in to spring? By a quick look on environmental sites posted I found that the temps this game show are way out of wack. Also Are blizzards this common? Don't know these answeres but I am hoping that this can be explained by a climate shift due to the nuclear strikes or whatever?\n\nOverall this game is fantastic for the stage it's in with an even more promising future. I understand that I nailed a lot of my dislikes and did not capitalize on the fun it has brought me but I only am doing that for a possibility of helping the future progression. I also understand this was not easy to create and my ideas may be too much time to put forth the effort again only suggestions.\n\nGet this game, play it when you aren't mad about it. Enjoy the tough survival aspect and show up all of your friends! Hope my review helps and please comment with what you think about it or the game. I would love to have some conversations!\n\nUpdate:\nAlso in response to a new review up there on the charts. (Stormrhodos). This guy is only complaining because he once again did not follow what this game is about. Intelligence. Tinder can be found easily by newpaper and warming up is easy if you just sleep for around an hour or two inside. Also foraging for wood and freezing? Forage on a warm day and in a shelter to protect from wind. Better yet forage inside! You know that furniture you complain you cant break and use? That's reclaimed wood baby and thats exactly what you get from foraging inside! Oh and rifle is rare? Its 100% spawn rate in homestead which if you were intelligent while playing you would notice. This game has a lot of secrets and once again if you use your brain while playing you will find them out and probably have a pretty successful run. If you would do it in real life then think about it in the game chances are its smarter than the other option. Don't let these reviews fool you because this game is great! Just know it's still early access.","September 22, 2014","true","14.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I was apprehensive about it at first because of the cartoon graphics, but after only about 15 or 20 minutes of play, I was hooked.  Anyone who liked The Road by Cormac McCarthy will totally groove on this game.  The best thing about it is that it's well balanced and believeable; meaning that if you do something stupid, you die, but if you are careful, you can survive for quite a long time.  Much like I'd imagine a real life apocalyptic survival situation to be.  The crafting isn't extremely difficult, but not easy or guaranteed when you get what you need to do it.  Another plus is that it isn't glitchy, like a lot of other early access games.  The controls are intuitive and follow industry standards, so you don't need to spend any time going through some boring tutorial.  In short, if you are looking for a survival game that you can get into quickly, presents a real, but achieveable challenge and never crashes, well this is it.","January 17, 2015","true","313.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

There's a certain sense of desperation that you sometimes feel when you're playing this game - you might be out in the cold, with your character's condition steadily decreasing, and you hear a howl. So you look around, and on the crest of a nearby ridge is a dark silhouette. It's a wolf, and suddenly the situation becomes more dire. Your character moves slowly when their stamina is drained, or if they are injured. Sometimes escaping from predators is not as easy as it sounds or seems. The elements are deadly too - navigating through fog or a snowstorm can be a challenge, if you aren't prepared.\n\nThe world of the Long Dark is a lonely world indeed. Searching through abandoned houses is always interesting - while searching for clothing you might stumble across the empty bedroom of a child, toys still scattered across the floor. You'll walk along lonely coastlines and across frozen lakes, through deserted settlements and climb up windswept mountains. When exploring new areas, you never really know what you might discover. The frozen bodies of those who could not survive serve as a warning and reminder of the post-disaster world the Long Dark takes place in.\n\nEvery major update adds something new and interesting to find. I look forward to the upcoming story mode. Thank you for this game, Hinterland.

The artistic style is consistent, fitting and most of all very pleasing. Hinterland have taken some liberties in portraying wildlife and occasionally favored game design over realism, which I find is nothing to complain about.\n\nBut 18 months and three failed release dates later it is still in Early Access and without any released episodes of the announced Story Mode. It's difficult to tell how long it'll be until Story Mode is completed because Hinterland have stopped giving new release dates and engaged in a rigorous "it's done when it's done" approach.\n\nThere are quite a lot of people who seem to be fine with playing just the Sandbox for all this time, stating that they don't want or care for the Story Mode. However, I actually bought this for the narrative story and Sandbox simply doesn't hold any interest for me anymore. You can't actually do that many different things in the current game and just trying to survive for one more day without achieving anything else than surviving for one more day is simply not my cup of tea. This is especially true since many of the in-game activities are represented by abstract progress bars that simly show the passage of time. You never actually see your character repairing, crafting, eating, harvesting or cooking. The maps are also static, so after some time you know the environment like the back of your hand.\n\nAfter having failed the most recent release window Hinterland published a roadmap for the future development in April 2016, containing development items categorized into "0 - 6 months", "6 - 12 months" and "12+ months".\nUnfortunately, Story Mode is not a part of that roadmap.\n\nThe roadmap was recently updated, after 2 months had passed. It seems they are trying to put 4 of 27 items of the "0 - 6 months" category into the June update. The remaining items are in the same category as in April, meaning what was thought to be 6 months away in April is still 6 months away in June.\nSo instead of one big change to the anticipated release date once a year, there are now several small ones. It might look better because instead of announcing a change to the planned release date, they are simply not updating the planned duration until completion, but the effect is still the same. With this approach I'm afraid the roadmap will take years to reach anything close to completion and Story Mode may not be coming for quite some time.\n\nWhile it might sound great that a developer is actually delaying a product because "it's not ready yet", I cannot recommend an Early Access title that keeps postponing its release on the sole premise of always needing more time.\nSadly, it seems The Long Dark is following the poor tradition of broken promises and seemingly endless development phases that plague Early Access.","June 3","false","222.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","2"

He was security, and his life was pretty good. He had a wife, couple kids, and good health. He enjoyed playing tennis at the local YMCA and building snowwolves with his kids on weekends. But one night while patrolling, one of the valves blew off it's place when to much pressure built up in a damaged pipe, and it got Fluffs (as his friends called him) right in his head. He held out for a little, but unfortunately there was too much internal bleeding. He was a dedicated security officer, and in his death he believes he's still on that night shift. Looking for trespassers, taking justice into his hands against thieves. We rage out on him, I do myself, but is he not doing his job? Is he not more dedicated to his work than we are to surviving? Fluffs, wherever you are...please let me hear you coming so I can bolt out the door X(\n\nAnywho...Good game, though I recommend it despite many frustrations I do warn that it's early access and thus frustrations will be common.

It is still a numbers game, and you still magically know all of your calories at any given time. Maybe the weather numbers were removed (I don't remember seeing them this time). To be fair - I did not melee fight any wolves - I killed some with a rifle, though.\n\nI got my money's worth out of this and all, but to tell you the truth, I am just not feeling it. ITS SOOO CLOSE to something I could love, but yet so far. I love the idea of surviving the environment, and not zombies, but this just feels too tedious to be much fun. The graphics are also amazing, and in fact, probably the high point. It really does make you feel like you are out there all alone.\n\nPros\n1. Graphics are killer good\n2. Atmosphere is very submersive, best I've seen for this kind of game\n3. Fresh idea that is welcome in survival games (no horror or zombies, I'm in!)\n\nCons\n1. Menus are terrible - all weird drop down boxes and statistics, and terrible for controller support to-boot\n2. This is too much of a 'numbers-game' where you have to fight counting calories and how much stove time you have left\n3. THINGS ARE SO COUNTER-INTUITIVE - you can dehydrate yourself to death while you sleep. I mean c'mon. I could go on and on for this point, but those that have played it certainly know what I am talking about\n4. The wolves are actual enemies that leave something to be desired for me. The combat is really silly, and is basically just spam-clicking\n5. You magically have statistics on the weather (degrees, etc.), and actual calories consumed, but do not have these numbers for other things\n\nOverall, it just feels too clunky and tedious to keep me coming back. I also started to really dislike the developers on the forums. They are *too* involved - they should stick to reading the stickied threads for ideas or troubleshooting. Once they get into bickering, they only stand to lose on a long enough timeline.","November 12, 2014","false","17.9"," 162 of 296 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","162","296","3","17"

Maps are mostly linear (Only 2 of them ATM) and houses that you can explore are copy-pasted, there is actually like 6 types of them and you will get sick of exploring them pretty quickly. Whole gameplay is a dull grinding, check every small drawer, get from point A to point B at a snail's pace without something that can provide you with fun in the mean time , ETC. I wouldn't mind this kind of grind but it takes too long to perform ANY action. There's nothing to do outside except for traveling between locations and gathering wood (Wood is obtained without any axe through the "gathering" menu, which only consumes time and some of your stats while you remain at the same position.) And maybe hunting, but that's when you get a rifle, which is a very rare item. Wolves is the only hostile mobs in the game ATM and there is no melee system. When a wolf catches you, you have to spam your RMB, that's it. There is "Gain strength" button which has a purpose of... letting the wolf eat you in less than a second. Mashing RMB is the only efficient option, why bother with anything else then? Oh, and there's no story mode right now. This game is not very fun and has a small amount of content. But it IS pretty and promising. That's why i'm recommending this game. If you are willing to buy a fun game that you can put lots of hours into, it's too early for that. If you are willing to support this dev both with money and constructive critique, go ahead then and buy it. I'll update this review when this game recieves a major update.","December 31, 2014","true","9.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

But, I digress and will try and keep this fair.\n\nThe Long Dark was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say, I am not disappointed by it. I loved the artstyle from the get-go because it's minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing but it may not work for everyone. For example, the buildings have an almost comic-book style to them which I enjoy but your mileage may vary. As for the actual gameplay, it's very easy to get into - very straight forward on what you have to do - but it gets very difficult very fast.\n\nFor example, I kept assuming you need a fire going when you rest so you don't freeze to death (using my real world logic) but this seems not to be the case. Within the first day I used all my accelerant and tinder plugs and no idea what to do after. I went out to forage, got hit with a blizzard and died. Cue clucking of tongue and an annoyance to make it past the first day.\n\nBut I admit, once you get the hang of it, it does become fun. Some people may not find calorie counting and foraging wood and lighting fires to be all that exciting mind you. Which this game has so if you want something more fast-paced, this probably won't do it for you. But for me, taking notes on what I'm doing, planning for the day or even just poking around outside for a minute and running back to shelter is fun. The fact that it's located in the wilderness of Canada - a place used rarely in games - just makes it better and I cannot wait for the Story Mode.\n\nOverall, again, I give it 10/10. The game is getting more content as the days go on so that's a big plus as it has changed from when I first downloaded it.\n\nAlso, Jennifer Hale. I mean... that right there.

The art is refreshing, It made me curse, scared me, felt joy of living by almost dying and then finding a cabin that prolonged my life, I had to pause the game and say to myself "It's just a game" that's how deep it took me in. The resources and the combinations of the rotating elements and my choices make for endless combinations and situations for an end result, and with multiple scenarios/stories/seasons (to come) the challenges and the reward's of playing would be endless, packed with adventure and "Damn I should have done that instead of this" retry!! And then I die 3 minutes later by a wolf so all theories about what I'm going to do go to hell and it starts all over but that is what makes it fun and challenging.

It didnt dissapoint. The sandbox mode is so good I havnt played much of it but from what I have played so far I find it very enjoyable the intesity of whether or not there is food or matches in a house or car, getting scared because of a few wolves near by. It is a very great game. I really wish I would play this a lot longer than what I have. (CSGO is that blame) I really have enjoyed my experience thus far and I really want to see some sort of DLC or more updates. You can tell the devs put time into this game. For its price its a great game. Better than most on EA (Early Access NOT Electronic Arts) 10/10 There is nothing wrong with this game or at least that I have found.

Right now only the sandbox mode is available so your objective is to survive for as long as possible by gathering food, wood, tools, clothing, etc. and by STAYING AWAY FROM WOLVES. Seriously, don't get near those things, not even with your rifle. You'll get bitten to death. Oh, and don't go out at night, you'll get bitten to death IN THE DARK.\n\nAll of these survival stunts take place in a beautifully portrayed Canadian winter, and I mean this seriously. The developers haven't gone for photorealistic graphics but for a more impressionist approach with vibrant colours and more simple shapes. The game has made me go "WOAH!" several times because the landscape was so beautiful that you forget the hunger and the wolves for some brief seconds.\n\nThere are some very interesting game mechanics that are the core of the game. Temperature is of the utmost importance so you are able to rip some clothes in order to improve others, skin animals to get leather or fur, etc. All of these actions are done inmediatly in real time but require an investment of in-game time (Which can be optimized by using the right tools) and that's the main point of the game: Invest your time wisely because your hunger, thirst and fatigue are going up continuosly.\n\nMy favourite mechanic of all is the climate. Let's say you're save in a cabin but then you need to go outside for resource gathering, well, you may go out to find a clear day which allows you to see up to the horizon or, if you can hear the wind while into the house, you can find a windy landscape with reduced visibility or a FREAKING STORM may arrive reducing your visibility to zero. Good luck finding the cabin again.\n\nI feel like I've only scratched the surface of a very rich, survival game in which you can feel like everything is under control one die just to die horrible the next day because you made some poor choices.

In real life, I would grab a big stick and use it. Not in The Long Dark; no, you can't use your axe or find any intelligent way to ward the wolves off after your flares run out.\n\n- I survived for nearly a month and only found half of the ingredients needed to make a bow and arrow. It's ridiculous that you need to find 2 different types of rare tree saplings just to make a simple bow. How about making a spear instead, or even just a pointy stick?\n\n- Clothes degrade at least ten times faster than they do in real life.\n\n- Thirst accumulates faster than it does in real life.\n\n- Hunger accumulates faster than it does in real life (but is much closer to accuracy than thirst, and it drains accurately while sleeping)\n\n\nHowever, the temperature balance seems polished and well-implemented, and the ambiance and art style are nice. The main complaint is that the constant threat of wolves is not offset by the common-sense ability to pick up and use a freaking stick, or maybe not be so damn picky about your choice of bow and arrow materials (alternately, maybe maple and birch saplings shouldn't be rarer than the lost city of Atlantis).","June 21, 2015","false","15.1"," 171 of 319 people (54%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","54","171","319","38","15"

Full of powers I ran down the hill, jumping through a crunchy snow like a astronaut on the moon. Crack! Yikes, I sprained my ankle and it hurts. I'm so stupid but this is ok, another time I sprained my ankle somehow by tripping the dead body. At least i found some beef jerky in his backpack, poor guy. Whatever I can make it, still flowed on my mind, just need some painkillers and rest for a few hours ... "There is a sign! The Sign! Forestry lookout, hmmm ..." I mumbled into the cold air with hope in some decent cabin where I can warm myself. "... this f*&$ing hill ... my ankle ... it hurts ... aaaawww cold", I was freezing and wind was blowing much more there on the top of rocky hill. Finally, I was indoors and felt better. Also I found some tools and food! Cans and can opener. I've started a fire in a stove, melt some snow for drinking, ate some energy bars, can of beans and lay down the bed to rest.\n\nMy ankle was completely recovered but thirst and hunger growed to giant dimensions. If there is snow pretty everywhere around you so you can melt it and have enough water but you have to find more wood for boiling it. That wasn't my case, nevermind, one can drink it as is I thought. Yep, it was my brilliant idea. After a while I felt a pain and welcomed my new friend for long dark nights ... dysentery. Lucky that I found some antibiotics but it wasn't time for sleep, I had to find more wood and remembered to dead deer down the hill. "I can cook some meat", I almost can't heard my own voice in the loud whistle of the wind that stretched around the cabin. So I grabbed the knife and went out.\n\nPoor deer, torn by wolves. Hey .. a dead body over there! I started to be glad for these frozen guys, one may appreciate some more food or clothes. It was getting dark and cold so I had to return to the lookout. My stomach wasn't in good condition and also I started to starve again. Not mentioning that I was really freezing.\n\n\n🔥\n"I am the God of Hellfire and I bring you ... FIRE! ... I love you my dear stove."\n\nMy love to this solid metal thing was warm as like its fire. But why I was so stupid?! While boiling some water I forgot to add more fuel and my fire burnt. Without that last tinder I wasn't able to start it again and cook some delicious deer meat. I barely stayed on my feet so I lay down and went to sleep.\n\nI fell asleep, long sleep as was a long dark there outside. I have died from exhaustion.\n\n\n\n⛰\n\nThis was my very first gameplay of The Long Dark in the early access sandbox mode. Game is running pretty smooth and player can experience so much game mechanics even at this moment. I hope that every small deficit or issue will be tunned by developers and game will be even much more realistic. I'm looking forward to the story mode as well, because even in the sandbox it's very atmospheric. As I said in the beginning, it's like a starving and freezing simulator and you'll find out how this game can be challenging and hard if you are lost and wandering in -20°C (-4°K) with a limited supplies in the small backpack, burning your calories and freezing maybe dying from food poisoning.\n\nAnyway If this will be your last day, believe you will die in the stunning nature!  ... or just torn apart by wolves! 🐺","September 22, 2014","true","10.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I have enough meat to last for a little bit, and some water as well.  I am out of firewood, though, and the temperature outside feels like -56 degrees. So, what's the plan? Do I go out and start my day exploring and gathering some wood? Or should I hunker down another few hours and see if this weather passes... one choice or the other could mean death.\n\nA true enough survival game with no visible bugs, but limited content.  It is relatively slow paced, which makes it more relaxing and calming until the wolf jumps out from behind you and tries to kill you. This game is quite enjoyable for what it is currently: a sandbox survival game with a pretty small, static map.  Your spawn is randomized, but the map is static. So, you will get used to it pretty quickly.\n\nThe game features a lot of ways to die and is actually quite hard.  This is a good thing.  There are no zombies and/or other players to kill you, and it is still pretty hard. A lot of people are saying it is too hard and unrealistic.  In some ways, perhaps, but in other ways not so.  I think it is actually more realistic than people think because very few people have actually experienced any type of arctic survival before.\n\nI actually enjoy the game as it is.  A lot of people are calling for base building, MP, PvP, etc, to make yet another Rust/DayZ clone.  I am looking forward to the devs bringing out the SP story mode and additional maps, which already seem to be promised or in the works.\n\nOverall, a good alpha SP game that I hope stays SP and just adds more variety to the maps and adventures/stories in the future.","September 24, 2014","true","42.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A few rocks here and there. I walked up a hill to get my barings to be met with a spectacular view of the surise. That's when some of the snow collapsed and I fell about 4-5 metres and sprained my ancle as a result. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I limped my way over some more hills then found a hut with an energy bar in it. I hadn't eaten in so long so it felt good to have something in my stomach. I continued on my way. Still limping since I didn't have the first aid to heal myself and I needed to find some supplies before I stopped for the night.\n\nI then found myself in a blizzard. The wind was beating down on me as I limped toward more endless snow. Each time I saw a rock I pictured it as a hut and got a glimps of hope only to see it as it truely was. A mirrage, the illusion of savior.\n\nI was getting cold, real cold when I finally found my way out of the blizzard and to a small clearing when I could make out an old train track and a building in the distance. That's when I heard it. A slight grumble of a wolfs breath. I looked around slowly, feeling around my pockets for a knife I had found early that day. But I was too slow, everything went slow when I saw the wolf pounce towards me. All I could think about was how funny it was that I had survived a fall from a cliff, starvation, dehydration, getting stuck in a blizzard with no fire wood. I survived it all only to die here when my salvation was in sight.\n\nThe wolf burried its teeth in my neck and for once since all of this happened I was finally warm. My blood felt like a hot shower as it covered my body. The wolf jumped off me and I rolled over. Tryign to stand. Red blood tainting the beauty of the plain white snow.\n\nMy vision was blurry then it all when black. No more hunger, no more cold. Just warmth.\n\n\nI did all of that surrounded by some of the most beautiful art I've seen in a game for a very long time. 10/10 would bang.","February 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","5","5","4","0"

Its obvious you care alot about your product.\nI died 5 times in the first 3 hours, mostly getting myself stuck in snowstorms. It takes a good deal of planning to make sure your not going to get stuck out in the snow, or attacked by wolves in the dark.\nWhen you've finally found the rifle or rounds for it, downing a buck is the most satisfying feeling. No worrying about sustenance for at least a week, if you ration. Make sure to build a fire nearby though, or by the time your done harvesting it you'll be frozen stiff.\nIm not gonna make a long review but I'd say this is one of the most rewarding games you could play. Also it's a better hunting simulator than most hunting games on the market now.\nI've played around 70 hours, and have not made it past 11 days.\n\n4/5 needs a little work on the crafting but overall a very atmospheric, realistic experience.","March 3","true","75.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Ive had it for about 3/4 of a year, and recently become addicted. This game has really hit my sweet spot: Artic Wilderness survival. I've been to both alaska and canada, and this really gives that immense feeling. Some of the most powerful surges of this feeling have been felt in my journies through Mystery Lake and Pleasant valley. When i was far younger, i dreamed of such a game. For the past 3/4 of a year ive seen it change, from new regions, sorry mode progress, wolf models, to advanced mechanics. From what i've read, this game is supposed to capture "Strong Emotions" I agreed with myself that this game has already captured them: Fear, wit, and the overwhelming drive for survival.\nAnd as for Hinterland, i have something to say: Thank you.

Beautiful art work, the sound of wind blowing... It was beautifuly clear day, I had no idea where to go, so I just walked by some frozen river. I arrived to Mystery lake, started to look around. I ran to the Camp office, set up base, and because snow storm started outside, I went to sleep... Next day, I somehow arrived to the Trapper's homestead. Entered it... YAAAAY!!! There was a rifle, bullets, safe wich contains more bullet, knife... The best loot what I can have in game. Looted the place and went back to the base camp. After few days surviving,  I ran out of supplies, so i went scavenging... Found a dam... Entered the dam... Started looting it... Then suddenly wolf jumped on me, I had no idea how to defend my self 'cause it never before happend to me, so I was just pressing all possible buttons... I died... Survive 8 days and 18 minutes... What a great expirience!\n\nPLUS:\n+ Amazing art work\n+ Amazing sounds & music.\n+ Only you and mother nature\n+ NO ZOMBIES\n+ Permadeath, you really need to try hard to survive\n+ Tons of loot\n+ Big world to explore\n\nMINUS:\n- Gets repetitive after you get used to it\n- Waiting. All actions you do is just wainting. Forage wood? waiting... Harvest meat? waiting... Craft an item? waiting... This really needs improvement.\n- To be completely honest, there is nothing to do after you have tons of supplies and gun: wake up, go hunt, kill a deer, cook it's meat, boil water, go to sleep... Wake up, eat, drink, sleep... Day by day, until you ran out of meat, then you have to go and kill another deer, and agin...\n\nAfter all, This game is beautiful piece of art. It is fun, but as I said, it gets repetitive after some time. I recommend.","July 21, 2015","true","133.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Anyway, this Wolf tore open my leg. I ran into a near by Hut hoping to find a Gun. I bandaged up my leg and found a lantern. Walked out it was gone. (Thank God!).\n\nThis brings me to Day 2. All I did was freeze myself in a Fishing Hut on the frozen lake and catch and cook the fish, it got me through the night, all was going to plan.\n\nDay 3 has now arrived. I had so many supplies you could bring Donald Trump in to win the Election and I would still survive somehow. I had 5 Fish and many bottles of Water and Soup. I thought it's about time I head inland. This was the worse mistake I have ever made. To start things off I hear a loud roar, I was pooping a bit. Than the loud thuds start happening. Turn around and a ♥♥♥♥ing Bear runs around the corner and starts chasing me.\n\n"THE CHASE IS ON!"\n\nI am running as fast as I can, dropping bait to lure the sucker away. Turn around hes still coming, I have just wasted so much food, I turn around and fall off a Cliff. Sprain my Ankle. Than it begins again. Another Bear comes out of no where and starts chasing me. I can't run by this point. I am done. I literally have never screamed so much, cringed to the point I had to look away as the bear is eating me.\n\nSo now my last week has been explained I will review the Game at hand.\n\n10/10. Graphics are Mint, Quality is literally to Die for, would recommend it to my Grandma so she can experience my #IRLMOMENT.","May 17","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

This was becoming a good run, then I found a hunting knife.

I think part of that is the Zombie fad, but not entirely. There is a harder core sort of gamer that wants gritty realism whose not satisfied with guns guns guns.\n\nWelcome to The Long Dark.\n\nThis game will kick your ♥♥♥. If your stupid, you die, that simple. If you /think/ you have a chance at survival.\n\nI love the premise of the game, the sun sends along a gift and turns off all electrical things on Earth. You, a bush pilot, manage to land your plain in the remote Canadian wilderness. Now what? Now you survive, or you die, a lot, before you start to learn just how gritty and realistic this game gets.\n\nPersonally I love that, don't cut me slack, I've done god mode enough its boring.\n\nThe graphics are stylized and really lovely, theres an artistic flair here not found in other games in this genre. The sound is good, not spectacular. It will make you feel powerful lonely at times, and thats sort of the point.\n\nAfter four attempts I managed to survive 20 days and am working on deerskin boots. The crafting and repair system is good, you have to find items needed and a place to do the work, and the game doesn't drown you in items. Sure, at first you'll find lots of candy bars and cans of beans, but they only last so long and you have to start thinking long term. Also, fire making skills are key, as would be the case in RL.\n\nIf you wan't a casual game, this is NOT for you.\n\nIf you wan't a game you can chew on, pitbull like, just to make it past a week...this is for you.\n\nSystem Specs: CPU: i7 4790K, Graphics: GTX 770 Mem: 16 gigs","October 19, 2015","true","13.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.\nPros(+)\n- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)\n- Surprisingly innovative\n- Low price compared to other survival games\n- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)\n- Huge world\nCons(-)\n- No jump button\n- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)\n- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)\nAll in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world.

This coupled with the great environmental audio (howling winds, snow crunching underfoot, etc.) really has a great immersive effect.\n\nHonestly there have been times walking through mountains in Pleasant Valley that I've stopped to look out over the beautiful scenery even though I was freezing my ♥♥♥ off and the sun was setting and it might kill me. Or the desperation when you're trapped at night in a blizzard dying of cold with just your storm lantern and 10 ft of visibility just praying you find shelter soon because if you stop to try to harvest wood for a fire it might kill you. All the while the wind is howling in your ears, snow is crunching under your feet and you're breathing ragged and shaking from the cold. Oh and you walk/run slower into the wind. Those types of details are the best.\n\nIt looks like once story mode is released (Spring 2016 is the latest word) the price will be bumped so get this game now. The sandbox mode alone is worth it, I honestly can't wait for the narrative they're planning to bring.

It has 3 diffculty modes. One where you can just get use to the game mechanics or explore, up to one that makes the game more realistic.\n\nTwo maps right now. Very big and expansive. It will take you quite abit you explore every part of these maps.\n\nSadly, no single player mode right now . Only sandbox mode. You can pick between a male or female character so extreme femintist won't say something stupid like "This games tells kids that only men can survive." Or some nonsense.\n\nIt looks pretty in its style and wonderful atmosphere, I always get the feeling of being watch and the sound design makes it seem like someone is moving around you in buildings. Has a day and night cycle and storms roll in and out. Abit of wild life. Have to protect yourself from wolfs with something as a flare or weapon.\n\nThis game is all about survival and scavenging in the cold mountains of Canada. Looking for warmer clothes, food, water, making fires and finding shelter. It has a crafting system for making clothes or tools. You have to worry about how many calories you intake and taking care of wounds and injuries.\n\nThere is alot of replay value in this, plus with up coming updates. You can even challenge your friends to see who can survive the longest.\n\nThis runs very well on high on my system. I have a GTX 770m with 3 gb of dedicated video ram.

This game will make you question your decisions or value them. In this game, everything you do has a price. That is, that last piece of wolf meat you ate? It's probably the last of food you'll have for days. That last piece of firewood? It will hold you out just enough to keep you warm and to boil you up half a liter of water. That run you want to make? It's getting dark out there. That last bullet in the rifle? It may end up saving your life, or end you.\n\nThis game revolves around the concept of conservation. Of making wise decisions for your character's benefit. Of making sure you can make it through the day just to make sure you can wake up tomorrow.\n\nBeing just an early access title, at $20, with just the sandbox and two challenges playable at the moment, I couldn't have spent it on anything better. (I actually bought it on sale for $10)\n\nTo finish this nice little review off, be 100% sure that you're ready for The Long Dark, like I said before, this game is unforgiving. There will be times of hope and times of great depression.\n\nRemember to play your cards right because you only have one life and mother nature isn't planning on playing fair with you.\n\n10/10 (Would get gang-♥♥♥♥♥ by two bears again)","May 16","true","32.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

I normally try to avoid investing in Alpha games as they seem to take years to complete and a lot of developers cut and run and never finish their product.  Kudos to Hinterland!\nMy first experience with the game I played it on medium difficulty and lasted 20 or so days without any kind of problem as I have played many survival/ resource games before.\nI turned it up to stalker difficulty (Hardest difficulty). Now this is certainly my kind of game:  Real survival.\nArtistically it's beautiful, the dark unforgiving environment was exactly what I expected for a survival game I rate it a 10/10.  Emersion is about 8/10 and it is certainly a playable game even though it’s Alpha.  Out of 36 hours played- I’ve fallen though the world once- That happened after I sprained my ankle from a bump in the snow. This was the only real bug I’ve found and I was able to recover after multiple saved game loads.    The game has only crashed once on me so my rating for general game stability would be 8/10- which is great for an alpha.\nIt isn’t a perfect balance… for example:  In Stalker mode you almost never find anything in file cabinets, you would think you would find just a little more paper….  Other than that you might find one item for every four boxes or containers you search though.\nI can tell you that after 36 hours- I’m not bored with it.   There’s lots of content and places to explore, and there are no quests in this game.  Simply surviving hour by hour and day by day and making it from point A to B is more than a challenge.  Getting down to 3% health in the middle of a blizzard with 99% fatigue all because of rusty can of pork and beans…  and surviving it with quick thinking…  Glorious/Rewarding.\nFrankly Speaking- I think this game has the potential to be the best realistic survival game on the market today.\n","December 31, 2014","true","345.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyberia/recommended/305620/","kyberia","Dolly Is Having Med Problems","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyberia/","226 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far, The Long Dark is looking excellent. It's a proper survival horror game, as in: You might not survive and that's pretty horrible.\n\nGameplay: At the time of writing, only Sandbox mode is available. The mechanics of interacting with the environment are exactly what I ache for in many games, i.e. When I do something that would be sensible in a situation in real life, it works in the game too. Freezing? Get in the lee of that rock to get out of the wind. Yay, it works!\n\nThe game itself kind of includes its tutorial organically. At the start, you have no stuff, so you don't have to worry about what you can do with stuff. As you acquire stuff, you can play with it and learn what it does.\n\nIt is a little frustrating that there are some features you'd hope will appear in the final version that apparently don't work yet - like fuelling and starting the oil generators with you can see attached to many of the cabins, but it's still alpha and there's plenty of time for more actions of this type - the ones that seem obvious and sensible to the player - to be added.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated by death, you might dislike this game, but as it stands, competing against yourself to see how long you can last is a main mechanic of sandbox mode.\n\nAtmosphere: Really good atmosphere, especially through sound and lighting. The constant howling of the wind makes you feel cold and alone, while I got a couple of good jump-scares from a sudden burst of incidental music and my own character mumbling to herself.\n\nStory: Storyline-mode isn't available yet, but there is a lot of good potential for when it is. You can already surmise a number of things about what happened simply from what you can see in the game - dinner still in the ovens, oddly placed corpses... if they stick with the vibe of "Show don't tell" it will be excellent.\n\nIn summary, pretty good as it stands and can only get better. The only reason I -wouldn't- recommend buying it on early access is that this game deserves to cost more - I think the devs may have underestimated what it will cost to do everything they will want to with the game.","November 29, 2014","true","20.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/305620/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's been a good year for fans of the "less zombies - more survival" theme, and this game is a nice addition to that theme.\n\ntl;dr: Scroll down for a short list of gameplay features that may help with decision making.\n\nSandbox Gameplay:\nThis is inherently a game about managing your resources and your condition and keeping yourself fed, warm, healthy and decently equipped. This specific iteration of the Canadian wilderness is empty of people but not of houses, cabins and other locations you can loot from, making this a game more about loot and less about base building or crafting. In fact crafting is minimal (at least at this stage of development), though repairing your equipment is an important aspect of the gameplay. The maps (both of which are relatively small) sport houses/lootable locations at regular, easily walkable distances and they are persistent. The loot however (the type and quantity of which also seems to be more or less persistent) is randomly distributed, offering at least some amount of replayability. The rest of the replayability comes from permadeath: Basically, you die often enough that it will take you a while to explore both maps, small though they may be. Hunting (or at least looting half frozen corpses the wolfs have killed for you) becomes necessary only in later game, when you have unearthed most of the loot and are slowly running low on food. There are at the moment three animals in the game: deer, the wolfs that hunt the deer (and you) and rabbits. You can use traps for the rabbits, and you can attack the wolfs and deer with your fists, a rifle or a hunting knife (both of which you have to find first, and both of which will degrade, so you need to be conservative about your hunting). You can apparently also fish, though I have yet to succeed in ever finding a hook, so there is little I can tell you about that.\n\nWolves:\nYou've heard about the wolves, and they deserve their own paragraph. Fighting them melee (when for example they attack you) is very much a twitchy experience of button mashing, one that feels equally "realistic" and annoying to me. Avoiding them (by using fire, flares or decoys, or by giving them a wide berth) is possible, but not always feasible/practical. Frankly, being stuck inside a house for two days because there's two wolves parked right outside and you have no weapons whatsoever isn't my idea of fun, yet it seems to keep happening to me. But I can see where the devs are coming from, and I have heard other players who enjoy that (and are apparently better than me in the twitchy button mashing), so ymmv.\nHowever, there is an easy mode of the game, which makes the wolves basically not an issue. Sadly, it also makes the rest of survival aspects a bit easier. I am still hoping better balance/alternative solution to this design choice will crop up before full release, but you shouldn't count on it. For now just know that if you are coming to this game for the snow and the exploration, you can feel free to play on easy mode and the wolves will ignore you.\n\nStory mode:\nThis is a promised feature that will apparently get added pre-release, but it isn't here yet. Since this game feels somewhat limited as a sandbox, I am looking forward to the story mode. Theoretically, The Long Dark could be absolutely lifted to the next level with good story mode implementation, it's absolutely a great world to tell stories in. But at this point we have no clue what that's gonna look like, so for now buy it for the sandbox, or wait it out.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThere is very little to say here, I absolutely love the art design. The screenshots you see are very representative of the real thing, so if that works for you, you won't be disappointed. The slightly stylized, less-than-realistic but incredibly evocative art style is gorgeous, atmospheric and immersive. The sound design also brilliantly contributes to the atmosphere. This is a beautiful game, even with lowered graphics.\n\nTechnical stuff:\nFor an early access game, this has been very much a bug free experience for me so far. And while playing this on a laptop not much above min specs, lowering the graphics from ultra to high was enough for a smooth experience, with no lag, small (hardly noticeable during play) fps drops and still stunning visuals.\n\nFinally, here's a list of features to keep in mind before you make your decision:\nAtmosphere: Walking around in the snow, listening to the howling wind is much of the appeal of this game.\nPermadeath: No way around it. Either you're okay with that, or you'll be very frustrated.\nReal time: The game doesn't stop while you're staring at your inventory trying to decide which socks to put on. When planning for a two hour tree cutting session, keep in mind the weather may have changed to howling winds and you may be dying of hypothermia when you emerge on the other side of it. (Not being able to break what you're doing in reaction to what's happening is one of my pet peeves with the game, btw.)\nMaps: This initially feels, but distinctly is NOT an open world survival game. There are two maps, and they are both small and persistent. You can basically learn where everything is in a couple of successful playthroughs. Also, some of the houses are too shame-y inside, which I find a pity for such small maps.\nLoot: There is a more or less set number of items you can find, spread randomly around the map in every new game. What you find when can easily make or break an early game.\nHunting: This is not an FPS and it isn't Deer Hunter. You have a rifle with very limited ammo and a knife, and that's about it. And even those degrade btw.\nDifficulty: There are three difficulty modes to pick and choose from. It is a bit unfortunate imo that wanting to avoid the button mashing that constitutes fighting the wolves means also having to play in a mode that seriously nerfs the rest of the survival difficulty, but at least the option is there.\nSurvival: The Long Dark is a decent, if rather limited, take on the "loot, craft (minimally), repair, manage your resources, manage your condition" type of gameplay. Because of the limited crafting and the reliance on findable loot, there is less flexibility of strategy here than in other games of the genre.\n\nAnd that inflexibility of viable strategies is for me this is the major negative of the game, the aspect that limits its sandbox mode the most. However, this could theoretically be completely offset with a decent story mode, effectively changing the whole feel of things. As a world to tell stories in, let me reiterate, this could potentially be an absolutely brilliant one. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nEDIT: Please add modding support! This game is screaming for it. :)","January 3, 2015","true","11.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Some elements are therefore not in line with the real world (for example the degradation of items goes a lot faster). There is (currently) no intention of making a separate game mode that is as realistic as possible, although there are talks of mod support to enable this by the community.\n\nI bought The Long Dark because I have been searching for a realistic survival game / simulator for a long time. Even though it is not meant to be entirely realistic / simulator, it comes very close. So close that I can state it is the best game I have ever played. I have played a lot of games for many years (a lot outside Steam) so this is quite impressive considering it still is in early access. The game-play is fantastic and is a must for any gamer that is into survival games and crafting. I don't want to spoil it for you, but there are times where I am trembling of fear and excitement. The immersion is so great that I sometimes forget I am playing a game. It is visually stunning and the sound is even better.\n\nThe game is constantly changing and new content is added regularly (big update each month and smaller ones in between). The developers are enthusiastic and committed and are willing to listen to the community, while maintaining their own vision. While there is currently only a sandbox, story mode is planned for release at the end of this year (which includes great voice actors like Jennifer Hale). The price will probably go up at that point, so buy it while it is still cheap.\n\nThe Long Dark will not hold your hand and there are no tutorials. It is very intuitive, but you have to use your intellect. There are three game modes. One which is forgiving and primarily to explore (Pilgrim). One that is exactly in line with the vision of Hinterland, challenging but fair (Voyageur) and my personal favourite, brutal and unforgiving (Stalker). I love the challenge in the game (or any game) as there is nothing better than to recover from your near dead experiences. Most people will die, some a lot. As it is permadeath you will lose your hard work. If you don't like dying or to lose your progress, I would suggest waiting for story mode (but be ready to pay more if you don't buy it now). I however love permadeath and (almost) impossible games, which is why I play games that have this (Faster Than Light, XCOM, Don't Starve etc.). Always on the highest difficulty and with permadeath on if this is possible. The Long Dark has a difficulty mode for every kind of player, which is a big plus.\n\nTo conclude, this game is so amazing that I bought a new Xbox One just to play The Long Dark. I bought the game for my low-end laptop, which was below the minimal requirements. Surprisingly I could play it extremely well until last big update. I felt so sad and empty when I could not play any more that I just had to do something about it. It is all worth it as I am 100% sure it will be a huge success (unlike other early access games). If there are any doubts or questions, feel free to send a message or post on the forum. Hinterland, me and the community are happy to help.","September 11, 2015","true","59.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

You will have to either melt snow on a fire and boil it to get water or actually find some. You will need to forage for wood which takes aslong as you want but you may come up empty handed.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThe game puts you randomly on the map and lets you survive how you want whether that be crawling up to a corner, putting a fire down, rolling out your bed and waiting although you will find that as the night approaches you will not want to stay there as your fire won't last long enough through the night and the cold wind will freeze to death, or close anyway. Tab opens up many options for you too choose from, ranging from inventory to foraging.\n\n-Conclusion-\nThe game looks and sounds fantastic and I can guarrente that this game will become so much better as the game develops. The only thing I dislike is the calary metre as it drops too fast in my opinion and even drops as you sleep and when you have to sleep through the night you will need ALOT of food to keep it up.\n\nI give it a 9/10 for being fun, unqiue and realistic and definately worth the purchase!\n\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf_WlIdNdVg","September 23, 2014","true","2.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I started in a cave to the south and almost immediatly found a rifle on a body frozen into the canyon ground. Excellent, this will make things much easier. Leaving the canyon, I found myself at the Camp Office. A good place to stay after I stocked up on food and firewood there. I even found some bullets. The next day I started to explore the lake, pillaging the cabins for their precious food and supplies, returning once again to the office, my home. On day three I made it to the hunter's homestead, killing a wolf along the way and skinning it.\nOn day four I decided it was time to go to the dam. Rifle at the ready, I opened the door. Nothing. As I start to open lockers, I hear a growl. The dam wolf starts ferociously biting at me as I struggle to fight it off. Eventually, I am the victor and the wolf scurries off down the corridor. Now the hunt is on, I take out my rifle and vow to remove the menace from the dam, and make it a new safe haven. I creep slowly down the hallway, the sights of my rifle in line with my eye. As I round the corner, I hear another growl, I aim, and I fire. I miss. The wolf attacks and I manage to kill it with my knife. Then I notice I only have one percent of life left and I'm bleeding out. I access my medical kit as the world starts to black out around me.

"The Long Dark" plops you into a post-apocolyptic environment set in the northern wilderness (where everything has icicles growing off of it).  Instead of trying to avoid zombies and the like, you'll "simply" be tasked with battling the elements, starvation, and the occasional pack of wolves.  As you'll soon realize, there's nothing "simple" about it.  In its current state, only the sandbox mode is available.  With that said, you'll easily be able to pump 50+ hours into this mode.  While the map itself is fixed, the items and their spawn locations are not, making it a challenge to find the tools you'll need to stay alive.

However, personally, only what the Early Access has offered now worths the money.\n\nThe very first thing that can be accounted as pros is the the game's very own concept. It is a new dimension of 'survival game', unlike many mainstream survival game lists which involve zombies and mutants to horrify you, this game is another story: just you against the 'Mother Nature'. You are on your own, among the cold, hunger, thirst, tiredness, or even danger from wolves. All you need to do is 'survive'. It sounds simple and uninteresting, but believe me this game is well enough even with this simplicity in this game genre. No safe place with lots of supplies (unless you choose 'Pilgrim' mode). You need to take risks with your own actions. Everything is by yourself.\n\nThe gameplay ... I don't know if I should classify it as a pro or con, but it is mixed. You can never expect anything from each playthrough; when you restart, everything except the regions will be resetted. This gives you the survival experience to some extends. For example, you might find a rifle, the only 'real' weapon in the game, without any bullets before you find one bullet miles away, or you need a can opener but still yet to be found; what will you do? which way? where is it going to be? Everything which other survival games may overlook matters in this game. You need clothes to keep you warm, raw food, if not cooked well, can be a threat when eaten, or you can even hurt your legs if you do not watch your steps (which happens to me a lot lol). These are some of the situations that I found and I need to give the 'thumb up' for the developer's careful planning so as to make this game as realistc as possible.\n\nHowever, there is something that still bugs me; the wolves. They still lack realistic movements: too repetitive and can be easy to deal with as you get get used to the game. Even though the developer has mentioned something about the wolves, their movements and some behaviors, such as how slow or fast it should be in different situations, are needed for consideration *for developers*. I hope if the wolves are readjusted in the right way it would gives me more exciting experience. Nevertheless, even with this comment I still find dealing with wolves sometimes hard anyway. (I heard that more wildlife will be added, so it might be the solution for this problem as well.)\n\nIf you are fans of survival game and need a new dimension on survival experience, I suggest you that you buy this and try it once or wait for sometime until the full release comes (Story Mode, I'm really looking forward to that!).\n\nMy last warning ..\n"Beware of the wolves, the cold, or even yourself as you play this game".\n\nGood Job Hinterland!","January 7, 2015","true","56.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Shepard - Mass Effect)\nJennifer Hale (Cmd. Shepard - Mass Effect)\nMarianne Crawcysk (writer of L.A. Noire, Driver, Far Cry 3, Appleseed Alpha)\nRaphael Van Lierop (Project Lead - Relic Games, Blacklight, Ubisoft, Activision)\nAlan Lawrence (Lead Designer - Saints Row 1-4, Freespace 1-2, Red Faction 1-2)\nDavid Chan (Audio Director - Bioware)\n\nNow that I have your attention...let's explain the credits more in depth and why The Long Dark is a great foundation for an amazing final product.\n\nI have been waiting for years, if not decades for a game that makes simple man vs. nature survival the primary focus rather than simply a secondary after-thought. The Long Dark by Hinterland Games delivers a the closest thing to being Survivorman that has ever appeared in a game. They also designed TLD from the ground-up to work seamlessly with the Oculus Rift. The have a dev kit in their studio as of last month in fact.\n\nAs of this review the game is currently in Early Access (v.119). It was the result of a Kickstarter campaign less than a year ago by Hinterland Games. The concept is you are a small plane bush pilot in Northern Canada when a Coronal Mass Ejection occurs (CME - similar to a solar flare). This causes all electrical components worldwide to fail. Unfortunately, this also caused the plane you were flying in to fall out of the sky into an unknown area in the frigid winter of a forest. You lived through the crash...but will you live through The Long Dark?\n\nHinterland Games was founded by Raphael Van Lierop. Raph, as he's known on the forums, has over a decade of AAA game creation experience. As a creative director, narrative director, producer, designer, and writer on multiple award-winning game titles including Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000. His former studios include Relic, Ubisoft Montreal, Blacklight and Activision.\n\nRapheal had the desire to create a first-person raw and realistic survival simulation with a deep story mode. The big box studios said it wasn't "marketable" enough. So he took his skills and experience and left. After easily surpassing his Kickstarter goal with his vision of The Long Dark, he grabbed some other highly experienced industry professionals. This inclused David Chan as Audio Director from Bioware. Next to join the team was Alan Lawrence. Alan was the lead designer on Freespace, Freespace 2, Red Faction, Red Faction 2, Saints Row 1-4 and many more. Together the group started Hinterland Games. Their first project is The Long Dark. With plans for future expansions and sequels in the form of seasons. This should be similar to The Walking Dead game series in delivery.\n\nRaph didn't stop there, he wants a deep and rich story to go with the realistic survival experience. So he invested a substantial amount of the kickstarter funds into hiring Marianne Krawcyzk as the writer. She wrote L.A. Noire, Driver, Far Cry 3 and Appleseed Alpha. Together Raph and Mirianne will have the story mode out by the end of 2014 with many NPC's characters created from the original Kickstarter backers likenesses.\n\nWhat else did Raph want for his survival game experience?? How about GREAT voice acting... Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale from Mass Effect. And maybe even a guy named David Hayter the former Solid Snake from a little franchise called Metal Gear. I guess Sutherland wasn't available...his loss.\n\nSo if you are jaded like I was/am on Early Alpha games that alway overpromise and underdeliver, I know this game design team will not disappoint you from experience. See as a kickstarter backer, I got a copy of the game many updates ago. The design team has a clearly defined goal, and future plans for this as a franchise. They are just looking to the community to give feed back to best reach that clear goal. Guess who has the most posts on the forums...each individual from the dev team! They are really that interactive and willing to hash-out and debate concepts with the players who are ultra motivated to help.\n\nThis leads me to the community. The community is amazing. No trolls, only mature and constructive gamers. Need a question about survival tactics...ask Rob Doar. Have an issue with the forum...Bill Tarling is your guy. Need help re-creating a bug...TattooedMac is your answer. Want to see how long you can survive...how about the long-term survival masters Heather and LordMasterGaming. Want to check out some great videos/livestreams...I'm your guy, Accurize2. Oh but maybe I'm not good enough for you, how about DaSquirrelsNuts or MathasGames...yep they are in the community too!\n\nSo to summarize this amazing survival game has a great goal.

Nope. You want to be naked and kill someone with a rock? Nope. Build something while naked and with friends to kill people with rocks? Nope.\n\nAny survival game you see this days is about Zombies, A post-apocalyptic world, MP or All of them combined. The Long Dark is quite a different.\n\nYou're going to be surviving by yourself. You will die horribly or just stupidly. You can survive for a week and just die embarassingly from freezing because of a blizzard. You can get eaten by wolves. or just starve to death in a matter of I don't know. A few hours? This is what a survival game is.\n\nIt has a lot of potential. I can go on and on about what they should add.

The artwork is beautiful, there are moments while exploring where you cannot help but admire the serenery, it can be breathtakingly calm one minute where there is light dainty snow drifting down around frolicking deer, but beware, mother nature can trap you.... leaving you alone..... in a cold blizzard..... roaming lost as you strive to find shelter.\n\n\nThe Long Dark has great potential, I have really liked the content that has been available to us, where I do not need zombies to be afraid or entertained.  I have mother nature and the harsh elements to contend with.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games.\n\nI've been running a Let's Play series for this game feel free to check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2QtQQYxhQXzzZD6TPH_lBG2zzBSU-4wA","November 17, 2014","true","237.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That said:\n\nThis game is mostly about exploration and resource management. Your only enemies are wolves, the cold, starvation, dehydration, and hopefully other survivors later in development. You will constantly be fighting an uphill battle to find food and supplies. Unless you have a stockpile far too heavy to carry, you will need to be on the move from location to location as you loot, scavenge, and hunt. The combat system currently is very undeveloped with you only being able to fight off wolves with your bare hands or using rifles (no using that hatchet/hunting knife/prybar against them, although hopefully soon they'll implement this). Avoiding combat with wildlife is actually pretty easy as long as you're aware of their locations; mainly just giving them a wide berth, or throwing lit or even burnt out flares (much less effective) too spook them. At this stage in the game, if you have food poisoning, you WILL die; there is absolutely nothing you can do about it as your condition will deplete fairly quickly. If you see that warning, do yourself a favor and just hit load (Save points are when you sleep in a bed or bedroll).\nOverall the game shows a lot of promise and is very unique (pretty much the only post-apocalyptic game I can think of that doesn't feature some sort of sci-fi or supernatural flavor. The full game will have multiple maps and goals beyond just survival.","September 25, 2014","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are no jumpscares, long dark uses that psychological horrorific fact that you're all alone.\n- Good crafting system (but need some improvements at some aspects)\n\nCons\n- No tutorials. The game chucks you in there and says "good luck surviving". You would have no idea what to do at the beginning or where to go, which sometimes causes players to refund the game. If you're the type of person who likes to figure out things on the fly, this shouldn't matter too much.\n\n- Restricted crafting. What I mean by this is at the moment, arrow heads can only be crafted at the forge. A forge can ONLY be found at Desolation Point, which is one map out of the 4 maps. If you ever think about hunting with a bow and arrow because rifle rounds cannot be crafted and you started at Mystery Lake or some other map, you're out of luck. You HAVE to travel to desolation point. (Hopefully they add more forges in, but at the moment, 1 forge exists in the game).\n\n- There is a tendency to run out of things to do. If you are the type of person who just wants to stay in one place and hide inside a house, I warn you. If you have EVERYTHING you need, you have the tendency to stay in that safe haven and get bored because you run out of things to do. There's no base building mechanics (yet, I don't know if they think about adding it), but if you're just going to stay in one place, you'd get bored in around 9 hours of gameplay straight (because that's how long it takes to get all your stuff as well as getting enough food and everything you need to survive if you know your map enough).\n\nConclusion: Every gaming experience is different. You never know how you'd find the game until you play it. I've listed all the pros and cons of the game and it's really up to you on whether you want it or not. If you do buy it, make sure you have heaps of flares and good luck surviving.","November 14, 2015","true","46.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Or at least that's what I imagine. Its been over a month since my plane went down, and the only people I've found are frozen corpses being picked over by the wolves. It seems the only thing I can do anymore to keep remotely sane and inspired to stay alive is to talk to myself during the long hours.  Oh, I had to put the spare wolf pet somewhere out of sight, I woke up in the middle of the night about two days ago to get a drink and about had a heart attack, the light filtering through the windows made it look like a wolf had crashed thru the window and gotten inside, I nearly wasted a round of my rifle ammo.\n\nThat's about the only positive thing I have to say today, I'm stuck in that little cabin off the beaten path. There's a snowstorm right now, my leg is bleeding profusely, I tore my hat to pieces in order to make a bandage, but I have the sinking suspicion that a bear's mouth isn't the most hygenic place in Canada. So yea, it's probably infected. I'll have to treat it when i get back to the gas station. Might be difficult walking thru the snow with a bum leg and no pants. ... Funny story behind that actually.\n\nI spent days hunting deer and drying their pelts in order to have some warm pants, and the bear ate them, and a bit of my leg as dessert.\n\nIt sounds so absurd to say it out loud... the bear ate my pants. Its like one of those things you learn to say in highschool spanish to make the teacher have a headache ...\n\nsomething something mis pantelones ...\n\n*a blood stain signs the final entry in a small journal laying next to a half naked corpse leaning in a corner of a little cabin off the beaten path.*\n\n--\n\nReally its a fun game where the experiences that kill you are just as fun to talk about as the experiences you survive. Hinterland is doing great with keeping the game coming along with updates and bugfixes. They have an amazing team that really is interested in player feedback.\n\nThe game has immense replay value, even in its unfinished alpha sandbox mode.\nGreat graphics that I can only describe as water color cell shading ... ish.\nI like that they're not trying to carbon copy other survival games.\n\nI've got nothing negative to say about the developers. Nothing negative to say about the game.\nHonestly I think everyone should play this game at least once.\n\nI guarantee the first time that you're ripped apart by wolves after barely surviving a blizzard after finally finding a box of crackers after panically searching houses for anything to eat will be 1000% times more enjoyable than experiencing those things in real life. ... at least, maybe like ... 1010% more enjoyable even.","July 9, 2015","true","68.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

It's got atmosphere. It's challenging. And the biggest threat to your survival isn't always as obvious as you might think. Most of the time I died in this game, it was because of poor preparation and getting lost in a blizzard while trying to find my way back to a shelter. It's a game where smart decisions and patience truly pay off, and I can't stress enough how much I love games like that.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels right now. ''Easy'' allows you to play simply for the atmosphere and wild animals won't attack you, which makes the whole experience more peaceful, if ridiculously easy. The ''Normal'' difficulty is not a walk in the park by any stretch of the imagination. Every day is a struggle against time and the elements to procure food, tools and equipment, and fuel for fires. In fact, it's so tough and gritty I haven't bothered to try the ''Hard'' difficulty yet. I assume you just die of dysentry or scurvy as soon as you start the game. :P\n\nThe game can get a bit boring when you're starting to build up a good supply of stuff. It can also get rather stressful in the early game when you're trying to avoid overly agressive wolves while fighting against the clock in mad sorties across the wilderness to ''maybe'' find that tool you desperately need. Despite that, The Long Dark is a promising game that has a lot to offer and will probably have a lot more to offer as it develops.","September 29, 2015","true","90.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

This is how an early access game should be.\n\nThat being said, I was skeptical when buying this game because early access titles have a bad reputation for being abandoned by developers, or just having to wait far too long for the next update. Well not this one. For early access this game is amazing and immersive. The moment I started up the game and found my first cabin to loot, I knew I was going to be hooked. But let's just get to a list of everything, it's easier.\n\nGraphics - The graphics are very nice, and the game has a unique look, but in a good way. The first word that comes to mind when trying to describe the graphics is "cartoonish", but I feel like that doesn't do justice. You may just have to watch some videos or get the game and see for yourself, but it's really cool. I especially love the shadows and the way light comes in through windows when indoors. It really gives you the sense that everything is abandoned, and has a slightly creepy atmosphere, but can be inviting at other times. Or even when holding the lantern I am reminded of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, even though this isn't a horror game!\n\nOn Ultra graphics, the framerate is fantastic. I am always above 60 thanks to the recent update to Unity 5, which improved performance for everyone. Before it was still fine, but it has gotten so much better! In fact, there is a good chance you could play this on a low end PC, although I'm just speculating.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - Here's where it might get a bit lengthy, so if you don't like reading, feel free to skip to the TL;DR section. The gameplay itself is fantastic! I have not been immersed in a game like this since Portal 2, and I didn't think I would be able to compare to that again. Whether you are walking through a raging blizzard, looting a lookout on the top of a steep hill, or gutting a deer while wolves patrol the surrounding area, you'll pretty much be on the edge of your seat the entire time. It's most enjoyable when starting a new game and finding food, clothing, water, and so on. Many times you'll feel relief if you're on the verge of dehydration or nearly freezing to death, and you find that one thing you happen to need. It's so, so satisfying.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, it can and will get repetitive eventually. Right now, the only thing you can do is see how long you can survive. You WILL eventually run out of houses to loot, but that's not until many in-game days, which could take 20+ hours of gameplay, depending on your approach. So for early access, you still have a good bit of things to do.\n\nOne thing I also want to cover are the wolves. The wolves are the one major thing that cause players to rage, and is probably one of the more controversial things in the game. And there are times that I've seen where I just wish they weren't in the game. Occasionally I'll walk out of a house to see a wolf is in agro range, so I either have to go inside and wait it out for a long time, or just fight the wolf. That's always frustrating. When exiting a house you do not know if there will be a wolf on the other side or not, because the house and the actual outside world are different areas, thus they are seperated by loading screens. The wolves will also patrol an area that contains a lot of loot, much like zombies in DayZ. Now I'm one for challenges, but this can be annoying at times. They don't act anything like real life wolves, which is why this topic is controversial, but there is in fact a disclaimer at the beginning of the game saying that they know this is not how wolves act in real life! So remember that they aren't trying to replicate real life in The Long Dark.\n\nBut still, other than a couple times, the wolves for me have not been overly frustrating, and they really add to the suspense of the gameplay. Especially the infamous wolf Fluffy...but that's for you to find out.\n\nThe World - No, the world is not procedurally generated. It is created by hand, but is still good sized and will keep you busy exploring it for a while. You'll find cabins, trailers, a dangerous hydro dam, and even small fishing huts out on frozen lakes. It's very fun to explore all of these and to find so much loot, which will still inevitably run out. You'll also hike up hills, along snow covered paths, and so far really anything you might expect to find in the Canadian wilderness. Currently, as of this last revision, there are FIVE areas to explore, each with a "transition" zone, which can either be a mineshaft, railroad bridge, or a destroyed highway. If you ever plan on exploring all of these in their entirety, it will keep you busy for quite a while!\n\nSounds/Music - This game continues to be atmospheric by having awesome sound effects and music. Prying open a locker with a prybar or just opening containers/cabinets sound so realistic, it's just extremely impressive. The music will either make you feel accomplished for surviving another night or put you on the VERY EDGE of your seat. I wish I could find the music somewhere else to listen to because certain tracks play very rarely.\n\nAt one point in the game I was in a cabin and headed upstairs only to find a dead body. What seemed like the scariest music in the entire game played then. I was so sure that a wolf would come running up the stairs to attack me, even though they can't go into houses. The hair on the back of my neck was standing up. After it ended, I still didn't feel like moving. Even though nothing happened, it was amazing how freaked out I was because the right music played at the right time. GG Hinterland, almost died of a heart attack.\n\nStability - I've been really impressed as to how stable the game is. For early access, it's very rare you'll come across any bugs or crashes. Occasionally you will see graphical glitches, but they are minor and don't affect much.\n-TL;DR-\n\nThe Long Dark is a very immersive game, and, for early access, provides a good bit of gameplay. It will eventually get repetitive because the only thing you can do for now is see how long you can survive for, but it's so enjoyable to find cabins to loot, new areas to explore, and those suspenseful moments when dealing with wolves or BEARS.

It's got atmosphere. It's challenging. And the biggest threat to your survival isn't always as obvious as you might think. Most of the time I died in this game, it was because of poor preparation and getting lost in a blizzard while trying to find my way back to a shelter. It's a game where smart decisions and patience truly pay off, and I can't stress enough how much I love games like that.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels right now. ''Easy'' allows you to play simply for the atmosphere and wild animals won't attack you, which makes the whole experience more peaceful, if ridiculously easy. The ''Normal'' difficulty is not a walk in the park by any stretch of the imagination. Every day is a struggle against time and the elements to procure food, tools and equipment, and fuel for fires. In fact, it's so tough and gritty I haven't bothered to try the ''Hard'' difficulty yet. I assume you just die of dysentry or scurvy as soon as you start the game. :P\n\nThe game can get a bit boring when you're starting to build up a good supply of stuff. It can also get rather stressful in the early game when you're trying to avoid overly agressive wolves while fighting against the clock in mad sorties across the wilderness to ''maybe'' find that tool you desperately need. Despite that, The Long Dark is a promising game that has a lot to offer and will probably have a lot more to offer as it develops.","September 29, 2015","true","90.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Or at least that's what I imagine. Its been over a month since my plane went down, and the only people I've found are frozen corpses being picked over by the wolves. It seems the only thing I can do anymore to keep remotely sane and inspired to stay alive is to talk to myself during the long hours.  Oh, I had to put the spare wolf pet somewhere out of sight, I woke up in the middle of the night about two days ago to get a drink and about had a heart attack, the light filtering through the windows made it look like a wolf had crashed thru the window and gotten inside, I nearly wasted a round of my rifle ammo.\n\nThat's about the only positive thing I have to say today, I'm stuck in that little cabin off the beaten path. There's a snowstorm right now, my leg is bleeding profusely, I tore my hat to pieces in order to make a bandage, but I have the sinking suspicion that a bear's mouth isn't the most hygenic place in Canada. So yea, it's probably infected. I'll have to treat it when i get back to the gas station. Might be difficult walking thru the snow with a bum leg and no pants. ... Funny story behind that actually.\n\nI spent days hunting deer and drying their pelts in order to have some warm pants, and the bear ate them, and a bit of my leg as dessert.\n\nIt sounds so absurd to say it out loud... the bear ate my pants. Its like one of those things you learn to say in highschool spanish to make the teacher have a headache ...\n\nsomething something mis pantelones ...\n\n*a blood stain signs the final entry in a small journal laying next to a half naked corpse leaning in a corner of a little cabin off the beaten path.*\n\n--\n\nReally its a fun game where the experiences that kill you are just as fun to talk about as the experiences you survive. Hinterland is doing great with keeping the game coming along with updates and bugfixes. They have an amazing team that really is interested in player feedback.\n\nThe game has immense replay value, even in its unfinished alpha sandbox mode.\nGreat graphics that I can only describe as water color cell shading ... ish.\nI like that they're not trying to carbon copy other survival games.\n\nI've got nothing negative to say about the developers. Nothing negative to say about the game.\nHonestly I think everyone should play this game at least once.\n\nI guarantee the first time that you're ripped apart by wolves after barely surviving a blizzard after finally finding a box of crackers after panically searching houses for anything to eat will be 1000% times more enjoyable than experiencing those things in real life. ... at least, maybe like ... 1010% more enjoyable even.","July 9, 2015","true","68.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Today there are a lot of survival games but most popular are about monsters and zombies. Wait... what??? Zombies?? You serious? Is it realistic??? Here  - we don't have all that kind of stuff. Instead we see beautiful nature, unpredictable weather, angry wolfes who are in costant search of fresh meat... just as you in fact) 9/10 (because nothing is perfect)\nP.s. Piligrim, hm - just to check the picture of the game and maybe to explore the locations (but I prefer to do it while wolfes are chasing me)))\nVoyager - nice!  less food, faster waste of calories, angry habitants of the forest and bad weather dominates.\nStalker - yeeeeah, that's how we survive!

In the beginning challenging, afterwards still an enjoyable experience. Maybe wait for Story mode though, it was announced for spring 2016 but is delayed at the moment. And I do believe that this delay is for the right reasons.\n\nif 95% of early access games are a downer, this one is part of the 5% that know what EA is about.\nChallenging, atmospheric, tense, immersively beautiful, progression (at MINIMUM for the first 15 hours of gameplay on every run, and you wont get there with the first tries).\ndecent\nfair explorable area with a 4-5 maps.\ngood learning curve\n___________________________\n\nOviously there are some things which can still be balanced differently  but hey, during the first 15 hours or so you wont even notice.\nAnd there are also things which you might envision to be there which aren't implemented (atleast for now, they do a good job of adding stuff) but generally the game already offers a fair amount of choice and a decent amount of content.\nNow then, let's take a closer look:\n\nI have seen this game about a year ago. It hasn't had that many reviews back than and i had to make decisions. I had played a number of early access survival games back at that point and was generally disappointed in the genre as it didn't live up to my expectations. So i decided for another early access game which wasn't about survival and proved to be a perfect hit. I tried a couple more early access games but lost this one vastness of the steam store, while i turned more and more sour in my opinion towards early access, untill about 4 days ago. And I currently 40 hours in, I should get back to studying.\n\nWith all the heart that Hinterland is putting into this gem, The Long Dark feels cold, as cold as the land in which you are stranded. It's ruthless and death lurks about everywhere and everywhen. But after a day stalking and exploring your way from hut to hut (only applies to one map), running for your life, freezing half to death you finally take shelter. Dusk has already come and it is starting to get a lot colder. There, struggling to get a fire started, you hear your belly rumbling, your lips dry of dehydration. Finally you manage to light up a small fire. You melt some snow in the last light of the day and take a zip. You heat up your canned food just assuming that you wont have any meat yetand a feeling of gladness, relaxation sets in for a moment. Your struggles payed off. You are still alive. Alive but tired. And thus the moment passes. You go to bed to wake up to another day to explore the world. To gather what you need in order to be unbound from the luck of scavanging, to sustain yourself.\n\nAll in all i can only recomend this game. it is definitely worth the 19 € it is currently priced at and already feels like a solid game. But wait there is more! This game actually uses the alpha! I personally can't wait for story mode which is soon to come!\n\n9.5/10 from me\n\nCheers!\n\n\n","February 21","true","66.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So any other developers with early access games, take note of Hinterland Studios, they know what they're doing. This is how an early access game should be.\n\nThat being said, I was skeptical when buying this game because early access titles have a bad reputation for being abandoned by developers, or just having to wait far too long for the next update. Well not this one. For early access this game is amazing and immersive. The moment I started up the game and found my first cabin to loot, I knew I was going to be hooked. But let's just get to a list of everything, it's easier.\n\nGraphics - The graphics are very nice, and the game has a unique look, but in a good way. The first word that comes to mind when trying to describe the graphics is "cartoonish", but I feel like that doesn't do justice. You may just have to watch some videos or get the game and see for yourself, but it's really cool. I especially love the shadows and the way light comes in through windows when indoors. It really gives you the sense that everything is abandoned, and has a slightly creepy atmosphere, but can be inviting at other times. Or even when holding the lantern I am reminded of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, even though this isn't a horror game!\n\nOn Ultra graphics, the framerate is fantastic. I am always above 60 thanks to the recent update to Unity 5, which improved performance for everyone. Before it was still fine, but it has gotten so much better! In fact, there is a good chance you could play this on a low end PC, although I'm just speculating.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - Here's where it might get a bit lengthy, so if you don't like reading, feel free to skip to the TL;DR section. The gameplay itself is fantastic! I have not been immersed in a game like this since Portal 2, and I didn't think I would be able to compare to that again. Whether you are walking through a raging blizzard, looting a lookout on the top of a steep hill, or gutting a deer while wolves patrol the surrounding area, you'll pretty much be on the edge of your seat the entire time. It's most enjoyable when starting a new game and finding food, clothing, water, and so on. Many times you'll feel relief if you're on the verge of dehydration or nearly freezing to death, and you find that one thing you happen to need. It's so, so satisfying.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, it can and will get repetitive eventually. Right now, the only thing you can do is see how long you can survive. You WILL eventually run out of houses to loot, but that's not until many in-game days, which could take 20+ hours of gameplay, depending on your approach. So for early access, you still have a good bit of things to do.\n\nOne thing I also want to cover are the wolves. The wolves are the one major thing that cause players to rage, and is probably one of the more controversial things in the game. And there are times that I've seen where I just wish they weren't in the game. Occasionally I'll walk out of a house to see a wolf is in agro range, so I either have to go inside and wait it out for a long time, or just fight the wolf. That's always frustrating. When exiting a house you do not know if there will be a wolf on the other side or not, because the house and the actual outside world are different areas, thus they are seperated by loading screens. The wolves will also patrol an area that contains a lot of loot, much like zombies in DayZ. Now I'm one for challenges, but this can be annoying at times. They don't act anything like real life wolves, which is why this topic is controversial, but there is in fact a disclaimer at the beginning of the game saying that they know this is not how wolves act in real life! So remember that they aren't trying to replicate real life in The Long Dark.\n\nBut still, other than a couple times, the wolves for me have not been overly frustrating, and they really add to the suspense of the gameplay. Especially the infamous wolf Fluffy...but that's for you to find out.\n\nThe World - No, the world is not procedurally generated. It is created by hand, but is still good sized and will keep you busy exploring it for a while. You'll find cabins, trailers, a dangerous hydro dam, and even small fishing huts out on frozen lakes. It's very fun to explore all of these and to find so much loot, which will still inevitably run out. You'll also hike up hills, along snow covered paths, and so far really anything you might expect to find in the Canadian wilderness. Currently, as of this last revision, there are FIVE areas to explore, each with a "transition" zone, which can either be a mineshaft, railroad bridge, or a destroyed highway. If you ever plan on exploring all of these in their entirety, it will keep you busy for quite a while!\n\nSounds/Music - This game continues to be atmospheric by having awesome sound effects and music. Prying open a locker with a prybar or just opening containers/cabinets sound so realistic, it's just extremely impressive. The music will either make you feel accomplished for surviving another night or put you on the VERY EDGE of your seat. I wish I could find the music somewhere else to listen to because certain tracks play very rarely.\n\nAt one point in the game I was in a cabin and headed upstairs only to find a dead body. What seemed like the scariest music in the entire game played then. I was so sure that a wolf would come running up the stairs to attack me, even though they can't go into houses. The hair on the back of my neck was standing up. After it ended, I still didn't feel like moving. Even though nothing happened, it was amazing how freaked out I was because the right music played at the right time. GG Hinterland, almost died of a heart attack.\n\nStability - I've been really impressed as to how stable the game is. For early access, it's very rare you'll come across any bugs or crashes. Occasionally you will see graphical glitches, but they are minor and don't affect much.\n-TL;DR-\n\nThe Long Dark is a very immersive game, and, for early access, provides a good bit of gameplay. It will eventually get repetitive because the only thing you can do for now is see how long you can survive for, but it's so enjoyable to find cabins to loot, new areas to explore, and those suspenseful moments when dealing with wolves or BEARS. The world is good sized and will keep you busy for a while. The graphics are great and have a cool, unique look to it, and the lighting is also superb when indoors. Not to mention the sounds and music are amazing and make the game so much more atmospheric. The developers of the game also seem very dedicated and promise a story mode, more areas to explore, more wildlife, and so forth. If this game looks even slightly interesting to you, please try it out and give them your support! For early access, I'm giving this a solid 8/10.

The gameplay I managed to get out of it that wasn't clouded with lag and bugs was pretty decent, but not as realistic or challenging as I expected. I held off a hoard of cannibals with a tennis ball and a fireax. I previously downloaded the Long Dark. I haven't played much, but what I have played has ran very smoothly on my sucky HP notebook. Very challenging, and I can't seem to survive more than a couple of days at a time before freezing in my sleep or being mauled. I wasn't expecting much realism, but I entered the game and spent the first 10 minutes or so going through all the menus seeing the dozens of things I had to keep up with to avoid from meeting death. Very fun game, runs nicley on old PCs as far as I'm concerned, and once you finally do pick it up it's hard to put down. I wish I could have come into this game with no prior knowledge of it, as that would have made it much better. If you do want to download, don't look up much other than controls for an amazing experience. There are about a thousand different ways, and maybe a couple to survive.

The game has developed in an amazing way from 2014 and continues to do so. The game idea is a good one. No zombies, no mutants or any other creatures of nightmares. It is just you and your wits vs. mother nature. The graphics and visuals are amazing Hinterland have done a brilliant job with their expansions and improvements. The weather effects have improved so much I have to wear a shawl or jumper while playing because it makes me feel cold (My computer is near the radiator too!)\n\nI like that there is no tutorial and that the player is 'thown into the deep end' as it were, which I think adds to the experience.\n\nI have had no major problems with the game, the last minor one was fixed very quickly by update. Hinterland certainly knows what their doing. Although I can't wait for the game to come out finished I am prepared to wait for a game that could be well beyond our expectations when finished.\n\nI am looking forward to the updates hinterland have planned in the upcomming months, all of which look good. I hope that they add new regions to explore (A small town would be nice,I wonder if they could add candles and a way to make them?).\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!","April 7","true","178.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game itself is a unique, survival, atmospheric and at certain points somewhat horror-like type. I've never seen something like this before and also the cartoony graphics makes it even more interesting and unique, which is a big plus from me. I've recently heard that the developers are working hard on the Story Mode and it got me really excited. At first i wasnt really convinced about the game, the price was again a problem, of course I could have refunded it but still got me thinking wether it's a good choice or a complete waste of time and money until i've played it...it got me wanting to play even more and more, it's a great timekiller, always new stuff to do and endless possibilities.

This review is based on build v270 and roughly 240 hours of gameplay. At the time of writing this review, only the sandbox mode was available. A story mode which will feature a coherent story is scheduled for release in 2015.\n\nIt's a first person survival game set in a Canadian Winter wilderness after a geomagnetic disaster. All electric devices have ceased functioning, whether there are other survivors is unclear (NPCs have been announced for a future update). The player has to battle the adversities of cold, hunger, thirst, fatigue, wild animals and health issues, while exploring abandoned leftovers of civilization. No zombies, no arsenal of super-guns, no vehicles. Just the player against nature or, well, a model of nature.\n\nThe game pleases with superb art style and sound effects. Sunrise, sunset, starry night skies and the landscape in general are simply beautiful to behold and have been made to look a bit like oil paintings. Everything creates an atmosphere of beauty, but at the same time loneliness and urgency. The player needs to scavenge abandoned houses, cars, forestry lookouts, factories etc. to find means to survive as long as possible. And if you learn the mechanics of the world surrounding you, it is possible to survive for a very long time.\n\nThe developers keep up a steady pace of updating and honing the sandbox mode, also adding new regions from time to time (there are now 4 major regions, each with its own "feel"). They are super-friendly and give feedback to even the strangest comments from players. There is a dedicated community at the developers homepage (Hinterland Games) which is worth checking out.\n\nThis game is not for everyone - it does not take your hand. You have to explore it, and the higher difficulty modes may frustrate people not used to overcome obstacles with patience. But for me, only the sandbox mode is one of the best games I have ever played. And I have basically played almost all the landmark games since 1983. I can't believe I only payed 20  € for this gem.

I was wrong. I was VERY wrong. This game is exceptional. Beyond excpetional.\n\nI started a sandbox, picked my character, and named her Abbie. Abbie and I started in a lighthouse and from there we spent the better part of 13 hours exploring, scrounging supplues, and escaping the local wildlife. Eventually we found ourselfs at the Trapper's Cabin and I decided that this would make a great home for Abbie. We went in and were very surprised at all of the gear left behind, there was even a rifle to but all the bullets we found along the way to use. Abbie and I then went about gathering firewood, hunting deer and bunnies, and making foraging trips for better clothes from the Mystery Lake.\n\nOn the 10th day, We were about gathering firewood and a bunny passed by, so Abbie equiped her bow and we started chasing that little bunny down. After a few minutes and many misses, we finally managed to hit that little rabbit and moved in to harvest it. Little did we know that there was a bear right around the rock the rabbit had died at. So Abbie quickly equipped the hunting rifle and took a shot, but it was too late the bear was upon her. She fought as hard as she could but the damage was done. Even though the bear had left her alive, we were far from home with no healing items to speak of. This was Abbie's last moments. We tried to stumble home but she collapsed in the snow dead.\n\nNever have a felt such heartbreak at losing a character. All the work that we had put into trying to build a home was all for naught. The fact that I had connected so much with a character who I never even saw the face of just shows how amazing this game is.

But this game changed that.\n\nIf you like survival games, this one seems to be the pinnacle. I've never before played a survival game that is as much fun or tense. Lemme give you a recount of my first three games.\n\nGame 1: Woke up in the middle of the night, in a blizzard. I had no idea where to go and began freezing fast. I realized I had a flare and popped it as quick as I could. I began to run through the woods. As I reached the end of my rope, I saw a small cottage in the distance and I ran for it as quick as I could. I made my way inside and found some food. I waited a day or so until I ran out of food then ventured outside once more....\n...\nand directly into the jaws of a wolf. I died, due to lack of food and preparation. I nearly ♥♥♥♥ myself when the wolf jumped on me.\n\nGame 2: Woke up during the day, afternoon I believe. The weather was relatively peaceful, and I managed to find a group of houses. I picked them apart then chose one for my own uses. Upon slightly stocking it over the course of a few days, I ended up making a fatal mistake by leaving to go exploring. A blizzard hit, and I couldn't find my way back in time before I froze to death.\n\nGame 3: By far my most successful one. Woke up around 9 am. I ventured from mystery lake to coastal highway along a set of railroad tracks. When I reached coastal highway I fell off of a cliff and ended up spraining my ankle. I hobbled along until I heard wolves behind me. I moved as quick as I could and at last spotted a cabin. I stayed there for a day, resting my ankle until it was functional once more. I began exploring a series of fishing villages, plundering what I could from the worn down houses. I found a gas station and began stockpiling it. A week passed in game, I had a good thing going.\n\nAnd then those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wolves moved in. I don't know if there is a pack tendency, or if they are randomly placed, or if they aren't supposed to move from one zone to another. But suddenly I had four wolves scratching at my door. I had found a rifle, but only had three bullets. I knew flares would scare them off, but not for good. But then I realized that they were taking down deer in the area. Then I formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with them. I wouldn't kill them and they killed deer, soon after which I'd go and carve the carcass up. I began stockpiling more food, and more, until I had a hefty amount. Day eleven rolled by, and I decided that I wanted to check out some of those ice fishing shacks I had spotted on the horizon. I geared up and made my way out to one.\n\nSo begins my fatal mistake.\n\nI arrived at one and was relatively unharmed for a day. Then a wolf happened by. I had one bullet left, at this point, and I used it on the wolf, figuring it was the only one. Not the case. Three more soon arrived, huddling around the ice fishing shack. I knew that I was on borrowed time by this point. I spent three nights holed up in that shack, (earning the achievement for spending three nights outdoors), then made my peace with whatever God is out there, and I stepped outside. The moment I did, I was pounced and killed. Surviving an epic 15 days and 7 hours.\n\nIt was amazing.\n\nPros\nGood survival aspects such as calorie count, which drains as you preform heavy tasks such as harvesting wood, skinning animals, running, etc., and a tempurature gauge (including windchill!) to help you monitor how much body heat you have.\nThe game feels balanced enough (for an early access game, no less) that you don't feel helped along by the mechanics, but they are fair enough to where you can, if you're smart, find or steal enough food for yourself to survive. That's what it boils down to in the end, food.\nWeather effects are amazing, and there's something to be said for being trapped in a building for three days because there is a blizzard outside.\nThe game is beautiful, it reminds me somewhat of The Telltale games. It has a sort of handpainted, almost comic book look to it.\nThe sound design is fairly well done. Wind whips around buildings and wolves howl in the distance. At night it's peaceful, houses settle as you're in them. The sound design further helps the idea that you are indeed, very much alone in this world.\nA minor crafting system is implemented, meaning that it should expand further in the upcoming months.\nThe dev community seems very into the game and seems to be actively working on it.\nCons\nIt is in early access, so the game is not completed, first off.\nSome bugs.\nOccasionally you'll be spawned somewhere, in the middle of the night, in a blizzard, with no way to survive.\nAnimal behavior is erratic and, sometimes, downright weird. Though I imagine that'll be improved with time.\nVery small area to explore once you've done it.I am aware that this is early access, and I don't begrudge the game for it. At the end of the day it is an amazing early access game, and one that I would wholeheartedly tell everyone to support. It has an enormous amount of potential, and I would love to see this game be taken further.\n\ntl;dr: Great survival game, still in early access, buy it anyway.\n\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","13.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Everything from the graphics to the game mechanics contribute towards the game's unique atmosphere and mood. Honestly, I would pay 60 bucks to get this game in its final state. It inhabits a frightening, lonely, and unforgiving wilderness and forces you to make life and death decisions, take risks, and face your doom countless times in any given playthrough. Surviving and succeeding is difficult but feels extremely rewarding. The maps are large and diverse, offering room for nomadic play styles and more settling playing styles. There are too many good things to write in this review, so just play the game to find out.\n\nIt is not without flaws, however. At its current state, it is lacking in some content, although I am confident that the addition of story mode (and hopefully co-op at some point maybe?) will fill in that gap. Sometimes, however, the games mostly successful "realism", ends up being a little bit too realistic. Wolves are a bit too aggressive, they should be more territorial and defensive. The hunger mechanics are a bit ridicoulous at times (aka I shouldn't be eating 2 deer, 3 fish, and 2 cans of beans a day...) The coastline highway map lacks workbenches and some much needed fireplaces (Why are their stoves in little fishing huts but not most of the houses?), and there is a very strange lack of roads in the mystery lake map.\n\nOverall, the game is an 8.5/10 for me, and thats in its early stages. Definitely buy this one\n","December 26, 2014","true","65.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Wolves and the freezing cold weather will be your main enemies, and they will not be easy to take on all alone, but that is what makes this a strong survival experience.

My 130+ hours of playtime show that it's a game that I managed to stick with - and the developers have not only met, but exceeded my every expectation so far. The game is still only sandbox at this point, but now has many regions, added wildlife, a crazy amount of added items, crafting and so much more. With story mode on the horizon, expect an updated-update-review in the future. This has now become one of my most played steam games, and is an example of early access done right. Slow and steady, with constant communication and updates.\n\nEven still in early access, the sandbox represents one of the most immersive, realistic and FUN single player survival games available.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW, WRITTEN SEPTEMBER 2014\n\nThis game is early access and has little content to it right now. At the time of writing this, it has but one static map. The starting point and the loot that you can find is RNG, but from a small pool of locations and a small pool of items, survival is really not that difficult once you've had a few trial and errors.\n\nThis game needs a lot of things. It needs more content, more maps, more items, more animals, it needs more realism and more balancing - but the foundation is absolutely rock solid.\n\nI don't usually like commenting on early access games, but in this case I'm recommending it for one main reason - I played 13 hours without even realising. I survived over 20 days (on my 4th playthrough) before I had to quit (I didn't die). It didn't feel like 13 hours. It felt like one or two. It is immersive, it is addictive, it has genuine atmopshere and had a weird combination of both being relaxing and gripping at the same time. I don't know how trudging through the snow for an hour became both challenging and fun - but it did!\n\nI also love the art style, the brief voiceovers and the very brief music on top of being one of the most bug free beta-games I've ever played. I think it's worth supporting these developers.\n\nOf all the early access games I've taken a risk on, I think this one has the most potential if the developers can stick with it. From the updates and forum interaction so far, I'm very hopeful.\n\nEven if you're not interesting in backing games in early access - keep an eye on this one for the future.","September 30, 2014","true","135.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Currently The Long Dark has 93% good reviews.\nThe game is in EARLY ACCESS which means a work in progress. Read the devs description below:\n\n\n"Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.\nNote: This Early Access game may or may not change significantly over the course of development. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you may want to wait until the game progresses further in development.\n“***THE SANDBOX IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF IMPROVEMENT, AND IT ISN'T FINISHED. BUYING THE LONG DARK ON EARLY ACCESS SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THE GAME.*** While the game is already very stable and highly playable, the Sandbox is constantly evolving. Features and balance tuning may change from version to version. Content will be added, some may be removed, and entire systems might change or disappear. We appreciate your patience as we go through this process of evolving the game with community feedback.\nWe'd like to expose the Sandbox portion of the game to as wide an audience as possible so that we can derive maximum playtesting value before we launch the game "for real".\n\nand from steam:\n\n"What is Early Access?\n\nGet immediate access to games that are being developed with the community's involvement. These are games that evolve as you play them, as you give feedback, and as the developers update and add content."\n\n\nAlso to the whiners "ohh i spent $20 bucks and there is not much to do" or "the world is small"  again the devs have addressed this on the main page as below:\n\n“The full game will offer both the Sandbox and Story modes -- i.e. the Story mode will be entirely new narrative content that lives within the Survival Sandbox. The Sandbox will also offer more content at full launch. If you buy the game on Early Access now, you will immediately get the Sandbox Mode, and will also get the Story Mode once it launches (final # of episodes to be determined).”\n\nSo for those thinking about buying the game do it. It is a work in progress but has huge potential. It looks and feels amazing. Look at all the positive reviews and all those people that have had a great experience playing this game even though the devs are months away from a full game.\n\nThis game has given me shivers and made me jump so many times.","September 24, 2014","true","70.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Great fun to be had being frustrated and desperate anyone could ever hope for as a survivorlist. If you're into surviving under harsh conditions, this is a must buy. The price will only go up. Being early access, I was surprised to not come across any bugs or glitches yet- only limited game modes. (ie story isn't ready yet, but there's two sandbox maps) Awesome break from the survival horror tropes. Feel tension build in your gut as your pushing up a hill into the icy wind and you see a cabin in the distance...just 200 meters away...your teeth are chattering and you're freezing to death.

I have NEVER played a more atmospheric survival game. The immersion factor of the world is unbelievable, and being in it not only has you on the lookout for its more wild inhabitants, but also has you looking for dangers like hunger, thirst, exhaustion and the weather itself. Speaking of weather, the game beautifully displays the changing of its many dynamic conditions available. These conditions, whether it be snow, fog or the powerful wind whistling in your ears as you trudge through the world, all convey the sense that it IS a fight for survival, and you'll need to do everything you can to win.\n\nIn its current alpha state, the game is VERY good. Although some systems need refinining, some optimization issues are present, and some more stuff needs to be added to make it a complete package, the game is still VERY fun and worth a buy for anyone looking for a game that will make you consider every possible decision, regret every time your fire goes out, and make you dread every howl you hear at night.\n\nThis was only on my first run, so if I come across anything else worth noting soon or in future updates, I will update my review.\n\nEDIT 1: So, I've put a lot more time into it. As I've played there are some more notable things I haven't talked about yet, and my opinions on what could make the game even better.\n\nThe systems. There are systems in this game you'd struggle to find in a modern AAA games, such as the different things affecting your ability to buld a fire, the amount of calories you have in your system, and the likeliness you'll be able to succeed in crafting (although this feature is rather undercooked at the moment. When you're cold, you can't do things effectively. When you're tired, good luck carrying all the gear you picked up. Hungry? Better check how old that venison is or else you might succumb to food poisoning. Things like these make the systems in the game feel fleshed out and more realistic, for lack of a better word, than other survival games on the market.\n\nNow, as much as I sound like I have no problem with this game (though the features that are currently present DO undermine any problems I have) there are some cons to the game, and ways to make them better.\n\n1. Map size- The map is not as big as I would have originally hoped. Now, I know this is only the first  map of many, but I had memorized the layout by my third life (which was very short). After you've memorized it, the exploration factor which I loved in my first couple hours started to fade.\n\n2. Combat and item use- Combat in The Long Dark revolves either around taking your foe out at long-range with a rare hunting rifle, or letting them jump on you and hopefully building up you attack power, and punching them off this way. I feel there should be a way to use a hunting knife or hatchet during a close quarters situation to be able to kill a wolf. I know, in real life you probably wouldn't be able to react this way when a wolf starts chasing you, but it gives players with low health and other status effects, i.e. starvation, exhaustion or a sprained ankle, a chance to survive a wolf attack instead of running away. And it doesn't have to be easy, just something players can do for a last chance.\n\n3.  Inventory- Lastly, inventory can sometimes be a pain to manage. Although it gives you a feeling you need to take what you truly need to survive, I sometimes wish you had more of a carrying capacity, or maybe it could fluctuate depending on your condition. The capacity DOES however change based on what status you're at, but the change is only made between when you're exhausted and when you aren't.\n\nThese things will change, I know, because it's still in Alpha. For the content you get right now, the game is still worth every cent you throw at it, and I'd highly recommend it in it's current state.","September 22, 2014","true","11.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The way the gameplay and the atmosphere feels simply amazing. The game design concept is simular to Shelter with it's lovely art. It feels so realistic walking around in the world explorning, searching for supplies and watching out for wolfs. Even though this isen't a horror game it still feels so scary (thanks to the atmosphere) that you're ready for anything. And I love this game because there are NO zombies in it (seriously guys, there are way to many of them already) only cold, wolfs and starving. And the Developers are constantly updating the game to both improve it and to add new things. And this is only Early access, the story mode isen't available (which will be when the full game is released) and yet there are so many things to do, to explore. This is my favorite survival game by far. And I've played loads of them. The Forrest, DayZ, Don't Starve, Shelter, pretty much all of them.\n\n\n\nPro's\n\n-Huge amount of detail has been put into the game, level design and art.\n-Huge map to explore (three regions)\n-Pure survival, no zombies or unnatural creatures\n-Crazy amount of items, food, clothes, craft items, weponds, tools, etc.\n\nCon's\n\n-Can become a bit boring when you find yourself a food and water supply on day 1 and then you basically don't have to move your ♥♥♥♥ for a very long time.\n\nI give this game 8/10 for it's lovely design, gameplay and atmosphere.","February 26, 2015","true","51.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I've only played TLD about 4 hours at this point. I had to quit out of my 3rd playthrough, in which I have been alive for about 3 days, in order to go to sleep (in real life). However, I didn't want to do this. In fact, I really wanted to keep playing... scavenging... scraping by...... surviving.\n\nThis is the magic of The Long Dark.\n\nI was hesitant to make the initial purchase, but I went with my gut and I have not since, in any way, shape, or form regretted doing so. This game is unforgiving, ruthless, and requires constant thinking and moving - or you die. And die you will. But this, however pointless as it sounds, is what makes the sandbox mode (the only mode available for the early access) so damn appealing. Each time you start over, you begin to pick up on things you didn't previously. You learn how to manage your resources better, how to assess and prioritize which needs should be met, and all the while you watch the clock and count the hours that go by with intensity and hope, however small that hope is - to live just a bit longer... to hold on, to find a way.\n\nThe Long Dark is absolutely amazing and simply downright a blast to play. I can honestly say that it has me excited and hooked already. I'm looking forward to the Story mode, but for the time being will be completely satisfied with hammering away at the Sandbox.\n\nAs of this moment I'd probably give TLD an 8/10.

It has no zombies, no machine guns, no multiplayer (yet). You are left alone in the cold, fighting mother nature.

You take on a first person perspective of someone dropped into a frozen wasteland after a plane crash.  I've had three or four run throughs (all but one on the Mystery Lake sandbox). The first one was just a feel out, then I restarted with a good sense of the controls and when traveling was a good investment. My first two deaths in this game were both freezing to death, and I felt like I deserved those deaths as I ran out of food and had to go out to search for more resources. Fun, gritty, atmospheric. I was ready to be addicted to this game.\n\nThe whole time during the early playthroughs, I had noticed wolves, and my thoughts were always, "Man, there are a lot of those." I always managed to keep my distance and keep an eye on them, so they never got to me. But I never enjoyed wolf encounters much. It took the game from a thoughtful, atmospheric survival game with lots of satisfying resource management and time for reflection to a Liam Neeson "The Grey" action game that takes me out of the world and makes me desperate to avoid something akin to a jump scare, since it is for all intensive purposes impossible to win a wolf struggle with any consistency.\n\nIn the most recent runthrough, a wolf in the dam on Mystery Lake actually did jump-scare me. I was followed by two wolves into the dam, and without a sound or sight of this other wolf, it jumped on top of me and destroyed me.\n\nI actually liked how panicked the struggle made me feel, fighting for survival. But based on what I've seen in game and what I read on the forums, wolf encounters are far too frequent, and the struggles far too frustrating to be a major game mechanic. They destroy any resources the player has accumulated, make skill improvements become meaningless, and are a complete buzzkill for the morbid majesty this survival game otherwise does so well.\n\nIndeed, that is my biggest complaint: the wolves seem to remove the player from the measured, thoughtful, immersive scrape for survival and make the game lose some of that novel "the elements are slowing killing me" feeling.\n\nMaybe my vision for the game differs from that of the developers, and they do want that higher stress, more action packed, more sudden deathy atmosphere that the wolves provide. But if that is the vision, they will lose the following of me and hundreds of others on the forums.\n\nIf their vision is mine of survival as long as you can on your wits and abilities in a quiet wasteland, then I recommend they change wolves entirely. Far fewer, maybe 2 or 3 total on the sandbox maps. They only attack you if they are desperate and you are weak. The wolf struggles add just a little bit of excitement to the game, and so should be present in just a small dose.\n\nI recognize this game is in alpha at the time of this review, and wolf balancing is a major issue on Hinterland’s plate. I will continue to watch it and play it, though if wolves or other wildlife attacks become the “main enemy” of the game, then it will lose my support moving forward.\n\nOtherwise, the game is excellent. The mechanics of hunger, exhaustion, thirst, and cold all work pretty well, and are improving as the game develops. The atmosphere and art are taking an excellent direction, the crafting system shows a lot of promise, and the coastal highway map shows the developers will be able to include multiple compelling locations with different survival challenges in each.\n\nIt should consume a few hours of your life, and if the wolves come under control, it may just be the next addictive hit on Steam.\n\n","December 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I loved the way the lighting seemed to work with the stark contrast between the whites and browns of nature and the reds and chestnuts of man man objects.  There is no denying the game is absolutely gorgeous, and it succeeds in making you want to kick down your front door and go exploring.\n\nHowever, you had better pray that you can find a hammer and nails to reattach that door before the sun goes down.  The beauty of The Long Dark is also it's most dangerous aspect.  It's easy to get lost in the wonderful landscape that Hinterland Games has crafted, but underneath a black night sky with plummeting temperatures it is only a siren's song.  Wolves will stalk your trail, seemingly alert to your deteriorating condition.  Sometimes, the only way you will know their presence is through their foreboding howls, following you as you desperately seek shelter from the freezing cold and brutal wind.\n\nEating food, staying hydrated, rested and warm are essential to survival in The Long Dark.  You will find supplies like candy bars, pork & beans, beef jerky and military food packets to help you stay alive.  The attention to detail is delightful even if it stands in the way of your best case scenario for living another day.  Canned food requires a can opener to access, unless you want to smash it open and risk losing some of the food.  Your character will make remarks when he/she is hungry, thirsty, cold or tired and you would do well to take care of these ailments before they start affecting your condition.  When your condition meter reaches 0%, you will finally succumb to the Terrible Outdoors.  The Long Dark will give you stats on how long you managed to survive and what you died of before sending you back to the main menu.\n\nThe alpha version of the game features a Survival sandbox, with a story about a Geomagnetic disaster coming later with the full game release.  For now, purchasing the Early Access version helps the studio identify and fix issues with the game, and helps them fund the overall project through release.\n\nIf you love open world games with gorgeous visuals, unique gameplay, and you have the desire to see how long you would survive in the middle of nowhere with limited supplies;  The Long Dark is for you.","September 22, 2014","true","2.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Yup, 4 kata itu merupakan kata kunci. The Long Dark merupakan game yang mengetes bagaimana kemampuan survival lo ditanah dingin Amerika bagian utara. Suhunya bahkan bisa mencapai -20 derajat celcius. Kalau lo suka game bertemakan survival, mungkin sebaiknya lo baca dulu review ini baru beli.\n\nReview ini gue tulis berdasarkan early access dan 5 jam gameplay.\n\nScore total = 7 dari 10\nStoryline:Gak ada. Katanya sih nanti bakalan dikembangkan lagi. Maklum namanya juga masih early access.\n\nGrafik:Standart 3D cartoon. Kalau lo liat screenshot yang ada di steam store, mungkin lo takjub dengan berbagai macam scenery nya. Tapi perlu di ingat, itu merupakan scenery lho. Kalau lo terjun langsung kedalam game, lo MEMANG bakalan melihat scenery seperti itu, tapiiiii.... kalau lo liat objek yang ada disekitar lo, lo bakalan sadar bahwa tekstur dari objek disekitar lo bertekstur kartun. Bisa dibilang low budget The Walking Dead Telltale. Nah, animasi yang ditawarkan juga sederhana... kebanyakan yang bakalan lo lihat adalah panel loading loading progress.. pas makan, lo gak akan melihat karakter lo memasukan makanan ke mulutnya, tapi panel loading progress. Mau minum? loading progress. Mau menyalakan api? loading progress. Mau looting? loading progress. Mau crafting? Loading progress. Emang sih terkesan simple tapi kalau hampir setiap action yang kita lakukan adalah loading progress, rada bete juga kan? Kalau lo gak masalah dengan loading progress, its okay. for me, its kinda big deal. Walau pun begitu, lo bakalan merasakan pengalaman yang cukup real. Badai saljunya itu bener bener DINGIN banget. Lo kerasa deh bagaimana angin berhembus dengan cepat dan jarak pandang lo berkurang akibat kabut. Serius. Gue hampir aja mati ditengah badai salju. Gue mencari rumah untuk berteduh dibawah derasnya badai salju. Nyawa gue udah 50%. Akhirnya gue duduk dibawah batu besar berharap badainya berhenti. Tapi karena nyawa gue udah turun drastis, gue nekat! Eh gak nyampe 20 detik, ternyata disebelah gue persis ada rumah. PERSIS lho. Badainya bener bener top banget.\n\nSounds:Salah satu aspek paling keren di game ini. Suaranya bener bener ngebuat lo kerasa banget dinginnya. Badai, salju, jejak kaki, binatang liar, kayu yang terbakar, kabin yang ditiup angin kencang, semuanya itu bener bener keren dikuping gue.\n\nGameplay:Survival, looting, and crafting. Yup, ini bumbu manis banget untuk para gamers di tahun 2013 keatas. Seperti yang lo tau, ini game bertemakan survival ditengah wilayah salju yang liar. Spoiler alert: Lo pasti mati. Yup, ini adalah tipikal game yang gak bisa dimenangkan. Game ini hanya mengetes seberapa lama lo bertahan dipadang salju yang liar. Kalau lo udah gak tertarik, lo bisa berhenti membaca review ini disini. Nah, untuk looting, didalam game ini lo musti mencari berbagai macam kebutuhan dasar hidup dikabin kabin peninggalan penduduk sebelumnya. Lo musti mencari makanan, minuman, baju, tool, dan fuel. Yup secara keseluruhan itu tadi adalah kebutuhan lo didalam game ini. makanan, minuman, baju, dan tool udah jelas yah. Nah fuel ini penting karena mau gak mau lo bakalan kedinginan dan satu satunya cara supaya gak kedinginan adalah lo musti bisa menyalakan api. disini, api gak cuman buat menghangatkan badan aja tapi juga untuk memasak daging mentah. sip, selain looting, lo musti juga pintar pintar crafting. sejauh ini nih, masih sedikit banget item yang bisa lo crafting. bahkan ya, gue udah bisa menebak end game nya seperti apa: sepatu rusa, sarung tangan rabit, dan jaket bulu serigala. Oh lo bakalan mati kehausan. trust me, you will be dehydrated.\n\n\nKesimpulan:Yup, game ini masih early access. Secara masih banyak banget animasi yang bisa dikembangkan tapi malah dibuat panel loading progress dan item yang bisa dicrafting nya juga sedikit banget. Tambah lagi gak ada storyline dan fakta bahwa lo pasti mati itu yang membuat usaha lo dalam survival rasanya jadi sia sia.\n\n\nthank udah membaca review ini, jangan lupa tekan thumbsup yaa~","January 7, 2015","true","16.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UsernameObjects/recommended/305620/","UsernameObjects","Surprise Reformation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UsernameObjects/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWow. This game looks incredible. I've always been interested in getting a survival game, but I never liked how most of them involved gratuitous zombies. If I wanted to shoot zombies, I'd play Left 4 Dead. I just want to survive in a survival game.\n\nThis title, however, is just about surviving the harsh life in the frozen north (the devs have hinted they may add other "survivors" of whatever catastrophe sent your character northwards, and that they may not be friendly, but they're not zombies)\n\nThe gameplay is currently only the sandbox mode, with no narrative or guide whatsoever, and just one map so far (though they have more planned). They drop you in, and its up to you to figure out how the ♥♥♥♥ you are going to stay alive. Make no mistake, that's no easy feat. You have to manage a number of different variables, including body heat, windchill, hunger and thirst, exhaustion, wounds and disease, and hostile wildlife. Neglect any of these and they can kill you faster than you can sneeze.\n\nIn order to get firewood and harvest meat, you need a hatchet. To get that you need to venture to the clearcut lookout, but there are wolves in that area, and you can't go there without a firearm. To get one you can go to the trapper's homestead, but will you survive long enough to reach that place? These are the kind of questions and dilemmas you need to answer in order to survive. It's hard to start off: in 3/4 of my attempts I die within three days, but when I do survive for longer, the victory is sweeter than honey.\n\nIts onyl early access, but that means we can help shape the game as it develops. If you are remotely a fan of survival games, purchase this title immediately!","September 24, 2014","true","81.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've never felt more vulnerable and alone in a game, than here. The Canadian wilderness is beautifully realized, and the atmospheric effects of the environment pull you in so effectively, you'd swear you were really lost in the barrens. Scavenging for supplies is at times both stressful and rewarding, and the threat of wild wolves lurking around the corner keeps you on your toes. Though that's not your only enemy, as the weather can change from sunny and clear, to blizzard conditions with no visibility. Haunting and moody, this game has the potential to be one of the best gameplay experiences in a very long time, and I know it was money well spent for me.

The TL;DR is at the bottom, if anybody's interested.\n\nFirst off, let me say that "The Long Dark" is one of the truest survival games to be produced in the year of 2014. Everything in the game is out to get you: the elements, the water, the wolves, sickness, hunger, dehydration, and fatigue, just to name a few. The game does a fantastic job proving how frail the human body is when exposed to these hardships, as well. One cannot go on a murderous rampage of kniving wolves and deer. One cannot travel miles in a blizzard. One cannot carry a rifle, six jackets, enough medical supplies to aid a hospital, and enough food to make people think you robbed a grocer. If one wants to survive, one must avoid wolves, travel light, and travel prepared. One wrong step and it could be one's last.\n\nThe graphics are quite simple, yet unique for modern games. It's hard to describe, but it borders cartoon-y, in a sense. Finding a human corpse will reward you with a flat-faced man with hands lacking fingers, but it somehow does the game justice of displaying a bleak wilderness that is inhospitable.\n\nThe gameplay is perfect, in such few words. Every day, one has to question oneself, "What do I need to do today?" One needs wood for a fire to stay warm, food and water to stay alive, clothes to stay warm while outside, medication to keep you alive when you're hurt, but one can only do so much per day. These needs will always keep one questioning if what one grabbed from that cabin was the right thing for tonight, or if one dodged that wolf on the railroads, will it have tracked them back to their camp? Every so often, these primal thoughts of food, water, and safety will even have the player making basic statements of "Need water" or cursing a wolf's presence. The game also praises (read: demands) players for taking risks and venturing away from one's safe camp to search abandoned vehicles and houses for more supplies, but remember: too much risk and one might run into a LOT of trouble.\n\nSome of the upcoming features include a story mode involving a Canadian bushman pilot who goes down after the freak electromagnetic surge which causes the events of "The Long Dark" to unfold, AI (and possibly human) survivor interation (which, as far as AI goes, has been teased that some AI are friendly, some are hostile, and some will pretend to be friendly to steal your supplies), and more undisclosed content that has yet to be revealed. After all, this is Early Access.\n\nAlso, as a final note, the dev team is a new face on the development playing field, but they are certainly not green. With voice actors such as Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale, David Hayer, and Elias Toufexis providing their talents to the game's characters and devs including people who have worked on "TES: Morrowind", "League of Legends", "God of War", "Far Cry 3", and "Mass Effect". With such a team, not only will a quality game come out of "The Long Dark", but it will definitely be developed by a reputable team.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n"The Long Dark" is a diamond in the rough amongst all the other survival games of 2014 that is being headed by a great dev team. I would definitely recommend it for everybody masochist out there who wants more challenges.","January 4, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Once you’ve played enough to memorize the maps the gameplay can become stale, though the introduction of a story mode in the final release hopefully will change that.\n\nThe items needed for survival are generated through the map randomly which spices up the gameplay, but I wish there were more enterable buildings and shelters. Maybe more will be introduced in the coming updates.\n\nEnding on a very favorable note, the developers are transparent and really make you feel like you’re being heard. There is no radio silence like some early access games.\n\n\nOverall, The Long Dark is a favorable experience and worth a buy.

I like this feeling, the sound effects, the half light, the breathing animations in cold air. It's great.\n\nBut... I found certain things to be illogical and against the sense of realism I was expecting to feel:\n\n1. Clothes need to last longer and be added in layers, it is what you would do and they wouldn't fall apart in a few days\n2. I understand water has to be boiled to make it safe (assuming some chance of contamination as this a "post apocolytic world", but it shouldn't take hours to melt then boil the snow because it simply does not in reality - too ridiculous, especially when your fire has only 1hr burning time. It can take half a day to boil a few gallons.\n3. All tools such as crowbars, hatchets, knives etc need to be usable in self defence (wolves...) as well as for "harvesting useful items". They should also wear out more realistically. No axe maker in the world would remain in business if their axes only lasted a few days or weeks.  Making the game hard by doing this and removing realism doesn't make it fun long-term, think retention.\n4. Should be easier to collect wood, it's everywhere, via using the tools as mentioned above, be easier to go out and collect diamonds than wood in those forests, peesh.\n5. Food should last longer if prepared/sealed, it isn't the tropics, it would last a long time. Even frozen animals would.\n6. Map should auto generate as if slowly drawing one through discovery, be a nice touch\n7. If you don't happen upon a rifle you are defenceless against wolves even if you are carrying knives, crowbars etc, this is totally unrealistic.\n\nI sprained an ankle somehow, it was the death of me, that did feel realistic in that I couldn't move fast enough to gather supplies to feed myself, but the above issues take away a lot of the fun for me right now.\n\nFix the above and I'd be hooked, I remain keen :)\n","September 24, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In my 2 hours of gameplay at time of writing I've died twice and been attacked by wolves 4 times. Yet I've enjoyed every minute so far, and it really feels like I've played for much much longer.\n\nThe mechanics are rather simple, and therein lies the games strength. Keep yourself rested,warm,fed,watered & out of trouble to survive, everything you do burns calories, so make sure you have enough to stay fit.\n\nThe world is stunningly realised and if wandering around aimlessly wasn't so fatal, I could spend a long time exploring the initial map the sandbox mode currently has available.\n\nTime for a few minor gripes. Whilst you do need a lot of calories to survive in the cold (approx 6000-8000 a day) the game does burn through a considerable amount more than that. I checked when indoors, with a 'feels like' temperature of 19C (i.e. typical room temperature) with all my winter gear on, I was burning 200+ cal per hour, so almost the expected cold requirement, only at room temp. Whilst increasing this value for gameplay reasons is understandable, I have basically spent my entire play time so far both hungry and eating almost constantly.\n\nMy only other gripe is the wolves, and the systems designed to combat them. There are a lot of wolves, and they are very aggressive (pretty much attack on sight) and can be warded off with flares. But if they attack you, the only course of action is to frantically punch them, which can get slightly silly if you have a knife on your character.\n\nWrapping it up, overall an enjoyable, robust experience (especially for early access) that could do with a few minor balancing changes to avoid having to eat near constantly just to prevent your hunger level getting worse. Also as it's in the trailer it's not much of a spoiler, yes there is a wolf in the dam, his name his Fluffy, and he respawns.","September 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The scenary is just one of the most beautiful thing I've seen in a game before.

All in all I'm not a real big PC gamer but this game always keeps me on the edge of my seat.

It extended from Canada to Mexico over the Continental Divide, unsupported.  We started in Banff, Canada and rode out from there where we were left to our own wits and survival.  Everything I had for the next month was on my bike and that's how I lived.\n\nThe Long Dark, while you're not on a bike, is a bit like the race.  You're constantly wondering if you have enough food, enough water, was there a predator lurking about (not wolves, we had to worry about Grizzlies).  In the game, you do this, you figure stuff out and it's fun... depressing, but fun.\n\nThis is the first game I'm actively avoiding all videos, how-to's and spoilers because I want to figure it out on my own, take my time and enjoy it.  The artistic beauty, grim deaths and isolated gameplay really throw me back in the Tour Divide pushing my bike up the side of a mountain in the middle of the night, alone and freezing.\n\nAs a casual gamer who lightly plays games, I cannot recommend this enough.  I feel drawn in and "cold" when I play it and it's a haunting comfort to hop in and play.\n\nIt does come with a few snags and that's mainly performance on my Macbook Air.  It gets a little sluggish in fullscreen but runs fine in a smaller window.  I don't mind.\n\n(Also if you're interested, I wrote a book about the Tour Divide race which has some similarities to The Long Dark.

(Which I backed)\nI had pretty high hopes for this game and it showed great potential.\n\nAs many other reviewers pointed out, when this game first released into Early Access it was almost unplayable. You froze within minutes of starting, or you died of hunger within minutes of starting, or you ran out of calories within minutes of starting, or you died of thirst within minutes of starting or you get killed by a wolf within seconds of starting. Yes, seconds. Once a wolf had you in sights, you might as well restart because there was no escaping or surviving. If you managed to somehow survive a wolf attack, you would quickly die of infection or bleeding out. Why in the hell can't you use your hatchet or hunting knife or rifle to kill it when it attacks you?!? Cooking the food did no good. You still got food poisoning even after cooking the food. RIDICULOUS! Sitting ONE inch away from a BURNING FIRE didn't even help warm you up a single degree, even while you're using one of the pits inside the house. How does a fire in a house not warm you up past 40 degrees?!? Especially when you're basically standing INSIDE the damn fire.\n\nBut since the latest update, they have addressed ALMOST ALL OF THESE ISSUES! Calories don't burn QUITE as fast. Still really damn quick though. You definitely don't freeze as fast. A fire finally seems to warm you up when you're sitting next to it. Hunger takes a TINY bit longer to kick in and thirst is pretty easy to quench so long as you have even the tiniest amount of water. The wolfs no longer home in on you like a heat-seeker missile. You can actually run away now, but only IF you are far enough away. Cooking the food finally seems to help from getting food poisoning(ABOUT TIME).\n\nThey still haven't addressed being able to use the HUNTING knife or Hatchet to fight the wolf off. You still have to fight it off with your bare hands, which is ALMOST impossible. Seriously, why have a HUNTING knife if you can't use it when you get attacked?!?\n\nThe game is beautiful and the artwork is amazing. The sounds and music are both really good. It just needs some minor tweaks to help make it a lot better.\n\nI'm glad I waited until after they did a few updates before I did this review, because if I hadn't then it would have just been all negative. But instead I waited to let them get the updates out. This way I got to try it both BEFORE and AFTER the updates. The game has IMPROVED VASTLY with these new updates. I really hope they continue to listen to feedback and make adjustments accordingly. So far, it's working out pretty well.","October 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The mechanics are simple and quite mathematical in nature.. warmth, hunger and thirst vs time and resources, however given that routine is often interrupted by disease or wolf attack the game makes you head out of whatever comfort zone you've created to search for the rarities that make life sustainable.\n\nI found this game ultimately eventuates into posing the question "why keep going?" and those steam achievements certainly rank high in the game's longevity. More importantly I found myself thinking .. "would I keep going?" surely there is something in our makeup that makes gripping onto life with every last ounce of strength...  a game mechanic that is both powerful and compelling.\n\nI was an alpha backer of minecraft, the most amazing part of that experience was the journey I took with that game (and Notch) as it evolved into the massive beast it has become. The Long Dark is evolving, and I think part of the attraction I have to this game, is the oppportunity to follow the bread crumb trail that the developers scatter as this game flourishes into maturity.","November 3, 2014","true","34.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I try to light a fire, but the blizzard keeps blowing out my tinder. I don't dare leave the relative safety of the logs and freeze in the storm, but I can see the direction of the snow being blown around me is starting to shift.. I don't have much time before I freeze, so I start sprinting through the blinding snow in hopes of finding shelter. After what seems like days, I spot something red whipping in the wind. It's the Canadian flag, and it's in front of a small cabin. Safe at last.\n\nDay 8: I've recovered from the minor frostbite, and have been fishing through a hole in the ice for the last few days. Between foraging for wood and melting snow for water, I've built up quite an appetite. The salmon and trout have kept me full, but the axe I found in this cabin is almost about to break. So I stock up on fresh water and tinder, and I head out into the wilderness for another place to stay.\n\nDay 10: I've found a hunting cabin with a rifle!! Sadly, I can't find any bullets.. But the weight in my hands give me a sense of security, false as it may be. But now I'm determined to change my fortune. I won't just endure the environment anymore... I'll thrive in it. I just need a few rounds to start eating some tasty wolf meat.\nTasty wolf meat.\nWolf meat.\nMeat.\nMe.\n\nDay 12: There's a forest lookout on top of a mountain. Rangers and Mounties have guns, right? Probably bullets too.\nAs I start my ascent to the top of the mountain, I hear a wolf howl. God damn tasty wolf, all full of meat and ♥♥♥♥... It could be anywhere. What are the chances of it being on this pat--- OH ♥♥♥♥ it's turning the corner in front of me!\nNow it's just me and the wolf. I slowly drop the rifle and bring out a flair. It lights and hurts my eyes, but it's the only thing I have to potentially scare it off.\nThe hair on it's back stands on end. I can hear the growls start to intensify. It's about to charge, but just as it leaps forward I throw my flair at it and hear it yelp in surprise. It runs away from the stick of life-saving white-phosphorous, and I am inclined to run after it. It won't be scared for long, and it can catch up to me if I run down the mountain. My only hope is to make it to the forestry lookout before it regains it's wits.\nThe sound of wooden stairs beneath my body weight was a welcome change.\n\nDay 29: Well, I'm a master hunter now. I found bullets in the lookout, hunted that wolf, and ate every ounce of meat off his body. Tasty wolf meat.\nSince then I've killed several more wolves, and have had the luxury of fast exploration now that my boom-stick assures me safety. I've found knives, hatchets, tools, and more clothing and canned food than I know what to do with. My run in with fluffy at the dam might haunt me for a while, but at the moment I'm far away from that place. Some kind of Coastal Highway. My current living conditions have been fairly pleasant. There's a garage with a convenience store that still had some snacks, but I've found plenty of bullets in the surrounding cabins, so deer and wold meat is never far away. I think I'll go get more of a stockpile from the other surrounding cabins.\n\nWalking on the road I see a black shape over a hill, but it quickly dissapears behind a tree. I investigate, but come up empty. No paw prints, no wolf. But what's this? A dead deer on the side of the lake. I can still feel it's body heat residing in the carcass... but I didn't kill this deer. A quick 360 scan and no sign of a predator. Ah well! I got 12lbs of meat off this deer. I can eat happy for a week and make it to a full month!\n\nBut as I walk towards the garage, the wolf (presumably the one who took down the deer) turns the corner and charges at me. My rifle round pierces it's hip, but doesn't kill it. I feel it's teeth on my neck. I'm meat to it, and I know what hunger does to a living thing.\nBut my knife meets it's ribs, and it jumps off of my in fright. But this isn't over, you stupid wolf. You're full of calories that I NEED! But this deer meat is slowing me down, and the wolf is now too far away to risk shooting at it. I'll probably miss.\n\nSo after I drop the raw deer meat on the ground I start my pursuit. The wolf keeps it's distance, but I'm waiting for it to turn it's flank to me so I can get a larger target. It's been 29 days and 12 hours since this plane crashed, and with this deer and wolf I'll surely be able to make it to day 40 in that garage. The thought of turning away this wolf-meal is unimaginable right now.\n\nGun in hand, I bring the rifle stock to my shoulder. My cheek pressed firmly on the butt of the rifle, I aim down the sites. My cold finger begins to gently squeeze the trigger. I can't miss.\n\nSomething hits me. Big. Black. Hungry.\nIt's a wolf. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ had a pack with him.\nBiting.\nWolf.\nMeat.\nMe.\nMeal.\n\nThe Long Dark...\n\n\nGame is 15/10.\n\nSeriously, it's the only thing I play anymore. They could leave it untouched and I'd be happy, but the thought that they're adding more to it all the time is seriously the best thing ever. Get it.\n\nFood for thought: A hunting sim would be a cool mod, DLC, or workshop idea though. Like you start off in the trappers cabin with a bunch of fire logs and MRE's, plenty of bullets and tools. Just to kinda have a game mode where you could screw around and shoot stuff. I'd love to shoot at the crows, but in the current sandbox if I miss and waste a bullet it's a terrible loss for me, so I don't if they're food sources or not.\n\nMaybe survival books that could give the player more crafting ideas? I mean, they're all over the place in Canada. Everyone has at least one. And there are some pretty cool (albiet advanced) traps out there for birds and such.","December 4, 2014","true","85.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Because it's smart, and it treats me as a gamer, and as a developer as such.  There's nothing hand holding about the survival, there are no explicit tutorials, it doesn't assume I'm 12 years old and have never stood out in a forest in my life.  It's smart, And it's challenging.  A tremendous amount of the survival comes from how you play it, the game is never unfair, if you died, it's because you made poor decisions, or as is often the case in real survival, one fatal misstep that led to a cascade of errors.\n\nThe Long Dark is gorgeous, smart, and an engrossing play.

This is a great example of Early Access done right. While there is no story mode yet, the sandbox is a great game experience. I've already spent over 40 hours in here. The quotes at the beginning of the game are completely appropriate. It feels like a Cormac McCarthy novel. You aren't going to survive. It's going to be brutal and bitter, but you're going to keep on walking as long as you can.\n\nI don't really have much negative to say. Maybe you could craft a few more items? Buckskin pants? Maybe you could create a basic shelter/tent? But, these are small details.

I loved Skyrim. I still do. But I wanted more realism. I wanted to feel like every little choice really mattered. In Skyrim, you can run through the snow in your underwear, and the only thing you have to worry about is stumbling across a wolf or troll, but you can usually cut them down with a chop or two.\n\nNot so with The Long Dark. The Long Dark, even in its alpha stage is as intense and challenging as a game of chess against the game world itself. Every move you make has consequences. Every little thing you do or don't do could mean life or death.\n\nYou are a survivor of a plane crash in the Canadian North. You have the shirt on your back, a pair of boots, and a few bits of food. You're in a blizzard in the middle of nowhere, and there are wolves on the hunt. Go.\n\nMaybe you see a cabin in the distance, in the blinding cold and blowing snow. Maybe you find a hatchet. Maybe you find nothing at all. You're slowly freezing to death, but you must find some wood. Do you have enough calories to go out foraging? But if you don't, how will you melt snow and boil it to get clean water? You're thirsty too. Very thirsty. And the clock is ticking.\n\nIt's this kind of intensity, this kind of challenge, where consequences loom behing every little choice that's missing in almost every other game I've ever played. It keeps you coming back, again and again, even after you died so many times in the bitter cold. You keep coming back because you learned something, and you just might do better the next time. You just might survive a few more days.\n\nA good game rewards you. And this is something that's beautiful in The Long Dark. Because every little choice matters, because every hour of survival is bought with intelligent choices and lots of luck, that one scrap of food or firewood you find in a cabin is worth more than gold to you. You almost want to cheer. The rewards are doled out like breadcrumbs down the trail of life, and you keep searching for the next one. You keep fighting for your next hour of life.\n\nYou're also rewarded by levelling up skills. You become better and better at making a fire after a few days. You improve in repairing and crafting new gear.\n\nThe crafting system is interesting and engaging as well. You find an old pair of pants or a sweater that you don't need? Harvest it for cloth and use it to repair the gear you're already wearing. Patch that hole the wolves tore in it. Fix up your hatchet with the scrap metal you found in a locker. Cobble together a pair of deerskin boots with the hides you've scavenged off of a carcass in the woods. It's all so involving, and it only adds to the sense of reward. I made this! And it just might help me survive a few more days.\n\nThe music is creepy and intense, but it only comes on occasionally, when something of consequence is going down. Otherwise, there's only the wind and woods, creaking trees, squawking crows, and your own breath.\n\nThe graphics are stylized. It's not a realistic world. It's somewhat cartoony, TF2 style. But it's not a flaw. You can see for miles on a clear day, and everything looks beautiful, like a painting you've somehow wandered into, a painting that's trying to kill you.\n\nAnd thank God, there are no zombies. I'm sick to death of zombies. This game pits you against the real world, a world unpolluted by all the survival horror cliches that have been done to death in by every other game in the past ten years. (Guitar Hero: Zombie Edition? Go f*ck yourself.)\n\nIf I had to complain about anything in this game, I'd say the item lists need to be expanded. There are only five or six types of food. A couple of each type of clothing. Tools, weapons, gear--they all need to be diversified. After a few hours of play, I'd discovered pretty much everything there was to be discovered. I was no longer being surprised. The rewards were still rewarding, but I would have been thrilled to walk into a house somewhere and find some new article of clothing or type of food I'd never even seen before.\n\nThe wolves are too over-powered at times, and you spend a lot of time just walking around in very wide circles to avoid them. Some items, weapons, or defense that might give you a bit of an edge on them would be awesome, especially if it took a hell of a lot to earn it.\n\nI got stuck in a hole at some point, between two boulders by a bridge. The walls were too steep, and I couldn't get out. I was worried I'd be stuck there and lose my week's worth of gear. But I somehow managed to go into crawl mode and wiggle and squirm until I glitched right through the ground. then I was walking under the earth. All of this could have been avoided with a simple jump function.\n\nThe game is still in alpha, so all these things will surely be fixed over time. And all these things are forgivable, considering the massive amounts of fun I'm having. It's looking like the devs at Hinterland are putting out an update every couple of weeks. I look forward to the new developments. New regions to explore. New animals to hunt and be hunted by. Maybe even a multiplayer mode, where you can team up with a buddy or two and face the elements together, or hunt each other down in a last-man-standing survival showdown. That would be too amazing for words.\n\nAll that is yet to come. For now, I recommend this game to anyone who likes an intellectual challenge in their game play. You'll be hard pressed to find this much intensity in any other game you can pick up for only $20. If you enjoy a game that makes you think, strategize, and plan every move in order to win, you'll love The Long Dark. If you're more the mindless hack n' slash type, you might still like it. There is excitment, there is atmosphere, there are scares and thrills. But mostly it's about slow, methodical puzzle solving, where every move could mean a miserable death, bleeding out in the dark, with an empty stomach in the cold bitter snow...","January 2, 2015","true","76.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything can take a toll on your character such as spraining an ankle while walking down a steep slope or getting sick from unboiled water. For this current state of the game it is truly at a solid and sets the foundations for a lot of further potential.\n\nMy only concerns are that the current level is relatively small and perhaps the developers should reconsider the possible of a Coop or Multiplayer option. While The Long Dark offers a great & unique experience, I worry that without a multiplayer function, it's replayability is limited. However it's possible that once development reaches a further point, the extent of more content might solve this problem in it's self.\n\nOverall it is highly worth checking out and worth every bit of the $19.99 price tag","September 28, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also I am very limited on some aspects as I use a not so decent laptop for my PC gaming right now.\n\nAnyway though, this game took me by suprise. I saw the videos adn thought that it wouldn't honestly be that great, despite it only being in Alpha. Turns out that it being in Alpha still is a GREAT thing. While bugs and the such do arise (natural) I find it to be worth it. The mechanics of the game are beautiful and the gameplay itself, while slow-paced and (for your first few attempts at the game) quite unrewarding you will soon find yourself knowing where stuff is and where to go next. The graphics are indeed very nice and the artstyle used is just jawdropping to me. My absolute favorite part is the game itself though, and its gameplay. Instead of throwing zombies or cannibals (Mmmhm Forest and 7 Days to Die) at you like crazy, your primary threat is nature itself. You find yourself quickly on the verge of freeaing to death after spending adn hour harvesting 9 KG of venison and let me tell you, you do not wana go out like that.\n\nOverall I simply love the game and the fact that it is in Alpha only makes me happier that I bought it.

Getting stuck in a fish-hut on a frozen lake in a seemingly endless cycle of blizzards and blinding, heavy fog. Getting lost in the forest in the middle of the night when you're only 500 meters from home but you can't remember which way you came from.\n\nIt's very satisfactory to craft better clothing from deer hides and rabbit fur. To find medicinal plants. To find a cave that protects you from the icy wind and make a lifesaving fire. Then make a nice, hot herbal tea that revitalizes you.\n\nThe art style is beautiful and evocative. There's much to explore: forests, lakes and mountains, settlements, abandoned mines and highways.\n\nAnd then there are the wolves. They ruin everything. Your clothes, and your fun. Fortunately, you can play on a mode called Pilgrim where the wolves (and the bears) don't attack you, so you can focus on survival rather than stealth.\n\nThe game is quite stable and runs well.\n\nIn sandbox mode there is a lack of positive goals, but there is a story mode still to come.","October 4, 2015","true","57.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Today people think of ♥♥♥♥ like Rust and Dayz as survival, they are more of a survive other people, and eat every-once-in-a-while games. This however, is just you, your instinct, and nature. The world has gone to ♥♥♥♥ after a solar flare knocked out all electronics (this can genuinely happen in real life, and has) your place has gone down over a remote wilderness in northern canada. This game will give you a genuine feeling of loneliness, and despair, and even sometimes, fear.\nPros:\n1. Fantastic Developers. These guys listen to their community, they don't ban people who talk badly about the game, and they actually care about feedback. They won't abandon the game, this is like a piece of art to them, rather than a cash cow.\n2. Unique art style. This game will age well, it doesn't try to look realistic, it tries to look unique.\n3. Superb survival aspects. The environment WILL kill you. This is not Rust where getting hungry or cold won't affect you and a few pieces of food will solve your worries. In this, the cold is a dangerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Hunger isn't the only problem either, seeing as you have to manage your calories as you perform tasks like starting a fire, or running.\n4. The environment is spectacular. The sound effects are amazing, the character even talks to himself every so often. Being inside derelict houses is eerie, since you can see family pictures in the dark, creeky house.\n\nCons:\n1. This, of course, is early access. There is no absolute gurantee that the game will be the same the next update, or even the final release.","August 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusticsaxon/recommended/305620/","rusticsaxon","Saxonaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusticsaxon/","130 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Long Dark is a first person, open world, survival game being developed by a rather new company called Hinterland. I bought this game back when it was very, very new. And there was, and still is a lot of potential for this rather unexpected gem. I don't often write reviews on Alpha/Beta/Early Access titles, and typically, when I do, they're because you can tell the'll be utter ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI'm pleased to say, that I've yet to be disappointed by Hinterland Studio. The Long Dark, in its current state, has only the Sandbox Mode, an open-world survival that we're all too familiar with, with three difficulties, and the obvious absence of a story-mode. Survival games are now so common, like your failure to potty train your dog, you can't walk more than two feet without stepping on ♥♥♥♥♥. And often, this ♥♥♥♥♥ brings about a revolted feeling of disgust and you urgently rush to the washroom to clean the filth away.\n\nIn otherwords, since the rise of Minecraft, there's been a few gems in the Survival genre, but the majority have been such massive disappointments, you'd think that the only service their dev-companies could do now, is to beat themselves in the face with a club labled bankruptcy. It seems so irritating, to be taunted constantly with these games, of the next-generation "survival", only to discover that its only usefulnes is to help fix the unlevel table in your dining room.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at first, learning the game, as any decent person would, and that was by ignoring any sense of a tutorial or wiki. Well, they had the latter, the former might as well as have been named bigfoot. From the start, there were a lot of problems with the game, I can't count how many times I found myself squealing as my face was mauled by a wolf, with my attacks being as useless as an old lady with a foam bat. However, they quickly nerfed the wolves, still ensuring they were a challenge, but not so much that any form of resistence or risk-taking adventure around them could still result in your body being violently eviscerated by ravenous teeth.\n\nThe landscape and overall design of the world, which gave me the impression that someone spilt a set of depressing watercolours on a Canadian forest, is actually admirably beautiful and robust. Immediately, when you spawn into the game, you're hit with the feeling of desolate isolation, and a sense of ever foreboding dread that the whole world has in fact gone to ♥♥♥♥♥. The devs masterly crafted a mosaic and rather sad setting for such a survival game that few can compare.\n\nIn fact, I spent a lot of my time risking my life in the subzero frigid temperatures, and the horrendous monstrosities birthed by Cerberus to explore this rather dire landscape, and found it so oddly enchanting that I often starved or froze to death. An ending well fit for such a daring expedition, I might add. In short, the entire survival atmosphere Hinterland Studio built, is very well done, beautifully so, and their attention to detail in such a world is so remarkable that the experience of being in such a terrifying world really affects you.\n\nEverything from the wind, your breath, the need for food, water and sleep, and the constant battling of the elements have been so neatly put together that I could sit down and eat the game if it were my favourite box of mixed mac'n'cheese and feel sad yet strangely delighted.\n\nSo far, there's been little to really complain about. The Devs have really taken their time to listen to community input and respond rather quickly with bugfixes and patches to rebalance the game, something that I hope remains, since I'd rather not have to compare a new company to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isations of EA or Ubisoft. Honestly, I remember a time where companies were so closely-knit to their communities they were like a pair of siamese twins, and now, we're left with the brooding dead husks that make up EA, Ubisoft, and other alleged AAA developers.\n\nHowever, what kind of review would this be without some complaint. Ones that they haven't been sniping out rather quickly, they also have been rather sluggish in others, whether because of budget constraints or a risky move when they opened the game to Early Access. I contemplated purchasing the game in Early Access, because as we all may know, some companies, and especially certain groups of devs, have burnt us on Early Access titles and you're left caring for the drooling, brain-dead husk of a game as they run off with the money and flash it you in suggestive poses with a sign saying, "Ha Ha, Fooled You".\n\nHowever, being one so often familiar with the feeling of disappointment, and a craving to be disappointed, I bought the Long Dark in Early Access and immediately found a few discrepancies. Initially, they advertised the game, insofar as its mechanics with a world that became drastically altered and terrifying at night, than during the day. Something that at first, made me recall another game, perhaps Minecraft. However, their unique twist to it made me forgive Hinterland for that comparison. You see, the world you're character has fallen into has been ravaged by a Carrington Event, or a large Solarmagnetic Storm that wipes out nearly all electrical based systems across the globe, creating terrifying aurora at night, that send the radioes screaming alive, and the lights flashing on. The storm's impact disrupts mgiratory patterns of animals, sends birds flying around until they die frome exhaustion, and disrupts the hibernation cycle of bears and other animals.\n\nAs a result, nighttime in this desolate and frozen wilderness brings you into the horrifying embrace of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off animal from Quebec to British Columbia, who are all out for a snack, and you look like a delicious New York strip with a side of their favourite barbecue sauce. With all this riveting advertisement, I just couldn't help but buy the game, and immediatelly noticed something interesting, the lack of this solarmagnetic storm, and even the terrifying aurora. Instead, all that happened at night was frostbite.\n\nAfter I found myself comfortably rooted in a home, I eventually lost interest with the game. While they were quick with patchfixes and updates, it made me feel more like I was playing Minecraft: The Canadian Edition, with less green phalli to ruin my day. I stopped in when they made a few major updates, particularily they've been good at adding maps and new areas, and more mechanics that kept me interested for a little while, and then I'd lose it again and go back to bludgeoning people's heads open on one of my favourite FPSs.\n\nHowever, finally they've made the big announcement, and this is why I chose to write this review now. Despite their lack to give us the initially advertised content when I first bought the game, and when I started to wonder if I had made a grave mistake, I saw a beacon in this dark and macabre wilderness. A teaser trailer for their storymode, with the features they promised at the start, and then, I was finally sold.\n\nIn short, I would recommend you buy this game. With the big announcement for the upcoming story-mode in 2016, and the final major updates involving the auroras and other massively yearned for features, Hinterland Studios has proved that they actually care about gaming and development. They've proven that they care about their community, something we can't say for EA or other Early Access shites, and with a dedicated team to fix bugs and patches, I can say that the wait has well been worth it. I may not be all that interested until those features are finally added to the game, but when they are, I can see my social life suffering in the face of surviving the brutal Canadian wilderness in a post-apocalyptic gem of the survival genre that deserves all of its praise.","December 18, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Many players who think of this term immediately think of Ark, DayZ and Rust. Little do they know, survival (at least in its hardcore sense) should be about a battle between the environment and yourself.

Love this game!  For me the weather, from snow storms to the cold is a bigger threat than the wolves (once I figured out how to make bandages that is), the icy silence of my boots on the snow and ice is a constant companion to the mournful howling of the wind.  That aside I wish there was a tutorial of sorts to show me how to craft snares, boil water etc.  Steam guides and blind dumb luck have been the only reason I made it beyond day 5.  I really dig the survival aspect of this game and I realize it's in Alpha still but I do wish surviving was a little easier, or resources a bit more plentiful, or maybe I should just play more and try not to suck.","November 10, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The TL;DR is at the bottom, if anybody's interested.\n\nFirst off, let me say that "The Long Dark" is one of the truest survival games to be produced in the year of 2014. Everything in the game is out to get you: the elements, the water, the wolves, sickness, hunger, dehydration, and fatigue, just to name a few. The game does a fantastic job proving how frail the human body is when exposed to these hardships, as well. One cannot go on a murderous rampage of kniving wolves and deer. One cannot travel miles in a blizzard. One cannot carry a rifle, six jackets, enough medical supplies to aid a hospital, and enough food to make people think you robbed a grocer. If one wants to survive, one must avoid wolves, travel light, and travel prepared. One wrong step and it could be one's last.\n\nThe graphics are quite simple, yet unique for modern games. It's hard to describe, but it borders cartoon-y, in a sense. Finding a human corpse will reward you with a flat-faced man with hands lacking fingers, but it somehow does the game justice of displaying a bleak wilderness that is inhospitable.\n\nThe gameplay is perfect, in such few words. Every day, one has to question oneself, "What do I need to do today?" One needs wood for a fire to stay warm, food and water to stay alive, clothes to stay warm while outside, medication to keep you alive when you're hurt, but one can only do so much per day. These needs will always keep one questioning if what one grabbed from that cabin was the right thing for tonight, or if one dodged that wolf on the railroads, will it have tracked them back to their camp? Every so often, these primal thoughts of food, water, and safety will even have the player making basic statements of "Need water" or cursing a wolf's presence. The game also praises (read: demands) players for taking risks and venturing away from one's safe camp to search abandoned vehicles and houses for more supplies, but remember: too much risk and one might run into a LOT of trouble.\n\nSome of the upcoming features include a story mode involving a Canadian bushman pilot who goes down after the freak electromagnetic surge which causes the events of "The Long Dark" to unfold, AI (and possibly human) survivor interation (which, as far as AI goes, has been teased that some AI are friendly, some are hostile, and some will pretend to be friendly to steal your supplies), and more undisclosed content that has yet to be revealed. After all, this is Early Access.\n\nAlso, as a final note, the dev team is a new face on the development playing field, but they are certainly not green. With voice actors such as Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale, David Hayer, and Elias Toufexis providing their talents to the game's characters and devs including people who have worked on "TES: Morrowind", "League of Legends", "God of War", "Far Cry 3", and "Mass Effect". With such a team, not only will a quality game come out of "The Long Dark", but it will definitely be developed by a reputable team.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n"The Long Dark" is a diamond in the rough amongst all the other survival games of 2014 that is being headed by a great dev team. I would definitely recommend it for everybody masochist out there who wants more challenges.","January 4, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It just keeps getting better and better. Maybe I've spent too many winter nights in a tent or read too many Antarctica tales, but this game to me, appeals to a basic human need...to be tested. Not by how many zombie ninja robots you can kill or by how many fighting combos you can preform with your mouse buttons but in a way that feels real, you must survive in a world devoid of basic human comforts. A world that many of us could not survive for very long. You must be thoughtful, cautious, you must think ahead, you must plan for the unknown, and all along at the back of your mind in each game is the most realistic game mechanic of all, if you die, all your planning and thoughtful preparation will be for naught, and you will be dead (unless you want to start all over again, which I've done happily about 50 times).

I orginally gave it an 8/10 (-1 for impending doom) and (-1 for nitpicky things) After roughly a year in early access ALL OF MY CONCERNS were met. This game is about as close to perfection as you can possibly get.\n\nThe developers expanded the Sandbox and in doing so removed  the "impending doom" concern I had felt during the first days the long dark launched on steam... Since the playable area is much larger, and more resources are now its very possible to survive 1000's of days now. There are 5 zones, + transiton zones between those places which are large enough to survive in as well. + Caves to explore in both the main zones and the transiton areas with items and spoilers. When I mean caves I mean cute little hidely spots, and also pitch black mazes you can explore by torchlight.This game is seriously amazing. Respawnable coal can be gathered from these dark and dangerous mines as well as an alternative fuel source. The coal burns hot and can be used tacfully to provide extra warmth in terrible conditions, as well as for something spoiler related.\n\nAs far as nitpicky things go. They expanded upon wood gathering mechanics. They added more realism to injuries, hypothermia is beautifully done after some tweaks. At lower condition your character staggers around very convincingly. Honestly I would change nothing and they have changed this game for the beter. Watching the team inch towards this massive transformation with every patch they release is pretty cool. Fishing was added, bows were added. Snaring rabbits also was added. Hell they even added cat tail harvesting and making tea from wild plants to heal yourself.\n\nThis is a must have game.\n\nIts a thoughtful, beautiful, challenge. It kills you through your own neglect and poor choices. Nature favores no one. A game where you second guess yourself and your choices and feel powerless at times against the weather. Deeply thoughtful as you get better you learn to plan ahead, when to move, when to remain inside. So many things time of day, temperature, wolf patrols. You will find yourself seeking out predators collecting hides to make warm fur clothing. At other times avoiding conflict to keep yourself healthy and alive.\n\nBest game I played in 2015 and I feel no other survial game can replace it in 2016.","September 24, 2014","true","632.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When you first start up the game you are greeted by the Hinter Land Games logo, (Looks very sexy) My first time playing the game i knew nothing about it. I clicked start new and i had spawned in. I walked around for a bit trying to find a shelter. A dam is what i found full of all sorts of items i was excited to get my survival gaming back but there was a problem... a big... problem... i forgot that while i was on my way there i had sprained my ankle and cut my leg. so i died... didnt last long but hey i kept on playing. I started up a new game on the map for advanced players (forgot the name of it) i got attacked by a bear and ♥♥♥♥ my self the animation for being attacked was like nothing i have ever seen before it was like i was playing amnesia i thought i was all of a suddern playing a horror game but boy was enjoying it. i managed to survive the attack and run away and bandage my self up at a nearby farm. I found my self a rifle found the bloody bear and killed it with my bear hands... ( see what i did there c; ) I have now survived for 2 days and 24 hours and 31 minutes, I need to find shelter and i feel like im being followed...\nThe long dark is by far one of my most enjoyed games i have ever played it is a mix of intense survival and the horror of being followed and hunted! i would rate this game a 10/10 for its amazing creativity Hinter Land did a bloody job well done on it and i can't wait for story mode!!!!\n"Bears, scarry, stay away" -Hydra\n\n*Update*\nI have survived for 4 days and 4 hours and 46 minutes\ni found an old abandend fall out shelter i have stacked up on surplus that should last me for a week... hopefully.","December 31, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is really difficult and a lot of your ability to survive depends on your perseverance and persistence to learn maps, resource management, and weapon locations. You will die a lot (I have not survived very long at the time of this writing). You can play as a dude or a dudette (yay!) and in both cases, you are subjected to utter hell on earth. Unlike other games, which rely on biochemical warfare, nuclear weapons, or zombies to craft apocalyptic hellholes, this one uses freezing cold. Take it from a Coloradan who used to do outdoor education for elementary students, the cold can and does suck if you are not properly equipped.\n\nYou start out with your standard survival stuff: fatigue, hunger, thirst, health, and a meter detailing how cold you are or aren't. Lanterns are useful and are rather plentiful in the world, so pick them up. Starting fires can give you warmth, but also consume resources and may fail at the expense of those resources. Water must be purified before hand, or else you will get sick. The main problem I had was locating food, which is difficult to find and can go bad (like in the real world). You need to constantly be moving between shelters and raiding things, which is hard because there are wolves and now bears (have not faced them yet) to harass you. This game is dangerous trial and error, but the most enjoyable kind.\n\nIf you want a realistic and challenging survival game, check this one out! The visual styles are really nice and remind me a lot of graphic novels with a dash of Telltale. And hey, if you play the lady, you get to have Ellie from The Last of Us as your narrator.

The wind broke long enough for me to venture outside, my growling stomach told me i had little choice. The deer i'd been tracking slowly moved along picking out what bit's of vegetation it could find, ever wary of it's surroundings. I saw my opportunity arise as it stopped ears perked in the opposite direction of me. My rifle came to my shoulder slowly as not to spook the deer, my breath slowed finger on the trigger slowly squeezing back. For a second i could swear i  caught motion out of the corner of my eye, then it happened. The wolf sprang barely giving me enough time to pivot in his direction. My shot was true and i caught him mid chest. No deer for dinner tonight but i find i'm getting used to the taste of wolf.\n\nLet me say that rarely do i ever see a survival game that has pulled me in so deeply, immersed is a word that does not do it justice. Ive actually found myself talking to myself as i move along warning myself not to get too focused on the road ahead and to scan around as i go. Nothing about this game is linear or boring. The graphics are stunning and the dynamics of the game itself work incredibly well. Bravo dev's bravo!\n\nIf i had anything to request or add to the game it would possibly be allowing the hatchet or hunting knife be used as a weapon itself and maybe adding an option for scrap metal to be heated in a fire for use in making the basic items for tools weapons etc. One could possibly assemble a crude axe that way etc. I see great potential in this game to evolve into not only a urvival game but a hybrid crafting one as well. The elements of basic survival alone make the game more than challenging for any player, adding a primitive crafting system could only enhance the experience.\n","December 11, 2015","true","30.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

My rucksack full of loot, I opened a door that led outside from the depths of the dam. I took a glance down and around the ravine, didn't see anything useful, and returned to the door... but it wouldn't open from this side. I was then presented with two options. Attempt to cross a narrow ridge and risk a near certain fall to get across the ravine to an entrance to reenter the dam that may or may not even be there, or descend down into the ravine and follow the frozen river. I chose the later. What followed was a disoriented drudge through tall ravine walls and finally a labyrinthian cave that sent shivers up my spine every time I stepped into the dark. I finally emerged from the caves into a moonlit forest being ravaged by a blizzard. To my dread I could hear the yips and howls of wolves in the distance.\n\nThis is what I enjoy about the Long Dark. It will throw you curve balls and it requires you to think on your feet and weigh desicions one of which may be life (at least for a while) and the other may be death. You don't really know what's coming next.\n\nSay you're looking for shelter. Do you stay in the dam and risk dealing with any threats that may dwell within to access all those glorious resources? Or maybe the Trapper's Homestead near replenishable natural resources, but far from anything else? Perhaps Signal Hill with a fence to keep out ravenous predators, but beaing secluded on a lonely peak?\n\nSay you're confronted with a wolf. Do you fire your one remaining .303 round and risk a miss? Throw a flare and lose your only remaining light source? Spare a chunk of meat for a decoy and go hungry yourself? Run and hope for the best?\n\nI highly recommed the twisting, turning journey toward inevitable death that is The Long Dark. It's an excellent product and is a steal at $19.99,\n\nI also suggest heading over to hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark/roadmap/ to see all of the awesome content Hinterland is hoping to add to the game.

The studio has planed this game as a story mode and released the sandbox to test the in game mechanics of the world.\nThey constantly improve the mechanics always in close connection to the feed back of the community. (It's just amazing how fast they respond!)\nIf you read this you can get the impression of the game is in an experimental state - belief me, it's not! I played this game in sandbox mode for more than 100 hours, I wouldn't  have if it wasn't playable and highly enjoyable.\nIn the last update they also implanted a challenge mode where you have missions to accomplish under high pressure. This is great for all players that spend a lot of time in the game and wished for some change in their day to day survival. If you are new I recommend to first explore all regions and learn to survive in the wilderness before accepting the challenges.\n\nWhat I especially like as a female player is that you can choose between a female an a male character. It helps to merge in to the game even more. And you really get absorbed by the game: If you played it for a couple hours you will start to collect matches in real live.\n\nIn short: Highly recommended for players who like to explore a beautiful landscape under extreme circumstances. Who like to collect food and stuff and build a base camp. Who like game mechanics that are oriented in real life (you can't run all day, you have to sleep or you can't sleep if you aren't tired).\nWho like to think of what happens if you are the last person after the apocalypse. Who like an apocalypse where nothing really changes but the weather gets more extreme, the wolves are more aggressive and you can't find other survivors (at the moment).","May 31","true","187.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doniczkov/recommended/305620/","doniczkov","doniczkov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doniczkov/","11 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is awesome. I'll give it 10 / 10 in the future.\n\nIt has one wonderfull thing, which few of today's games have - it's own, specific CLIMATE. You feel it from the first seconds of play. Things which build up for it are:\n\n1. STORY\nYou wake up in the middle of nowhere, with no weapon, nor food. The heat of your body constantly falling. There's no time to think, you must act. The game pulls you in at the very beginning and keeps it that way.\n\n2. GAMEPLAY\nYou constantly need to do something. You're either hungry, thirsty, cold or exhausted. At some point it may gets little tiresome, because you wish you had more time for exploring things and this beautiful world, but if you carry on, you'll explore it anyway (Sandbox).\nThe game is hard. There's only sandbox mode available with one area, but it gave me 10 hours of solid gameplay anyway. I consider full game with story mode and few more sandbox areas will give at least a couple of times this.\n\n3. GRAPHICS\nIt is made by a renowned artist Hokyo Lim, author of i.a. The Unfisnished Swan (https://www.google.pl/search?q=unfisnished+swan). He's an out-of-the-box thinker.\nSometimes, you feel like watching a very good movie. But mostly, you feel like you're actually there. Standing there at the top of the mountain and admiring views. Some people may consider it looking a bit too fairy-tale-like, but for me it is suiting.\n\n4. SOUND\nThe sound effects are what builds up the atmosphere and they are very real. At some point even the howling wind gives you chills because it sounds similiar to the wolf's howling.\nThe music is heard only occasionally, but the moments choosen to play it build up the atmosphere even more.\nThere are two PC available - man and woman. Man is vioced by the Mass Effect no.1 voice actor Mark Meer. Female - I don't know, but I think she's not a professionall voice actress or at least for me her voices are disturbing.\n\nCONS:\nThe game got kind of tiresome after ~10h and a few deaths. There's lot of walking in the beginning and tt's also easy to die. If you die you loose your save. So, if you're hunted down on 2nd day due to distraction, you have to replay the whole part before it really got fun. I think it requires some sort of calibration yet.\n\nTo sum it up: This game is made by professionals, who left big gaming companies to create offbeat titles. It has great graphics, music, and nice gameplay. When the story mode will be available, it will be unbelievably good. I predict it will deliver one of the best gaming experience in a long time. And I don't mean survival enthusiasts.","October 8, 2014","true","14.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is a really challenge, if you don't find any weapons (gun, hunting knife,etc.) You are going to die. The combat system is very different and it can use some fixing. I stab a wolf 3 times with full power and only takes away 20% out of 100%. Overall this game could use some fixing, but it is in alpha.

I found it to be a struggle to just get the 5 day achievement (maybe I just suck) but when I did it was so satisfying. Here is my story of that run.\n\n1. Finds Lake and gets warm clothes, hears laughter of dead children\n2. Gets mauled by rabid wolf and fights it off, takes meds\n3. Gets stuck in blizzard on lake and sleeps in a hut, probably lost a toe.\n4. Wanders through blizzard and finds Camp house, sleeps\n5. Goes on a hike, sprains ankle twice\n6. Finds hunters house with rifle *how do I open that safe?*\n7. Becomes a cook\n8. *Finds ammo and murders a wolf*... This was enjoyable.\n9. Goes into Dam, shoots giant FLIPPING SCARY WOLF HOLY ♥♥♥♥, gets encumbered, spends 20 minutes taking baby steps. Spends the night in haunted dam.\n10. Murders damn wolves for no reason, gets food poisoning randomly. [karma I guess]\n11. Arrives at Logging Camp freezing and exhausted, probably lost another toe. Sleeps 12 hours.\n12. Walks out in the middle of the night and HOLY FUUUUU THAT WOLF HAS GREEN EYES -- Almost dies from scary wolf in the dark, eats, takes meds, & sleeps some more with frozen dead black guy that drops grape soda.\n13. Kills that damn wolf, heads to Forestry Lookout at 1 mph.\n14. Stuffs crap in metal container, rubs back for awhile\n15. Eats fresh meat and clean water for once, has a merry christmas, sleeps for 8 hours. Life is great.\n16. Gets food poisoning, and runs out of tinder in a snowstorm. Fml.\n17, Sleeps for 12 hours, gets better, forages wood for an hour, finds cabin with dead guy. Yay.\n18. Another blizzard, sleeps more, gets 5-day achievement. *success*\n19. Gets crappy loot at Unnamed Pond, becomes a bean bandit, gets food poison again. "I just wanna die!"\n20. Goes in search of mystical Storm Hatch that I found in a previous life, eats tons of raw meat and polluted water.\n21. Probably lost a foot by now. Walks back home in storm freezing, exhausted, and poisoned; sprains foot again, thanks painkillers.\n22. Gets back to house with worthless supplies, sleeps for 12 more hours, wakes up with Dysentery because of dirty water.\n23. Realizes I'm going to die.\n24. Cranks up "Let It Go" and slowly walks down mountain in a blizzard while crying, spraining ankle, firing my gun at things, tossing my items everywhere, cursing those damn wolves, and overdosing on pills. At least it was painless. ;-;\n25. Stares at deathscreen for awhile.\n\nI'd recommend it.","September 23, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some people may consider it looking a bit too fairy-tale-like, but for me it is suiting.\n\n4. SOUND\nThe sound effects are what builds up the atmosphere and they are very real. At some point even the howling wind gives you chills because it sounds similiar to the wolf's howling.\nThe music is heard only occasionally, but the moments choosen to play it build up the atmosphere even more.\nThere are two PC available - man and woman. Man is vioced by the Mass Effect no.1 voice actor Mark Meer. Female - I don't know, but I think she's not a professionall voice actress or at least for me her voices are disturbing.\n\nCONS:\nThe game got kind of tiresome after ~10h and a few deaths. There's lot of walking in the beginning and tt's also easy to die. If you die you loose your save. So, if you're hunted down on 2nd day due to distraction, you have to replay the whole part before it really got fun. I think it requires some sort of calibration yet.\n\nTo sum it up: This game is made by professionals, who left big gaming companies to create offbeat titles. It has great graphics, music, and nice gameplay. When the story mode will be available, it will be unbelievably good. I predict it will deliver one of the best gaming experience in a long time. And I don't mean survival enthusiasts.","October 8, 2014","true","14.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With that, I feel it is totally worth the price!\n\nI love exploration games, and this game has a lot of what I love: Abandoned places. It's mainly a survival/resource management game right now, with a Story Mode coming later.\n\nThe game is in ALPHA right now (not even Beta), and it's very fun so far. The developers are still working on fixes and features. They are also considering suggestions for additions to the game and Sandbox Mode. Who knows what will be here in the future, but I'm going to call it: $10 is worth the game right now, as an unfinished Alpha.\n\nWill it be worth $20 in the future with the Story Mode? Possible. The art style is very cool, and some real nice voice acting. I expect there to be plenty of care with the story mode, so I'm staying positive.","December 3, 2014","true","21.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really wanted to get to this place, I only had one bullet left and I had the feeling chances are of finding some more in this abandoned factory. As I came closer and started to walk slowly across the frozen sea, trying to make as little noises as possible, the wind turned and carried my scent towards the wolves. I pulled my gun off my back and as soon as I had my finger on the trigger I already heard paws and claws on the ice behind me, I turned around and looked the wolf right in the eyes, it was baring its teeth and growling. I slowly started walking backwards, the muzzle of the gun pointing towards the wolf but it did not seem that it wanted to attack me and my pulse started to normalize, but suddenly I ran into something, the chicken wire fence surrounding this place got me caught. More wolves where approaching in the distance and I had to make a decision, do I run towards and past the wolves or do I use my last bullet... The sound of a gunshot is incredible loud if you haven't heard any cars or planes for a few weeks, it made all the other wolves flee, perfect as I needed to gut the wolf because a man has to eat if he wants to survive in this cold hell. It took me almost two hours to skin this poor thing, I didn't want to shoot it, but it was hungry and it was either him or me...\n\nMy heart just stopped when I heard the breathing of something really big behind me, a big black bear stood not even 5 meters from me, I did not hear him coming because I was so busy pulling the pelt off this wolf, the smell of blood must've caught the bears attention. I slowly stood up, a mistake, the bear made a jump and his paws threw me to the ground, I was feeling his steamy breath in my face and I passed out...\nWas it the 350kg of pressure on my lungs, the pain of the bear digging his teeth into my shoulder or the fear which made me pass out? I don't know. But as I woke up It took me a few seconds to remember what just happened, I had pain everywhere and my vision was blurred, I looked around and saw my attacker who was just a few meters away feeding on the corpse of the wolf, I was lucky he liked that better then me.\nI dragged my body a few meters away as the bear noticed me and stopped eating and turned around and started walking towards me, with shaky hands I pulled out a flare and light it up. That was the best thing I could have done, the bear stopped and was afraid to come any closer.\n\nI barely made it into the factory and blood is pouring out of my shoulder, luckily I've found this bottle of antiseptic which burns like crazy but at least my wounds wont get infected.\nI can barely see anything because of the pain and its also very dark in here, it looks like a mattress is laying in that corner, time to rest a bit...\nThe few pieces wolf meat I was able to grab before the bear surprised me will be very useful to keep my stomach filled for a few days while I recover from my wounds.","October 31, 2015","true","207.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I had the day off and the blinds were drawn. As I pulled a sweater on and sipped some tea, I felt the chill as I loaded the Mystery Lake sandbox mode (the only mode available as of yet).\n\nWIth no map and a few supplies, I found myself in a cave that led out into a clearing, with snow blowing. I managed to find a few cabins along a lake, with some food to keep me going. I ate too quick, and stretched myself too thin in the first day. The harsh realities of survival set in quickly. You need to make calm and calculated decisions. Evaluate your needs and priorities. The game builds an amazing atmosphere, reminiscent of being out in the forests of northern Alberta myself. Hearing wolves call, and seeing a buck off in the distance, going about it's life in a world devoid of humans. The short days and the blowing cold outside the window.\n\nThis is a game that will addict you. It will give you the urge to stop down at your local MEC or REI to shop for a pack saw and a Coghlan's pocket can opener. You'll crave pork and beans in a way you never thought possible.\n\nFor all its simplicity, this game is an enjoyable experience. Hinterland has delivered that experience with simple aesthetic that transfers a complex atmosphere. One of emotional and physical desolation that instills in you the desire to survive.\n\nAn update: I brought this game out again after about half a year collecting dust, and they've made some great improvements, added new areas, refined a lot of the mechanics and crafting.\n\nI can not stress enough: one of the best things about this game is it is *not* procedural. Somebody actually put work into crafting the environments, and they're crafted well because of it. It does not look like an AI hit copy-paste. The artwork and modelling is fantastic, something a lot of the crafting/survival games right now lack.","December 11, 2014","true","32.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is gorgeous, and simply exploring the vast expanse of Canadian wilderness becomes a main driving point as every new cabin or site you discover is like some sort of picturesque painting. I've amassed a considerable screenshot collection, utilizing the handy HD Screenshot (Hud Disabled) hotkey. The beauty is enchanting, but also deadly--which is another great aspect of this game. No zombies or otherworldly threat. Just nature's bites--the cold and the wolves. Those damn wolves...\n\nSurviving is a great challenge in either starting point, making each decision important since it is life or death with every hour that passes. A lot of games tout "Survival" as a selling point, but none have managed to really be an enjoyable experience to me until I played The Long Dark. I think the dev team have managed to strike a near-perfect balance of challenge and reward. Note that I've only played this on the standard diffuclty level--I've heard that the hardest difficulty adds more wolves... I'm confident they will change that and challenge the player some other way, as the wolves are notorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. Like I mentioned, however, I think standard strikes a great balance and has been a lot of fun.\n\nBe aware that there is currently no narrative story mode--Sandbox mode alone is worth the price during a sale. Throughout the play, you'll encounter hints as to what the story may be... I've had a lot of fun with the minimalism of it all, and to see that sense of mystery last so long is impressive. I still haven't explored every last bit of the lands yet, and now they are going to double the size of the explorable terrain! So, I'll just leave off with that--I'm impressed with this game!!","January 31, 2015","true","73.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And the worst time to get lost or caught in a natural disaster, is winter. Winter you fight the cold more than anything else. This is why i love this game so much. Its not too easy and not too too difficult. You actually have to look for supplies. Not to mention you start with absolutely nothing so its up to your wits about surviving.

Loots of loot, cool.\nGathered everything I possibly could, ended up carrying about 10kg+ beyond my capacity. Slow as ♥♥♥♥, couldn't run anymore. Maybe there's a cabin somewhere nearby outside?\nNo cabin's anywhere. Luckily I've got plenty of supplies, huh.\nFound a cave. Got even more loot, now carrying around 20kg beyond my capacity. Can barely walk. Maybe there's a cabin nearby the exit of the cave.\nGot out of the cave. Does nobody have a house on this god forsaken place?????? Dropped what I could and consumed some supplies so I wouldn't be so slow.\nDay 4 and I have absolutely no idea of where the ♥♥♥♥ I am. Walking in a frozen lake, ended up on the other side of the hydro dam. ♥♥♥♥.\nGive up on finding another cabin, just wanna go back to my own, with a bed, and a stove and a safe I still have hopes on findind the combination to. Couldn't find any way into the hydro dam.\nAt this point, I have absolutely no idea of what I did. Found the cave again, couldn't retrace my steps - seriously, what's wrong with me? - found another exit.\nEnded up in pleasant valley. Found hilltop cave. At least I have shelter. Now I'm only about 9kg beyond my carrying capacity. I can finally run, ♥♥♥♥ yeah!\nThere's a habitation somewhere nearby, hopes up again.\nFound a frozen deer, 8kg of meat. Back to carrying way beyond my capacities, slow down again. Almost froze myself, got back to the cave entrance to build a firecamp and rest.\nMade it to day 5. Terrified of leaving and not only not being able to find the house, but losing this cozy cave. Geting out of fire supplies thou'.\nAt this point, I just gave up on getting back to Trapper's cabin at Mistery Lake. I just wanna find another cabin and I'm never freakin' leaving the place.\nI'll die there if I must, thank you very much.\n\n\nCan't wait for the story mode :)\nHope it won't require much of my very poor sense of direction. (Also hope I never need it on real life. Stay strong, GPS. Stay strong.)","January 7","true","5.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

Using your brains to plan your meals, your travel and managing your supplies is vital and making a mistake can quickly snowball for you. This game is one of the few true survival games without an overarching threat (zombie invasion example) that asks if you could survive under possible conditions that could happen today. Just get it and try it. It'll be brutal but as you learn you'll enjoy the true curve and every run more and more.","May 15","true","93.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Long Dark looks great, plays very well for an early access game and is not only addictive but very challenging.  It takes a slightly different approach to the survival genre and excels in it.","May 17","true","96.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The long dark is absolutely amazing and one of the best games I have ever played.. It's got a steep learning curve, but it's so insanely rewarding once you take the time to learn and understand the dynamics. From playing about every survival game available I can say that these guys nail atmosphere.\n\nI have a bear near the farmstead, he's always there, I named him Barney, I once thought of killing Barney cause he was roaming near the house and he was getting a little rowdy, I'm very happy I did not, I keep my distance and the wolves theirs, no one's gonna mess with Barney so we have this weird relationship. I've spent hours in this game just sitting and watching the sun set, Barney grunting in the distance..

I had lots of food, I had plenty of water, good clothes and a nice warm hut to live in. I noticed I was running out of firewood tough, so I went outside and had a look at the weather. It looked good enough and I had a couple of (ingame) hours left before dark. After getting myself some firewood, I started to head back and out of nowhere a snowstorm showed up.\n\nI got lost on my way back to my hut and the sun was setting. I wondered around for a while trying to find something familiar but I couldn't see more than a couple of meters in front of me. I realized the longer I stayed out in the freezing wind the less time I had. My character was freezing pretty badly by now.\n\nIn a last ditch attempt I went back the way I came where I had seen an old wind shelter. It was just big enough to fit in. I crawled in and tried to start a fire. I didn't have any accelerant with me so I couldn't get it going. I tried again and again. The storm wasn't getting any better. And by now the temperature was below -40 degrees Celsius. I came to the realization that I wouldn't get out of this. By now my character was too cold to even try to light a fire. I lit a match and held it up which increased the temperature inside the small wooden shelter by a degree or so. It was meaningless of course.\nI wrote a few last words in the diary and drifted off to sleep, never to wake again.","May 16","true","11.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've found my heart pounding a couple of times after narrowly escaping a close encounter with the punishing wildlife, and spent some serious time pondering the best courses of actions (certainly more time than I would in any other game). You need to plan every outing somewhat carefully and be always ready to make a beeline back to wherever it is you call home.\nThe beautiful art design and the amazing audio really conspire to pull you into the Canadian wilderness to a level that I believe could only be surpassed by the implementation of a VR mode, if at all.\nI am really looking forward to the full release and playing what promises to be an intense story-driven survival experience.\n","May 15","true","17.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Being that it is a survival Game (I Love Survival Games)\n\n2.	Secondly this game has very realistic mechanics. (Such as stamina meter, food bar etc.)\n\n3.	Very nice graphics that make this game playable on almost anything.\n\n4.	Very spot on to what the northern Canadian wilderness is like (Being I live in northern Canada so yes I know)\n\n5.	Also this is an early access which means you have a voice in the development of the Game.\n\n6.	The story mode will be coming out for the game (Can’t Wait)\n\nSo if your satisfied with this review get the game you probably won’t regret it (I Don’t)\nI Give this game a 10/10 for current state (Can’t wait for more Updates)\n","March 10","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is not a lot of content out there due to it's early version, but it's still sucks you in pretty easily. It offers some realistic elements that are together making it a great survival experience.\nExploring the world while scavenging for food and tools is surprisingly not boring at all compared to all those "running simulators" survival games, probably because of it's gorgeous world (that is not randomly generated, BTW), and it's a bit creepy, which is nice.\nWhen it comes to the mechanics and technical stability it's clear that these developers really know their business.\n\nI played a few early access titles, but non of them showed some real potential like The Long Dark. Buy it. I think that even if your not a survival games enthusiast, you'll still find The Long Dark very enjoyable.","November 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I liked the lineup of Dev's and the trailers where eerily exciting.\nI won't say the game is perfect yet, but when I'm sitting with my headphones on, and hear every little breeze, breath and howl, I'm in the game.\nThere is still work to be done on the whole eating/warmth area, but as a EA, I am happy with the gameplay. I have played through so many times, and I still love the feeling I get wham I'm searching a frozen corps, in the middle of the wilderness, and I have visions of hunkering down, and ravaging the beef jerky I just found, to take away the stomach rumbles, and enough to get me to the next place I'm trekking too.\n\nIf you are looking for a shooting/hunting game, where you have to go out and hunt deer to eat, then this isn't for you. As a Survival Sim, the Developers have dome a great job, to make you believe that you tare there, surviving, having to repair your jeans, before you head out to forage wood, so you don't freeze to death.\nI for one, am very happy with this game, but it is a really different learning curve to any other game you have played. There is a system to surviving, and once you find that, you will be wanting to get back to it, to beat that 20 day run. Can you make it to 30  . . .??\n\nI give it a thumbs up, because I'm excited to see where this is going, and considering we are 5 days in to it, and its EA, there is a LOT of room to move and make this such a beautiful world to explore.\nThe soundtrack, voice overs and Art is worth the look, and price of admission :D","September 23, 2014","true","493.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The Long dark can either be a beautiful and relaxing experience seeing the many alluring locations and places you can see will leave you in awe or you can have an intense and will breaking experience with bears and wolves lurking in the places where you won't expect and food and supplies being scarce. You can choose various places to settle in and make a home , my personal favourite being the Trappers Lodge which has a good chance of spawning a Hunting rifle with and coems with a good amount of storage and a nice cozy fireplace for keeping warm during snow storms and boiling water. The Long Dark is a great game to get if you like taking a nice break from multiplayer games and just want to unwind and rest and take in the amazing places you can visit or if you want a good difficult challenge this game is still the game for you.\n\n","March 16","true","28.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

Alone, cold and getting colder. What do I do? I need food, water, shelter. Trudging through the thick snow, I decide my best bet is to find some high ground and hope I can spot something that may be of use. As I reach the peak I see a small wooden structure next to a pond. Eagerly I rush down the side of the hill, hoping that I may find something of use. Inside is a can of beans, and not much else. Quickly I collect my prize and scavenge a small bundle of sticks that may be I can use for a fire if I can't find some place to hold up for the night. A little ways in the distance I see a flock of crows cawing, and circling over something. I decide to check it out. There in the snow bank, right under where the black birds hover is a man, dead. Covered in ice and snow. Most likely lost his way in a storm, looking for shelter or food, the same way I am. Is this my future? No, I won't end up like him. All I need to do is find some place to hold up and eventually, surely, help will come. I search his body, no time to pay respects. The sun is setting and I need to move. Maybe he has something that will help me avoid the same outcome as him. A smile spreads across my face. A pocket knife! Jackpot! I need to move now. I think I see something in the distance.\n\nNight 1:\nThe house must have belonged to a trapper. Inside was a rifle, with a couple rounds, and some wire traps for small game. I've never hunted in my life, but necessity demands that I learn on the fly now. I tore the cabin apart, scavenging whatever I could use. I'm so cold though. Snow clinging to almost every inch of my clothing. It took a few tries, but I was able to get a fire started in the stove in the corner. Good thing I had those matches on me during the crash. There's only a few left though. I'll need to be careful how I use them. Right now these are the most precious tools to me. Each small stick is precious to seperate me from death. As I warm myself by the fire, I decide to melt some of the snow to give myself a small supply of drinking water. As the water boils I also use my newly found pocket knife to open the can of beans. Heating them on the fire I gulp it down as soon as they're done. Back home this would barely pass as a snack. Here it's a gourmet meal. It's time I get some sleep. In the morning I need to hunt. Other than a small package of jerky and a candy bar I found in the cabin, I'm not very well stocked. Hopefully my first hunting trip will pay off.\n\nDay 2:\nMaybe I should've watched somet hunting shows when I was back home. It occurs to me I know almost nothing on how to hunt and trap. I set up the wire trap in the woods, but unless a rabbit just happens to strangle itself in it I don't think I'm going to have much luck. I'll come back and check in awhile. In the meantime I'll try to track down one of those deer I saw yesterday.\n\nThe trap is empty. Go figure. My stomach is growling. The candy bar did little to slate my hunger. What the hell am I going to do? I pick up the trap. Maybe I'll have better luck somewhere else? What's that? Out the corner of my eye I see movement. A buck! Holy ♥♥♥♥! No way! Maybe someone up there is looking out for me after all! I crouch trying to hide my presents as I bring the rifles sights up. I've only ever fired a BB gun before, but it's the same concept right? I line the sights up, centering them near the deers heart. I let out my breath slowly, as I go to pull the trigger...\n\nNight 2\nThe irony isn't lost on me, even as I sit here, the Long Dark creeping in on me. My head hurts, I can hear my own heart beat pulsing in my ears. I killed the deer. One shot. It went down like I was an expert. I even was able to skin it, gut it, and harvest the meat, something I never thought I'd ever do. I had a feast all laid out in front of me. Yet in the end it wasn't lack of food or shelter that will do me in. Fire. God damned fire. Something that the earliest man knew how to use somehow eludes me. I couldn't get the fire started again. I had two matches and both times the fire only flickered and died. I have no way to start it. In a panic I ran outside to go look for something to start it with, but it's midnight and a storm hit. I can't see a foot in front of my face. I'm lost, I think I've been going in circles. I don't remember where the cabin is. I chuckle as I think of how bad I am at this. I couldn't even survive 2 nights on my own. No ones coming for me, there won't be a rescue party, and in the end I'm destined to die here in the snow. I close my eyes and wait for the end. I just hope that the darkness comes for me before the wolves do.\n\nPROS:\n-Fantastic survival simulator, even at this early stage of development. Already have put 4 hours in and will continue to put in more.\n-2 large maps\n-Each playthrough feels different\n-Challenging. 2 days is the longest I've survived so far\n-Great atmosphere, and feeling of lonliness and isolation\n-Wolves stalk you, and at night their eyes glow and makes you feel like you're in "The Grey." A+ for that.\n-No map. I count this as a pro because you have to rely on your own memory of where things are. When storms hit you can quickly become disoriented and lose your way which is thrilling.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The coastal highway map feels a bit too easy. I came across a town with several houses and have found a virtually endless supply of food, water, and great clothing. Not to mention it's next to several fishing spots. When your supplies are in abundance the game loses it's sense of adventure and danger, and thus loses a large amount of fun\n-Items are randomly placed every game, but structures are not. This means you can eventualy learn the map and find all houses quickly just from memory. Though it's random what you'll find, knowing where to look eliminates some of the challenge of surviving.\n-Only animals you'll currently see are deer, rabbits, and wolves. Here's hoping we see some new fauna additions in the future.\n-Not a lot to do when you're well fed, and stuck inside during a blizzard. A way to level up your abilities with out having to repair/craft something would be nice, like reading books, etc.","January 1, 2015","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

There is however a small mountain, weary of the weather, I already tire of the snow and it's obstacles and in hope, there is maybe a cabin just up this slope.\n\nGrowling, I hear growling.. The predatory eyes of another hungry being that is not I. the gleam of the carnivore's fangs quickly strikes me with fear, it is as if the hungry, angered gaze of this wolf grasps my heart and does not let me go. With courage, I slowly take a step back, the snow creaks underneath my soles. With a sudden rush, the wolf leaps at me and it's fangs delve with hunger and anger in against my neck. I try to hit, to fight!

The Long Dark is one of those gems that still has dust and mud all over, but you know will be worth in the end. I so far have found a couple of glitches like wolves getting stuck inside a tree or even myself getting stuck where I should be able to walk and pass freely. Despite glitches and difficulty (which can be extremely high at times) I loved the game. I'll be brief with the review:\n\na) Graphics 8/10: good and different. If you're looking for detailed textures and realism this ain't for you\nb) Gameplay 9/10: frustrating at times (killed by falling from the edge of a mountain when walking at night), foolish at others (spent a week eating cooked meat, drinking water, and sleeping 12 hours in a row), but overall balanced. Make sure you get some experience before trying hard mode\nc) Sound 8/10: effects are pretty good. Wind, wolves, even drinnking water sound good to me.\nd) Replay value 9/10: you'll find yourself trying over and over again till you kill those mother***** wolves or find better resources\ne) Concept 10/10: the idea is amazing. Co op, bigger maps, more loot, more crafting chances, less wolves, more guns and ammo, these are some ideas I'd like to see in the future.\n\nMY VERDICT: Worth a try","January 3, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Me too bro.  That's one of my favorite things about The Long Dark; it's unique.  Your biggest enemies are the elements, wolves, and your own human needs.  Hunt for food, boil snow for water, find better clothing to stay warm.  It sounds simple, but it's surprisingly difficult to keep yourself in homeostasis.

But here's my impressions from right now.\n\nThis is the world's finest Siuntio-simulator! If you don't know what Siuntio is it's the small town where I live in Southern Finland which is known for it's... nothing really. We might have a few less wolves but just as few houses and as many trees. Oh, and the amount of snow portrayed in The Long Dark is nothing compared to what we get in late January...\nOh damn, anyways... The Long Dark! It's a survival game... NO! Please don't leave! There's no zombies... I promise!\n\nYou crash your plane in Canada Siuntio due to some phenomenon that you can read about in the "About the game"-part above. After that... you just gotta survive. For as long as you can. In first person.\nFind food, find firewood, hide from wolves, find shelter and fire, scavange houses and frozen bodies. It's just really, really intense.\nBest way to describe how good this game feels is buy lending freely from another review and changing it around a bit;\nyou know that feeling when you've been out in the cold for a long time and you feel like you're gonna freeze to death even thou you're actually surrounded by people, houses and electricity - and then you get home and can cuddle with the heater for a few hours and get that cosy warm feeling? It's the same feeling you get when you're walking around in The Long Dark, freezing, and then finding shelter. It's just so damn immersive!","September 29, 2014","true","64.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I randomly found a trailer for this game about a year ago, and even then when it was pretty under the radar I was stoked to see it come to fruition.  I was very hopeful that this title would turn out well, but equally worried that it wouldn't be up to my expectations.  This game finally did it for me.  Survival at its core.  A harsh environment can be the most dangerous thing out there.  Some of the situations you encounter will catch you completely off guard.  You'll feel quite comfortable with your current setup and then something will go horribly, horribly wrong.  I made it to seven days so far, and even that was pretty impressive for me. My character was constantly freezing everytime I went outside for a large portion of my run, and towards the end I had finally found some warm clothes to replace my nearly broken clothing; and I also managed to find a sewing kit to repair what I did have on!  I had just entered a fishing hole to search for items and knew where my destination was after I left there.  But fate chose to laugh at me, and moments later before I had a chance to look outside a monstrous storm began.  Incredibly short draw distance and incredibly low temperatures left me too my demise.  I was walking in the long dark, lost completely.  It was saddening, yet satisfying.  I had come so close to dying so many times, and just barely made it through it and found myself getting comfortable with my new set up each time.\n\nPositives:\n+ Feels like almost every moment can be your last.  Each decison you make counts.\n+ Amazing art direction\n+ Good graphics, yet small file size\n+ Tons of replayability\n+ Crafting is not overly-complicated, and straightforward\n+ Constantly changing meta due to Early Access changes as well as randomized locations for events; it makes the game feel like the environment can be harsher or more forgiving at times.\n\n\nThere's just a few things I'm still hoping for from this game that would bring it to perfection:\n- More animations, less loading bars.  I'd much rather see myself making the fire than seeing a loading bar as it progresses.\n-  Ability to use more items as weapons.  If I have a prybar, a hatchet, and a hunting knife, it's going to break immersion if I can't use any of these to help fend off the wolves.  Noise can be used to scare off wolves, and I'd love to also be able to use these weapons to create enough noise to scare them off as well.\n-  I love the number crunching for staying alive, but to be honest it kind of ditracts from the immersion.  If I just knew the character was hungry/thirsty that'd be good enough and probably better for the overall game.  We can't quite number crunch in real life unfortunately.  We don't know how many calories are in products unless labelled, and we don't know how many calories are currently in us.  These numbers matter, but that feels like it should be back-end and something the developers really know about and the players don't.  As a solution, perhaps if the player becomes severely dehydrated they end up becoming delerious, and can even go far as passing out? There's plenty of potential in removing the number crunching.\n- More interactivity with the environment.  I'd love to chop down a tree myself rather than clicking on a 'forage' button.  I'd also like to be able to incorprate plants/bushes for tinder\n- More options for hunting animals, more trap types, larger animal variety,\n- SHOVEL, seriously, there's so much potential!!!  Imagine you could stack up snow and create an igloo or snow fort in case of emergency.  There are real life situations where you can dig yourself into a hole, cover it, and survive; I'd love to see that implemented.  We've got to be able to create our own makeshift shelters.  Perhaps small leather tents we can construct as well.\n- This game screams co-op experience.  It may be ideal to only have one friend available for the current set up, but I'd love to see a team of four as well.  Something about trying to survive together just feels right.  Of course for the sake of balancing issues I would suggest only certain maps be available to co-op.\n- This one seems stupid but it's just a given, it's a survival game, and I don't think it detracts or makes the game silly or less serious by adding it; they should definitely allow you to drink your own urine.  Were in desperate need of fluid and on the verge of death, yet were too good to drink our own urine?  Come on.\n- Fall damage is a bit high in my personal opinion\n- On warmer days, have randomly placed thin ice\n- Raw meat seems to be okay with sitting out for days, while convienent for balancing, it's not exactly accurrate.  At the very least there could be containers outside of cabins to place them in to freeze, but not completely freeze over.\n- RARE Hostile/friendly AI human\n- Skiing poles as rare items to help scale steep heights,\n- Snow shoes as rare item to traverse deep snow with less fatigue.\n- Ability to carve wooden weaponry like a club or spear\n- Perhaps this is nitpicky, but I want to be able to see my feet/arms\n\nOverall: As an early access title this game easily earns an 8/10.  I'd love to give it a higher score, but it needs to keep expanding and have more content first.  There's a lot of promise in this game, loads of potential.  I'm already having a ton of fun with it. They've tapped into a lot of it already, but I'm really hoping they manage to keep this up.  I hope it takes them a long time to feel satisfied enough with the project to consider it a full release.  But in the mean time, support these devs, buy their game and enjoy!","November 28, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is however a small mountain, weary of the weather, I already tire of the snow and it's obstacles and in hope, there is maybe a cabin just up this slope.\n\nGrowling, I hear growling.. The predatory eyes of another hungry being that is not I. the gleam of the carnivore's fangs quickly strikes me with fear, it is as if the hungry, angered gaze of this wolf grasps my heart and does not let me go. With courage, I slowly take a step back, the snow creaks underneath my soles. With a sudden rush, the wolf leaps at me and it's fangs delve with hunger and anger in against my neck. I try to hit, to fight!

Me too bro.  That's one of my favorite things about The Long Dark; it's unique.  Your biggest enemies are the elements, wolves, and your own human needs.  Hunt for food, boil snow for water, find better clothing to stay warm.  It sounds simple, but it's surprisingly difficult to keep yourself in homeostasis.  True shelters are few and far between, and you will find yourself wandering through a blizzard because you ran out of food.\n\nCheck out a short gameplay video from the latest update for an idea on how this plays.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8EGLtGMtVA&list=UUyejDs7HftG00dQkl5thUow","December 19, 2014","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Spent the next two hours dying, a lot.\n\nIf you like survival games I recommend jumping straight in with the hardcore mode. Anything less and the game doesn't really pose much of a challenge. Also, try to avoid looking stuff up on the internet. It's quite rewarding when you slowly figure out how things work and you'll kick yourself for your previous stupidity when you do. Really gives you the sense of being some inept survivor stuck in a weilderness that you have no idea how to survive in.\n\nHas taken me around 20 gaming hours to finally craft all the available items and get to the point where I'd say I'm an accomplished survivor. I did nearly give up at one point, after a wolf surprise attacked me after around 10 days of game time (around 8 hours real time) and killed me but I persisted and later figured out better ways to survive wolf attacks with some pre planning.\n\nThere are a lot of tips I'd love to give you, as looking back I realise I spent many hours doing things the wrong way or not understanding a concept that meant I was dying more than I had to, but this is what made the game a challenge. If you can accept that you'll inevitably die many many times but each time you restart you'll be a little better and get a little further, then you'll enjoy the game immensely.\n\nSometimes it can feel like you're spening most your day constantly eating, drinking and sleeping just to keep yourself alive, with only a little time in between to explore. This did very nearly put me off, so be prepared to hit a point of frustration and battle through it. Once you get the hang of it though, you'll learn how better to keep your energy up and make efficient use of your time.\n\nOnly one info I will give is that the sandbox has three maps. These maps are interconnected from within the game. I assumed they were three entirely different worlds. It was nice to realise that once I was starting to understand the layout of the first map, I could actually walk to a new area entirely and so the fun of exporing would begin again.\n\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","49.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Straight out.  There's no one out there but you and the animals.  The game tracks your hunger, thirst, body temp, medical ailments(sickness/injury) and calorie intake and usage.  Failing to manage all of these correctly will result in the death of you.\n\nInventory.  This is your mini game to keep you occupied while trying to defrost your tootsies.  Clothes, food, water,  weapons and miscellaneous supplies all have a purpose and must be maintained to survive successfully.\n\nAnimals.  They're out there and so are you.  These towns are only big enough for one sheriff so show them who's boss.  But be warned.  A failed skirmish with a hostile animal can result in fatal injuries.\n\nThe environment.  This is the star of the show.  It will stop at nothing to kill you with its sudden storms, blistering winds or vast wilderness where one wrong turn could cost you more than just time.  I was in fog so thick I literally didn't know which way to go and I ended up getting lost.\n\nFor a survival game this is top of its class.  Don't let the art style throw you off.  This is the most realistic survival game to date.  No game makes you feel the desperation of scavenging like this one.  Just hoping to find something to eat or drink.  The relief of finding shelter just before nightfall to keep from freezing to death.  The fear of running in to a small pack of wolves as they feast on a dead animal carcass.  Or the absolute dread when night has fallen and you have inefficient supplies to make a fire.\n\nHow long can you survive?\n\n10/10\n\n","January 26","true","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They've added some more content and depth to the game, and the biggest factor of all, they finally increased the character's endurance when running (although there is still a lot of running/walking/traveling in this game).\n\nDay 23\nI'm on my way back to the dam's control room to collect a bunch of items i dropped since i couldn't carry them all back in one trip. After filling up my inventory, I begin to head back when i notice that this door is actually usable... I use this new door that leads to the back of the dam. Once out, I begin to look around to get a feel of the new environment. To the far left i see that there's another platform that may hold some promising items. To get across I'd have to hug the dam and tip toe across the protruding ledge. A few steps onto the ledge and I fall off the ledge onto the dam itself (the dam isn't completely vertical but at an angle)! I take only 15% damage, sprained my wrist (of course never my ankle when falling for some reason), and my clothes are a little ripped, no serious harm done. I'm off the ledge but still on the dam, so I take off all my clothes to prevent any damage to them. I take little jumps down the dam, slowly but surely. Eventually, I make it all the way down and begin to find my way back up to dam's door so i could try again. I tiptoe across the ledge once more. Yes ! I'm across the long part of the ledge. Now all i need to do is turn the corner. There's 8 more steps I need to make before i can be safe on the platform. Sure enough I fall again ! This time the injuries are more severe. I'm left with 12% hp left ! But I will not give up ! I head across to the other platform once more. Success ! I scour the platform and find nothing of value. Brrrrr... It's cold... What is this?! I'm suffering from hypothermia! FML I FORGOT TO PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON !! My hp is slowly ticking down... After putting my clothes back on, I race across the ledge once more, to  the dam's back door. WTF !?!? I LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF THE CONTROL ROOM?!?! WHO DOES THAT ?!?! I'm panicking ! My life's slowly dropping by the percent. Down to 8%... My vision's blurry and my character begins to wobble. He's blacking out and coming back. I attempt to make a fire, but no, it's too windy ! I run around the place looking for cover from the wind ! I travel down the  mountain on a path and finally manage to get the fire going, but am left with 4% hp. I throw some logs onto the fire and warm myself up entirely. I check the time, there's 4 hours left. I've got to reach some kind of shelter before nightfall or else i'll freeze to death. Perhaps I messed somthing up and the back door actually does open? Still blacking out and wobbling, I decided to head back up to the back door to check again. I take 4 steps. OWWWW, burning damage inflicted !! I WALKED OVER MY OWN FIRE ! IS THIS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE?? KILLING MYSELF BY WALKING OVER MY OWN FIRE??!!? Thankfully, I'm left with 2% health and minor burns... I travel upwards, towards the door, but alas, the door does not open... The only way to go is down the mountain and follow the frozen river. My character's still disoriented, I'm having trouble walking and navigating my way through this maze of a river. I take every turn, only to be led to a dead end. It seems like there's no way up and out of this river system, so i push through looking for some kind of exit... I finally reach the end.... I found the tunnel system. It seemed to be the only way out, so i went in. Bad idea. 10 Steps in and i literally could not tell which way was up or down. I see a frozen corpse. Ha, i guess he'll have a friend pretty soon. I personally, begin to get motion sickness. I'm lost and i honestly can't tell if i'm going forwards into the cave or going back to where i came in from..... I give up... I exit the game and decide to reload from my last save spot (where ever that is i do not know). It happens to be the moment i entered the cave. I quickly turn around and exit. Surely there has to be another way out of this river system.... Welp, time to go online and look for a map ! There's no map. I did however, find out that there are two entrances/exits to this river system... The cave and A MFING WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM TO THE DAM'S BACK DOOR!!!! I begin my journey back through the river/maze.... I'm beginning to feel tired... I'm forced to drop some inventory.... A dead end.... Another one.... Eventually i see open space. There's no mountains ahead. Sure enough, the dam appears. I travel up the moutain pass and reached the back door. Okay... I could barely cross the ledge at 100% health.... Now i've got to do it at 2% health.... I'm still wobbling, my screen is still fading in and out. I tip toe across the ledge and make sure i hit every wall there is to hit. I'm safe on the platform. I search for the window and slide my way inside of the dam. I recognize this area.... It's the deepest room inside of the dam and darkest..... I'll need a light source through the entire dam... I have a few matches and a flare.... I light the flare and race my way through the dam. I pass through the piles of items that i was supposed to retrieve. I pass through the door that started the entire journey. A few more minutes and i reach the front door of the dam. I drink and eat as much as i can. I check the time, less than an hour left of daylight ! It's a race against time ! I leave the dam with nothing but the clothes on my back and the single flare which only has 30% of it's original life left. I'm outside and it's dark. The time says less than one hour of daylight, but that's only referring to the temperature... I walk straight until i see the railroad. I place my feet on the railroad and look towards home, but i can barely see now. It's too dark ! I walk backwards, i've lost the railroad ! i look left or was it right? I see the way that isn't home and look the opposite direction. I see the bridge and railroad so I begin to walk. It's a long trek home. My flare dies out. The icon that tells me i'm suffering from lack of sleep appears. I march on. I reach a checkpoint, the trees that have been cut for lumber. I see that familiar corpse on the left side of the tracks.I reach the next checkpoint. The derailed carts. I walk around the carts and around the branch that blocks the way. From here on it's a straight path until home. I literally can not tell If i'm moving or not. I can only trust that i am. I march on. Waiting for some sign, for that opening in the mountains to the left that signifies that my cabin is there. I march on. Finally, i see the opening ! i see the black silouhette that resembles a house. I recognize that flag figure flying proudly atop the house. I run towards the house to the side i know the front door is on. I put my face against the side of the house and move left and right searching for the door. Is my face even against the wall or is it on the fence of the front porch?! I don't know, i can not see ! I try the back door which has no fence to protect it. I can't find that one either ! I back off from the house, trying to position myself to where i know the back door is, but i lose the house itself !! I see nothing but blackness. Am i touching the house or is it the mountains behind the house?!? I can not tell.... In time, i'm able to see that familiar silhoutte once more. I reposition myself and check my inventory to see if there's ANYTHING that can light the way... Apparently I left some matches in my backpack !! They must have been too light to throw away ! Thank god I was too lazy to toss them out ! I light a match against the wall of the house and am able to find the back door.... i light another match inside of the cabin so i can locate the stairs.  finally i'm safe at last.... I rest for 6 hours, not wanting to die of thirst or hunger. I wake up well enough to sleep for another 12 hours. Alas, I am home and rested, ready to journey once more...","December 19, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Я советую купить the long dark, не задумываясь. Даже находясь в глубокой бета версии игра представляла из себя интересный и красивый проект. Это редкость, так как мелкие разработчики "вот так" не начинают. По сравнению с "press X to win"-игр эта сильно отличается. Помимо прочего, разработчики не забросили игру, а продолжают её развивать и улучшать.\n\nНаиболее вероятная смерть в игре описывается: "придёт серенький волчок и укусит за бочок".\n\nОстрые проблемы\n1) Не знаю. С одной стороны мультиплеер в игре был бы отличной затеей, с другой - убьёт особенную атмосферу. Игр с такой атмосферой нет вообще.\n\n2) FPS ужасно проседает, и я не имею представления в чём причина: в движке или оптимизации, но однозначно что такая простенькая игра кушает много ресурсов и эту проблему нужно исправить.\n\n3) Даже консервы, газировки и военные сухпайки портятся. Как?! Как если они рассчитаны на годы и десятки лет. Тем более что я их сохраняю на "чёрный день". Срок годности продуктов в этой игре - очень острая и неприятная проблема.\n\n\nПожелания\n1) Игра представляет из себя отличную инструкцию "по выживанию".  Обновляйте в том же направлении. Кроме дезентерии, простуды, заражения крови и растяжений есть масса других недугов и заболеваний.\n\n2).\n\n3) Помимо керосинового фонаря есть обычный, на батарейках который и флюоресцентные трубочки. А так же лучина.\n\n4) У вещей отсутсвует физика. Может быть я хочу класть полено на полено. А что? Так красивее сразу становится.\n\n5).\n\n6) Добавьте в игру карту. Было бы невероятно удобно, но так, чтобы использовать карту можно было бы держа в руках и найти её было бы сложно, и для определённой локации.\n\n7) Как можно подхватить дизентерию при питье топлёного снега? Там же северная Канада, промышленности и загрязнений нет, а главное выпавший снег - это чистая дистиллированная вода.\n\n8) Очень неудобно использовать многочисленные предметы одного типа по одному, например тимофеевка луговая, дающая по 150 калорий. Нельзя ли сделать так, чтобы можно было выбрать нужное количество и использовать?\n\n9) Вещи имеют объём. А ящики, тумбочки, сумки и подобные вместилища для вещей в игре рассчитаны не на объём, а на вес. Это очень бредово.\n\n10) Если волк замечает меня или ест оленя/зайца (ко мне спиной), то он обязательно хочет и меня сожрать. Неправдоподобно, ведь будучи сытым или вкушая пищу захотеть схомячить и человека, наоборот, волк должен защищать свою пищу.\n\n11) Хотелось бы чтобы добавили ещё один фильтр при выборе вкладыша с едой - энергетическая ценность/вес. Стало бы удобнее (эффективнее) при выборе что съесть первым.\n\n12) Снег и лёд тают, когда на них горит костёр.","November 10, 2014","true","49.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I wasn't sure if it'd be that great. But I have instantly fell in love with this game. Within 10 hours of playing I was completely enveloped. The ambience and sound direction of the game are incredible. It really feels like your stranded out there in the freezing cold forests of Canada. The game offers good quality, challenging gameplay. Mistakes are punished and taking risks will either net you great reward or complete loss. Yes this game is early in development, but it is incredibly flushed out.\n\nIf you need a reason to buy this game simply listen to the words of our saviour Shia 'The Madman' Lebouff:\n"Do it!

I myself love survivals a lot and have had this game for a while. It can be a bit challenging, but half the fun with any survival game is that it challenges you.\n\nPros:\n+ Really beautiful art style. Amazing looking for how simple it is.\n+ Being able to survive for a long time has a really rewarding feeling that is hard to get in many other survival games.\n+ Game is very stable despite being an EA title. I honestly don't recall running into a single bug and it doesn't require a top notch PC to run.\n+ 3 difficulty levels have been added, no longer are you forced into one difficulty.\n+ Lots to explore if you want to. Quite a large world, but you don't have to play all areas if you don't want to, though I'd say that's half the fun. More maps coming as well.\n+ Steam workshop allows for player made language packs.\n\nCons:\n- Can be very easy to get lost if you're not 100% familiar with the map you're playing on.\n- Sometimes you get really crappy spawn luck and you either have to try to deal with it or start over. This is pretty much not an issue on easiest difficulty as resources are so common and wildlife doesn't attack.\n- No tutorial yet, so some things can be sort of confusing at first.\n- No customization at all, which is a con for me since I do love customizing things.\n- When you die, it's over, you have to begin anew.\n\nNeutrals:\n= Very little music, which could be good or bad depending on the person playing. I don't mind it so much, it helps to hear stuff around you.\n= Sometimes the sound effects are a bit irritating because of the repetitiveness, but overall they're not too bad.\n= I'm not a big fan of the inventory/conditions/crafting interfaces, but they're functional.\n= The environment can be very cruel, even on easiest difficulty. This can be a big con for people new to survivals and not good at managing themselves in-game. To me it's just part of the game, though, so at worst this is a neutral point for me.\n= Map setup doesn't change each play through, other than actual items you pick up (though some locations have exclusive or almost guaranteed spawns so they need to be checked for certain items). This can be both good and bad because it makes the maps predictable once you're used to them, which hurts replayability a little, but also allows replays to go smoother.\n= No story mode for the moment, but that is in development.\n= Development has been a bit slow lately, but it's not a huge team and there's a lot to do in the game in it's current state, so I would still argue it's still a worthwhile buy.\n\n---\n\nThe pros greatly outweigh the cons in my opinion. It does get frustrating when you've made good progress and some random fluke of a thing kills you, but for some reason that doesn't make me stop playing it, when most games would frustrate me to the point of not being able to play again by doing that. Perhaps those with rage issues should pass this game up, though.\n\nI highly recommend that anyone new to the game uses the community made maps. None of them are 100% accurate and you may need to make note of the differences yourself, but they will give you a pretty good idea of where you're going at first and eventually you won't need them because the maps don't change each playthrough. I still find them useful though for planning where I'm going to go when I start a new game or for when I have to stop playing, I can cross off the locations I've visited so I don't forget.","December 17, 2014","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You see, on the contrary from other survival games, The Long Dark has you searching for shelter in the blistering frost world that surrounds you, taking everything you can get from homes and landmarks that have all since been abandoned. In conclusion, The Long Dark in my opinion is more "survival" based instead of building based.\n\nR: Replayability- There are Three unique and rather "Large" maps, notice I use quotes as I feel that the word "large" is ineffective in describing just how incredibly expansive these maps are which make for a long quest to truly see what The Long Dark has to offer, even I have yet to discover much about The Long Dark... Quite strange for an Early Access title I must say.\n\nD: Difficulty- There are three difficulty modes, in short there's a passive mode, a not too agressive wild life mode, and finally, a truly difficult survival experience HOWEVER, much of the game's difficulty is based upon ammo and resources that spawn throughout whatever map you may so choose. As I have said before, you are a scavenger, no bullets or food spawns you starve.

It makes all these modern day folk that only care about graphics remember how good gameplay is. That's why I like Valve so much because they care ALL ABOUT gameplay and graphics do not matter to me. It looks spectacular for the Unity Engine and is EXTREMELY difficult. Not so difficult that you would quit the game and get a refund, but the kind of difficult where you MIGHT quit and come back later and then start anew and have another fun adventure in the frozen wilderness. I don't even have any changes except for one thing ; I got caught on a snow polygon and was walking on the mountain top and all of a sudden out of nowhere sprained my ankle.

I was reluctant to try it at first but when I finally got it and started playing I was immediately blown away by the imagery and design. That was and remains to be my favorite part of the whole game. The graphics and landscape design aren't incredibly realistic but I believe that is what makes this game stand out. To me it's like everywhere I turn I'm looking at a beautiful painting that someone made with their own hands and imagination.\nBesides the imagery, I am impressed with how challenging the game is. There's no cutting corners here. I must admit, I am a known rage quitter, but I have yet to quit this game. No matter how many times my throat is ripped out by a wolf, I just want to keep trying, because unlike many other games this one is not monotonous. It's not trying to redo the same level over and over again every time you fail. Every time you die you come back in a completely random location with completely random gear.

Let me clarify what type of gameplay this game has so you get the idea of whether you want to play it or not.\n\n---------------------------------\nAt this CURRENT moment the game only offers the ability to play in sandbox mode. In this mode you spawn in a random area at a random time of day. The goal is to survive as long as you can and that's about it, however, it's not as easy as you'd always assume. The loot around the area is also random so you may be lucky or unlucky as to what you will find. I don't think you can be soo unlucky that you will die right from the start but you may not find something as valuable as a sewing kit.\n\nYou have to deal with many issues in this game such as starvation, dehydration, fatigue, injuries, freezing, etc. There is food within the game as random loot as well as raw meat from animals which you can cook on a fire. Having something to drink can be random or you can melt snow to get water and you will need to boil water to purify it for safe drinking unless you have a water purifier. If you carry too much weight you will get fatigued very fast as well as running around everywhere and burning your calories which is another thing in the game. Depending on the quality of your items and what they are changes how well you can survive outside for extended periods of time and being by a fire isn't going to help you if it's windy and freezing outside so going indoors is always a good option.\n\nThis alone wouldn't be much of a challenge but there are also wolves in the game and they are quite brutal. If one attacks you then you must build up strenth then attack it which can do 3 things: hurt the wolf a little, hurt the wolf enough to make it run away, or kill the wolf. If you are very tired and run into a wolf you are screwed because you cannot build much strength up at that time and you will be overpowered and killed.\n\nThe weather can be mellow, windy, or there may be a blizzard which will freeze you VERY fast if you are outside.\n\nThere will be more options and there will be a campaign but at the moment there is only sandbox survival which is still fun.\n---------------------------------\n\nThe art style is nice in this game and is different. The sounds are great and this is an overall nice game. Should you buy it? Completely up to you but at the current state $20 is a bit much but there is more content coming and I've been seeing 1-2 updates a day since launch so things are actually getting done and I believe my money was well spent so far.","September 26, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have had only had one life in this game and in the short time I've had more fun than many survival games have given me in many hours.\n\nI spawned in and the sun is just rising behind the mountains.  Snow is gently falling and I can see a clearing down the side of the hill I am standing on.  I make my way down and find it's a tiny encampent for loggers.  After searching through the trailers I find myself with a few cans of soda, peaches, and a new jacket.  Not a bad take.  Returning to the wilderness I begin to trek into the unknown.  After making my way through the woods and following a railroad it gets quite dark and I realize the sun is actually setting.  Now with a sense of urgency I begin to scramble for shelter.  The wind picks up and the snow begins to fall heavy on me.  I find an abandoned hydro dam and take shelter inside.  It's pitch black so I light my only flare to give me some sense of comfort.  After finding a crowbar I begin breaking into lockers and after finding some beef jerky and a knife I hear a menacing growl.  I turn around just in time to see a rather large wolf lunge at me and pin me to the ground.  After a brief struggle the wolf is now dead and I'm bleeding all over the place.  Turning the place upside down I managed to find some bandages and antiseptic and am able to treat my wound.  Fearing another wolf attack I head back outside and seek shelter elsewhere.  Walking around the darkness for what felt like hours I found a lookout tower.  This is my current shelter.  I managed to get a fire going and got a good nights rest.  Tomorrow is a new day and I can't wait to see how it unfolds.\n\nThis game even in its current lacking state is awesome.  The sense of immersion is unrivaled.  Going inside the dam was truly unnerving.  The echoes and emptiness in the halls set up the tension that built up to the wolf attack perfectly.  Wandering around in the dark as the storms began to roll in made me feel helpless and that's what a survival game should aim to do.  It's nice to see a survival game without zombies and this game offers a great challenge and a fantastic sense of immersion.  Get it. Play it.  Enjoy it.","September 23, 2014","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As I started walking forward I questioned myself, did I choose the right direction? All around me are trees and snow, wind and doubt, in the distance I see a shape taking form, a sign and guard rails. As I get closer I see the remnants of a road winding up a hill on my left, the wind is getting stronger and I can tell im moving slower, im taking a gamble there is shelter at the top of this hill. As I clear the top of the hill I see an outpost, 30 – 50 feet in the air atop a winding red staircase.\n\nStruggling to make it to the top of the stair I fall through the outpost’s door and into one small cramped abandoned rangers post. Rifle on the table, 5 shells on the floor, some kindling by the stove and an energy bar. I lit a small fire in the stove, but without proper clothing I never really warmed up. Taking some snow from outside I melted it on the stove, but before I could get it to boil the fire went out. I ate the energy bar and grabbed the rifle, made my way back into the howling wind, down the stairs and started descending down the hill.\n\nIm starting to freeze to death, no food, no shelter, no heat, it doesn’t look good. I follow the road heading away from the outpost atop the hill, the wind starts to die down and I can see further into the distance now. Round a small hill to my left and see a building in the distance built into a mountain, ive lost track of the road, lost under the snow, I head to the building. Under the snow I see something red, I get closer and see it is a dead fox, half eaten, mostly frozen. I have no tools, nothing to cut the meat, I have to abandon the carcass and pray there is food in the building up ahead.\n\nI open the giant metal door, this is a hydroelectric dam, empty and abandoned, dark and silent.  My body is going into shock, I have no food, no water, no way of building a fire. My only hope is to find a furnace and pray there is wood nearby to burn. As I walk into the main room coming through the front door I can see hulking machinery, up ahead, file cabinets to my right, and stairs going down to my left. It reminds me of something out of a horror movie, pitch black with only light from a small window, something is lighting up the stairs, beckoning me. Im dying, I can hear the wind outside starting to pick back up, I head down the stairs in a last ditch effort to find heat, to find what the light is coming from below. I take 3 steps and see a shadow at the bottom of the stairs, it’s a wolf, and it guarding something, meat… I pull out my rifle and before I can take aim the wolf lunges at me, I cant fight back, im too weak. I die on the floor of the building.\n\n","January 21, 2015","true","24.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great play value, but could be better.\n\nValue: 9/10\nThis game can be constantly replayed and has endless fun, the developers work hard on this game and post updates often, adding more value to the game. There is a great amount of good gameplay involved that is SLIGHTLY (0.000005%) impeded by constant wolves, but once you get a knife, oh, then its their time to worry.\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10\nAmazing singleplayer. Singleplayer is so far the only mode available, but still one of the best out there in the survival standpoint. All games seem to go for zombies and nuclear fallouts, while this game takes realism to a new level, its just you and the evilness of mother nature.\n\nCo-op: -\nNo Co-op yet, I really hope that the developers will eventually bring co-op to the table, as there would be even more fun. Its always more fun if you have great friends trying to survive also. Now, lemme get more in depth to why it has probably not been released: Resources. For two players you will either require double the resources, or have them left for dead to survive for mere days. There would have to be a lot more loot on the map or the friends would have to split up, one on Costal Highway, and one on Mystery lake, which would not be as fun.\n\nMultiplayer: -\nSame with Co-op, there would be great balancing issues, but If the devs could overcome that it would be so awesome to have multiplayer.\n\nContent: 9.5/10\nHunting, Scavenging, Foraging, Creating Fires, Taking Antibiotics for wolf attacks, this game has already such an indepth system of scavenging and everything. (It even includes infections :D)\n\nLength: 10/10\nExtremely long playthroughs are possible with proper management of health, condition, food, water, and a hefty supply of resources. You can probably sleep to day 50 on just one map alone before resources get extremely low.\n\nStory: 8/10\nNot much is known about the charachters. I know, they are making story mode. I cannot wait until it comes out, especially since they say it will be in episodes and seasons. If they make me pay for them as DLCs...\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nVery good, open gameplay. Basically an open world that allows for lots of fun.\n\nWith freinds: -\nNo co-op and multiplayer yet. I hope for them very soon.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nStrange and Mixed about the Graphics. Its like they tried to go BL style on some things as it looks like they tried to convert a cartoon to real life (Much like the SFM MLP models and such) It doesn't look as good as it could, but its ok. Graphics will hopefully get a huge overhaul to get more realism, or they will focus on a cartoon-like atmosphere. (I do not know which they will go for)\n\nPhysics: 9/10\nPhysics are ok, every once in a while I have a deer glitch through the rock (No joke I can upload a video of it right now, just add me and tell me to) and other problems. Lemme delve into realism here, because that is what the game is trying to do, you can run up hills, albeit slowly, not as realistic as you would severely hurt your ankles almost instantly, but in this game they survive. (Those are just nitpicking details)\n\nPerformance: 10/10\nHere is the problem for me: I run on a 8 month old gaming computer that is still better than most out there that are up to date. I cannot accurately tell you how much memory usage or stuff it uses as I do not check. This is what I can tell you: It runs flawlessly, transitions into houses (new levels/maps) are flawless and only take but a second or two, I have not tried crossing into coastal highway nor have I played coastal highway.\n\nSound: 8/10\nSound is good but maybe a little rough here and there.\n\nPolished: 8/10\nNothing majorly wrong with it but I still have not found the bunker, which is kinda annoying. (Overall great game, just a few flaws. I have heard of wolves invisible, but that is probably a graphics card problem not game problem)\n\nAtmosphere: 8.5/10\nThe vast landscape gives you a good immersive feel but could be better if they didn't have so much of the same trees making it all feel the same.\n\nObjectives: 9/10\nObjectives are pretty basic. Pretty much survive. The sub-objectives of that objective are vast and indephth, so the game is really good because of the mechanics and playstyle.\n\nClarity: 9/10\nNo problems with knowing where to go or what to do. (The story line will probably linear and very easy to follow when it comes out. I cant wait!)\n\nWorld: 9.5/10\nUnparalleled world. Massive world (Split in two so far) with mountains, caves, vast foliage, and tons of wildlife to try and kill you. Although most of the landscape has the same trees and plants so a lot of it looks the same. (More diverse?)\n\nCharacters: 8/10\nNot much is known about the characters. Once the story mode is released my rating will probably go up, unless the details we learn are useless and add no effect to the story or charachters.\n\nUI: 10/10\nGreat UI, I think It could have a pause feature while in the TAB menu, but that is just me.\n\nControls: 10/10\nGreat controls, can change key bindings to personal preference. (All buttons/actions are customizable)\n\nFreedom: 10/10\nAs much freedom as you could ask for. You can do whatever you want, such as going for a nature hike.\n\nInfluence: 10/10\nThe Gameplay is very dynamic and not linear at all. Your only objective is to survive and you can do that many ways. Scavenging DayZ style, or hunting Forest Gum style (yes I misspelled his name, and yes that was a horrible analogy as it was just meant to be a joke) Could have more maps or loot to make surviving longer possible.\n\nSettings: 9/10\nSettings are great, many different Graphic options (have not tried any but maximum) and key binding changing is easy. Audio and everything else in the menue is also great.\n\nCharacter progression: 6/10\nNo character progression, other than trying to survive.\n\nWeapon selection: 8/10\nHas limited weapons. Shotguns and (better) sniper rifles should all be added eventually. So far only 3 weapons or so.\n\nCustomization: 7/10\nNo weapon or item customization, only repair or harvest.\n\nAI: 8.5/10\nFor the most part the ai is fairly intelligent. Every once in a while are there weird glitches in the ai. Wolves have howl animation which in my eyes is pretty cool.\n\nUp to date: 9/10\nConstantly evolving as it is in Early Access, which is why I am being careful of what I state in this review. Everything might eventually change.\n\nReplayability: 10/10\nEntire game as stated above can be played up until forever if you get enough resources. The fun of surviving drives me to constantly replaythis.\n\nPace: 10/10\nYou can do everything at your own pace. No one rushes you. (Except for your Hunger, Thirst, Condition, Wolve Population and about 70 other things trying to kill you.)\n\nRepetitiveness: 9/10\nI guess some people can find it repetitive to constantly day after day survive in this game, but thats basically how life works, there are rarely any fun moments and mostly just work.\n\nRealism: 10/10\nRealism is very high in this game. Must I say more?\n\nDLC: -\nNo DLCs so far, MIGHT be some for the story, but I will be very sad if they make you pay for it. It it is like a free dlc then I will be happy even though its a DLC.\n\nAchievements: 10/10\nTrack how long you have survived with achievements. Its really exhilarating and a great feeling of accomplishment. Tip: for extra realism and feeling of accomplishment reset your achievement stats for The Long Dark.","November 28, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It makes all these modern day folk that only care about graphics remember how good gameplay is. That's why I like Valve so much because they care ALL ABOUT gameplay and graphics do not matter to me. It looks spectacular for the Unity Engine and is EXTREMELY difficult. Not so difficult that you would quit the game and get a refund, but the kind of difficult where you MIGHT quit and come back later and then start anew and have another fun adventure in the frozen wilderness. I don't even have any changes except for one thing ; I got caught on a snow polygon and was walking on the mountain top and all of a sudden out of nowhere sprained my ankle.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the first time I played the game there was an extra area to explore (The Coastal Highway). I would like ot see one feature added just for the sake of exploration: while I am able to save a game, it seems that I am unable to load from the save point after I have died.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gudgie/recommended/305620/","Gudgie","Gudgie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gudgie/","157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a very promising game if you like certain types of gameplay. Let me clarify what type of gameplay this game has so you get the idea of whether you want to play it or not.\n\n---------------------------------\nAt this CURRENT moment the game only offers the ability to play in sandbox mode. In this mode you spawn in a random area at a random time of day. The goal is to survive as long as you can and that's about it, however, it's not as easy as you'd always assume. The loot around the area is also random so you may be lucky or unlucky as to what you will find. I don't think you can be soo unlucky that you will die right from the start but you may not find something as valuable as a sewing kit.\n\nYou have to deal with many issues in this game such as starvation, dehydration, fatigue, injuries, freezing, etc. There is food within the game as random loot as well as raw meat from animals which you can cook on a fire. Having something to drink can be random or you can melt snow to get water and you will need to boil water to purify it for safe drinking unless you have a water purifier. If you carry too much weight you will get fatigued very fast as well as running around everywhere and burning your calories which is another thing in the game. Depending on the quality of your items and what they are changes how well you can survive outside for extended periods of time and being by a fire isn't going to help you if it's windy and freezing outside so going indoors is always a good option.\n\nThis alone wouldn't be much of a challenge but there are also wolves in the game and they are quite brutal. If one attacks you then you must build up strenth then attack it which can do 3 things: hurt the wolf a little, hurt the wolf enough to make it run away, or kill the wolf. If you are very tired and run into a wolf you are screwed because you cannot build much strength up at that time and you will be overpowered and killed.\n\nThe weather can be mellow, windy, or there may be a blizzard which will freeze you VERY fast if you are outside.\n\nThere will be more options and there will be a campaign but at the moment there is only sandbox survival which is still fun.\n---------------------------------\n\nThe art style is nice in this game and is different. The sounds are great and this is an overall nice game. Should you buy it? Completely up to you but at the current state $20 is a bit much but there is more content coming and I've been seeing 1-2 updates a day since launch so things are actually getting done and I believe my money was well spent so far.","September 26, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I finally found some train tracks and followed it until I found a derailed train and a collapsed tunnel, took shelter just inside the tunnel. Realized that I had no wood and it was almost dark, I scrambled to gather some wood nearby and literally minutes from freezing to death I built a big fire, enough wood to last most of the night. I rolled out my bedroll and slept til the fire was out. After I woke up, I finished off my food and drink most of my water and with only the moon as my light I wandered off in a random direction. Wandering past trees, rocks, for what seemed like a few hours I am already freezing again I see an opening and there on top of a cliff sits a hut, the trappers hut. With releif I ran there got inside and started a fire, stoked it to last a few hours, gathered some food and boiled water. After several hours of patching up, eating, drinking, I crash due to my condition being so bad.

(there is a storm and you can´t see anything, or you had to spend a round of ammo for a wolf, and you should never waste any food, so grap it and go back to camp..)\n\norientation is fun. playing a game without automap or any help is just great. i am back again playing bard´s tale, dungeon master, or ultima, where you had to make your own maps, or remember waypoints. but even then, in a storm, you will get lost really easy (seeing only about 10m or so..). this is hardcore. and i like it.\n\ncrafting means a lot of time, which means a lot of food, which means, it is not easy. :) repairing is the same. there are some things that may cause your realistic sense to go red, but not as many as in other games (e.g. you may eat many kilos of meat a day, or a few boxes of matches have a weight of half a kilo, and few things more.)\n\nall in all this is one of the hardest and best survival games i played. and i recommend it.","July 20, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They commuicate regularly and are very accessible through both the Steam and Hinterland forums for help, questions, bug reports, etc.  They are also very receptive to gameplay feedback as they are always seeking to improve gameplay.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's simply excellent.  It's challenging and VERY replayable.  Once a player gets the learning/playing curve down, survival is not horribly difficult... as long as you don't make any mistakes.  And mistakes can be costly, sometimes resulting in death.  Death is permanent and ends the play through, which simply adds to the challenge because developing character resources that allow more in game freedom (from the weather) takes a lot of time.\n\nThe player is on a constant hunt for survival resources, which includes food, water, clothing while being on the lookout for predators such as wolves (quite common) and bears (fairly rare).  Depending on the game difficulty level chosen, play through goes from relatively easy to incredibly difficult.\n\nThe game graphics are not high end/high definition, but are quite nice, and a starry night sky in this game is phenomenally beautiful.\n\nIf survival challenge games are your thing, then I highly recommend this game.","November 1, 2015","true","178.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Knifes and Axe's will help you alot in those situations and if you're lucky enuf to find a gun with ammo then it's the Wolf/s who should be afraid of you then.\n\nYou have two fairly big maps to play on at the moment, in the future hopefully there will be more as developemnt progresses, they are also promising a Story mode with some fairly famous voice actors such as Jennifer hale but that's still not in the current build, at the moment all you have is sandbox where you just try to survive for as long as possible and maybe also try earning some achievements to give yourself an objective once you manage to stock up on alot of things.\n\nBottom line :\nThe game is still lacking content but the content it has at the moment is enuf to keep you busy for a good few hours of survival fun, it's in my opinion much better then most unfinished survival games we have at the moment and it seems to occasionally go on a nice sale, if you see The Long Dark 50% off then I'd say pick it up if you like survival but for 20 Euros,ahh I'd say wait a bit for more content but even if you get it for 20 Euros i don't think you'll really regreat it that much, specially if you love these survival games and this is one of the few that's atm in a solid fun state unlike other games.","November 29, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I so far have found a couple of glitches like wolves getting stuck inside a tree or even myself getting stuck where I should be able to walk and pass freely.

If you're looking for detailed textures and realism this ain't for you\nb) Gameplay 9/10: frustrating at times (killed by falling from the edge of a mountain when walking at night), foolish at others (spent a week eating cooked meat, drinking water, and sleeping 12 hours in a row), but overall balanced. Make sure you get some experience before trying hard mode\nc) Sound 8/10: effects are pretty good.

I finally found some train tracks and followed it until I found a derailed train and a collapsed tunnel, took shelter just inside the tunnel. Realized that I had no wood and it was almost dark, I scrambled to gather some wood nearby and literally minutes from freezing to death I built a big fire, enough wood to last most of the night. I rolled out my bedroll and slept til the fire was out. After I woke up, I finished off my food and drink most of my water and with only the moon as my light I wandered off in a random direction. Wandering past trees, rocks, for what seemed like a few hours I am already freezing again I see an opening and there on top of a cliff sits a hut, the trappers hut. With releif I ran there got inside and started a fire, stoked it to last a few hours, gathered some food and boiled water. After several hours of patching up, eating, drinking, I crash due to my condition being so bad. Woke mid day and scavenged the rest of the hut and now I'm up to day four and after hunting I've got food and water for a while.

Suffice to say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe Long Dark is an Incredibly tense, beautiful and engaging wilderness survival game. Although the wildlife and combat are quite limited in the current version, the survival mechanics are very deep as you find yourelf in a constant struggle to stay alive as you scavenge for food/water and try to keep your character warm, healthy and rested,\n\nThe difficulty options are neat - allowing you to opt for a more ambient experience, a brutal survival experience or something in between - and it's nice to see you can choose your gender and environment before starting.\n\nThere's alot of fun to be had with this game in it's current state (sandbox mode) and I can only imagine it will get better as new mechanics, modes and environments are added.\n\nRecommended for fans of games like Don't Starve but I also encourage players who enjoy exploring vast yet delicate environments to give this a try.\n\n-----\n\nReview Update 1 - 11/6/2015:\n\nFollowing my review from December 2014, this game has went from strength to strength as the devs have added a host of new environments, wildlife and mechanics. Each update has been of a consistently high standard and I have no doubt they will continue to improve/refine the game as they push towards full release.\n\nEach of the sandboxes has a very distinct feel - forcing you to adapt your survival style as you progress - and the transisition areas between each sandbox are unique and challenging. The bears are a welcome addition as are the new crafting mechanics: such as curing of animal skins (which makes crafting of animal-based clothing a little trickier) and the bow and arrow (which provide a nice alternative to the rifle).\n\nThe general balancing has improved alot since I started playing this - providing a good mix of thoughtful exploration and harrowing survival - and the backpack interface has evolved nicely.\n\nThe Long Dark is undoubtedly one of the finest products on Steam and surely one of the best examples of Early Access done right.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n-----\n\nReview Update 2 - 13/2/2016\n\nFollowing my June 2015 update, the Hinterland team have added even more environments: including the oddly-sinister Desolation Point - where the ominous Processing Station contrasts starkly with the cosy Lighthouse - and highly-challenging Timberwolf Mountain - which requires nerves-of-steel to navigate its lakes, forests, slopes and caves.\n\nNew gameplay additions - such as the flare gun, rope climbing mechanics, ability to pick up stray wood and ability to break down items in the game world (one of my favourite additions since purchase) - serve to deepen the already-refined gameplay; nothing feels quite so humbling as finding a cosy cabin in the middle of a fierce storm then being forced to break and burn any remaining signs of humanity in order to stay warm.\n\nHinterland have overhauled the UI side of the game too with a much improved backpack interface, detailed logbook and stats screen and the ability to create multiple saves at once. You can also choose to start from any region now: a welcome edition for new players who will likely benefit as they attempt to hone their own survival style. You can now play the game with a controller as well as keyboard-and-mouse: the former feels good but the latter remains my weapon-of-choice.\n\nSince my last review I've clocked in almost 100 hours of playtime and reached the peak of Timberwolf Mountain: a great achievement indeed. I look forward to the impending Story mode but even without that feature, this game is already more than worth your time and money.\n\nEssential!","December 30, 2014","true","99.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sandbox mode available at early access is a decent game in itself and I am eagerly anticipating the story mode release to add more depth to the experience. I picked this game up during one of the sales and I think it offers excellent value for money in its current state.\n\nIn a genre otherwise swamped in zombies it is extremely refreshing to play a survival game where you are simply pitted against nature itself. This is certainly more than challenging enough and although the game is a sandbox, there are plenty of goals that will keep you interested. I spent a fair amount of time gaining the achievements and surviving the toughest settings and starter zones, something simply not possible till you've mastered the game in the earlier areas.\n\nThe game adds real peril and fear with the introduction of the wildlife and it's genuinely scary to be trying to find shelter in the darkness and come across a growling pair of green eyes or when you see the bear stand and sniff the air for the first time.\n\nPositives:\n- This game is a unique experience in an otherwise very predictable genre.\n- It's extremly well designed and balanced feeling very challenging without being impossible.\n- It's actually very addictive as the game constantly presents a new threat to your survival.\n- It feels like you've genuinely accomplished something when you become "sustainable".\n\nNegatives:\n- Graphically, this game is let down a touch and almost certainly due to a lack of budget when it was needed. As a very good game it shines on its gameplay but it is a shame it doesn't have the looks to match.\n- The game is surprisingly unforgiving in some of its starter locations which might lead to a newer player being presented with a very tough start to the game. Persevere if this happens to you, although frustrating, it is part of the charm.\n- Some of the sound balancing is a bit messed up. Most terrifying thing in the game? Bears? Wolves? Nope, spraining your flipping ankle. The sound scares the living heck outta me every time.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nI guess it depends if you like the idea of it, but if you do; this is arguably one of the finest survival titles ever made, and it isn't even finished yet.

I looked around looking at the sheer artistic beauty of this Canadian wasteland and saw in the distance a small green hut and ventured forth across the ice to it and upon arrival was met by great luck with a hunting rifle and a bullet being inside this small hut. upon exiting i see a large cabin on top of a large island and move towards it cautiosly, luck doesn't last forever. To my suprise i enter the house with no problems and inside find several days worth of supplies, a lantern, 5 more bullets, some better clothes and some food and drinks. I spent the night in this homely cabin and spent the next day exploring other green ice fishing cabins returning to my house at night. Knowing I would have to leave I cooked my raw food and kept my tinned produce for the days walking.\n\nAfter a short walk collecting a few bits of food and drink from a gas station I venture up a snow track lane and walk off to get to a small ranger station to see my surroundings. I reach the station and look out spotting a new place to discover, but I here footsteps behind me and a bear begins to charge me! I ran from the killer bear and when there is some distance between us I start to fire my gun at it's face striking 4 times before being mauled and thrown about by the bear like Leonardo Di Caprio in the Revenant. After a minute of being maulled in a brutal and beautiful animation i accept my death when the black screen comes only to discover that my clothing may have saved me. I'm bleeding and have just 30 seconds to heal myself. Frantically, through blurred vision, I grab my rifle off the floor and my peaches, the bear just 15 metres away, and sprint to a nearby rock so i can bandage myself. A moments respite.\n\nThe bear begins charging again and I sprint down some rocks spraining my ankle, thankfully I see a trailer to dive into for safety the bear right behind me. I get in and rest for a few hours to heal. Upon leaving the trailer I begin to celebrate, my fight with the bear was won! The bear led on the ground dead from blood loss and i begin my newest chapter.\n\nA day later a wolf attempts to attack me but i quickly light a flare and throw it at the wolf scaring it, feeling like Liam Neeson I Crouch down and put a bullet in the wolf's face. The same evening another experience with a bear went much better the last of my bullets in the bear I run into a building and sleep.\n\nDay 10 now I have become a survivor and I now wear the pelts of the bears as my clothing.","April 11","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I myself love survivals a lot and have had this game for a while. It can be a bit challenging, but half the fun with any survival game is that it challenges you.\n\nPros:\n+ Really beautiful art style. Amazing looking for how simple it is.\n+ Being able to survive for a long time has a really rewarding feeling that is hard to get in many other survival games.\n+ Game is very stable despite being an EA title. I honestly don't recall running into a single bug and it doesn't require a top notch PC to run.\n+ 3 difficulty levels have been added, no longer are you forced into one difficulty.\n+ Lots to explore if you want to. Quite a large world, but you don't have to play all areas if you don't want to, though I'd say that's half the fun. More maps coming as well.\n+ Steam workshop allows for player made language packs.\n\nCons:\n- Can be very easy to get lost if you're not 100% familiar with the map you're playing on.\n- Sometimes you get really crappy spawn luck and you either have to try to deal with it or start over. This is pretty much not an issue on easiest difficulty as resources are so common and wildlife doesn't attack.\n- No tutorial yet, so some things can be sort of confusing at first.\n- No customization at all, which is a con for me since I do love customizing things.\n- When you die, it's over, you have to begin anew.\n\nNeutrals:\n= Very little music, which could be good or bad depending on the person playing. I don't mind it so much, it helps to hear stuff around you.\n= Sometimes the sound effects are a bit irritating because of the repetitiveness, but overall they're not too bad.\n= I'm not a big fan of the inventory/conditions/crafting interfaces, but they're functional.\n= The environment can be very cruel, even on easiest difficulty. This can be a big con for people new to survivals and not good at managing themselves in-game. To me it's just part of the game, though, so at worst this is a neutral point for me.\n= Map setup doesn't change each play through, other than actual items you pick up (though some locations have exclusive or almost guaranteed spawns so they need to be checked for certain items). This can be both good and bad because it makes the maps predictable once you're used to them, which hurts replayability a little, but also allows replays to go smoother.\n= No story mode for the moment, but that is in development.\n= Development has been a bit slow lately, but it's not a huge team and there's a lot to do in the game in it's current state, so I would still argue it's still a worthwhile buy.\n\n---\n\nThe pros greatly outweigh the cons in my opinion. It does get frustrating when you've made good progress and some random fluke of a thing kills you, but for some reason that doesn't make me stop playing it, when most games would frustrate me to the point of not being able to play again by doing that. Perhaps those with rage issues should pass this game up, though.\n\nI highly recommend that anyone new to the game uses the community made maps. None of them are 100% accurate and you may need to make note of the differences yourself, but they will give you a pretty good idea of where you're going at first and eventually you won't need them because the maps don't change each playthrough. I still find them useful though for planning where I'm going to go when I start a new game or for when I have to stop playing, I can cross off the locations I've visited so I don't forget.","December 17, 2014","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Я советую купить the long dark, не задумываясь. Даже находясь в глубокой бета версии игра представляла из себя интересный и красивый проект. Это редкость, так как мелкие разработчики "вот так" не начинают. По сравнению с "press X to win"-игр эта сильно отличается. Помимо прочего, разработчики не забросили игру, а продолжают её развивать и улучшать.\n\nНаиболее вероятная смерть в игре описывается: "придёт серенький волчок и укусит за бочок".\n\nОстрые проблемы\n1) Не знаю. С одной стороны мультиплеер в игре был бы отличной затеей, с другой - убьёт особенную атмосферу. Игр с такой атмосферой нет вообще.\n\n2) FPS ужасно проседает, и я не имею представления в чём причина: в движке или оптимизации, но однозначно что такая простенькая игра кушает много ресурсов и эту проблему нужно исправить.\n\n3) Даже консервы, газировки и военные сухпайки портятся. Как?! Как если они рассчитаны на годы и десятки лет. Тем более что я их сохраняю на "чёрный день". Срок годности продуктов в этой игре - очень острая и неприятная проблема.\n\n\nПожелания\n1) Игра представляет из себя отличную инструкцию "по выживанию".  Обновляйте в том же направлении. Кроме дезентерии, простуды, заражения крови и растяжений есть масса других недугов и заболеваний.\n\n2).\n\n3) Помимо керосинового фонаря есть обычный, на батарейках который и флюоресцентные трубочки.

The ambience and sound direction of the game are incredible. It really feels like your stranded out there in the freezing cold forests of Canada. The game offers good quality, challenging gameplay.

With that out of the way, let's go with along with this review. Keep in mind I stand on a neutral ground, there are good and bad points noted in each section of this review, should you wish to point something out, by all means you are more than welcome to do so.\n\nDifficulty Settings ; While all three difficulty bring their flavors, I've tried the "Pilgrim" difficulty and I must say, it's too easy, when I read the wolves would only attacked when provoked I assumed that they would act like bears on the medium difficulty. They would stand their ground and growl at you. but no, they run with their tail between their legs. I think Wolves and bears should act like this on Pilgrim, they don't attack intentionally but if they spot you they stand their ground and dissuade you from getting closer, if you stand your ground too long or walk up to them, that would be considered as "provoked" which to me sounds more fair, adds a little bit more challenge to the player and makes the animals react in a more realistic manner. And flares would actually have a use in Pilgrim difficulty.\n\nGraphics ; There is little to say other than they are stunning but also reminds me a little bit of Dishonored, a painting like world. Simple yet... breathtaking. I hope this won't change in the future.\nGameplay...\n\nCalories ; A very interesting concept sure, but it seems that it's impossible to go over 2500 calories, I think over eating should be a thing, however doing so causes the player to suffer stomach aches if they really go over 2500 and in doing so their movements are sluggish and slow or perhaps even cause vomiting which in itself would cause losing water and calories in the body.\n\nWeather ; The weather of this game is what make it shine through many other survival titles, a blizzard can easily make a simple looting run for supplies into a living nightmare. Should I stick in the cabin in which I currently am or risk going outside with a blinding blizzard and probably get lost or run into wolves along the way back to the safehouse. Though it would be nice to have means to tell what kind of weather might be coming during the day or the next. For example we often identify pink clouds in the evening as a sign that a sunny day will come, such signs could be implemented in the future.\n\nCrafting/repair ; The crafting is well done, though it does deserve some fixing here and there. For instance sewing and fixing some objects ought to take more time. Or cleaning a gun should only need to be done once or twice since I've never seen anyone clean their gun over 15 times. if the barrel is that unclean you might as well just harvest it's base materials. As for the skins, I think there could be much more use out of them. Creating a bed for example and perhaps even a safehouse or if that's impossible create articles such as a working bench or crates to store items in a house that a player often comes back to or considers a safehouse.\n\nFishing/Hunting/looting ; Fishing is a nice part of the game, patience and reward but I've never seen anyone manage to get that many fishes without using any kind of bait. It would be nice to have to harvest some plants or find something that could be used as such for fishes. Hunting is the core for survival, it's rather well done though I would like for it to be harder than that to kill animals, a deer for example, you can go prone and literally crawl right next to it and shoot it right in the eye for an instakill and bears should be able to be killed with one well placed shot but of course, miss and get ready to be mauled to near death besides it's near impossible to carry the whole load of meat and guts a bear wields so it risk vs reward situation. Looting, the first things that end up in your hands are the most important part until you find a rifle or bow, but as soon as you are able to hunt down animals, such supplies turn into nothing more than a burden. I think they should have a use to other food, which in itself would increase the crafting possibilites.\n\nCooking ; Among the things that makes this game shine, the ability to craft many things found outside, but while this game is still in it's alpha stage, I believe it could use an even bigger variety to the crafting and cooking. For example you were able to kill many animals within a few days but all that meat is going to go away fast unless cooked but there should be the ability to have dried meat or someting of the sort, in itself the food's calorie value would be lower BUT it would last much longer, again risk vs reward.\n\nWeapons ; While a rifle and a bow are the most common weapons to be found, I do believe it would be best to have a wider variety of weapons. Being able to craft a bow is great but I think the bow itself needs something to help aim more, because right now, it's really hard to aim with. I am aware that with enough practice I should be able to get it right, it's still very hard to get used to. As for a rifle while there isn't an infinite amount of bullets, it would be nice to see more than just that like a shotgun or perhas a .22 rifle to hunt rabbits rather than just use snares to get them.","December 30, 2015","true","83.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You really have to push yourself to find the balance for exploration and hoarding. One of the first things you notice about this game is that it is fantasically, deceptively beautiful. I have lost myself in the art of the game only to find myself wandering off a cliff or into a den of wolves. There are only a few things I have issues with, the main being weapons. This isn't a first person shooter or anything, but one of the only weapons in the game is a hard to find/maintain gun. You can find knives, crowbars, and axes, but cannot use them for defence against wolves. The developers seem to always be updating and improving the game, so this could easily change. Overall, I think this is a fantastic game for casual or intense gamers.","December 27, 2015","true","37.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyrdsmyth/recommended/305620/","wyrdsmyth","Wyrdsmyth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyrdsmyth/","35 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wrote my original review (included below) for The Long Dark based on only a couple weeks of play, and so I felt it was a good idea to come back and update this review now that I've spent over 85 hours with this game.\n\nIn that time, the developers successfully upgraded the engine from Unity 4 to Unity 5 over the course of a few weeks, bringing added multi-core cpu and gpu support and increasing overall performance, therefore increasing the range of computers that can support this game.  In my case, I have been playing exclusively on a custom-built rig with the following specifications:\n\n▪ AMD K10-8750K ~3.7GHz 4-core + R7 APU\n▪ Gigabyte GA-F2A88XM-D3H microATX motherboard\n▪ Corsair 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM\n▪ Crucial MX100 512GB SSD (Windows 7 installed)\n▪ Crucial MX100 256GB SSD (Linux installed - at this time The Long Dark is not natively supported in this OS)\n▪ AOC E2727SHE 27" LCD monitor w/ 1920x1080 resolution\n\nWith the above system I have been able to play The Long Dark using the Ultra graphics setting, and all effects enabled, without any significant performance issues aside from occasional, slight stuttering in certain interior environments that are using special lighting effects.  I also stream the game from this computer via Steam on my late 2006 MacBook Pro over my local network (whenever I don't feel like playing in my office) with no significant performance issues.\n\nThe first thing that you should bear in mind is that this game gets continuous attention and responsive updates from the development team.  I am confident that Hinterland Games is committed to completing this game and feel that my money was well spent, enough so that I purchased a separate copy for my oldest daughter when she expressed interest in playing.  A big plus is the rapid release of bug fixes following each new release, and special effort is repeatedly made to assist those who have lost their loot in the process of upgrading to the latest version.\n\nThe Long Dark is very immersive, enough so that I have felt it in my fingers, hands, wrists and arms when the main character sprains an ankle.  This is primarily due to the spectacular voice acting.  Some people may be a little put off by the stylized graphics, but I do not find that they detract from immersion in any significant way.\n\nAfter being punished by my first few tries playing the game in Voyageur mode, I switched to Pilgrim in order to explore the maps and get a feel for how the game should be played.  Upon exploring the majority of the maps (and the new connecting area released since my initial review), I decided that I was no longer being challenged by the game and returned to Voyageur mode, which has since been a constant learning experience.  My longest run so far has been in Voyageur with 41 days completed at the time of this writing.\n\nThis is a survival game, and as such it approaches survival in a way that (in most cases) makes sense.  Some notable exceptions are the ability to carry a mug of coffee in your backpack without spilling it, the ability to craft a bow and arrows but the inability to fashion a basic spear, and the amount of food that must be consumed each day in order to survive might seem excessive.  These exceptions do not detract from my experience, however, and do not necessarily reflect the final version of the game when it is released.\n\nThat said, the player is rewarded by finding, repairing and crafting better gear, tools and shelter, all of which dramatically raise his or her chances of survival.  That said, it is still quite possible to make a bad decision that leads to your demise, and therefore every decision should be made with care.\n\nThe sense of danger that remains prevalent in Voyageur has been more than enough to keep me interested, and even though only Sandbox mode is currently available, the little stories that are created in day to day play are cool enough to share with others later.\n\nFor example, I discovered that wearing a wolf coat may surprise and frighten off a wolf, but it will come back to attack you when you are not expecting it.  After learning this the hard way (and surviving the event), I unexpectedly came upon another wolf who was frightened off by my sudden appearance.  This time I found a safe place to wait for the wolf to return, and after it failed to reach me, I successfully dispatched it with my rifle.  As I was building a fire in preparation to harvest the wolf's meat and fur, I was surprised by the arrival of a black bear.  I ran back to my safe place and shot it twice, the second time directly between the eyes.  Now I had more than enough food to last me for several days, and also the opportunity to harvest the necessary materials to make a bearskin bedroll, but I had to act quickly before the body began to decompose.\n\nIf you are at all interested in survival simulations, I cannot recommend The Long Dark strongly enough.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nBearing in mind this game is still in development, I've been hooked for over two weeks and played this to the exclusion of everything else during my spare time.  I like the pace, I like the challenge of surviving the elements, I like the concept of a massive CME knocking out the power worldwide, I like the option to choose a difficulty level without completely eliminating the challenge of the game, and I like the exploration elements involved.  The artistic styling of the renderings is simply gorgeous.\n\nThe ability to unlock maps by discovering them is a nice touch.  I can't wait to see what the story mode will have to offer when it becomes available.   I hope the devs will make it possible to play either gender in story mode as well as sandbox mode, because the voice acting by Jennifer Hale for this game is superb.","April 25, 2015","true","157.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

We are still waiting for the story mode.\n\nThis game is a survival masterpiece. Most survival games (or probbaby all of them) lack the reality. I mean let's say you are alone on an island. Is it reallistic to craft an axe, cut some trees and build a house in few hours (or few days)? It would take weeks for one human to do so and I'm in doubt that this would be possible at all (imagine you need to transport lumber - how?). Another thing - you are getting hungry what would you do? In most games you just hand kill an animal which by chance came near you. Too easy.\n\nYou won't find such things here. The game is as reallistic as possible. You can't build. You have to relay on what was already built. You can craft only some basic stuff like fishing hook, bow and arrows, skin clothes, torches etc. Hunting is really dificult. Unless you find a rifle (you will still be very limited with ammo though) you will either have to craft a bow (using which is very difficult) or try to get some food by chance. Of course you need to gather wood to boil things etc.\n\nYour main evemy is cold. Until you craft some better clothes you can't stay outside for a long time so you need a lot of planning. You will have to explore with a lot of common sense too - never go out too far without a chance of getting back. You will have to account for changing weather. You have no map, no compass and when visibility drops you are lost in a moment.\n\nThis game can give you a lot of fun for tenths of hours even though it's just a sandbox. Survival and exploration in the most realistic way. We are still waiting for the story mode. My guess is it won't be as deep as for example Fallout but still combining the most reallistic survival with a thrilling story can be perfect. I hope this game can be modded in the future so there could be more missions on different custom-made maps.\n\nIf you are not sure whether to get this game or not, wait for the story mode. It might skyrocket the fun even more. In one sentence - the most reallistic survival game out there.","November 22, 2015","true","68.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However when I have all 100% conditioned arrows or none arrows at all. The new crafted arrow does have 100% condition.\n\n- When the Wolfskin Coat is still in crafting, as in not being done yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kakoopa/recommended/305620/","Kakoopa","Filthy Acts at (asleep)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kakoopa/","437 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Long Dark is an extremely well put together game, that luckily has a developer team that updates it almost monthly.\n\nThe game as of right now is a sandbox survival game where, depending on your difficulty, you are put in a situation that you must quickly find your way out of, or you'll die. From there on out, you are met with the challenge of staying alive, and what a challenge that is. Usually, getting your thirst under control is easy, as long as you have a fire, you have a stable source of water. Then you have to find food. This is where the game can get difficult to deal with, as food can be tricky. Hunting is the greatest form of getting food, however, to do this, you either need a bow, or a gun. A bow can be gotten with a little work, however, a rifle, is a different story. You are left to the RNG Gods when it comes to important loot, and while the map doesn't change, the contents of it does.\n\nThe cold is a constant fight, and there are only a few times of day when the sun is out and beaming down enough to raise the temperature above 25 degrees, and usually, these times of day are the riskiest, with the most obvious being a few hours before night. This time is risky, because in this game, when things get dark, they get  dark.  Even with a lantern, or a torch, the night is thick, and the darkness is hard to see through, and most of the time, even with those sources of light, you can't see more than 10 feet in front of you, making stumbling over a wolf a genuine risk that could occur. Blizzards are much of the same, you cannot see 5 feet in front of you, the temperature falls to record lows, and the wind chill gets painful. Hypothermia is a real risk, and it's sometimes best to just stay inside.\n\nThe art style is wonderful, and charming. Along with this, it is also incredibly comfortable looking, with a wonderful looking lighting system that works alongside the art style beautifully. The insides of houses are comfortable and welcoming, and the outside is a cold, bitter wasteland, that is just as ready to welcome a poor soul as it is to pull that same soul in to chew it up, and spit it out.\n\nThe sounds in the game are minimal, but they work. The ambient sounds are usually few and far between, but they do the world a treat, adding both suspense and interest to it. The music is, as such, also incredible effective. Usually, it only comes when things are either at their best, or their worst. If you find a new place, you get to hear a small bit of music that is there to reward you for finding it. The other times it comes, is when your condition is low, and you're nearing death. The music becomes desperate, and urges you to fix the mistakes you've made before it's too late.\n\nHunting in the game is a treat, in which you actually have to track animals. If you don't kill it, it'll run away. This isn't the end of the world, however. Luckily, not only do they leave a blood trail, but all enemies have a bleed-out amount, meaning that eventually, they will die. And you can follow that same blood trail to find the body, if you can manage to stay warm enough. Along with this, the medical system is well done, it's nothing to write home about, but it works, and it's interesting. There are checks and balances. Everything can be healed over time, but sometimes, they can't be healed well without the correct medical supplies.\n\nSadly, with this being said, the fishing in this game is useless, except for a 1 or 2 time situation when you're near a place to fish and desperately need food. It is risky, it's incredibly hard to actually catch fish, when you DO catch fish, it usually ends up being too small to actually sustain you, and the places to fish are few and far between. It's better to just scrap the hook and line and use it for other things to fix other pieces of equipment. The metal is better used other ways.\n\nAs well as this, I wish the game had a map system, I'm not even asking for one that holds your hand, but maybe the ability to find maps that detail places that would actually have maps would be nice, and they'd allow your character to draw a map over time, ala Miasmata, after searching around and reconning it long enough.\n\nThere are so many reasons to get this game, and with story mode coming (next month?), there's even more. Where other Early Access games are only making minimal progress, this one is leaping ahead, with large improvements every single time. I could sing this games praises forever, and I couldn't recommend it more. If you're a fan of survival games, adventure games, or are interested in what the game looks like, get it. It's well supported by an active developement and as of yet I have found no bugs that have impacted my gameplay negatively.\n\n","December 21, 2015","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.\nPros(+)\n- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)\n- Surprisingly innovative\n- Low price compared to other survival games\n- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)\n- Huge world\nCons(-)\n- No jump button\n- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)\n- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)\nAll in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world.

Unlike other survival games on Steam that have never left Early Access, the game is focused around surviving, not crafting or zombie defense. Currently, only a Sandbox mode is available, however a Story mode is in the works and the developers keep us posted about it regularly.\n\nThe game is highly immersive and contains a fair degree of realism, in Sandbox you must look out for your health and supply stock to ensure you live as long as possible. However, I recommend starting on the Pilgrim difficulty due to the fact that death is permanent and wildlife is otherwise quite hostile - not only are you in the menu but you're also the main course. It could save you a lot of rage and false initial impressions about the game.\n\nHighly recommended - the game is guaranteed to bring out an inner survival instinct you never imagined you had in you - I always have a blast when i'm playing it!\n\nIf you fear your computer might be too slow to run the game, they have recently announced a feature-complete Xbox One edition available through the Game Preview program - as an admitted PC elitist, if you see me recommending this on a console is because the game is just criminally good. This is Early Access done right, and we should always support developers that support us. The average user score in the mid-90's or higher speaks for itself: developers listen to feedback and its player base is very fond of it - for good reasons.","January 1, 2015","true","243.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I adore the aesthetic and cannot express how I am drawn to the illustrious open world and the adventure it entails. As it is in Alpha, I have minor issues that, if fixed, could increase my respect for the developers even more so. Some of the gameplay aspects are a bit clunky, such as switching in and out of the inventory and to the personal status section, and having to alternate between them to determine a propeer course of action (that is, in terms of repairing or consuming one item over another based on the player's current condition). It makes the game feel less immersive and unnecessarily slow. However, every aspect of this game with the exception of this is beyond extraordinary, and if you crave a beautifully artistic world or immense strategic planning and quick-thinking survival tactics with intuitive gameplay, then this game is absolutely worth your time and money.\n\nI love this game.  :)","December 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If the map is unfamiliar you first go wandering to find a suitable homebase or shelter at least but after a few attempts at the same map I find that it switches to trying to find the necessary tools of survival such as a rifle (which has random spawn locations) that you can lug back with you to the homebase and safety you know is there.\n\nThe next few days can be bothersome because you eventually run into wolves and they can be a chore to deal with but fortunatly there is Pilgrim mode for when I just feel like exploring the world. This has to be on a different character as you can't switch between modes in the same playthrough. It's actually a very relaxing game to just enjoy the environments and the layout of the maps while exploring and watching the changes of the day as time rolls by. There is no fear of danger or even of dying in the cold weather as it is mostly milder and soon you'll be wearing the top tier homemade gear from a crafting table. After exploring in pilgrim mode you can than return to voyager or stalker mode to give yourself a survival challenge where dangerous animals lurk and hunt you, especially if you don't feel like staying indoors for days on end sleeping and starving or dehydrating yourself to get to the next day on the bare minimum and want to push yourself to the next map.\n\nThere are currently five maps in sandbox mode. Each with a transition zone in between to explore and challenge. Soon there will be a story mode, and the devs continually add to the game mechanics I hear. From screenshots I've seen the menus have changed which inform your stats. Before it would show the meters filling to indicate the bad things happening to your character; like cold, or hunger. Now they drain which is more intuitive, I think. when fully  drained and things start to go from bad to worse there will be an indicator on screen telling which bar has been drained or is near empty. Icicles for cold, a stomach for hunger, an eye for sleep, and a droplet for thirst. Cold is worst but your condition can drop to 65% before suffering the consequences like getting hypothermia.\n\nI think the fun of this game comes from trying to push your character to the brink and desperatly fighting to come back from it. Living through animal encounters where all your clothes have been torn to tatters and having to go out and hunt anyways because you need those skins for the repairs. Gambling on foraging for even more supplies like meds and bandages or plants when you only have a few more bullets in your rifle or a handful of flares to fend off wolves or bears. And finally when you are on the brink after a bear attack and you hear the sound of your own heartbeat as it slows and your character cant even walk straight as you bleed out. You at least have a chance to use bandages and run for safety but if you don't it can be an epic end to your run.\n\nIn short, I really like this game as it is right now but look forward to what else the devs will add. I hope they put in beavers. I want a homemade hat.","December 26, 2015","true","100.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Entered an old mining cave and found a granola bar, hopefully it would last me a few more hours, tried to go deeper into the cave, but it was dark, too dark…\n\nWhispers of the chilly wind made me nervous, I wasn’t sure anymore if I was just hearing things, so I tried to make a small camp fire, no luck, my fingers, they hurt so badly.\n\nTied up some cloth onto a piece of wood, tried six times to light up matchstick, it worked thank god, now I can explore the cave. Found a hunter’s knife, a rifle, and some canned goods by a frozen body, the ashes of some logs were scattered around him, a sign of struggle? His arms were gone, frost bite? Flesh freezes so easily.\n\nLuckily I found some coals along the way, hopefully this would make the fire last longer, built a small camp fire near the body, added some accelerants to boost it. Opened a can of peaches using the knife, held it on top of the fire to heat it up, finally some proper food.\n\nAdded a few more coals to help the fire last longer, settled up and placed the sleeping mat near the fire, removed the clothes from the frozen body and made a simple blanket from it, anything to keep me warm.\n\nTried to get some sleep, thought I was imagining things, when I saw it glowing, two orbs in the colour of red, eyes? Grabbed the rifle and the knife, but it was running towards me already, couldn’t aim as it was right behind me, no lights, just following the sound of the blizzard, as I got closer and closer, the wind sounded harsher and almost deafening, reached the gate and slammed it, knocking back the wolf, yeah that would save me some time, ran towards the road, but there was another one that lounged right at me.\n\nPain\n\nIt’s teeth stuck at my hand, biting down hard and wouldn’t budge, my things scattered across the snow, tried to reach the knife but it was too far, kneed it to the side of its ribs, it howled in pain, grabbed the rifle, aimed, ♥♥♥♥ no bullets, didn’t noticed the other one behind it, it tried to lounge at me, knocked him off with the rifle, now it’s broken.\n\nGrabbed the knife and ran along the cliff, a good 6 feet drop? The snow would absorb the impact, I hope, tried to get some space to run and jump, but the wolves caught up with me, heading straight for my leg, it bit me while we fell to the icy snow.\n\nA sprained ankle, a bleeding hand, a broken leg, one knife, and two wolves, if the injury couldn’t kill me, I bet the wolves will. Grabbed the knife and plunged it to my neck, good bye.\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

His instrumenst malfunctioned and he found that he had no idea where he was during flight. He wakes up in the snow and seems to have a few portions of food that survived the crash. Thankfully he crashed by train tracks, So just maybe he could find some signs of civilization. He goes on ahead and finds a train wreck with crows flying overhead. His stomach drops. and he already knows what he might find.\nSeveral dead bodies litter the area. He is getting really cold and needs to start a fire. He quickly pilfers through the belongings of these long dead men and manages to gather up soome matches and tinder. He tries to start the fire and fails. He should have paid more attention in army survival school. The cold is starting to burn him to his very depths. He is slowly going numb.\nAfter a hour or two of walking he seems something amazing ahead, A cabin! He sprints towards it with all his might, in the happiest mood ever. He may just survive this long enough to find someone who can help him. He goes inside and looks through everything, finding food first aid and flares. He also has a wood stove. Ofcourse another unfortunate thing he finds is a dead body. He cant quite tell the cause of death or how long this man has been dead. Probably awhile. He crawls to the warm bed and takes a two hour nap wrapped in blankets to warm up. He wakes up feeling refreshed. He has enough food and refreshments to last him a bit but he needs more. Either that or he needs to find a way to get help.\nHe leaves the cabin and sees several small ice-fishing huts out in the distance as well as some deer. After unsuccesfully sneaking up to, and running after some deer, he loots the ice huts and finds some useful things he can use to ice fish. He will need to go back to his hut and put these things together to make a legit fishing pole,\nBy the time Daryl makes it back to his cabin it is getting dark. He sleeps till morning and goes exploring some more. He finds some cabins past the ice fishing huts, and decides to loot those. He goes to search through a cave and finds a dead man with a knife by his body. He quickly grabs it up and makes his way further through the valley. He took a wrong step at one point, spraining his wrist terribly. He wrapped it up, so as to not bother him.\nHe hits a dead end in the valley and decides to turn back. He gets back to the cabin and still has daylight to spare so he decides to try to follow the track further, He does so and runs into another circling of crows. He continues to what looks like a train tunnel and maybe another wreck of some sort, but he also hears menacing snarls. Sure enough it is a wolf. He turns and sprints as fast as he can back to the cabin and makes it safely, thinking and hoping the wolf would not follow.\nHe is tired so he takes a little nap. He wakes up and creates some fishing supplies. HE is going to the ice fishing huts to grab some more food. He leaves the cabin only to hear the snarl of the wolf.\nHe runs with all is might towards the ice fishing hut and manages to leave the wolf behind him, only to see another wolf awaiting by the hut. IT runs at him, he is already out of breath,s o he has to stand and face the fast approaching wolf. IT jumps at him and bites his arm and knaws towards his chest. He stabs and slashes frantically, and manages a deep cut into the wolfs stomach, IT whimpers and limps quickly away, bleeding out quickly. He is however in the same predicament. He is getting cold quickly. He makes his way to the ice fishing hut and attempts to start a fire in the wood stove to warm up and maybe help him survive. He has no first aid supplies for this deep wound, He fails to start the fire due to fatigue and dizziness. He is losing all his focus now. He steps outside of the hut.\nHe is walking towards the cabing. Slowly his world is fading to black. This is where it ends he said.\nAs the whole world fades to black and he falls to the ground, he just hopes that the wolf suffered as much as he did. IT warm now as he fades out, and the world around him disappears...\n10/10","December 26, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I adore the aesthetic and cannot express how I am drawn to the illustrious open world and the adventure it entails. As it is in Alpha, I have minor issues that, if fixed, could increase my respect for the developers even more so. Some of the gameplay aspects are a bit clunky, such as switching in and out of the inventory and to the personal status section, and having to alternate between them to determine a propeer course of action (that is, in terms of repairing or consuming one item over another based on the player's current condition). It makes the game feel less immersive and unnecessarily slow. However, every aspect of this game with the exception of this is beyond extraordinary, and if you crave a beautifully artistic world or immense strategic planning and quick-thinking survival tactics with intuitive gameplay, then this game is absolutely worth your time and money.\n\nI love this game.  :)","December 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your teeth chatter because the windchill is hitting -21C. The door shuts behind you and you can hear the angry whistle of the winds outside frantically trying to rip through the ramshackle boards of the derelict structure. You think that you are alone in the structure with the sound of your winded breath, but find another person hunched over at the top of the staircase. Well, more of a decoration than a person. They've been a frozen reminder of your future for at least a week.\nYou drank your last can of soda before you went to sleep, so you'll need to leave the building and go back to searching for food. If you're lucky, the blizzard will stop, but after your plane crash and being stuck with no viable supplies, you aren't exactly the luckiest person in the world. Then again, up here, you are the only person.\n\n\nBuy this game.","December 26, 2015","true","75.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They've added some more content and depth to the game, and the biggest factor of all, they finally increased the character's endurance when running (although there is still a lot of running/walking/traveling in this game).\n\nDay 23\nI'm on my way back to the dam's control room to collect a bunch of items i dropped since i couldn't carry them all back in one trip. After filling up my inventory, I begin to head back when i notice that this door is actually usable... I use this new door that leads to the back of the dam. Once out, I begin to look around to get a feel of the new environment. To the far left i see that there's another platform that may hold some promising items. To get across I'd have to hug the dam and tip toe across the protruding ledge. A few steps onto the ledge and I fall off the ledge onto the dam itself (the dam isn't completely vertical but at an angle)! I take only 15% damage, sprained my wrist (of course never my ankle when falling for some reason), and my clothes are a little ripped, no serious harm done. I'm off the ledge but still on the dam, so I take off all my clothes to prevent any damage to them. I take little jumps down the dam, slowly but surely. Eventually, I make it all the way down and begin to find my way back up to dam's door so i could try again. I tiptoe across the ledge once more. Yes ! I'm across the long part of the ledge. Now all i need to do is turn the corner. There's 8 more steps I need to make before i can be safe on the platform. Sure enough I fall again ! This time the injuries are more severe. I'm left with 12% hp left ! But I will not give up ! I head across to the other platform once more. Success ! I scour the platform and find nothing of value. Brrrrr... It's cold... What is this?! I'm suffering from hypothermia! FML I FORGOT TO PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON !! My hp is slowly ticking down... After putting my clothes back on, I race across the ledge once more, to  the dam's back door. WTF !?!? I LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF THE CONTROL ROOM?!?! WHO DOES THAT ?!?! I'm panicking ! My life's slowly dropping by the percent. Down to 8%... My vision's blurry and my character begins to wobble. He's blacking out and coming back. I attempt to make a fire, but no, it's too windy ! I run around the place looking for cover from the wind ! I travel down the  mountain on a path and finally manage to get the fire going, but am left with 4% hp. I throw some logs onto the fire and warm myself up entirely. I check the time, there's 4 hours left. I've got to reach some kind of shelter before nightfall or else i'll freeze to death. Perhaps I messed somthing up and the back door actually does open? Still blacking out and wobbling, I decided to head back up to the back door to check again. I take 4 steps. OWWWW, burning damage inflicted !! I WALKED OVER MY OWN FIRE ! IS THIS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE?? KILLING MYSELF BY WALKING OVER MY OWN FIRE??!!? Thankfully, I'm left with 2% health and minor burns... I travel upwards, towards the door, but alas, the door does not open... The only way to go is down the mountain and follow the frozen river. My character's still disoriented, I'm having trouble walking and navigating my way through this maze of a river. I take every turn, only to be led to a dead end. It seems like there's no way up and out of this river system, so i push through looking for some kind of exit... I finally reach the end.... I found the tunnel system. It seemed to be the only way out, so i went in. Bad idea. 10 Steps in and i literally could not tell which way was up or down. I see a frozen corpse. Ha, i guess he'll have a friend pretty soon. I personally, begin to get motion sickness. I'm lost and i honestly can't tell if i'm going forwards into the cave or going back to where i came in from..... I give up... I exit the game and decide to reload from my last save spot (where ever that is i do not know). It happens to be the moment i entered the cave. I quickly turn around and exit. Surely there has to be another way out of this river system.... Welp, time to go online and look for a map ! There's no map. I did however, find out that there are two entrances/exits to this river system... The cave and A MFING WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM TO THE DAM'S BACK DOOR!!!! I begin my journey back through the river/maze.... I'm beginning to feel tired... I'm forced to drop some inventory.... A dead end.... Another one.... Eventually i see open space. There's no mountains ahead. Sure enough, the dam appears. I travel up the moutain pass and reached the back door. Okay... I could barely cross the ledge at 100% health.... Now i've got to do it at 2% health.... I'm still wobbling, my screen is still fading in and out. I tip toe across the ledge and make sure i hit every wall there is to hit. I'm safe on the platform. I search for the window and slide my way inside of the dam. I recognize this area.... It's the deepest room inside of the dam and darkest..... I'll need a light source through the entire dam... I have a few matches and a flare.... I light the flare and race my way through the dam. I pass through the piles of items that i was supposed to retrieve. I pass through the door that started the entire journey. A few more minutes and i reach the front door of the dam. I drink and eat as much as i can. I check the time, less than an hour left of daylight ! It's a race against time ! I leave the dam with nothing but the clothes on my back and the single flare which only has 30% of it's original life left. I'm outside and it's dark. The time says less than one hour of daylight, but that's only referring to the temperature... I walk straight until i see the railroad. I place my feet on the railroad and look towards home, but i can barely see now. It's too dark ! I walk backwards, i've lost the railroad ! i look left or was it right? I see the way that isn't home and look the opposite direction. I see the bridge and railroad so I begin to walk. It's a long trek home. My flare dies out. The icon that tells me i'm suffering from lack of sleep appears. I march on. I reach a checkpoint, the trees that have been cut for lumber. I see that familiar corpse on the left side of the tracks.I reach the next checkpoint. The derailed carts. I walk around the carts and around the branch that blocks the way. From here on it's a straight path until home. I literally can not tell If i'm moving or not. I can only trust that i am. I march on. Waiting for some sign, for that opening in the mountains to the left that signifies that my cabin is there. I march on. Finally, i see the opening ! i see the black silouhette that resembles a house. I recognize that flag figure flying proudly atop the house. I run towards the house to the side i know the front door is on. I put my face against the side of the house and move left and right searching for the door. Is my face even against the wall or is it on the fence of the front porch?! I don't know, i can not see ! I try the back door which has no fence to protect it. I can't find that one either ! I back off from the house, trying to position myself to where i know the back door is, but i lose the house itself !! I see nothing but blackness. Am i touching the house or is it the mountains behind the house?!? I can not tell.... In time, i'm able to see that familiar silhoutte once more. I reposition myself and check my inventory to see if there's ANYTHING that can light the way... Apparently I left some matches in my backpack !! They must have been too light to throw away ! Thank god I was too lazy to toss them out ! I light a match against the wall of the house and am able to find the back door.... i light another match inside of the cabin so i can locate the stairs.  finally i'm safe at last.... I rest for 6 hours, not wanting to die of thirst or hunger. I wake up well enough to sleep for another 12 hours. Alas, I am home and rested, ready to journey once more...","December 19, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.\nPros(+)\n- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)\n- Surprisingly innovative\n- Low price compared to other survival games\n- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)\n- Huge world\nCons(-)\n- No jump button\n- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)\n- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)\nAll in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world.

The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.\nPros(+)\n- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)\n- Surprisingly innovative\n- Low price compared to other survival games\n- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)\n- Huge world\nCons(-)\n- No jump button\n- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)\n- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)\nAll in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world. Yet still for me it's experience worth 20 euro!","January 11","true","26.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Though it's not really about getting from one specific place to another, it's about exploring and surviving when the odds are entirely against you.  Hours in you realize so many small choices are life and death: using that cloth to repair your clothing, keeping you warm, or tearing them up for bandages, in case you are attacked.\n\nOr staying where you are, which is safe, but your food sources are running out, or hiking through the blizzard down an unknown path hoping to find game, something to eat, or an abandoned house to raid.\n\nEven the miniscule amounts of ammunition you can scavenge adds to this:  do you use your last three bullets hoping to take down the wolf at a distance? Or do you get closer, improving your chance to hit, but giving it a chance to charge you?\n\nIt ook a few hours to fully get the experience, but once I got it, I was hooked.","December 28, 2015","true","79.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not a lot, but I have EXTREMELY bad luck and getting to aim a gun and shoot at the same time when my mouse pad locks up up all the time means wolves keep slaughtering me - that and I always seem to leave my shelters at the worst possible times, y'know, like when I'm starving to death to look for food.\n\nThough you can survive without food for a few days, I think the hunger mechanic is a little over the top, I understand all the extra calories you'd burn in such a cold environment and walking on snow and yadayadayda, but it is a little annoying to be starving just hours after polishing off 9kg of deer meat (not all in one go, but tbh I don't think it would've lasted much longer anyway.) This dude must've been in eating competitions and have t-shirts from every steakhouse in the US for how much he needs to eat to stop complaining!\n\nOverall I do really love this game, it's interesting and just plain different, the permadeath is an element I love and hate at the same time, but it really does make the game, you HAVE to survive. Sometimes it's luck, where you start out, which caches are open to you, whether you catch any fish during a 5 hour stretch and whether a big bad wolf will flip it's biscuits and attack you three times in a row so every item of your clothing is ripped to shreds and you're out in North Canada wearing, assuringly, nothing.\n\nYeah, I'm sure a lot of you will read this and assume I'm horribly bad at the game and maybe I am, but you gotta try it for yourself and see how well you fair! It's like nothing else and you kinda enjoy being such a horrible masochist to yourself.\n\nGood luck out there, it's f***king cold!","May 9","true","88.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I began breaking down the crates and shelves within the dam's lower quarters so that I could get a roaring fire and stave off hypothermia. It was then that I discovered the body. In the corner just beside my fire barrel was a frozen corpse, head down in rigid repose. I could not move the fire I had already started, so I would have to deal with the body for the time being. Finally, a place to heat up these cans of soup and get a good night's rest.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night to snarling. A wolf had wandered into my makeshift camp; or perhaps I had wandered into his. Armed with nothing but a torch, I brandished my tool at the beast in a desperate attempt to drive it off. It worked for a while, but the creature returned. My body screamed at me to sleep, to get the desperate rest I needed to go on, but I knew I could not tear my eyes away from the shadows for a second, lest the wolf take me. Glowing green eyes pierced the shadowy veil around my fire, which I struggled to maintain. My torch was burning out, and still the pair of eyes stared - waiting, watching, growling.\n\nThere was little I could do against the animal, and my only tool for driving it back was losing fuel quickly. I instinctively backed into a corner and realized I had bumped into something - the body. The frozen man which had horrified me earlier would soon become my eternal friend, now that the wolf had me. But wait, what's this? You can search corpses in this game? A feature I had not expected could now save me! But only if the man had something on him like a rifle or...\n\nA knife!\n\nThe wolf lunged and I fell back, stabbing wildly with my new weapon and screaming at the screen in a moment of defiance. It was him or me, and thanks to my frozen friend I had leveled the playing field. The creature shrieked in pain and fell off me, whimpering and darting back into the shadows. No longer would its eyes haunt the night. After about an hour of hovering over the fire and taking whatever medicine I had gathered prior to the encounter, I heard the beast let out a final cry of pain from the next room. My valiant defense had killed the creature. I won.\n\nThree days later I died to a bear. This game has quickly become one of my favorites because of moments like the one listed above.
