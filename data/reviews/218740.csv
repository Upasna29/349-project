"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhete/recommended/218740/","rhete","Rhete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhete/","645 products in account","If there's one game that completely failed to find its audience, it's Pid. On the outside, Pid looks another artsy puzzle platformer, with its gentle, softly rendered backgrounds, and relaxing acoustic soundtrack. Upon playing it though, the game honestly has more in common with Super Meat Boy than any puzzle platformer. The distance between checkpoints is tiny, you have infinite lives, and enemies, traps, and spikes are everywhere. I personally love the game to death, but I can see why the huge dissonance between how the game looks and feels, vs how it plays, turned a lot of people off.  It's really too bad though, because I think Pid is one of the best games around.\n\nThe main gimmick here is the ability to place down beams of light that can carry you around. The way this changes how you navigate through the game world is dramatic, and a bit reminiscent of Bionic Commando Rearmed, which some of the Pid team also worked on. The game thoroughly explores this mechanic, with every area in the game having a slight twist to how the game plays. Most of the time you use the beam to carry yourself, but other locations have you using it to carry bombs towards enemies, carry enemies themselves, or even push around light sources needed to light the way for you. The other great thing about the beam mechanic is how the solution is always right there in front of you, but you have to figure out where to place the beams, adding a bit of a puzzle aspect.\n\nOverall though, I really can't stress enough how much I like this game. The scenery, music, atmosphere, and gameplay all combine to form this truly unique experience. The game is pretty long as well, but has a great flow and variety to the areas. If you like hard platformers, you should check this game out.","November 25, 2013","true","32.9"," 191 of 209 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","191","209","0","0"

You learn the basic mechanics of using the game's gravity gems to float to high unreachable platsforms. Then you are introduced to bombs, music boxes, smoke bombs, lazer beams, and so on to assist you. Then approaching the first boss there is a sudden difficulty spike. Platforms got smaller, enemies became faster, and oh god the ♥♥♥♥ing spiked walls. EVERYWHERE.\nEven at the easiest difficulty setting if you don't have the patience to retry a level again again you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nUnlike other precision platoformers like Super Meat Boy the game has a larger focus of utilizing the gravity gems/timing. For instance you'll teach yourself how to wall jump even if there isn't a wall sticking mechanic, which will help you find the collectables throughout the game.\nThe collectables are what almost ruined this game for me. There are 12 "souviners" and 17 "secret constellations". Finding them are almost impossible without guides and even when you reach them you will have to try. try. try and try again to get them. one of the souviners took me at least 40 mins to get. Collecting all of them doesn't give you an alternate ending or anything, but it certainly makes you feel good knowing that you challenged yourself to the MAX. Also an achievement.\n\nBUT, the game is gorgeous. Even when i was frustrated i couldn't get over how amazing the game looked. The soundtrack is definately up there with hotline miami in terms of quality. The timing of when the tunes started playing according to where you are in the game is pitch perfect also. One moment you're hearing gusty fast paced drum, when suddenly you reach a calm zero gravity zone and a calm piano track kicks in. Perfect. These two factors kept me pushing through the more unforgiving parts of the game.\nThe levels also very greatly from robot sweat shops, to an opera stage with flying airplanes. ♥♥♥♥ gets creative, and you will grin ear to ear everytime a new set piece is opening.\nThe story is also starts out simple, and gets pretty interesting by the end. It's pretty cliche, but it's like a reallly good children's picture book.\n\nIf you like platformers that are challenging you might want to pick this up. It's pretty cheap, and it's been in like 3 bundles this year alone. While it has an extremly unforgiving diffuiculty spike,  it also has alot of excellent redeeming qualities. Reccomended if you have time.\n\n7/10\nit's also the 3rd game I 100%. Why do i do this to myself.","November 15, 2013","true","18.1"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","0"

On first blush, it should really satisfy: interesting art direction, unique music, and a nifty little gameplay mechanic. The difficulty seemed on par with my meager skills: not super-frenetic, but needing a little thought to keep it from being a cakewalk.\n\nThe trouble is, it all just seems too sluggish. Character control is incredibly slow. Just try "running" (loping?) one way, and then quickly change direction: young master Pid does an excruciatingly tardy about-face.\n\nWorse yet, this sluggishness extends to jumping, as well. Platormers live and die by their jump-physics, and Pid sadly comes across as clumsy in this department. I think the benchmark for controllability in a character is to stand on a ledge, jump out into space, and then reverse direction to land on the edge again. The distance that you can get from the ledge safely tells you how "in control" you will feel with the gameplay. Pid does not fare well here.\n\nI suppose it can be reasoned that everything *else* in the game is slow as well (animations, enemies, dialog, checkpoint restarts) so perhaps a slow character fits in with the dream-like feel. Or perhaps you could say that the emphasis is on the force beams instead of jumping, and you'd have a point. And there are plenty of people that loved Pid, so I won't begrudge them that.\n\nHowever, for my own taste, the poor character control turned gameplay into a chore for me due to being unnecessarily challenging for comparatively trivial tasks. Life is short, and I have more games in my library than time to play them all, so I'll move my attention to more rewarding fare!\n","November 17, 2014","false","2.9"," 68 of 94 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","68","94","0","0"

This is puzzle-platformer where you have to get your way through levels by jumping, evading and fighting enemies. At the end of each "world", there're boss battles, which are fun and challenging. Levels are well designed and fun to explore. Colors are beautiful, everything in this game is painted with eye pleasing color. Soundtrack is awesome, it is written for this game and, compared to similar indie games, it really stands out. As for the difficulty, this is hard game, it starts slow but gets really hard towards the end.

In Pid, your little spaceboy Kurt falls asleep on a bus and ends up on a planet of robots, where the busses haven't been running for 300 years. In his journey to find some way off the rock, he comes across a shining gem that creates pillars of levitating force. But someone isn't happy about him having it, and sends a veritable army of robot minions to chase him down.\n\nHow's that for a puzzle platform hook? Pid compliments its children's book premise with appropriately soft, pastel visuals, collectible stars, and goofy characters. The presentation is the real stand-out here, making each level appear inviting and mysterious and charming all at once. The soundtrack is both subdued and peppy when it needs to be, and there's some cute writing on display with the NPCs and cutscenes. It's really everything you could ask for in an indie platformer.\n\nThe lavish charm makes the game's intense difficulty all the more jarring when it starts smashing you against spikes and explosives. Pid wastes no time in wasting you, pitting you against tiny platforms and precise timing puzzles in the first hour. The levitation is a clever gimmick done well, but you'll have to master it in a hurry to survive. You'll also gain a number of supporting abilities and items including bombs and super jumps that will need to be used to their fullest. Stars you find are used to replenish expendable abilities, but even if you're completely awful at the game you shouldn't run out.\n\nLevels abound with secrets, but by the time you reach the city they'll likely be too frustrating to sniff out. I kept running into annoyances like secrets you only get one chance at, spoiled by checkpointing or unscaleable heights. The clever and colorful bosses offer yet another source of frustration, since they have very long lifebars and patterns but you can only take one or two hits before dying and starting the whole thing over. There are challenge rooms beyond the lengthy story mode as well, but even the very first set required pin-point precision to complete, let alone get the par or challenge time.\n\nI wish I could recommend Pid without reservation, I really do. I adore everything about how it looks and sounds. But it suffers from that most common affliction among indie games, a poor difficulty curve. I still say it's worth a try, because if you have the time to devote to it you can surely overcome its challenges. Just don't go into it thinking it's as friendly as it looks.","February 28","true","2.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

However, after I got past the first zone I began to find the game incredibly unforgiving, and by extension quite irritating.\n\nThere are many areas that I found frustrating: One of the boss battles seems to take an inordinate amount of time to complete, because his movements are erratic, and when jumping around you can often bounce right off him into another enemy [dying, meaning you have to start over].\n\nAlso, when trying to complete many of the platformer puzzles, I found myself frequently grazing "forbidden zones" and dying, which makes for incredibly tedious gameplay.\n\nIt isn't all bad though, If you can stomach the tedious parts of the game you will find that it has a very nice story with some very nice graphics and music. The environment almost seems like it is played out by toys, which looks very nice.\nThe game runs very well, and I have had no problems with it on the software side.\n\nThat said, I couldn't complete the game.

I actually purchased it three times; once on Xbox Live, and twice on Steam for myself and a friend.\n\nFirstly, the visual style is superb. As well as creating a rich sense of depth with blurs and diffused lighting, there seems also to be a seperate layer of color grading (shadows tinted blue, highlights tinted orange) which is why many screenshots have a cinematic aura about them.\n\nThe light beam mechanic quickly becomes second nature, and I find myself missing it when I hop over to other platformers. The gameplay is more of a navigational puzzler than a logic one, and there's a nice steady progression of what you can do with the beams which prevents it from becoming stale.\n\nI'm a fan of "strange world" concepts in games. Pid in particular creates a surprisingly inviting atmosphere for a planet of mechanical characters. What's more, each citizen is unique in appearance, which could've been an easy cop out for the devs if they decided that robots would be mass produced in one model. A fine level of variation worth noting. The length of the game was also pretty satisfying. It's taken me between 12 to 13 hours each time I've played through, though it felt much longer.\n\nFinally, and without giving anything away, the last few sections of gameplay were just brilliantly executed.

Pid is a game with a difficulty curve that borderlines abuse, puzzles that push the mind and skill to levels unheard, and secrets abound.\n\nStory:\nA small boy known as Kurt has a regular day at school, but the bus-ride home is where the adventure really begins. Kurt falls asleep finding himself waking up on a weird little planet, which no one has come to or left for over 350 years. Stumbling upon a magical orb Kurt becomes connected to the planet and is the boy who must solve its mysteries and return it back to its former glory. With a fascinating story, and wonderful character development this game will keep you gripped.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is about eight hours long, depending on your skill and the difficulty choice. I played on Normal for the campaign, thinking it wouldn’t be too challenging. Well I was definitely wrong; Pid is a difficult game which pushes boundaries. If you try to get all the secrets you will most likely rip out most of your hair. The campaign combines puzzle solving, action, and an amazing physics engine. Pid combines such elements as collecting items, pushing switches, carrying keys, manipulating gravity wells, spike traps, and much more. There are multiple bosses throughout the campaign one that are entirely fighting, one that combines both puzzles and combat, and  even one that is just puzzle solving. The bosses push your mind and skill as each one requires unique approaches for victory.\n\nGameplay:\nPid starts out with you obtaining a special orb that allows you to create gravity wells that push you in some direction. You must use these gravity wells in order to complete objectives, defeat enemies, and race across levels. You will fight enemies who shoot rockets, lasers, or even shine spotlights that for some reason cause you to lose. You acquire items throughout the campaign that allow you to push through the campaign: crank boxes (that confuse robots), explosives, timed explosives, laser grids, armor, hyper beams, gravel, and more.\n\nResults:\nPid is an awesome platformer that combines puzzle solving and combat to produce an invigorating experience. The game pushes you against spike traps, bottomless pits, rockets, and laser grids. You have to utilize special beams to launch yourself through the levels, but sometimes the surfaces don’t allow you to use your ability. You must combine strategies and tactics in order to complete the levels and solve the puzzles. Pid makes for an amazing and incredibly challenging experience that really puts you to the test.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome level design\n+Brilliant art work and soundtrack\n+Fantastic story\n+Challenging Puzzles with high amounts of variation\n+Simple, but soothing soundtrack\n+Bundles of enemies that keep you on your toes\n+Lots of items that give you loads of varieties\n+Secrets abound: constellations and souvenirs.\n+Whimsical nature that makes you smile as you progress through\n+Three difficulty settings that keep the game entertaining.\n\nCons:\n-The slingshot requires you to use your keyboard to control direction rather than using a mouse.\n-Difficulty spikes in the game make some parts more annoying than entertaining (such as running away from the Grandma or the wormhole level).","May 11, 2014","true","11.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, poor controls let the game down in this department. Kurt routinely 'sticks' to the end of the beams, making it difficult to jump off the end of them. Poor design of several puzzles exacerbates the problem, as many puzzles and boss battles are timed, and leave no margin for error. The result is controlling-smashing levels of frustrating in many of the puzzles.\n\nThis is all the more disappointing because of the excellent game concept, graphic design, animation, sound and music, which help bring the simple but engaging story to life. Each area has a unique aesthetic and introduces new game mechanics, which ensure that the game never becomes routine or old. Each new challenge requires skilful use of the skills and abilities you have accrued so far.\n\nI can only recommend Pid if you have considerable patience to look past its flawed controls. Be prepared to spend 30% of the time enjoying the calm ambience of the game's better-designed areas, 10% of your time working out the solutions to the more challenging puzzles and areas, and 60% of your time wrestling with the terrible controls and dying over and over again as you try to get past a challenge once you have identified the solution. If you are willing to take on this frustration, then the game is definitely beautiful, original and occasionally offers some thought-provoking puzzles.","January 8","false","23.9"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/recommended/218740/","ddiesonne","NOOB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/","1002 products in account","I've started playing Pid at the same time with FEZ. Both three-letter titles, both platformers, both Indie, both obtained without any real financial effort (I had FEZ from an old bundle and got Pid for free from the well-known giveaway). FEZ had a huge Metascore rating (91 if I remember correctly), while PID has a mere 63. Therefore I had no expectations of PID. Yet it proved so much better than FEZ.\n\nThe graphics are really fine. There's a lot of creativity put into them, reminding me somehow of a colored Limbo. Both artistic and original, I prefered them anytime to the already-ubiquitous 16-bit approach of FEZ.\n\nThe gamestory is decent. It's not exactly impressive but also far from ridiculous or disappointing. Despite being dull at times and lacking wit, the few dialogs are passable as well.\n\nThe gameplay is its best part in my opinion. It finds the right way of being challenging without being frustrating, and this can make it unbelievable addictive. It can be very difficult at points, but since the levels are short and the checkpoints are often, you often get to feel the satisfaction of solving a level and that's what makes it so addictive. It keeps you playing without feeding you false rewards or ridiculously easy challenges.\n\nUntil you get to the boss known as the "crook". Then you might experience some frustration like never before.\n\nThere's also plenty of complexity involved in terms of items, scenes and characters, and the music really adds to the awesome overall atmosphere created by the neat graphics.\n\nI hardly managed to play a bit more than an hour of FEZ and then I realized I had no fun and had no idea what was I supposed to do and why. I'm about to reach my 5th hour of playing PID and I can hardly wait for my next work break to give it another go.\n\nIn my humble opinion, it's really unfortunate that this game was the subject of that giveaway. It makes it look so much cheaper and lacking attractivity. A lot of people now have it just for the sake of having one more game in their library. That's too bad, Pid deserves a lot much more than that. On the other hand, that's how I got it too, and I love it.","February 11, 2014","true","22.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At the beginning, you have this feeling like you're going to play a mediocre game but then it surprises you with its stunning graphics and added game mechanics. However, the plot is extremely stupid and a lot of it just isn't logical. After a few hours of playing it, you begin to grind it out essentially. The game becomes dull, and very infrequently has bosses. When it does have bosses, they are too easy and it feels like you're playing a little kid's game despite it having dark undertones. The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a shame some of the aspects of the game are mediocre. It had serious potential  to be a classic but was underwhelming at that. Should you spend the $10 for this game? Honestly, I think so. It's well worth a shot, and it's relatively easy to get addicted but its just as easy to become bored. Do not fear spending those $10 because this game is decent enough to merit spending that much.","February 6, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now I really wish I had bought it!\n\nPid is an extremely enjoyable platformer, with great graphics to match. Each environment is very varied, and the requirements for some levels change too. My favorite example of this is in The Factory, which gives you several small puzzles one after the over, and is a nice break from the constant platforming.\nThe main mechanic, although basic, opens up some interesting platforming opportunities. And when combined with the numerous different items you find, there are a lot of ways to navigate around levels.\nSound design is also excellent, with the music fitting each area perfectly!\nThe game took me around 10 hours to beat on normal, but there are also numerous time trial challenges you can try, which are a nice addition and add to the replayability.\n\nThere is Co-op support, but i haven't tried this (I'm forever alone...) and so can't comment on it.\n\nThere are a few minor annoyances. Difficulty can fluctuate rather drastically at times, and it can get rather frustrating. Knowing where to go is also an issue at times. I only found the resistance's hideout by accidentally pressing the interaction button while standing near the door. If it wasn't for that, i may have been searching for a lot longer.\n\nBut aside from these, Pid is a really good game. If you enjoy platformers, you'll enjoy this.

You play as Kurt, a boy who falls asleep on a space school bus and needs to get back home. Unfortunately the planet he's on is less than willing to let you go. You must dodge clever robots and learn about the planet, which has a surprising amount of lore.\n\nThe gameplay has a lot of satisfying controls like precise jumping, but its core mechanic is a superpower Kurt gets early on. You have the ability to place down up to two beams that can carry you like the Funnels in Portal 2. This opens up a lot of solutions to puzzles considering that you can place them down on almost any surface. These puzzles, as I've said before, can get a little frustratng because most of the game a single hit will kill you. And sometimes the beam placement can get finnicky and you get killed.\n\nTo top off the great story and puzzling, there's a co op mode that takes Audrey with you. With two people, each person gets only one beam. Personally I think the beams are a power you shouldn't dumb down to force co operation. Instead, either give one of the partners a different power, or just give both partners two beams.\n\nSumming up Pid, it's really fun if you are normally really precise with your movement. The story is engaging and charming, and if you can part with half your power to enjoy the game with another human, then more power to you!","August 23, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On one hand it wants to be an atmospheric and dreamy little puzzle platformer that has great sense of style and a fun take on traversal, and on the other it wants to be a masocore platformer, killing you over and over again until you get it right. These elements unfortunately never come together.  It feels like two entirely different games shoved into a room and told to play nice, but they never really want to.\n\nPid's strong suit is its take on using gravity to get yourself around the world and using it to solve simple room puzzles to progress. When the game sticks to that, it's fun, and as it tucks more and more items into your inventory to play around with, the mechanics can get quit advanced and demand a lot of your critical thinking and reflexes. When the level design allows for creativity in passing obstacles with your collected items, Pid excels head and shoulders above most puzzle platformers.\n\nThe parts of Pid that are out for your blood however really drag the game into the mud. When the game decides to go all "Action Game" mode, you're being asked to perform tasks that the laboured character movement, weapons that are needlessly hard to work with, and weak jumping arc simply can't provide.

You can also play Co-Op with your friends. There are some smart puzzles in Pid and the variety is admirable, using beams to push you over chasms, shift security cameras, or delivering primed bombs to their target.

Until you reach an obstacle. And die. Over and over until you figure it out just at the moment you're about to punch a hole through your screen and strangle your neighbor's cat. There are plenty of discoverables to challenge you, but the last thing this game needed was a bigger challenge. Not that it's hard — the solutions are right in front of you, they're just barely capable of being executed.\n\nIn the end, I look forward to what Might and Delight will come up with in the future. Although, I think I’d be more excited to see them switch gears and produce an animated children’s TV series. The visual and sound design, the soundtrack, and the cast of characters was what made this game top notch, not necessarily the gameplay.","December 18, 2014","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love pretty much everything about it, but you do need a very patient hand. Kurt moves unfortunately slowly, and you generally can't breeze through puzzles... gameplay and mechanics and such are fine, but again it takes a fair amount of patience.\n\nThe game lets you figure things out on your own, it tells you only what it deems necessary and you're left to explore, trying to escape the planet Kurt is trapped on. There's no hand-holding in this game, and at times it can be quite unforgiving. One of the reviewers mentions that they don't expect the game to have much length - do not listen to this person. There is much to explore, you will die trying to solve puzzles, and the bosses will stomp on you. This isn't a quick game you're going to get through in a couple of hours. Pid is beautiful and you will surely get your money's worth, if you're willing to stick it out and take on the challenge.","July 14, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/218740/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","The main attraction here is the beautiful art and the dreamy world. These are the best aspects of the game.\n\nThe gameplay / basic mechanics essentially boil down to:\n\n1. Basic platforming (at which the game is mediocre and sometimes bad)\n\n2. Throwable levitation pebbles.\n\nThe levitation pebbles are an item which you have an unlimited supply of. You throw them at a surface and it creates a sort of tractor beam rising up from the surface at which you threw it. If you throw it on the floor, you get a vertical beam that levitates you upward. But you can also throw it at walls to get a horizontal beam that carries you across gaps and so on. There are also diagonal/slanting surfaces, which allow you to create beams that elevate you in a diagonal direction. The pebbles can also be used to push enemies off of edges, lift them into spiky ceilings, and so on.\n\nHowever, the game is extremely repetitive, the platforming feels mostly boring, the controls don't feel very tight, and the levitation beams are more difficult to use than you'd like them to be. What starts off as a relaxing stroll of a platformer through a beautiful world of child-like whimsy soon becomes death after death after death, as the game repeatedly punishes you for failing to demonstrate accuracy and precision using a very innacurate and imprecise toolset.\n\n6/10 is a pretty fair rating, in my opinion. It's definitely not an awful game, and it's worth checking out just for the interesting art/atmosphere. But it's also not a particularly great game. Worth checking out if some of your favorite things are platformers, light puzzling, and constant repeated deaths. Otherwise, you may find the gameplay isn't as captivating as that wonderful art makes it look.\n\nArt/atmosphere: 9/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nOverall: meh / 10","April 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","1"

The player is generally hard to control (very "slippery" movement, throwing things isn't fluid or precise), there is little sense of direction in the game, and the secrets are frustrating to find because well, they're very secretive. Typically a game might have a blur, a shadow, some indication of a secret, but in this platformer, there's pretty much no way to discover them without looking them up, so gathering achievements is simply tedious and dull. Furthermore, adding on to what I mentioned previously, the lack of solid control of the character makes doing anything at all difficult. There's tons of touching spikes (instant kill, by the way) not because I didn't see them coming or wasn't skilled enough (trust me, I've beaten IWBTG), but because the controls are unnecessarily hard to manage. Another general comment about the game overall is that it is VERY slow. Not only is the player slippery in the sense that his acceleration and deceleration are very low, the maximum velocity feels like a snail's pace. There's also lots of unneeded crawling and waiting for slow platforms). To sum it up, this isn't a game I'd play for fun and I would not recommend this game.","June 28, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After playing Shelter (Might & Delight's other game), I was interested in what else they had done, as Shelter is certainly a unique game!\nPid seemed more traditional, but hey, why not give it a go?\n\nYou play as Kurt, a kid lost in a totally unknown planet, after oversleeping in the bus. This new world draws the player in with its visuals and, well... peculiar characters. It certainly creates a wonderful world, and that was the main factor that kept me going.\nYou visit several different places, slowly learning more about the planet and the crisis it's going through, while trying to get back to your home.\nAll you know is that traffic and communication to the outside has suddenly stopped, leading you to help with its problems so that you can get back.\n\nThe story wasn't its main focus, but it was certainly well done, and fairly interesting.\nAnd to be honest, it wasn't the actual plot I cared about, but the setting, and the people living there. And Pid certainly did the trick for me.\n\n\n\nLet's talk about its presentation.\n\nThe game looks pretty incredible. Everything is very clean and smooth and has a characteristic look to it. Every person/creature looks like a puppet of sorts, and I think it contributes positively to its vibe.\nIts simplicity is its great strength. Also, the areas you visit look significantly different, with detailed backgrounds to draw your attention (whenever you don't have to worry about dying).\nDespite all the enemies in the game, it doesn't feel hostile, and it reminds me of certain games of my childhood, which is good.\n\nThe music was also one of its highest points for me. Retro Family did an incredible job with it, maintaining the feel of old-school games, with a more jazz-y feel to it. Again, fairly simple, but it sounded really great, and went along with the game perfectly.\nIt's actually something I'll be listening to outside of the game, it's pretty great!\nThey also managed to keep it on par with the different areas, making some things more classical, or eerie, others more fast paced... I liked it a whole lot.\n\n\nSo, let's about gameplay, shall we?\nThis... is what left me very uncertain about the game. On one hand, I wanted to fully recommend it, but it's not nearly as well designed as I had hoped.\n\nThe main mechanic is a beam of light, which alters gravity. It's a simple, yet effective mechanic. Throughout the game, you'll unlock many different items to go along with it. Some of them seemed pretty useless, however. Other were fine, but none particularly interesting that I remember. Still, it kept the gameplay varied enough not to get too boring, and it led to many different ways of approaching each problem.\n\nWith this mechanic, it's obvious the it could go both ways: being a puzzler, or a hardcore platformer. It ended up doing both, but these two just felt thrown in together, with no sense of pacing, in my opinion.\n\nYou'll also collect Stars to buy more items (if you don't find enough in the environment), and there are Special Constellations as well as Souvenirs, that are hidden, and work for achievement hunters, and just exploring in general.\n\nThe game starts out great! Smaller rooms (with good maneuvering space, but not overwhelming, and good recovery time), with good checkpoint placement.\nI started out taking the time to get these secrets, and despite being challenging, it didn't feel frustrating. You would get back in the action quickly enough. I was having fun!\n\nThen, the game started to show far bigger areas, with very sparse checkpoints. And I've found myself trying to collect these secrets, and dying afterwards. And I had to do everything over again, which started to get infuriating. Besides, these checkpoints aren't reactivatable, which means that even if you get back to the supposed checkpoint, it's pointless.\nWith the smaller rooms, this system worked fine, but as soon as it opens up, it all falls apart. You'll have to thread the same territory over and over again... the game simply doesn't respect the player's time in these circumstances.\n\nThere is also a fair amount of vertical paltforming, which won't kill you for mistakes, but it'll throw you all the way down, resulting in even more time where you're not actually having fun.\n\nAnd this is probably my main problem with the game, and the reason why I stopped trying to go for the collectibles at one point. It was simply not worth it.\n\nWhile trying to be an hardcore platformer, it went against the games' foundations, and resulted in a frustrating experience, unfortunately.\nI don't mind hard games, but I hate games that thrive in trial and error, and repetition due to lack of checkpoints.\nOne simply change would be letting the player keep the stars after he died, or just save whenever the player reached those secrets. It would have made things so different... but it doesn't, and it feels badly designed, in my opinion.\n\n\nOther than that, it's a pretty good game! If you focus more on progressing itself, and try to get into the world and the story, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. Maybe go for the collectibles in a second playthrough.\n\nThe game has 4 Boss Fights (if I remember correctly), and each fight feels very different from each other, as well as each Boss. Each of them looks unique, and has its own very simple, yet recognizable personality. And they're also a good challenge! Several patterns to memorize, but you'll surely ace it after a few deaths. I enjoyed these quite a lot!\n\nNow, each stage is mostly about getting to the ending without getting killed, more in the style of a hardcore platformer than a puzzle. I say this because its focus was in execution rather than identifying the solution. Even after knowing what to do, you're likely to die several times, sometimes due to a bit unpredictable enemy behaviour.\nStill, as I said, there are several ways of completing each area, and while a bit hard, they're accessible, as long as you don't try to collect every Star, which gets infuriating fairly quickly. At least it did for me.\n\n\nNow, one big flaw, it the lack of pacing. Instead of spacing out the hard sections with a couple of puzzles in the middle, Pid just seems to have no specific order in which to throw ou problems. And it keeps getting worse, unfortunately.\nI think it would have benefitted from being more intervaled. Do a hard section, and then give the player a break. Let him look at the world, solve a couple of puzzles, relax. Then throw another hard sections. And then rinse and repeat.\n\nThere were two moments where it had short periods of calm (after the storm) and they both felt great! On of them was the farmlands. After going through a lot, you reached a very green and lively place, that was pretty striaghtforward, without challenge for 2 minutes. Just that. Look at the houses and the trees, appreciate the world. They you're on your own.\n\nAnother moment was right after the first Boss. He summoned a few creatures that felt quite hostile, with the music, the Boss and everything else. Yet, after the Boss was defeated, only one of these was alive, and there was no music. And it was at that moment that you could just look at it, listening to the noises the creature done by jumping, and realized how simple and easy it was, without all the chaos of the Boss fight. I'm not sure this was intentional, but it was certainly something that amused me!\n\nSome moments in Pid made me smile at how some simple things worked so well. The rest was a bit too frustrating, unfortunately. It seemed to punish exploration, rather than encouraging it. Don't do that...\n\nBut despite its flaws, it's a good game!","June 16, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is one of my favorite games by far. Its a very light hearted yet challenging platformer about a young boy in space who has to travel through a house to find his way home.\n\nThe visuals are very unique and honestly I never get tired of them, the music fits the mood of the game quite well and is a joy to listen too. The controls are easy to master as well, admittedly I still sometimes mess up when playing its not much of a hindrance.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a light hearted, fun loving and highly enjoyable game.\n\n10/10","July 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is yet another indie puzzle solving game. The game feels very polished, and I didn't run into any bugs. The gameplay concept is mostly unique among of the modern indie puzzle games that I can think of. You can use two beams to travel to out of reach areas. One hit is enough to "kill" your character unless you have armor. You have to avoid missles, ground units, or say out of size of other bad guys all while trying to get to progress though the environment. There are pickups you can use to open up secrets or deal with bad guys. The game is fun, but as difficult picks up (mostly from obtaining the optional stars that you can collect to buy stuff) it gets a little bit more frustrating than fun to play. If you enjoy puzzle time games this is for you. If they frustrate you it isn't. If you can get it pretty cheap it could be worth a look at if your in the first group.","February 23, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Occasionally well paced, with a well thought out learning and difficulty curve (I found this only to be true early on and in the factory area).\n\nTerribly sloppy and imprecise control for what they want you to do.  Much of the game design is centered around exploiting the crappiest aspects of the control scheme to create challenge.  Boring, repetetive enemies with little to no character.  Often times, the play areas seem too open ended, with much of the game taking place on small platforms out in the open, making the game feel disjointed and since the penalty for failed exploring is so great, pointless.  Very long for a game so lacking in fun, clocking in at 12 hours to completion for me.  I did not have the trouble with bosses most are reporting, and only found the last boss in the backstage area to be truly garbage and cheap.\n\nI can't tell if they wanted this to be a punisher or not, as it seems to be mostly hard because of the design being often centered on making you battle the control to get what you want.  After more consideration, I do think they were going for a punisher style game, but they got several things wrong.  Most punishers really on precise control and overwhelming difficulty with progress gained by learning patterns and pitfalls.  This game adds an unacceptable level of randomness to an already slimy control scheme that makes me question the intentions of the designers.\n\nHad I known the miniscule amount of enjoyment and satisfaction I would have gotten coupled with such a high level of frustration, I seriously, absolutely, 100% would never have played this.  I hope this dissuades at least one person from wasting their time and sanity on such refuse.\n\nIf you must play, don't explore, and don't seek out the secrets.  Just get to the end of each area as quickly as possible.\n\nHopefully, the developers will do something better with their obvious talents, but the lead gameplay designer needs to go take some classes.  Unfortunately, the high sales of this game have perhaps convinced them that they made something of merit.  Shame on you guys for releasing something so obviously intended to enrage people.","August 25, 2014","false","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HungriTerri/recommended/218740/","HungriTerri","Hungri Terri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HungriTerri/","216 products in account","This is probably the hardest platformer I've ever played, and I A+'ed all but a few of the dark levels in Super Meat Boy. The problem is that Pid isn't fun hard, it's just frustrating and annoying. Controls are awkward and inconsistent, and the checkpoint system is dreadful (invisible checkpoints everywhere, so if you fall into one while failing a difficult platform puzzle, now you have to start from a different place and if you complete the puzzle you have to make it to the NEXT checkpoint to save your progress). This is the first game since the NES days that I actually considered quitting because it was too hard.\n\nGranted, I played on Normal difficulty because I didn't realize that Easy was specifically patched in because of complaints at release. I could've dropped down to Easy, but was too proud. But if you go into this expecting a nice chill Metroidvania, as I did, then you're in for a big surprise (not the least of which is that it's not at all a Metroidvania, whoops).\n\nOne especially frustrating thing is the lack of a level select. There are some secret areas that I wouldn't mind going back to, or puzzles I would like to figure out, but instead you're forced to complete them as you go. I did do a couple of the challenge rooms, and they are a fun way to do some tough puzzles without having to play through the game.","August 1, 2014","false","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I and my sister play this game. The art look very good, sound is ok. The first impression really not bad. I love the idea about beam that the core feature of the game. Yeah so this puzzle mechanic is very unique. We enjoy the game after the first boss. I realise there're so many problems with the game. The controll system sucks, and i have to change the key blind again when i restart the game. When play 2-players mode, each player can just use 1 beam (single player allow people to play 2 beams) which make the game need teamwork in this mode. However, something wrong like, if just 1 player can get out the area, both 2 will get out the area which make the game less challenge in this mode. And i think the boss have a bad design at all. There're some large area in this game that i think should show the minimap because it look very hard with casual player to navigate. The story is ok.\nAfter all, the beam is the cool thing, the bright point at this game. Too bad, there're so many bugs (sometimes i can just say "WTF just happend"), lot of issue, bad controll system. Maybe some people wouldn't mind and can enjoy this game. This game just not a good gem for me.\n4/10 :(","October 2, 2015","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On one hand, it was to be a slow-paced, calming, artsy platformer.  On the other hand it wants to be a hardcore torture platformer.  Unfortunately both of these are let down by one simple fact: clumsy gameplay.  While the game mechanics are interesting, in practice they're often hard to control, and the character's movement isn't precise enough to support the type of platforming the game wants to do.  If you want to go after the secrets, as I generally do, it gets much, much worse.\n\nThe game unfortunately reminds me of Giana Sisters in the way that it likes to kill you constantly and send you back to the previous checkpoint.  I believe this sort of gameplay is supposed to make it feel like you haven't lost much progress, but in practice it ends up being quite frustrating having to redo rooms over and over and over again.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but there's no way I can recommend it from my experience with it.","January 24","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love the beam mechanic and the game feels like it has so much potential, but the item system is horribly designed and kind of ruins the experience. Throughtout the game you collect stars which can be used to purchase items, but the only thing you can purchase is refills for your consumables. And the refills cost a rediculous number of stars. So essentially your consumables are then so valuable that you dare not use them unless they are absolutely required.

I should have turned down this free game and just let him have the code for free. Games like this used to be free to play in your website's flash. Now they sell on Steam for money. Do yourself a favor. Go to a flash game website. There are tons of these, for free to play. Or buy any other platformer that exists instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/recommended/218740/","abbe","Abbe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/","806 products in account","TL;DR: Bad gamedesign and leveldesign ruins a good looking game and causing massive rage from someone who wants to pick up all of the things.\n\nLong version:\nSo this game… ♥♥♥♥ this game. Don’t buy it.\nOk, maybe a bit harsh, but I’ll try to explain why I feel that way.\nI will begin with the good thing: The graphics.\n\nThe style of the graphics, or the focus, I say, is the lighting and atmosphere, they have very noise-free textures, and focus more on the models and the edges, I have to say that most of the time I loved it, although it never reached a crazy level of amazement.\n\nWith that out of the way: The bad.\nThe bad in the game is just the whole design. From what I’ve heard they wanted to create a “hard game of the past” and made the normal difficulty in this tone, theres nothing really bad in doing that and I enjoy a challenge normally. The puzzles or levels start out kind of complicated and they continue from that. I can live with that, a challenge is something to overcome. However, here’s where the extremely bad thing comes in: Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing Gamedesign Decisions.\n\nAs in most games, when you take damage, you get a short invulnerability time to recover. Their time is about 1 second, which mean that your character might not even land on the ground before taking the second point of damage, which means death. This, of course, is if you have armor on you, if you don’t, you just die instantly.\n\nThe game consists of moving about on the levels using a ball that you can drop to create air lifts, you need to attach that to walls, platforms, lift enemies and other things, and it works pretty well. Until you fall down onto an old area you just were inside so you have solve that area again. So not only did I fail, but I now have to move my way back to where I was to try and move on again.\n\nBut here comes the closing deal for my 3 hours with this game. I am somewhat of an achiever, not anal, but if I see something that I can pick up, then I will ♥♥♥♥ing pick it up. And within 20 minutes of gameplay, the game locked me away from two of these pickups because of bad checkpoints.\n\nSo what happened was: I traversed a room full of spikes on every side, climbing and managing the ballthrowing as I should, carrying the key to the door where I needed to go. Key unlocks door, I jump down at the door to look around at the optional route I saw above me outside from where I just came. I go up and yes, here’s a puzzle with a pickup as a reward. Naturally (because bad designers) you have a risk of dying while trying to solve the puzzle, because that’s fun!\n\nI make a few tries and eventually I figure out how to solve the puzzle, but get stuck in a bad way and fall down on spikes and die. And respawns down by the door. Which is now closed. I cannot get back to the pickup.\n\nI cannot backtrack, at all.\n\nNow at this point I have played for about 3 hours, I’m kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because the game is annoying to play and have very untight controls, but not willing to quit just yet, I move on.\n\nThen it happens again, barely 20 minutes later, similar situation with a door and an optional route and a puzzle where you can die.

It has a beautiful concept and gameplay but I wouldn't recommend this game for short-tempered gamers. You must have lots of patience because you'll die hundreds of times that it becomes too repetitive and frustrating. Why? First of all, the frame rate drops. It's smooth almost but on parts that has many visuals going on the background added with Kurt's power ups, it slows down. I played this game on windowed mode with a controller just so you know. Second, keyboard controls are confusing. I tried it but man.. you'll definitely have a hard time. Finally, in my case it's very frustrating especially in the near end of the game. Right after I finished the story, I immediately uninstalled and yelled, "♥♥♥♥ you Pid I beat yo' ♥♥♥ in the end!".\n\n100/1000 would rather die thousands of times in Dark Souls 2 than in this game.","January 15, 2015","false","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sounds pretty nice too, with a nice calm sound track and quaint little sound effects for actions. The controls are fairly easy to use, although at times can be a bit clunky, but otherwise it does that well.\n\nOne other thing. It is boring. So boring. The gameplay is repetetive, the puzzles are simple and require minimal thought. The only time I've had trouble with a puzzle was due to the controls being awkward.\n\nI'm not the whole way through this game, but if you read other reviews, you'll see that it is a long game. That doesn't fill me with hope with what I've got left of this game. And I sincerely hope that it proves me wrong, but for now, I wouldn't recommend it.","February 26, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not tell how the story would end, whereas in the majority of the modern video games it is easy to predict how exactly the plot is going to unfold since the very beginning. Since I'm a man who believes in traditional values, without spoiling the plot, I must say that I was touched by the ending.\n\nThis game is a great mixture of several genres, it can be described as an adventure platformer with the elements of puzzle. This is exactly the type of game I was looking for. It kept me entertained from the beginning till the very end and I enjoyed every piece of it:\nFunny, blabberish NPC voice acting;\nGravel tossing while climbing the sky staircase on your journey from the farmland (loved the soundtrack by the way) to the outer space;\nChaotic rockets on the moon that occasionally blow you up;\nMission impossible themed castle and much more...\n\nTl:dr - I recommend this game to those who are fond of challenging and atmospheric adventure platformers. (10/10 - soundtrack, story, atmosphere, challenge).\nHowever, I do not recommend this game to the everbored people (the ones who are usually saying that they are "forced" to collect achievements, but the game is too frustratingly hard) who are looking for yet another casual game to play without the need to think and concentrate (some puzzles require good timing and precision),\n\nP.S. If you are using an xbox360 controller, I'd recommend the dpad for the slingshot aiming (instead of a stick).","February 15, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This simplistic story manages to grow into something much bigger through the surprising twists you experience further into the game.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is in its puzzle solving. Your primary method of solving these puzzles is the gravity manipulating gem you acquire early on. With this item Kurt, the main character, can create beams that can drag or push you and/or your enemies.\n\nPid increases the difficulty at a perfect pace while introducing more new and interesting items and concepts on the way, which makes it accesible to everyone. By the end of the game you will have amassed a large amount of items and a sense of flow that goes with mastering them. The boss battles are a great place to test you at what you've learned and provide a good challenge.\n\nThis game is beautiful visually, the character design and art style is very charming. The soundtrack is incredible and is definitely worth checking out even if you have no interest in the game. A sample:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wGSCRUVkb4\n\nPid should be an essential game for any platformer fan.","December 1, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But to me, the enjoyment gained from pid is not undone by its difficulty. The repulsor beam, cruel mistress though it may be, once mastered leads to a not imprecise puzzle platformer that requires skill and mind both. But that difficulty is subdued in it sharpness by the wonderful moments that the player meets throughout the story. My personal favorite moment came when, whilst traversing the maze level, a traditionally tedious experience in most games, soft saxophone music started playing as you neared the exit, turning an otherwise trying level into a moment of sudden zen where the tone aided the design of the level. The story itself weaves these pleasent moments into a charming tale of a marooned little boy forced to fix the bus schedule of an alien world. And it's this story, this subdued tone, and the enjoyable gameplay that for me make this game well worth experiencing if you have the time to savor them.","November 24, 2012","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, while I have some minor nitpicks with Pid, it's a fantastic game that I recommend to fans of the platforming genre.","May 20, 2013","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_scott/recommended/218740/","mr_scott","Scott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_scott/","467 products in account","An underappreciated gem of the platformer genre.\n\nIn Pid you play as a young boy stranded on a planet trying to find his way home. This simplistic story manages to grow into something much bigger through the surprising twists you experience further into the game.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is in its puzzle solving. Your primary method of solving these puzzles is the gravity manipulating gem you acquire early on. With this item Kurt, the main character, can create beams that can drag or push you and/or your enemies.\n\nPid increases the difficulty at a perfect pace while introducing more new and interesting items and concepts on the way, which makes it accesible to everyone. By the end of the game you will have amassed a large amount of items and a sense of flow that goes with mastering them. The boss battles are a great place to test you at what you've learned and provide a good challenge.\n\nThis game is beautiful visually, the character design and art style is very charming. The soundtrack is incredible and is definitely worth checking out even if you have no interest in the game. A sample:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wGSCRUVkb4\n\nPid should be an essential game for any platformer fan.","December 1, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not tell how the story would end, whereas in the majority of the modern video games it is easy to predict how exactly the plot is going to unfold since the very beginning. Since I'm a man who believes in traditional values, without spoiling the plot, I must say that I was touched by the ending.\n\nThis game is a great mixture of several genres, it can be described as an adventure platformer with the elements of puzzle. This is exactly the type of game I was looking for. It kept me entertained from the beginning till the very end and I enjoyed every piece of it:\nFunny, blabberish NPC voice acting;\nGravel tossing while climbing the sky staircase on your journey from the farmland (loved the soundtrack by the way) to the outer space;\nChaotic rockets on the moon that occasionally blow you up;\nMission impossible themed castle and much more...\n\nTl:dr - I recommend this game to those who are fond of challenging and atmospheric adventure platformers. (10/10 - soundtrack, story, atmosphere, challenge).\nHowever, I do not recommend this game to the everbored people (the ones who are usually saying that they are "forced" to collect achievements, but the game is too frustratingly hard) who are looking for yet another casual game to play without the need to think and concentrate (some puzzles require good timing and precision),\n\nP.S. If you are using an xbox360 controller, I'd recommend the dpad for the slingshot aiming (instead of a stick).","February 15, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a beautiful concept and gameplay but I wouldn't recommend this game for short-tempered gamers. You must have lots of patience because you'll die hundreds of times that it becomes too repetitive and frustrating. Why? First of all, the frame rate drops. It's smooth almost but on parts that has many visuals going on the background added with Kurt's power ups, it slows down. I played this game on windowed mode with a controller just so you know. Second, keyboard controls are confusing. I tried it but man.. you'll definitely have a hard time. Finally, in my case it's very frustrating especially in the near end of the game. Right after I finished the story, I immediately uninstalled and yelled, "♥♥♥♥ you Pid I beat yo' ♥♥♥ in the end!".\n\n100/1000 would rather die thousands of times in Dark Souls 2 than in this game.","January 15, 2015","false","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gimmick in this case is that you have a force field type thing where you can push yourself and other things. The gimmick isn't half bad and the puzzles are designed around it. Standard stuff applies. Enemies, spikes, get to the other side. You know the drill.\n\nGood:\nThe art style is FANTASTIC\nThe music is pretty damn good\nThe puzzles with small rooms use the gimmick well and are actually fun to solve.\nNegative:\nThe story is lack luster and forgettable\nPlatforming is a bit meh because of the controls.\nIt's pretty short (But it felt much muuuuuuuch longer in a bad way)\n♥♥♥♥ING HELL\nTHE BOSS BATTLES ARE THE MOST ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING THINGS EVER CREATED. EACH BOSS HAS ONE SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE IT LOOSE HEALTH. IT'S NOT HARD TO DO. THE HARD PART IS THAT THEY HAVE SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥ING HEALTH AND IT TAKES ♥♥♥♥ING FOREVER TO ACTUALLY BEAT THEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REPEAT ♥♥♥♥ AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE LIKE 2-3 HIT POINTS AND ITS ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING.\nTHE PARTS WHERE YOU RUN AWAY ARE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ TOO. You mess up ONE thing. ONE TINY THING, you're dead. DEAD. SLIGHT PAUSE? DEAD. ACCIDENTALLY WERE A MILLIMETER OFF? DEAD. AND THEY ARE ♥♥♥♥ING LONG AND HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING CHECKPOINTS.\nThe difficulty on this game is all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. The platforming is mid level stuff and the boss makes the game turn into ♥♥♥♥ing dark souls. BE ♥♥♥♥ING CONSISTENT\nAlso, some of the levels are just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. There is an entire level in a maze where you have to guide yourself by sound. Sounds fine but there are so many dead ends and it looks the same and the level is so long that you end up backtracking through half of it and hope that you actually are able to (based on luck) get through it.\nI'm recommending this game solely because I liked the parts that revolved around using the gimmick. It was good. The rest of it can go die in a hole. Is it worth $9? If you follow $1/hour, yes. But I would rather spend $10 on something else.\n","May 10, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The development that went into this game must have been from an artistic genius, because the amount of care that went into animation and drawing is good enough to exaggerate about. The mechanics, they offer a style of gameplay which cannot be found elsewhere.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it for all of those reasons, and that was enough for me not to rage quit throughout it (though I did have to take pauses sometimes...) It was difficult at some times, the bosses were sometimes hard, the mechanics took some time to get used to, and the puzzles were a tiny bit confusing. BUT, despite all of that, I think it should be viewed as a challenge. And I'm a sucker for its story and adorableness.\n\nIf you don't mind a challenge, you like platformers, a cool story, music, and puzzles, then I would recommend this. But if you get stressed out easily over things like this, maybe not... Either way, it's a creative concept and is a good game for what it is.","July 12, 2015","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially, the gravity well will be used to assist with reaching greater heights but later on you'll be forced to apply this mechanic to get across obstacles and bypass enemies...or impale them.\n\nSpeaking of enemies: there is a nice variety of them, each with their own peculiarities and weakness. Hint: Take notice of their color.\n\nFinally, be prepared to die often. You only have 1 HP - 2HP depending on how you equip your character, but fortunately in most cases this means reverting back to where you were 1 - 2 seconds before you met your untimely demise.\n\nSolid game.

I'd estimate 75% of it is a very well made and very well thought out puzzle-platformer. The remaining 25% is a frustrating mess that has terrible controls and frustrations. Its frustrations do not come out of its difficulty, but out of the fact that the controls do not live up to the challenge. In some of the key difficult moments in this game, the game does not behave like a well-designed platformer(Rayman Origins, Ms. Splosion Man, Super Meat Boy, etc).\n\nHowever, when the game is good, it is really good. Lots of challenge, lots of great levels, and a whole lot of fun.\n\nI played it in co-op mode with my wife. The co-op is nice, but it has problems. The camera is not smart and follows only one player. Frequently, one of us would fall to our death and the camera chose to stick with the falling player, cutting off the living one and making it impossible. Total mess. Also, the game is not optimized for co-op. It's the same single player mission, which sometimes makes levels much harder. We had to have one of us sit still while the other played. Then again, a few puzzles were cake with co-op, but we saw the difficulty in single player.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Lots of variety(platforming, puzzling, stealth, bosses, and more)\n+ Neat mechanic(beam)\n+ Controls adequately most of the time\n+ Offers a co-op mode\n+ Lengthy and highly worth the low price point\n\nCons\n- Co-op is badly designed\n- Controls can be terrible at time. Poor response. Used Xbox 360 controller.\n- Infuriatingly difficult at times and not in fun ways.\n- Poor music and not a beautiful game\n- Boring story that think it is better than it is.\n\nI got the game for $3 and it was definitely worth it at that price. Pick it up, but know there are some issues.\n\n6.5/10\n","September 7, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like puzzle platformers and own a steam game there is nary a reason not to own this game. The developers recently added an easy mode where they redisigned every room because normal is supposed to be ungodly hard with pinpoint accuracy, so I played that and it felt just right. The graphics feel like they are ripped from a Pixar movie, and often have one or two rooms per level that dazzle you with their difference in style. The gameplay was very solid, and the game did not repetitive because it kept switching genres. One room you might have to do a thought provoking puzzle, while in another you have to escape the screen while the place is exploding ala SMW. The bosses and character design is top notch, and there's even a story, while not particularly special, serves as a great placeholder for the world. In conclusion this game feels like a much better version of Rochard. Buy it! OH AND THE MUSIC. Jesus christ, it might just be the best part.

Now I'm sure it's Might & Delight's puzzling platformer. But while Super Meat Boy's difficulty was something to cherish, a game pitched perfectly between frustration and fascination, Pid's toughness comes from a clumsy control scheme that can't keep up with the challenges it throws at you.\n\nIt's heart-breaking. There's so much going for it, not least visually: Pid's sumptuously realised, soft-focus world begs you to explore and it's matched by a sweet fable of a little lost boy in search of home, marooned in an abstraction of our own world. Peopled by giant chefs and cute bomb-bots, this otherworld feels like it was conjured from a child's imagination - innocent, colourful and curious.\n\nThe boy's main tool to traverse the world is a beam of light: the beam moves you, enemies, bombs and other bits of the level around, and you can have a pair in play at any time. It's a bit like Portal 2's light tunnel. There are some smart puzzles in Pid and the variety is admirable, using beams to push you over chasms, shift security cameras, or delivering primed bombs to their target. Alas, these mental tests are about the only thing that keep you engaged; ultimately, you end up fighting against the controls rather than the levels.\n\nYou will die, but not because the game is challenging you to perfect a route through a level. It's because the loose jumps, the sticky edges, and the awkward beam manipulation simply won't allow you to do what's necessary, even if you're sure you know what's needed. Worse, it occasionally tosses you into situations that seem to exist only as punishment. No-one has ever, ever wanted a boss fight that can kill you in one hit, resetting you to the start of the battle, but so it is in the awkward fight against a giant chef. You have to climb his body as he looms out of the background, clambering up his inside arm to take a shot at his weak spots - a process so infuriatingly imprecise that I had to go and have a lie down in a dark room until my blood pressure settled. Even if my efforts weren't sabotaged by the woeful controls, the threat of instant death alone would be enough to make this egregiously irritating.\n\nA more interesting challenge is to be found in reaching the game's collectible stars. The pointed glowy things form a currency to spend at vending machines throughout the level, and getting to the higher ones requires a fair amount of puzzling. The problems are usually solved with slow, deliberate beam placement. It's as close to fun as Pid gets.\n\nI don't mind difficult platformers. I don't mind difficult puzzle games. But Pid doesn't give you the necessary tools to attack either with any confidence. Pid has lots of levels. It has co-op. But none of that matters when half the time you just want to walk away.\n","February 22","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it for all of those reasons, and that was enough for me not to rage quit throughout it (though I did have to take pauses sometimes...) It was difficult at some times, the bosses were sometimes hard, the mechanics took some time to get used to, and the puzzles were a tiny bit confusing. BUT, despite all of that, I think it should be viewed as a challenge. And I'm a sucker for its story and adorableness.\n\nIf you don't mind a challenge, you like platformers, a cool story, music, and puzzles, then I would recommend this. But if you get stressed out easily over things like this, maybe not... Either way, it's a creative concept and is a good game for what it is.","July 12, 2015","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems the stars are finite, although there is no HUD to track if you've collected them all or not (and you spend them on consumable items..??).\n\n\nCONS:\n-For a platformer with some tricky setups, the games "toss a beam and float through it mechanic" leads to some very looses controls at times. It would have been much better if the player could control the actual landing point of the beam instead of it just being a set distance in front of you (this requires a bit of practice just to learn where the beam lands, and in a game with already poor pacing it really struggles to keep the player engaged).\n-Incredibly slow gameplay.  Looking at the achievements, less than 15% of players have beaten the first boss....probably because they got bored...\n-Slightly floaty controls (not bad, but they aren't tight).","May 18","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
