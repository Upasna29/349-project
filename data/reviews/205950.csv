Maaaan ♥♥♥♥ you get out of here yes you have. This game is known far across the land for it's kickin' soundtrack, beats so thick you could bounce a coin off 'em. Also, it's so old GBA could run it, so don't sweat the specs. Only worry is the keyboard controls suck harder than your EX girlfriend, so grab an Xbox 360 controller and get going.\n\nNow the objective of the game is simple, roll around the city, tag some walls, and keep away from the fuzz. However, this is all done to the sweet sonic sound that will be oozing out of the audio device of your choosing. It also helps that this game has  graphically dated better than you could ever dream of. (Oh snap son.)  You might get one Jet rank on your first playthrough. Might. If you wanna get Jet on every mission you must first study the anicent urban staking gurus.\n\nThere are moments where this game gets janky, though. Even with the right controller getting your character to move how you want can be like trying to guide a small badger through a den of hungry lions. Or sorta like that. Only less guiding the badger through the den and more like the badger just ♥♥♥♥♥ing out, The game also lasts about as long as Chaos Knight's mana bar in a teamfight.\n\nHOWEVER.

Well, the game I COMPLETELY recommend but the PC version is pretty bleh. On PC there's this glitch where you can't load your save data. It still saves but it looks for a file that doesn't exist. So unless you go in and change it with a hex editor (which takes about 10-15 minutes if you know what you're doing. SEGA, WHY YOU NO FIX THIS?!) don't expect to be able to load your save data. If you DO fix it then the game runs and plays the way it should (with a controller at least.

Turs out a guy named Goji thinks the disc is something demonic and wants to get it so he can make a pact with a demon. He wants to take down all the graffiti and make it so there are no more skaters/graffiti artists.\nHe puts Golden Rhino posters all over the graffiti you need to spray graffiti on all of them and show him you aren't scared. After all that it's time to take him on!\nYou beat him in a final battle and the credits start to roll.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics have aged well in my opinion, the game is colorful and the art style really catches your eye.\nSome of the effects are pretty well done too.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is exactly what you would expect from this game. You are rolling around at the speed of sound while tagging graffiti and collecting spray cans so you can tag even more.\nThe red spray cans refill your health, the yellow spray cans give you 1 spray can and the blue spray cans give you a couple of spray cans. Like it's original name ,,Jet Grind Radio" the main focus is grinding and tagging.\nYou perform cooler tricks the faster you are moving, for example if you are really slow and press the jump button you just do a simple jump but if you are going fast and press the jump button your character performs a trick.\nYou can clear stages in a simple casual way or you can be the speed runner and just breeze through the level.\nYou unlock new spray art by finding them around the map. You can customize you tag with letters of your choice or the ones you have unlocked.\n\nPros:+Nice soundtrack\n+Catchy graphics\n+Freedom in stages\n+Multiple playable characters.\n+Good controls (if you are used to them)\n+Characters MEW and GUM (rule 34) ;]\n\nCons:-Shows XBOX 360 controls instead of keyboard keys.\n-Freedom in stages (under a time limit). there is plenty of time on the other hand.\n-Controls may feel clunky if you are not used to them. (You will get used pretty fast, after failing once or twice).\n\nFinal Verdict :~~ 9/10\n\nThe game is great and it's the most fun I have had in steam since ,,Out There Somewhere"\nThis game deserves more than 3.99€","September 11, 2015","true","18.4"," 70 of 84 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","70","84","11","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegolar/recommended/205950/","thegolar","TheGolar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegolar/","171 products in account","I bloody loved Jet Set Radio, back in the days of the Dreamcast. Stylistically, it is still a striking product, with an art style distinct enough that it transcends the need to keep up with technological improvements in gaming. This means that graphically, it is still likely to impress, even though the cel-shading technique it pioneered is now ubiquitous and about as surprising to see in a game as a henchman crouched next to an explosive barrel.\n\nThe gameplay, however, just doesn't stand up to scrutiny anymore, mainly lending to a control scheme so incredibly archaic and clunky it makes my grandma look like a futuristic ninja. I would liken the controls in this game to trying to pull a pallet of bricks around on sheet ice with a bungee cord. The characters seem to want to deliberately cause rage-induced aneurisms in its players, and repeatedly I swore at my screen as the once-charming little punk skaters fell from bulldings as the ADHD camera spun in circles, desperately indecisive as to what to lock onto. I don't remember it being like this when it came out, but then again we were more patient gamers back then.\n\nAnd storywise, it's not anything remarkable, but the charm exuding from every pore in this game is enough to make you want to see it through. A typically Japanese touch sees a racially stereotypical dreadlocked black DJ introducing each story beat, but more importantly the incredible soundtrack. The tunes in this game are probably now its main selling point, and well worth the admission price alone if you're into your chunky beats and late 90's sampling. It certainly takes the edge off when you're trying to wrestle the player characters into doing even one thing you've asked them to.\n\nI feel like I've been very negative about this game, but I still love it. The rose tint of nostalgia will certainly help if you've played previously, but I think theres still enough going for this game that it's worth a go for new players looking to take down the Japanese government with inline skates and spray cans.","March 22, 2015","true","2.9"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","42","46","4","0"

Some good work has been put into this HD remake. It looks great, the colorful art style really lending itself to crisper textures and higher resolutions, the once awkward camera is greatly improved with the modern innovation of two thumbsticks and the soundtrack (arguably the best part of the game) is there in its entirety.\n\nHowever, gameplay wise it looks poor when held up to the standard of modern games. Its controls can be frustrating and its mechanics border on being repetitive. If you have no nostalgia or cant at least appreciate the games groundbreaking style through its old school jank you'll only be disappointed. And even fans may be better off letting the memory of how awesome this game was remain unspoiled by time. But sometimes a straight adaption of a classic given a nice spit shine is the best  you could hope for and if that's the case then you'll definitely find yourself satisfied.","November 26, 2013","true","12.1"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","50","64","0","2"

Jet Grind Radio, as we knew it in North America, was a big deal at the time, thanks in no small part to the cel-shaded graphics ("it looks like a cartoon!") and its absurd premise of street ruffians with magnetic inline skates tagging their turf with graffiti while evading an escalating police onslaught tantamount to the Five-O's response in a Grand Theft Auto game. Apparently urban vandalism is an offense so severe as to warrant an "execute on sight" approach by the logic of JSR's universe, and yet tagging is the only thing that can stop an evil corporate overlord with a giant turntable on top of a skyscraper from using a forbidden vinyl record to summon the devil. Look, if you weren't already drawn in by the aesthetic, the plot isn't going to make converts of anyone.\n\nI'll be the first to admit more than a little bit of bias due to the affection that I and others from my gaming generation have for the Dreamcast. Without making a wholesale "you kind of had to be there" qualifier in my endorsement of Jet Set Radio, the fact is that some of its gameplay aspects haven't held up very well. The controls never felt quite right while trying to stick a rail and initiate a grind, a skill that is crucial to master if you're going to get a handle for traversing the game's maps to make all your tagging goals within the time limit. Sometimes it feels like the geometry could have been a little more forgiving, other times it's the camera that causes you to fumble around in empty space before plummeting past your intended rail, and even after hours of play it's hard to get a feel positioning your character for grinds. Tricks were never supposed to be the game's selling point, but every time a half pipe shows up, the weird space-time dilation of your skater's momentum that occurs combined with the camera's abrupt low swoop gives me a sense of mild vertigo. I usually end up just skating up the side of the pipe and coming to a stop so I can scoot my way forward to the tagging point I'm supposed to hit. Fun.\n\nThe PC port supplements the basic Dreamcast controls by adding camera control with the right analog stick, which while not an unwelcome addition, doesn't add much benefit while trying to navigate levels that were never designed to be these massive sprawling cityscapes. The result is that panning the camera around makes the environment seem a little more claustrophobic. JSR's graphical aesthetic still holds up pretty well, although as a game originally intended for 480i televisions, some of the seams start to show on a modern high resolution monitor. The primitive models for bystanders stand out much more in comparison to your articulate skater, and some of the textures are just butt ugly.\n\nStill, time hasn't done much to dilute Jet Set Radio's charm, and I can't rightly call it a bad game despite its more frustrating gameplay moments (there's that bias showing again, whither goest thou, objectivity?). Some will undoubtedly be less tolerant of the clunky controls than I was during my revisit of it, and had it been framed as a regular inline skating game with less heart and a celebrity endorsement and Offspring songs, I probably wouldn't have given it much of my time either. If you want to briefly reconnect with the good feels that JSR gave you back in the day, this port will scratch that itch. But if you still have a (functioning) Dreamcast sitting in the attic, you might as well dust that off and fire up some of the other classics from that era.","June 14, 2015","true","8.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Tokyo-to is a city where hip-hop/grafitti is the dominant culture and rollerskates are the transportation method of choice, at least amongst the gangs in town. You play as various characters from a local gang known as the GGs. Gameplay is simple. You skate around the city, grinding and jumping, and spray graffiti at marked locations, to assert GGs presence in the streets or wipe out rival gangs\n\nLearning to skate in Jet Set Radio is kind of hard. Controlling your character isn't that intuitive, and accuracy in your movements is very important. There isn't that much lenience. If you screw up, you'll screw up. Sometimes it feels like your character has a mind of its own. Movement is definitely the weakest part of the game, However, the slightly awkward movement didn't stop it from being ridiculously fun. Gameplay is varied and level design is consistently well thought out. There isn't a dull level in the game.\n\nGraphically and artistically, Tokyo-to is represented beautifully. It is clear that meticulous effort was taken in designing the city, which feels very familiar if you've been to Tokyo, but way cooler. This port looks great on the PC. At 1920x1080 it looks awesome thanks to cel-shaded characters and a highly developed cartoon style. Coupled with a very cool, slightly obscure upbeat hip-hop soundtrack, you can get lost in the world for quite some time.\n\nThe game has alot of replay value with the unlockables and I find myself playing it over and over even though I have everything unlocked on the Dreamcast.\n\nOverall: Jet Grind Radio/Jet Set Radio remains simply one of the best games I have ever played, on the Dreamcast, if you have a Dreamcast you need to buy it right now. or on the PC but i still recommend it on the DC.\nNote: I Love Dreamcast forever,ouh it is still right next to me here by the way","November 22, 2012","true",""," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/205950/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Compared to it's successor, this game can easily hold it's own. The only thing lacking is the local co-op concepts they've added to JSRF.\n\nIt's about living the life in Tokyo-to, tagging the streets, listening to the underground pirate radio and dancing even when someone is talking to you. There really is no other game I've seen similar to this. Roller skates are used by each character all the time and cannot be taken off to walk around. This isn't much of an issue as moving about is relatively simple and easy. It gets a bit complicated at certain points when you want to stop as it does take time to come to a full stop from full speed. None the less the game tries it's best to go over the top with what they gave you. Grinding (on rails) is another big aspect to the game. I remember it being a lot easier in JSRF than it is in JSR. In JSRF, you could be near the rail and have a bit of leeway if you missed your mark. In JSR, you have to be pretty precise in your movements to land on top of the area you want to grind. In JSRF, you were allowed to walk into a grind whereas here, you'll need to press jump ("A") before you get going. Once you get how the game mechanics work, it'll all slowly fall into place. There are times you may find yourself randomly falling off grind rails. This may be due in part that you are actually colliding with something that you should be jumping over. There were certain parts in the game where for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my characters would suddenly just stop, drop and free fall from a grind. I later noticed that indeed, you do need to jump over or avoid certain obstacles. This is most notable with power poles. Either than that, the grinding is actually pretty smooth and some pretty sick combos/jumps can be made rail to rail.\n\nImagine grinding on a rail, then riding a billboard, jumping onto a truck and grinding that, then jumping on power lines then finally, grinding on roofs to reach a "tag point" (where you need to graffiti). This is just one of the many possible combos available. Unlike JSRF, you cannot do moves as you are grinding on a rail. Meaning in the newer game, you were able to press x if you were grinding for a while to do a technique on the rail. Here, you are only able to do moves when you are jumping. Moves can be strung together by timing your next jump right. By keeping the timing right, this also let's you keep your momentum and speed. Tagging is a lot more inclusive in this one than JSRF. They will ask you to rotate the stick in all sorts of directions to complete your graffiti art. Bigger murals will take more time, technique and paint. Besides having the basic movements of jumping and tagging, the player may also hit the sprint button ("RT") for a little extra umph while the right stick allows you to move the camera.\n\nFor future Jet Set games, I would recommend adding more actions (such as shouldering people as your moving through an area) or something along those lines. More controls means more action. The story itself is pretty cool and characters are nothing short of creative. It starts out as small time gangs beefing in which it starts to turn into all out war with a certain group of unknowns. When you initially start tagging the streets, police will show up and try to take you down. The first guy is not too bad, but pretty soon you'll have riot police with tear gas, tanks, helicopters and even pyromaniacs chasing you down. Although this adds great excitement to the game, there is one great flaw that the other game had that this one didn't : you cannot retaliate! You can't hit back or even tag your enemies to knock them down. If you run into a cop full speed, you'll be taking the brunt of the damage. If you run into another character, they will sort of stumble but your character will feel all the force (especially your health bar). This is the one little thing I couldn't get over as I want to fight back! I know it ain't easy going against tanks but hey, if a little spray paint gets into their engines, I'm sure their check engine lights will go on. You may retaliate to certain extents. There is a level where helicopters will be hovering by power cables in which you can tag them as you pass along (leading to their extermination). The levels try their best to stay diverse and to challenge the player differently. There will be surprise levels where someone will ask to join your squad. You may have to race these people to a tag spot or battle it out with them by tagging their backs. Cops won't always chase you if you manage to reach a safe zone.\n\nLevels at first may seem a bit small, but they've done a hell of a job putting everything together. You will start off small in one area which eventually will allow you to travel to other areas as you progress through the game. You will have to be attentive though as you may have tagged everything in this area, but there is still another area within the city to tag! It's not always super obvious that you are going to the next area. Sometimes it is a bit hard to tell which graphics are simply background graphics and which graphics can lead you to another area. None the less, I think it is great that they decided to make levels interconnected to make them feel bigger. In JSRF, going from place to place is a lot easier than JSR. Red arrows will indicate areas that are needed to be tagged in order to beat the level while green arrows will indicate optional tags (for more points)! An addition this game had that JSRF didn't have was the ability to ride on the back of cars! Don't want to go up a big hill? Catch a ride!\n\nMy biggest issue deciding whether or not to purchase this game was it's graphics. This game was released in 2000 which is extremely hard to believe and it would be harder to play because I already played the newer version. Nonetheless, the graphics did not bother me at all. The devs went with a cell shading scheme which doesn't have as many lines as say Borderlands, but still provides for a pleasurable playing experience. Any gamer playing this will not have an issue with how anything looks. Sounds are pretty neat and really add the extra enjoyment to the game. Jet Set Radio games are known for their awesome sound tracks. I should probably give you a warning as some songs are weird.\n\nOverall, this is a great game and would recommend everyone to try it (especially on a sale price). If you like this, you'll definitely like Jet Set Radio Future (which unfortunately isn't on steam yet)! The grinding challenges and the diversity of where you can go in levels will definitely have you testing your skills.\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C	Overall 	B\nScreenShots :\nI know him only as Corn\n\nThis was a neat feature they added\n\nQTE's while tagging\n\nAs if Swat wasn't enough\n\nSCREW IT!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixS4/recommended/205950/","PhoenixS4","The Phoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixS4/","57 products in account","If I were to describe Jet Set Radio in one sentence, it would be, "Wow, this game is ridiculously hard, but it's also really fun, and the soundtrack is awesome."\n\nThe first thing you should know is that this game is extremely unforgiving and very likely to turn away beginners. I would normally recommend trying the tutorial, but even that is hard as all hell until you figure out how to consistently loop around the stage. Oh, and if you think the tutorial is difficult, just wait until you see the actual game! The gameplay consists of your character of choice roller skating around the various districts of Tokyo-to and spraying graffiti upon every kind of surface imaginable (yes, you can even cover the game's initial antagonist with graffiti, and it is HILARIOUS). Each level is absolutely merciless, to the point that I once got stuck on an early level for what felt like an eternity. There were many times where I stopped playing the game for days at a time out of sheer frustration, but it's that very frustration, as well as a drive to improve, that kept me coming back. It's the kind of game that pisses you off just enough to make you want to keep playing, and the feeling when you finally complete god-damn Fight or Flight a really hard level is just incredible. Even if you've never played Jet Set Radio before and you're having a really rough time with it, you have to persevere and rely on your own skill to get further in the game, and you'll end up feeling much better about what you've accomplished as a result. Except chapter 2, that part really does just suck.\n\nThe story is exactly what you'd expect: you've got the rebellious skaters/graffiti artists who want to express their freedom through their art, and the crazy police force that tries to stop them through any means necessary (such as shooting them on sight without hesitation and even calling in mother♥♥♥♥ing armed helicopters with god-damn homing missiles). It's over-the-top in the best way possible, but it also really makes you consider who the real bad guy is. Sure, graffiti is often meant as vandalism, but when people want to express such an art form in a restrictive society, what else is there to do? At the same time, the police may be attempting to stop this violation of the law, but are they any better than the so-called "criminals" when they're taking measures far beyond reasonable legal punishment? Play far enough through the story and you just might find an answer.\n\nNext up is the soundtrack, and DAAAAAAAAAAYUM, is it good. It and the rest of the game are an excellent representation of the "turn of the millennium" between the 90's and 2000's, much like The Matrix (and interestingly enough, the two share a song, being "Dragula" by Rob Zombie). Hideki Naganuma is the main composer, with several other artists such as Deavid Soul, Richard Jacques, and Guitar Vader making contributions as well. My personal favorite is "Rock It On," as it serves as the perfect theme for this game's story of a revolution upon a legitimately evil government. If you're wondering why I chose the words "legitimately evil," then you're just gonna have to PLAY THE GAME!\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game if you're a hardcore motha♥♥♥♥a and you love awesome games with amazing soundtracks.\n\n(Jet Set Radio Future HD now pls Sega?)","January 5, 2015","true","47.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","15","16","5","0"

As you move the camera the character moves a bit with it so sometimes if you move the camera with the keyboard you might fall off or something.\n\nAs young me played Jet Set Radio Future on the Xbox witouth knowing that wasnt the first jet set radio i wanted to check this out\n\nI really enjoyed it and you should get this game\n\nAlso seeing the difference between characters on the future version and this version i can understand why they changed some... *Looks at Combo* as you play the game you'll notice why im saying this...\n\nMy rating is 8/10 TOTALLY WORTH TRYING OUT....\n\n*SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER*\nThe last graffiti you make on story mode is on the big bald head of the ''baddiest of baddies''","March 29, 2015","true","6.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

It's been one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while.\n\nThe goal of the game is to tag the biggest marks before the police arrive and escalate in force, and to tag all marks in a timely manner - unless you're hanging around doing sick tricks like Otto Rocket to top that leaderboard.  Levels are divided into sections, but most sections double back on one another, preventing tedium and allowing you to scope out your marks before tagging. Don't be alarmed by how sluggish the controls feel, squid.  They're given such qualities on purpose, and once the controls are understood, they are completely congruous to the level design.  You'll be tricking off of everything.  It will be so great.\n\nLike NiGHTs or Crazy Taxi, there's always room to play better and improve your score, making the game addictive and arcade-like.  Unlike NiGHTs or Crazy Taxi, this is the only one I can stand playing for so long.\n\nThe problems with this game are the sometimes-spotty collision detection, the camera (you're given some control but it is never really perfect), and the rival fights.\n\n6.9/7","June 6, 2014","true","19.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It still looks absolutely fantastic.  The cel-shaded graphics are better than ever: some tweaks make this feel great in high-def.  Not just the style, but the fluid animation, the textures, and the character design are as fresh as ever.  And it has a surprising amount of places to go and things to accomplish.  I remember beating this game.\n\nIt also really does validate the existence of its sequel, Jet Set Radio Future.  The level design here is solid, but JSRF really takes it to new heights, and I find myself wanting to play some of those levels.  I also appreciate that they go on to simplify the graffiti mechanic.  The circular motions have always been a little frustrating.  When they work, they're very satisfying—you feel like you've got this DOWN.  When they don't, it feels like it wasn't your fault and it's frustrating.\n\nWhile the updates to this game aren't massive, they provide a more-than-adequate excuse to buy this on Steam at such a reasonable price, to be able to play instantly. How many people still have their Dreamcasts ready to play?  Kudos to SEGA for releasing this great game at a compelling price.

Has this game stood the test of time or are things from this era in gaming history best left alone?\n\nThe story is a very simple one, you play as a member of the GG's, a group of youngsters in the city of Tokyo-To who fight other groups in the many locations in the game world. Your goal is one of expression through dance, music, and graffiti.\n\nThe design of the game is that of a very simple one. Pressed by time you go around tagging up different parts of the city to expand your territory all the while escaping the clutches of the police. The game also invokes a sense of style in how you go about your mission. It isn’t just enough to tag up the city but to make sure you look cool while you do it.\n\nThe gameplay is one of an intense cat and mouse. Finding the areas you need to tag while being chased by police, dogs, helicopters, and tanks (not all at the same time, mind you). All the while the sands of father time slip down in the hour glass. But, before you can tag anything you have to gather spray cans which are spread around the different levels. Each of the characters you can choose from has a certain amount of graffiti they can carry as well as a certain amount of health and skill for pulling off tricks. When finding an area in need of some graffiti, you enter into a mode of a series of quick time events. In these events you swing the left analog stick in a specific direction (specific button presses on the keyboard). If you are to mess up the event you lose a can of graffiti in the process, but when you restart you start back at the beginning.\n\nAfter clearing a section of the game in the single player campaign, levels will become opened to the other three modes of the game.\nJet Graffiti: a mode in which you spray paint (tag) the streets.\nJet Technique: a mode where you earn as many points as you can (i.e. do as many tricks as you can) until time is up.\nJet Crush: in this mode you pick a person from your group to race with someone else in your group.\n\nBringing in something completely new to the scene (at the time), the game shows off its cell shaded graphics which give the feeling of playing an anime/manga. Accompanying the new graphic style is a diverse array of music ranging from j-pop, hip-hop, funk, electronic dance, rock, and acid jazz. The graffiti in the game was the work done by several artists, most notably Eric Haze who contributed several pieces including the game’s logo.\n\nThe game also has a nice level of replayability with online leaderboards for all game modes (including the campaign). Jet set radio also has unlockable characters of the different gangs you go up against, as well as a few other surprises ;].\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any gamer, it just oozes cool.","December 19, 2013","true","66.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Blending Hip-Hop, Dance, Techno, Jazz, Funk, Rock, Metal, and even Salsa the soundtrack is perhaps one of the best soundtracks you will ever hear let alone in a video game.\n\nFor under $10, this a gem that you should buy and experience at least once(you can easily beat it in 5 hours), and perhaps convince SEGA to give this series new life.\n\n\nJET SET RADDDIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","January 1, 2013","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Sega always nails it when it comes to graphics, as this game has a nice, visualized art style with vibrant, popping colors. All throughout the game, you're tuned in to the "Jet Set Radio" station where awesome music plays during the stage. Keeps everything upbeat and fun to listen to. The gameplay is essentially to spray the entire area with your graffiti while avoiding the authorities (Which you can also spray on them. For fun, you know?) It's fast paced action with a decent play time. You can even make your own graffiti in a little creator! (That is, whatever you can make by using a controller...)

It's 'just' an HD update. Let me tell you that it looks great in motion, especially in 1080p resolutions or higher. It's simply brilliant. The textures are still the same though. And they haven't aged well. They look really low res at times, which is somewhat disappointing. The controls also haven't been upgraded (camera view aside), but that's not such a big issue since they have always worked properly to begin with. The gameplay itself has been kept intact and it's still as fun and original as it was 12 years ago. It's a mix of (doing tricks while) skating and spraying graffiti, while avoiding the law/enemies and fighting rival gangs for control of the city.\n\nAwesome stuff !\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","October 4, 2012","true","5.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Though my steam hours may be kind of lacking, I've played this game a lot on the Dreamcast. This port is fantastic and playing it in HD is such a joy. But what is it that makes this game so special?\n\nFirst off, lets talk music. This game has one of the greatest soudtracks of all time. Every song is incredibly varied and every single one will get stuck in your head. Hideki Naganuma created an absolute masterpiece with this soundtrack.\n\nNext thing worth mentioning are the visuals. This game was originally made in the year 2000, thats 14 years ago, and it STILL looks good to this day. Sure, some of the textures may be a bit lacking and objects may seem a bit blocky by today's standarads, but for an HD re-release of a game thats 14 years old, it holds up really well.\n\nThe game play is really fun as well. The game has a really good flow to it, seeing as it relys heavily on your momentum. Sure, some say the controls are a bit clunky and the auto-grinding can be a pain sometimes, but once you get used to it, those things stop being an issue (for the most part). Grinding down a railing,, jumping off to wall ride, doing a backflip off of said wall onto another railing, all while spraying graffiti and avoiding helicopter and tank fire still feels as awesome as ever.\n\nWith all of this said, I heavily recommend purchising this game, whether you've played the original or not.

The absolute best part about this game is its design. Between the cel-shading and the vibrant colors, this game is astonishing to look at even with its low-poly models and slightly aged textures. It definitely looks like it's been touched up a bit, and even then the game has aged wonderfully. The soundtrack goes along with its aethstetic perfectly with turntablist hip hop tunes, electronic tracks with backing guitars, and a singular pop-punk track thrown in there for whatever reason, but even that track fits in.\n\nThe game's story is simple, nothing notable in the least and most of the time gets over-shadowed by the humorous and lighthearted dialogue in the cutscenes. The gameplay, however, is where the game takes a hit. It's not so much that the game itself is difficult, but it's that the controls are a bit clunky and sometimes frustrating. The way the game punishes you for getting too close to a challenger you're supposed to tag a group or race an opponent is the biggest flaw, with issues like inconsistencies with tricks and enemies that you just can't shake off being minor in comparison. It's easy to get past most of the flaws with a little experience. The game is that it's fairly short with about 6-8 hours of gameplay and a five dollar price tag, it's not that big of a deal in the big picture.\n\nWith that said, I think this has to be one of the greatest deals on steam. Five dollars for a completely unique experience you will not get with any other title. Less than most titles on steam, and less than most things period. Buy a copy of this game right now, and maybe buy some copies for your friends. If this game goes on sale for 50% off or less, then buy copies for all your friends. 9/10","February 7, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And in glorious HD. Part action/platformer, part in line skate video game, Jet Set Radio is a unique and extremely fun title. One of the first titles to ever use the now common cel-shading graphics, it certainly has a unique visual style, even today. You play as part of a group of young in line skaters, bombing the system by skating around in different urban environments in Tokyo-to, and tagging different areas while running from the local police, and competing with other gangs. Not the type of gangs you'd think of. Just groups of rival graff heads looking to lay stake in different areas by putting up their own signature tags. This game was fresh more than a decade ago, and still a blast to play today. It's also accompanied by an extremely catchy soundtrack filled with artists ranging from genres of J-Pop, underground hip hop, and more. This version features nearly all of the music featured in both the PAL and North American versions. The 1 Japanese only track is still missing from the game.","November 18, 2012","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well i didnt felt any diffrence between Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio HD, except the addition of textures with better quality, anti-aliasing 8x, achievements and some audio replacements/additions and better camera control with right analog stick.  If you love the Jet Set Radio from DC you will love this one as well, its kind amazing feeling the nostalgia from goodies from past.\n\nHopefully  SEGA will release the Jet Set Radio Future HD, if that will happen its like another dream came true.","October 1, 2012","true","36.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Doesn't matter where, be it PC, PS3, Xbox or the original Dreamcast, you NEED this game!\n\nThis game does have a couple short comings, the most promenant being you can't perform tricks manually. So if you've played JSRFuture, you're going to be a bit frustrated at that fact. But it's easy enough to get over once you get used to other methods of gaining speed.\n\nThe story is very creative and the levels are very colorful. It's great to just explore a level rather than speed through it because of how great everything looks.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best sound tracks for any video game. Definitely top 10 for me. This updated version had to remove two songs from the original due to copyright issues but trust me the songs that remain are awesome! My favorite so far being "Miller Ball Breakers".\n\nTo anyone who has played Jet Set Radio Future before playing this one you may notice some similarities between the stories, but nothing that spoilers anything. In fact, even though the stories are similar they are very different from each other.\n\nI recommend this game to EVERYONE. And grab a gamepad for this game, it feels so much better with one. I use the Official Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Controller and it works perfectly.\n\nMESSAGE TO SEGA:\nPlease work on an HD release for Jet Set Radio Future and if it's not too much to ask, another sequel as well. This series is under appreciated but if you market it right you'll see just how many people are waiting for a new Jet Set!","May 7, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

With Jet Set Radio's Steam release, the once-exclusive content is now available for everyone.\n\nThe game has been remade in HD, which from what I can tell, this simply means that the game was increased in resolution to look suitable on HD widescreens. The assets as far as I can tell are untouched. (Which is a good thing to me.)\n\nFeatures an incredible soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in a video game.\n\nHas a fair amount of replay value in trying to achieve Jet ratings on all the levels, unlocking all the characters, collecting all the Graffiti Souls, and unlocking the achievements.\n\nIf you didn't play Jet Set Radio back then, you might not like it today, which is what I believe caused the sudden surge in negative reviews since the game became free on February with the Make Love Not War event. It's a 16 year old game, and some would find it to be outdated by today's standards. Do some research and see if it's a game in which you're interested.\n\nIf you're like me and liked Jet Set Radio back then, you'll most likely love it today as myself and many others do, and I'd definitely recommend it on Steam, with all the new features and improvements. I got it for free with the Make War Not Love event on Steam, so in no way whatsoever can I complain.","March 3","true","28.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The goal of the game is to hit various parts of this futuristic city and tag them up with graffiti while avoiding the corrupt police officers when they send the friggen army in to take you out.\n\nThere are very clearly influences given from games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Though that game was very much focused on it's tricks and scoring. With this game, great preference is given to it's aesthetic and especially it's soundtrack.\n\nWhile I consider it's successor on the original Xbox; Jet Set Radio Future to be superior. Jet Set Radio is still an alright game. Just remember to buy a gamepad if you do wanna play it since the keyboard controls are simply horrible.","June 2, 2013","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

The controls are a pain at first but you get use to them, still it can become frustrating at time when enemies become more aggressive or you happen to miss that jump when racing against the clock, often your preformance can be sluggest because you lack speed. This game's music and art direction is what keeps it motivated. There's no import spray option for when you prefer your own taste of graffiti, but luckly a 3rd party program allows that.

The controls for this game can only be linked to the keyboard, unless you own an xbox controller (which i dont).  As a pro player the change from the controller to the keyboard was really overwhelming at the beginning, but it did not ruin the experience of the game as many users stated    -_-.  As it is with everything, you get used to the controllers, and will soon be busting out backflips on your skates WHILE painting a grafitti in no time.\nAlso i jest beat the game before writing this so it did not take that long to beat, its a decent leght, with 10 different unlockable characters, and the unchangable difficulty setting is perfect, and leaves you with a sense of acomplishment after beating each of the later difficult levels.

It also looks a lot better running at higher resolutions with AA. Like a lot of the other Dreamcast ports though, it either works for you or it doesn't, and Sega's budget for post-release patches seems to be minimal. Many people don't have problems, but I had to use a fan-made patch to the .exe to un-cap the framerate, or else it would run at 7.5fps in super slow motion, then a third-party program to lock it back down to 30fps or it'd run too quickly. It's enough of a hassle that, along with the random crashes, I lost interest pretty quickly.

A masterpiece in my eyes.\nRecommended for every rollerblades, graffiti, quirky art style, nice electro music or just funny outlaw action lovers.\nP.S.

I will edit again once I verify that to be true.\n\nThis is overall a good game and I like it a lot, but it must be said that the controls are kind of bad. Mainly the directional inputs when jumping and the fact that the spray graffiti button also centers the camera (this remake adds camera control to the right stick, yet this annoying feature remains). The latter can't be fixed, but for the jumping, make sure that if you need to jump to the side less than 45 degrees, that you jump first then fine tune your direction while you are in the air.

First off I'd like to say what a disappointment this port is on a technical level. Stuttering textures and cut off sound bites are all throughout the game, and though the last time I play JSR was 10 years ago, I think I can safely say I don't remember these issues on the Dreamcast version. There's also a bug where your game might not be able to save, but will indicate that it has, which is only fixable by editing the hex values of the game's executable (where it turns out one instance of the word SAVE should be lowercase).\n\nDespite the incompetence of whoever allowed these bugs to blight such a colorful weave in the tapestry of gaming history, JSR still fares okay. The art style is vibrant and colorful, there's excellent music that fits the tone perfectly, and the world it presents is interesting and lively. In fact, the game's flair is essentially it's only selling point, as the gameplay is stiff and feels alien to control, like your actions have a hard time corresponding to your key presses, messing up the energetic flow that every other part of the experience is trying to create.\n\nYou'll be cruising down Benten-Cho with Miller Ball Breakers thumping rhythmically; you're getting all pumped and ready to do some nice tricks, but you get snagged on wayward geometry or land one micrometer away from the rail you were trying to stick because despite the cartoony art style and space physics, JSR can require almost real-life skating precision sometimes. It's frustrating and it takes way too long to recover from bailing, which wouldn't be so bad were it not for the missions being timed and often involving chases. The controls are so jerky it's actually somehow preferable to play on a keyboard, which I didn't think was possible with a skating game.\n\nIt's a game of missed potential, but is still worth a buy just to get entrenched in the youthful, rebellious atmo, and get a handle on what the Dreamcast brought to the table as a launch title, so there's a historic glimmer to it that way.\n\n5/10\n","July 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only ever crashed once for me, everything else has been fine, no slowdown even on a mediocre PC.

It is the symbol of the Dreamcast era of SEGA for a reason.\nFirst of all, the graphics aged well, thanks to cel-shading (arguably, this game invented cel-shading) and an awesome artist work. If you can appreciate the great style over the amount of polygons per model, you're going to enjoy how this game looks even today.\nThe soundtrack is all kinds of awesome. I don't think anything needs to be said here.\nThe gameplay however, is the reason why I would take JSRF over this one. The controls could be wonky at times, the tutorial is borderline impossible to complete because of one needless challenge at the end, and also the time limit will make you rage at one point or another. And overall, Jet Set Radio is not as smooth as it's sequel. Well, after all, this game turns 14 soon.\nJSR is still one of my favorites, and still is a classic.

Probably the most important fact here !\n- You can get a long playtime for a cheap price !\n- This game is pretty challenging. The difficulty is just right imo. Sometimes it can be annoying to repeat a single level over and over again. But, when you managed to finish it, man. The happiness is real.\n- GUM.\n\n(-)\n- The controls on keyboard+Mouse is... not really comfortable imo, i suggest you to play with controller.\n- The camera is kinda hard to control sometimes, or maybe it's just me.\n- The tutorial is kinda bad, i can't seems to finish it even though i already followed the instruction.\n\nThis game is totally worth it, mate.

It is a rather fun game, but at the same time the game suffers on many different levels.\n\nThe gameplay of Jet Set Radio is rather interesting. You play as part of a group of Punks that decide to graffiti areas of the town you are in. You do this by rollerblading across maps of varying length, depending on the stage and how late in the game you are.  Its a rather refreshing game, because it isn't seen too much in games. However, the game is mainly split into two different parts as a result of the two extremely different styles of gameplay. The graffiti painting is extremely shallow as a mechanic, because you just move the joystick in a certain direction as a quicktime event. However, the directions you move the joystick in is the same for every single piece of graffiti you paint. It becomes quite tiring because halfway through the game you will probably have the patterns down by muscle memory, and it becomes rather a pain to have to move the joystick in the same directions every time. The game would have benefitted from having you move the stick inn a different direction, or having different patterns. Otherwise the graffiti spraying just becomes you moving the stick as fast as you can while still being slow enough for the game to register you starting the pattern. However, the patterns you follow change depending on the character you pick, so you can choose a different character\n\nIn terms of the rollerblading, it requires you to be good at the game if you want to get far.  Whenever you start moving, you start out at a very slow pace. To be able to get to a decent speed (to where you can actually grind on rails), you neet to press a button. However, there is absolutely no reason to not be pressing this button every single time you are on the ground. It would have been much better if they had made you speed up by default when you are on the ground.\n\nThere are two main types of "special moves" you have in terms of rollerblading. Other than just moving and jumping you are able to grind on rails and jump off of walls. Jumping off of the walls actually is much easier than it seems at first, and poses no real challenge. However, the wall jumping is extremely situational, because there are not many gaps that actually require you to wall jump, and there are very few places where wall jumping can be beneficial, or even possible. Most of the time is is either to go through a small shortcut or to get to optional spaces to spray paint.\n\nGrinding on rails on the other hand is an entirely different story. You NEED to learn how to grind on the rails if you want to be able to have a reasonable speed, or to get away from enemies. Not being able to land on the rails is disasterous. Without mastering rail grinding, entire sections of the maps are locked from you. Without grinding, the game is completely unbeatable. However, it can be quite finicky to get on a rail. You need to be absolutely set on where you are going to be before you start your jump, because you get very little control of your character while in the air. As such, you need to be able to determine where you will be as you are jumping. You also don't cling to rails, so you have to be completely precise.\n\nThe stages are usually pretty easy in the beginning, but halfway throughout the game the difficulty really goes up. After tagging different gangs' graffiti you have to tag the gang members as they run away from you. However, you have to be extremely close to them, and then spam the graffiti button. This is extremely tedious, because they follow the same path and loop around the map, and are just barely slower than you. Not only that, but the areas you have to go through can be extremely tight areas, preventing you from really gaining on them, because you need perfect inputs to keep your speed. These can be extremely tiresome, because there are three gang members for each of these stages, and you have to complete them. However then you have to face against certain enemies while trying to tag graffiti on the walls in other stages. In the earlier stages these enemies can be easy to avoid/get rid of because they are just people on foot, or they are helicopters you can take out by tagging. However, later on you face other enemies that have extremely long range attacks, or high manuverability. In one stage, the enemy has jetpacks, so you are not able to lose them. It also doesn't help that you have no way to fight back, other than tagging helicopters as mentioned earlier. All you can do is run.\n\nThe game is also extremely short, only taking me 5 hours to beat. However, I left the game idle for an hour in there, and I've played the game twice before, so about 4 hours. For someone's first time, 5-6 hours would be expected. There isn' much reason to replay the game afterwards, because it's just the same missions in the story mode again.\n\nLuckily, you have many characters to choose from in the game, many of them having unique stats. These stats are Power, Technique, and Graffiti. These control your health, the speed and points you get from grinding, and the difficulty and points gained from tagging, respecitively. Therefore, power is more of a difficulty rating. The higher it is, the easier the game is, and the lower score/rank you get. However, one stat that should exist is the number of paint cans a character can carry, because each character has their own limit. However, this stat is never shown, and you pretty much have to look up how much each character can carry.\n\nThe music is pretty good, not only for some of the tracks (though there are a couple duds) but for the way the music switches between tracks. Instead of fading to nothing as a track ends and going to another one, they transition into each other natually as if there is a DJ changing the tracks. It took me a while to notice this, because I thought that the music was instead just a few really long tracks. It's quite impressive, because it doesn't take you out of the game, and fits with the style of the game.\n\nThe graphics, despite being from the early 2000's, are still presentable today because of the more stylized approach take by the designers. The cell-shaded graphics are still pleasing to see today, however, some of the textures (especially facial ones) could have been cleaned up. Either way, the game has definitely aged well graphically.\n\nOverall, the game, while having its drawbacks, doesn't cease to be a fun experience as long as you are good at the game. If you figure out the mechanics, and can learn to hop from rail to rail easily, the game can be an absolute blast. Otherwise, the game can become quite a slog, as you slowly make your way to the tag locations. The game doesn't offer too much in terms of replay value, but is fun to pop in now and again. However, if you have an original Xbox, I would much rather reccomend Jet Set Radio Future, which made the gameplay less clunky overall. However, this game is still fun, and with various features like all of the characters and the customizable graffiti art, you can have tons of fun with it.","February 28","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game revolves around you performing tricks, but mainly spraying graffiti at certain points. The small graffiti just ask you to press a button to spray, but larger spray tags, named large or extra-large sprays, require you to perform quick time events with the analog stick (or keys if you played on keyboard, like I did).\n\nThe game features 4 rival 'teams', the first 3 are the Love Shockers, Noise Tanks and Poison Jam, and then finally the Golden Rhinos. The first 3 are just rival gangs which you are targeted with spraying over their tags while the police stop you from doing so, which leads to the captain Onishima leading a SWAT team, Helicopters, Air Squads, Tanks, Guard Dogs and even more to stop you. Eventually, after beating all 3 teams, the Golden Rhinos then make an appearance.\n\nThe story is silly and is quite fun to play with. The game is generally quite fun and easy unless you plan to go for Jet ranking on all levels, unlocking all the characters and graffiti in the game.\n\nThe game is definitely worth playing and buying, but hopefully in the future we'll get the sequel Jet Set Radio Future.","April 3","true","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Jet Set Radio gave me a unique and interesting, colorful story regarding gang rivalries and the exploration of graffiti as an artform, as told by the mad DJ, Professor K.\nJet Set Radio Future visuals are stylistic and has been able to stand the test of time. The game is accompanied by fun and catchy electronic rap songs and an almost perfect, fluid control scheme. To say the least about JSRF's gameplay is: If you messed up on a jump or trick then it was most likely your fault.\nWhen I started up Jet Set Radio I expected it to be worse than JSRF in all these aspects. I was proven wrong. Jet Set Radio feels almost on par with Jet Set Radio Future, while lacking in some areas of course.\n\nJet Set Radio:\nPros:\n+ Interesting and colorful story that keeps you engaged\n+ Fun and catchy soundtrack\n+ Diverse cast of characters with different skill sets\n+ Engaging challenges per level\n+ Professor K\n+ Professor K's voice\n\nCons:\n- Time Limit on Missions\n- Controls and sprays can be confusing and clunky if you play with a keyboard\n- Xbox 360 Controller recommended for maximum enjoyment\n- A good port in everything besides controls\n\nOverall:\nWhile the controls hold the game back to a certain extent it can still be enjoyable.

It already is cheap and on sales it's even cheaper!\n\nHopefully Sega will someday remember and decide to give us an HD port of the game's sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, originally available on the first Xbox, since I had found that to be bigger in everything (graphics, soundtrack and open world) and not that much dated compared to today's games!\n\nThe Dreamcast era, my favorite gaming era, is sadly over, but it's thanks to HD Ports like this that it continues to live... and with the now announced revival of Shenmue 3 (google it if you don't know what it is, we are talking about my absolute favorite games ever) all I can say is... long live childhood years!","July 4, 2015","true","28.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

One of my favorite games from my childhood - back then, it was a game like no other - and that still stands today.  The visuals have aged very well and the graphics look great in HD.  The soundtrack is also as amazing as ever (Naganuma is some kind of a genius), even though a few songs were cut.  The gameplay is fun and challenging - I don't remember it being this hard!  The main thing that could have been changed during the port is the controls.   It plays exactly like it did on the Dreamcast.  Keyboard movement is restricted to 8 directions (like the Dreamcast D-Pad) and an external analog stick isn't much better.  Getting used to movement with a Dualshock 3 was rough, especially with how difficult the game is naturally.  Steam Achievements is a nice bonus as well  Still totally recommend if you were a fan of the original Dreamcast release!

It's a game where you go around a colourful and stylised Tokyo spray tagging the city for your gang. I am recommending this game but if I was to rate it out of 10, it'd probably a 6.5. This game controls very stiffly at times, and there's a lot of thing to hinder your momentum, taking away from the fun. Also as funny and challenging the over-the-top guards can be, it's annoying how a lot of the time you can't defend yourself from them, making the game frustrating often.

In the few years active the dreamcast library got flooded by great, original and exclusive games.

The arcade-like gameplay suits the design choices perfectly and it's great.\n\n(The gameplay is actually more like a vehicle to the real purpose of the game, which is to immerse players in the developers idea of Tokyo in the 90's. But this is my interpretation after completing the game dozens of times.)\n\nJSR/JSRF are cult classics from the culmination of a not so far bygone age. An age where SEGA was a force to reckon in video games. Where creativity left no space for remakes, remasters and sequels. A place where video games' pririty was to be fun, entertraining and rememberable.\n\nFor the price of this good port it's a no-brainer for old dreamcast owners and new gamers alike.\n\n\nTLDR: it's a fun game made by fun people, for the entertainement of other people.\n\n*obligatory remark: NOW PORT JSRF!","April 3, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with that aside, it's a great game. By great I mean there are lots to do, plenty of achievements (30 to be exact) and a highly challenging gameplay, which is always a plus.\n\nCouple of negatives to be addressed however. The tricks that are performed while spray painting, which is a very pivotal role in the game can be difficult when using a keyboard. A controller is highly recommended if you want to play optimally. The button sprites on dialogues are based on controller buttons and not the keyboard, but upon launching the game, you can customize the controls using different keys anyways.\n\nTbh, It's not one of those games where I WANT to play it after a long day of work or school since the gameplay becomes somewhat redundant later on. I only pick it up when there's absolutely nothing to do or if you're one of those people that HAVE to play every game in your library, go for it. I recommend at least trying it.","March 1","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I feel that the flaws should be pointed out first.\n\n- The last level of the game gave me motion sickness. For the first time I can remember, and possibly the first time ever. I am NOT prone to motion sickness, AT ALL, and the last level of this game made me want to hurl.\n\n- The port to computer is not the best because they just directly mapped controller buttons to keyboard keys. This means that people playing on a computer have a serious disadvantage at things like graffiti, where the simple action of "move the stick in a circle" becomes "hit WASDWASDWASD as fast as you can until the game decides that you did a circle instead of up-then-right-then-down-then-left separately."\n\n- This game is extremely difficult to play with a laptop touchpad instead of a mouse. (It is playable -- just difficult.)\n\n- The storyline was maybe a little weak? Don't play this for the storyline, play it for everything else.\n\nOk, now on to the positives!\n\n- GREAT music. A+.\n\n- Large levels that you can spend ages exploring. Hidden paths, secret areas, etc.\n\n- It's just fun! Careen down a hill, jump at the last minute, do a flip in midair, ride a wall sideways, and land in a speedy grind on a handrail. And keep going -- like I said, HUGE LEVELS. I'm not normally one for repetition but this game makes me want to just keep practicing and keep practicing the same courses until i can do it perfectly!\n\n- I really liked the style of the game.

They aren't wrong. Jet Set Radio is a game where you skate around on blades & spray paint things to mark your "Turf" & the police get involved yatta yatta. This game is hard early; as spraypainting in a curved shape is REALLY ANNOYING, but AT FIRST. It's like DDR in a sense. The game gets SUPER HARD later, due to the levels where you have to find & spraypain every single spot in 3 areas. That part is not fun :C But it is an amazing game; I highly reccomend it!","February 25","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But beyond former fans of the game I would have a hard time outright recommending this title. The very simple gameplay was unique for it's time but over the course of 15years has become a bit clunky and aged. The quicksand feel of freeskating and your limited abilities can be downright infuriating in the late levels. But I pushed on because I had beat it as a much younger human so gosh darn it I could beat it as an old boring dude!\n\nThe charm is all still there. The music, the early cel-shading, the unique setting, the era vibe, etc. It has all held up great and brought warm memories. Combine that with the low low lowww sale prices this game can be found for (down to the price of FREE). And I can still recommend this. Heavy warning for the younger crowd or people who never played it on SEGA Dreamcast though; That gameplay really hasn't held up and it'll be a departure from what you're used to.\n\nSome final technical notes; I played with a 360 controller so I cannot vouch for the keyboard controls but I feel comfortable urging controller use. Can't imagine trying that with a keyboard... Also, this IS locked at 30 frames per second but like some other older games its performance is tied to the frame rate and cannot be changed. This is actually a time where a port gets a pass in this regard. You won't find (or need) any video settings beyond resolution. And finally the bonus content is appreciated (extra music, mini documentary).\n\nGrind a rail for me.","February 22","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very simple and easy to learn but mastering the movements can be trickey. The characters are on roller blades and feel like it so they are limited by that kinda movement in terms of turning and speed in areas such as stairs sharp turns and so on. Keep this in mind while playing because you will fall...a lot. The game is VERY strict on it's physics(which is kinda funny for a pre-physics era game) The over the top and zanny nature of the game it's self keeps it really fun as well as the cops tactics changing from stage to stage.\n\nPersonally I recommend this game BUT DOWNLOAD THAT FIX.

Even if you hate the story and everything about the characters, grinding down a rail while getting chased by a missle listening to a song about mario bros is just too damn fun.\n\n\n\n9.8-10 in my opinion, I just can´t wait until they port JSRF!","January 29","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SNOWSOS/recommended/205950/","SNOWSOS","SNOW SOS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SNOWSOS/","381 products in account","Let me start by saying Jet Set Radio is the predecessor to one of my favorite games of all time. So I'll admit I'm a bit biased when talking about the series. Jet Set Radio (or Jet Grind radio) is originally a Dreamcast game published by SEGA that came out in 2000. And is basically the game that started cel-shaded graphics. The game takes place in the fictional city Tokyo-to where skater youth gangs tag the streets on their futuristic as ♥♥♥♥ roller blades. The gameplay consists of Skating, Grinding and spray painting, this is all rather enjoyable when you're not battling the controls which is where the game shows it's age a little. I won't lie there's a certain amount of precision required here that most skate games don't share, this can lead to frustration at times but after prolonged exposure and a better understanding of the movement system this becomes less of an issue. This does add a certain level of challenge that can feel very rewarding when you nail a particularly difficult stunt. Besides that I think the game holds up rather well, in my opinion it has all the qualities of most timeless classics. The game is just fun to play, it's cheerful and loud nature just sucks you into the incredible stylistic world. Typically graphics in these older games are a non-factor but this is what I would call a special case, there's something about the aesthetic of this game that is just so infectious. There's nothing better then having one of your favorite songs come on while you grind off telephone wires and bounce in between neon signs on buildings, even picking a character you like to play the most or customizing you gangs graffiti I felt continually invested. And man does this game have style, one of the most important elements in Jet Set radio is the phenomenal soundtrack that is just so fitting and contagious. This coupled with the vibrant in your face cel-shaded art style creates a very memorable experience. So ya I would highly recommend playing Jet Set Radio, you should buy it. Also can someone tell ♥♥♥♥ing SEGA to get off their ♥♥♥ and make a HD JSRF already. Seriously wtf are they waiting for.","January 29","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I feel that the flaws should be pointed out first.\n\n- The last level of the game gave me motion sickness. For the first time I can remember, and possibly the first time ever. I am NOT prone to motion sickness, AT ALL, and the last level of this game made me want to hurl.\n\n- The port to computer is not the best because they just directly mapped controller buttons to keyboard keys. This means that people playing on a computer have a serious disadvantage at things like graffiti, where the simple action of "move the stick in a circle" becomes "hit WASDWASDWASD as fast as you can until the game decides that you did a circle instead of up-then-right-then-down-then-left separately."\n\n- This game is extremely difficult to play with a laptop touchpad instead of a mouse. (It is playable -- just difficult.)\n\n- The storyline was maybe a little weak? Don't play this for the storyline, play it for everything else.\n\nOk, now on to the positives!\n\n- GREAT music. A+.\n\n- Large levels that you can spend ages exploring. Hidden paths, secret areas, etc.\n\n- It's just fun! Careen down a hill, jump at the last minute, do a flip in midair, ride a wall sideways, and land in a speedy grind on a handrail. And keep going -- like I said, HUGE LEVELS. I'm not normally one for repetition but this game makes me want to just keep practicing and keep practicing the same courses until i can do it perfectly!\n\n- I really liked the style of the game. I thought the cel shading was very pretty.","May 29, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well it's awesome. Enough said. The graphics are very old-school and very fitting for a game like this bent on mimicing pop culture to a T. I don't know how it controls on keyboards, but I strongly reccomend playing it with an XBox 360 controller to your PC for a much better experience. The price here was a steal. $4.99 to be exact while conole versions cost about 10 bucks. For some reason, my computer beings a Windows 8 model plays it just fine. However during one cutscene the game crashed. But afterwards it never happened again.\nThe only thing I hate is the clunky controls when it comes to moving left or right on the ground, on ramps, or midair. But the voice acting is neat, the music is epic, the style of graphics is amazing, overall, it's an amazing game with the only flaw is the slightly off controls when it comes to moving a character. Other than that it plays just fine and I can reccomend it to anyone wishing to play another Sega masterpiece.\n\nNow if only Jet Set Radio future could be released on Steam as well.","March 9, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm going to break this in little segmants so first let's start off with the story. Its short but funny and it does have a sort of moral lesson in the end. The music, dear lord is it amazing. There are very few games where I'll fall in love the the entire soundtrack. Each song is memorable and catchy and they fit each area very well. Even the final boss music it's great however I will admit it took some getting used to. I highly recommend you get this soundtrack on Amazon. Finally but most importantly the gameplay. Not gonna lie, the control is not the best in the world but it isn't horrible and will take some getting used to. Each area is big enough for the objective of the game and I appreaciate that each area is broken into smaller quadrents, so moving around them feels really good. There are a few instances where you wish you could go faster (slopes and rails) and the , I'll call it sprint, button just doesn't cut it. Other than that I really enjoy the game.

No patches since 2013. Save files cannot be read, and you will find upon starting the game each time that you are at the beginning of the game. This is caused by a single mistake in capitalization in the code which is easily fixable, but SEGA won't do it.

Encouraging players to express their will for freedom against an oppressive regime through the use of simple acrobatic skating moves on electric/magnetic rollerblades (it's from the early noughties, they're blades, not skates, "dude") and graffiti (a small minigame of matching movements when painting makes the challenge different every time).\n\nSimple single-stick controls with triggers for paint control your character as they stick to any railed surface and grind it, and collect paint. Occasionally, like with all Dreamcast games (and games of that era) the camera can be a little moody, but it's forgivable.\n\nThroughout the game, colourful characters join, support or oppose your gang, leaving you needing to paint their backs, outskate them etc.\n\nSo, the music. Most people will mention this first - as it's a character in its own right. Featurring trip-hop and street beats, funked and drummed up to a hyperactive party level (without being pretentious), I challenge you not to love it.\n\nAs for the game as a whole? I love the remake, and will always want more. Get it. Now. Seriously. I'll pay if I have to :P","September 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In Jet Set Radio, you take on the role of a group of rollerskaters in Japan, who are in this futuristic Tokyo where Jpop music and rollerskating are actually the cool thing. As part of the gameplay, you are tasked with going into neighborhoods and vandalizing them with your own Graffiti. As you start to spray onto windows and walls, the sinister police of the future will show up and try to beat you down, gas you and even shoot you. Thus, the game puts an emphasis on evading the violent cops, whilst fulfilling each level by spraying all graffiti on the walls before time runs out.\n\nWhat makes this game so good? Well, it is very unique. The controls are simple and easy to become accustomed to, yet to master the game takes practice. It is thrilling because you can do stunts such as railgrinding, wallriding, etc while spraying. It is purely a sit down and have fun game, with a nice challenge. Unlike other skater games at its time, this one was less about crazy button mashing combos, and more about fluid movement. The quicker you finish, the higher the score you get. There are graffiti unlocks, and you even get to challenge other skaters to have them join your gang.\n\nAnother part of this game which is nice, is the iconic "JET SET RADIO!" station which plays real pop music from Japan and the US and even England; such as punk bands, Jpop music and so on. The artistic quality is very unique, sporting something along the lines of that early 2000's culture rush of "wacky and wild" sports games. In spite of being a game from the year 2000, 16 years later it still looks pretty good with its cel-shading, simply because cartoon graphics are not at all difficult to render. This game was a very daring release by Sega; and it definitely gave them some kind of competitive edge back in the day. Jet Set Radio Future was released on the Xbox, which gave it popularity as well.\n\nThe violence in the game is as cartoony as the game itself; and you will see funny behavior from the police when they fail to catch you "Damn!" while shaking their guns, etc. The attitude of the game is just so fun and exciting; it isn't dramatic or serious, just fun and enjoyable. One final piece of awesome: You can design your own graffiti! You can spray it freehand and even add letters, skew/reshape the way the appear as well. This makes you have more liberty in expressing yourself, as opposed to being restricted to the preset graffiti.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique gameplay about Skating and graffiti.\n+ Cartoon art style and graphics live well to this day.\n+ Music selection makes me think I am in the late 90's, early 2000's.\n+ Retrospective views on the future from this game are charming.\n+ Challenging but fun, the faster you finish the better score.\n+ Ability to make your own custom graffiti.\n+ Widescreen + modern hardware support.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes, the control responsiveness can be odd. If you use a Steam Controller, you can fix this with some pad tweaks.\n- No free roaming mode; but forgivable.\n- Menu for save/load in the garage isn't really visible.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI played this game long ago, and being invited back into it makes me so happy, especially on my PC with modern hardware support! I wish companies made games like this still, you know; challenging, fun, lacking in drama, lacking in DLC and horrid DRM... It is amazing to pick up an old game and review just how bad newer games can be in comparison.","February 17","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Look past the weird anime style and what you've got is essentially Tony Hawk's gang wars on crack.\n\nQuick note: It's a crappy port.  If you have a 720p monitor, either play in VSR/DSR 1080p or avoid-- the menus don't work at all in 1366x768.  Also, the game is locked to 30 FPS (game speed is tied, so no fixes), and rotating WASD takes a lot of getting used to.\n\nGet your Xbox 360 controller and what you've got is essentially Tony Hawk when you're on shrooms.  Definitely clunky by today's standards, but the graphics hold up (mostly) and the linear set of open levels are at least a lot of fun to travel around.  Thanks to custom sprays, you can spray John Cena on cops' backs, or just use the in-game graffiti editor to spray turds and F**K DA POLICE on every wall.  Yes, just like any Source game, the abuse potential never ends...\n\nSo yes, I do recommend it still.  It still holds up pretty well with an Xbox 360 controller on hand, and once you've learned the gimmicks of the game that the godawful tutorial won't show you, there's a lot of fun to be had here.\n\nOf course, useless memes are all the rage these days, so screw helpful reviews:\n\n==\n>A few teens are spraying grafitti on walls\n>Cops and SWAT come, and start firing...

Awesome totally rad music, non-sensical yet funny and somewhat fulfilling plot, clunky and hard-to-get-use-to control, beautiful aesthetic and a video game experience like no other. Well, a SEGA dreamcast game in short. Plus, Jet Set Radio was one of the first game to have cel-shaded graphic and the visual still look really great by today is stantard.\n\nIf you are looking for an innovative retro piece of art and you don't mind that your first hour in game might be awful, Jet Set Radio is for you. Be prepare though to have at least five new favorites songs.","April 17","true","27.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I first owned this puppy on the Sega Dreamcast. Being the first 128 bit console the game and graphics stunned me back then. First the good news, this PC Steam version is exactly the same as the Dreamcast version. Now for the bad news, games today can do a heck of alot more today than the Dreamcast could ever do. Jet Set Radio just plays better in my younger memories than it does today.\n\nNow graphics... different. The game went with cell-shading which was a first for consoles and this unique style holds up pretty good even today. Nothing that will blow your doors off compaired to today's standards but not much to disappoint either. Now the sound track is a different story all together which is fresh, hop and energenic all at once. Never have I head music get so crazy and off-beat and so enjoyable at the same time.\n\nThe story in the game is hum-ho and your missions seem off the wall but predictable this game wasn't. Unfortunately as I said before, this game played much better in my youth before I got spoiled on all the crazy games of today. I have beaten the Steam version on off-line mode but while I did, it almost felt more like work. The one thing I did love on the Dreamcast version was you could make your own 'tags' or grafetta (definite misspell) which I did from scratch but the tools on the Steam version are worse the the Dreamcast's. It's a minor point but now I can't make my own 'tags' because it takes twice as much work and it was hard to begin with.\n\nCan I recommend this game? It's a mixed bag. I've beaten the Steam version once and don't feel like ever playing it again. On that note... no. But if you have never played it, it's a unique experience and definitely worth a playthrough once, maybe even twice. On that note, yes.","November 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has moments of fun that are marred by clunky charcter control in a game that at many points requires you to be precise and finish levels as fast as possible, and TANKS AND HELICOPTERS SHOOTING MISSLES AT A TEENAGER SPRAYING GRAFFITI. Seriously...the police ruin this game. If there was less of them, or less tanks and helicopters, it wouldn't be so bad. But it's a little ridiculous when you're trying to finish the last grafitti tag and you cant because youre constantly being barraged by missles. That's just stupid. That's not adding to the difficulty of the game, it's just adding unnecessary annoyance. I've heard Jet Set Radio Future makes a lot of good changes to the game, and I sincerely hope someday it's released on Steam as well. The characters, the level design, the music all have a lot of charm to them, but there's a lot of frustrating moments throughout the game from beginning to end.","February 20","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I first owned this puppy on the Sega Dreamcast. Being the first 128 bit console the game and graphics stunned me back then. First the good news, this PC Steam version is exactly the same as the Dreamcast version. Now for the bad news, games today can do a heck of alot more today than the Dreamcast could ever do. Jet Set Radio just plays better in my younger memories than it does today.\n\nNow graphics... different. The game went with cell-shading which was a first for consoles and this unique style holds up pretty good even today. Nothing that will blow your doors off compaired to today's standards but not much to disappoint either. Now the sound track is a different story all together which is fresh, hop and energenic all at once. Never have I head music get so crazy and off-beat and so enjoyable at the same time.\n\nThe story in the game is hum-ho and your missions seem off the wall but predictable this game wasn't. Unfortunately as I said before, this game played much better in my youth before I got spoiled on all the crazy games of today. I have beaten the Steam version on off-line mode but while I did, it almost felt more like work. The one thing I did love on the Dreamcast version was you could make your own 'tags' or grafetta (definite misspell) which I did from scratch but the tools on the Steam version are worse the the Dreamcast's. It's a minor point but now I can't make my own 'tags' because it takes twice as much work and it was hard to begin with.\n\nCan I recommend this game? It's a mixed bag. I've beaten the Steam version once and don't feel like ever playing it again. On that note... no. But if you have never played it, it's a unique experience and definitely worth a playthrough once, maybe even twice. On that note, yes.","November 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do not recommend buying this.\nDon't even waste Steam card money on it. There are games that aren't broken on Steam.\n\nEDIT: I have been informed that there is a fix for it although doing the fix would break the Terms of Service, as it requires editing the EXE file.

The controls are awkward. The camera is awful. For some reason, the button that spray paints is also the button that centers the camera behind you, making for some crazy confusing angles, especially on the chase levels. On later levels, the maps link several places together and it's very easy to get lost or to accidentally exit the stage. Several times I got hit by a car or an enemy and shoved out of the level, which made me have to restart the whole stage. It's just not very fun.

Anytime you hear something that sounds too good to be true, it usually is. When I see that console games from 2 generations ago are suddenly popping up all over steam, was definately a shock. I'd played JSRF years ago for the Xbox and seeing this game available on steam, I jumped at the chance to get it.\nNow, I'm begining to regret it. The whole game slows down in any large area or when there are many objects on the screen. But it's obviously not the computer's fault since the fan doesn't spin up loudly or anything. I've tried setting VSync for this game in the Nvidia control panel but that didn't seem to fix anything either. One fix claims that you install 3rd party software to limit your gpu's frames to 30fps and then the game doesn't slow down anymore.  But why should I have to do that? Something's clearly still broken here and until it's fixed, I cannot recommend this game.","July 26, 2014","false","6.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","5"

The controls are a bit clunky at first, but it's totally playable with a keyboard. Controller is nice if you've got one, but with some practice, it's really not that hard. I recommend starting out playing character with low graffiti levels though, so you can get used to how the graffiti works a bit better, and once you're comfortable, then move up to the higher-level graffiti characters.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nOn a far less serious note, there must be zero crime in Tokyo-to for the police to send attack dogs, parachute squads, choppers, Capatin Insane-o with a gun, TANKS, and tear gas to deal with a bunch of kids... with, well, probably about eight thousand vandalism charges. And then there's the Golden Rhinos. How much money do they have? Choppers, jetpacks, all kinds of guns, flamethrowers, suicide bombers, a giant, flame-spewing golden rhino robot, and on top of all that, they have to pay their agents! It's absurd, man.\n\n**END SPOILERS**\n\nOverall, definitely 10/10 game. I've cleared the main story 20+ times; now I'm working on the achievements. Definitely a well-spent five bucks.","February 20","true","57.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My dad got me this game for the Sega Dreamcast when I was really young, but I never really got into it due to it's difficulty. I found it a while ago because of my friend, and bought it instantly. I don't regret a thing!\n==PROS==\n-Amazing Gameplay\n-Intuitive design (who would have thought of a game where you spraypaint while getting shot by tanks?!?)\n-The difficulty (Also could be a con)\n==CONS==\n-The controls. If you don't have a gamepad, you're gonna have a bad time. Except for me I guess. The controls don't really bother me I guess.\n-Like I stated, the difficulty is INSANE!!! If you miss something, or don't see some small details, you won't be able to beat the levels. Why are tanks attacking a graffiti artist!?! Lol.\n-It's not free :P\nIn conclusion, this game is AMAZING, but if you don't want to play a game harder than Dark Souls, then this isn't the game for you.\nMy Rating: 8.5/10","June 21, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This becomes clear when trying to race in the game and the back drops give no perception of how far or close you are to an object, due to it being one image rather than separate objects. NPC models in this game are laughable when compared to the player model's graphics that it make it seems they did not even try.\n\nOne of the biggest faults in this game is the camera controls. For a game that makes you jump in very high areas, the camera will constantly clip under you. Certain times you make jumps, there will be a provided replay function, while usually this would be fine, the fact the replay happens clearly 2 seconds AFTER you make a jump, makes disorientating time when the camera goes back to the original place. This really becomes a problem when you are tying to escape mobs and the replay messes up the flow of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be very infuriating at times, especially when games earlier than it (such as tony hawk games) nailed down the formula perfectly. This is clear when the grinding in this game is automatic rather than a dedicated button to grind, leading to mishaps in accidentally grinding when trying to jump to specific areas. There’s no way to simply dismount off of a grind either so when I try and get off I am thrusted forward into a jump instead. Jumping from curved areas is also buggy, leading to your character to either jumping straight up and doing nothing or actually performing a trick move. Stairs are also a challenge in the gameplay itself, this doesn’t becomes a problem till the later levels where you have flying enemies shooting you. When you are walking up stairs you are at the mercy of bullets hitting you with no way you to avoid getting hit, since jumping is even too slow to avoid getting it. Whoever thought the how the last level should work was a good idea  should put a bullet to their brain since platforming is this game's not strong point.\n\nHowever, as many people know and what this game is known for the most. The music in this game is stealer and one of my favorite video game soundtracks ever. I can honestly say that the music is what kept me going to finally beating this.\n\nMany people say JSRF is a better game and I am hopeful in trying it out if it improves on this game's problems  but till they release it on PC (I'm not gonna play a gimped ver on 360) Ill reserve my judgment.\n","February 22, 2015","false","8.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","5"

I should have seen it coming though, videos I had watched of the game didn't lie about the floatyness of the game. Something I never ever liked in any game. But hey ! If there is good level design, it'll be all right !\n\nOh.\n\nOooooh...\n\nEverything feels wrong abut this game. Levels are not as open as they should be, often you'll simply find yourself in a dead end with the only way to go being climbing up stairs. Which of course doesn't mesh with the skates. I might as well not have the skates for unless you're in a slope or have been grinding for a while you hardly go faster than the police officers chasing you. And you trade that modicum of speed you have on them with incredible imprecision over your direction. It's really hard to gain some speed, it's really hard to move around. The game is not snappy in the slightest.\n\nBut let's pretend you actually got some momentum. What now ? STOP. Do a graph. Just stop moving. It's time for contextual stick wiggling, harly different from a QTE. It's not very fun, but it is the objective of the game as far as I could tell from these few levels I played. In that regard, it turns the game into more of a platformer as the point is not to build speed but to jump around so that you can reach spots to graph. But again, it's so imprecise I'd rather play a genuine platformer like Sly Cooper.\n\nThere is a point system too based on how you trick, but it basically amounts to how long you grind. Which goes in direct contradiction with the tagging objectives that asks you to stop dead in your track, not that it matters considering it's useless and you'll get good grades without even trying. By that I mean that you won't feel like you deserve it and will end up thinking that good grades are actually bad. Seriously. It's that irrelevant. I don't remember any level in the fews I've played that actually recquired you to get a certain amount of points anyway. Why is it even here ?\n\nLet's add to that unskippable cutscene, unsuprisingly dreadful camera, the police forces that feel like they waste your time more than anything else, escaping them stucks you in a cutscene everytime for no other reason but to break your flow so everything about the opposing force, be it avoiding them or escaping them, is annoying, the narrative might as well not be there...\n\nIt's not fast enough to be cathartic, it's not precise enough to be rewarding. The levels aren't open enough to give any sense of flow unless perhaps you master them but nothing makes me want to. Graphing is just there to stop you in your tracks. The obstacles on your way are more annoying than threatening. Everything feels wrong. Nothing about it is satisfying.\n\nI want to like this game, I really do but it's all around frustrating... I don't recommend.","March 26, 2015","false","3.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

Jet Set Radio hasn't really aged well for me.\n\nI never had a Dreamcast or any of the early consoles, so I didn't grow up on many SEGA games. I was introduced to the concept of Jet Set Radio by the Sonic & SEGA racing franchise, and it intrigued me and all, but after playing the game, I guess it kinda let me down for a game so iconic among fans.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is that it doesn't have much structure to it, which I can dismiss as adding to the "rebellious" feel to the game. With debatable control porting and sometimes slow gameplay, you might be in an enclosed area at times, but you will almost always find yourself scrambling or lost, and since the guidelines for the game are for its original release, there's not much you can do about it.\n\nSpeaking of the gameplay... lord, that story and animation. The characters constantly swaying back and forth, and having no development or personality to back up their actions, they really come out as really unlikable. And then without a say in the matter, some join your team. I was actually yelling at my screen, pleading for the game not to have one member join my team. The only positive I can give the animation is the DJ of Jet Set Radio, which gave me nostalgia towards the Crash Bandicoot games I played. That feeling was kinda destroyed after that animation played over and over in a zoomed in camera, invading my eyes and my personal space.\n\nFinally... the audio. I understand the game has its limitations, but this was a game from 2000. Games ranging from a decade older had more variety than Jet Set Radio. Several sound effects in the game will loop over and over again to the point of aggrivation. What's worse is that, without the music that plays, that's all you hear. Sound loops. Over... and over.. and over...\n\nI can't help but give an unfortunate 'no' to this game. I bet it's fun for people who grew up on the N64 or Dreamcast, but for new players, the game just hasn't aged well. If you wanna play just for the music, then you're better off just listening to it online.","May 9","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I've gone through a pair a year and always had my eye on this game since its debut on the Dreamcast.\n\nI've heard Jet Set Radio Future improves the game, but unfortunately this one deserves a pass. For a skate game, the levels are oddly interruptive of flow. It's difficult in all the wrong ways, with terrible controls and poorly thought out paths that abruptly end. A small bump into level geometry (or one of those random cars) stops you solid and that's a pretty fatal flaw for a game about maintaining the flow of motion. A second earnest try at completing the game still resulted in frustration and tedium.

From the cel-shaded graphics, to the catchy-as-hell soundtrack and to the characters, it's quite possibly the best game i've played so far.\n\nTL;DR:  Really fun game that, in terms of controls could be better, but still works and looks great to date.\n\nStory: In a town called Tokyo-To, which can't be found on any map, there are three districts. There's Shibuya-Cho, where the so-called "punks" called GGs (your gang) lead the district, Benten-Cho, lead by the Noise Tanks and Kogane-Cho, lead by Poison Jam. Your mission is, well... go to each district, spray paint all over their district, humiliate 'em and get away from the police which keeps chasing you.\n\nOverall, the story is there. Not as amazing, but it's good for a game with this style. - B+/S+\n\nGraphics: There's not alot to say. Low-res-ish, cel-shaded graphics with very beautiful lighting and with a really fun comic style to them. - A/S+\n\nMusic/OST: May i just say; the team did a really great job on the soundtrack. With catchy beats or more rock styled songs or some metal (depending on what you like), the game does a spectacular job with soundtrack during the game. Most of the time,\nit can even  really  fit the level you're playing. - S/S+\n\nCharacters: I'm really happy with the characters in this game. From Professor K, the Jet Set Radio "captain" who's hyperactive and really freaking great, to Onishima, the lawful and sorta stereotypical cop trying to catch you. By all means, the characters aren't GREAT. Some of them are flawed and can be a bit annoying, but overall, NPCs and main characters/extra characters are really good. - A/S+\n\nOVERALL: A really fun game with every thing pleasant, from story to characters. Go get it now, especially if it's on sale!\nS+/S++","February 20","true","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The controls for tagging can be tricky to execute with a keyboard though, since instead of simply spinning the joystick around, you have to press each individual directional key (which oftentimes leads to failing the tag). Overall I found the game a bit hard, in part because of the keyboard issue but also general gameplay things like how it sometimes requires very precise timing and aim. I've been told that it can take a lot of time and practice to really get into the swing of things, but until then it can be pretty frustrating.\n\nIn spite of that, I was willing to keep playing this game. The reason I can't fully recommend it is that it seems to be prone to bugs that make it impossible to play - after having played for a few months with no problems (aside from an early glitch that automatically erased my save file), the game suddenly began crashing upon startup. I've tried every fix imaginable, and none have worked so far. There seems to be 0 interest from the developpers in making any sort of patch or update, so I don't expect the situation to get any better - I'll keep trying once in a while, but I've pretty much lost hope of playing this game until I get a new computer someday (and even then, nothing's guaranteed).

It's an absolute BLAST when it works - but a downright infuriating experience when it doesn't.\n\nI've never played the games before, so I have a completely unskewed, unbiased view of it from the get go.\n\nJet Set Radio is a fun game, but it controls so terribly and the physics mess up so bad at times that it's neigh unplayable. Take tagging other skaters for example - you approach them to tag them, only to get smacked out of the way leading to stumble or full knockdown, to which you have to recover from and rechase. This might sound okay, but when you have to be DIRECTLY behind them to tag them, it gets grating fast since if you so much as clip them in the back even the SLIGHTEST bit, you get stumbled and they grind away only for you to have to chase them once again. It's not even difficult! It's just infuriating and unfair.\n\nAll-in-all, Jet Set Radio's 5k graphics update and gameplay live up to the test of time, but its controls and optimization do not. It's simply just a hardware limitation from when the game was developed. If the game handle better I'd instantly, undoubtedly give this game a thumbs up. But as it is now? It's just to infuriating for me to reccomend you put your time into.","February 10","false","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Essentially, you play as a roller skater who skates around Tokyo-to spraying grafitti everywhere. Along the way you encounter rival gangs, people who you can compete with to join your gang, and the police. The latter plays the stereotype of extreme police brutality even just to catch some punks, using everything in their arsenal from helicopters to flamethrowers. The soundtrack has clear inspirations from 90s genres like Nu Metal, hip hop, and synthpop, among many others (my personal favorites are Miller Ball Breakers and Bout the City). The music just turns me on ;)\n\nJSR certainly isn't lacking in originality. It's music is very diverse (as stated earlier), and it goes against the grain from many of the trends in gaming. The story in this game isn't anything to write home about, and the graphics can look really sloppy at times, but SEGA made up for it in the gameplay. The skating mechanics are very polished, and although it's easy to learn it's a very difficult game to master. It's certainly not easy, but it's not rage-inducingly hard becuase the game isn't unfair, and once you get enough practice, you can really get the hang of it. However, the gameplay was designed around using the analog stick. If you want the maximum enjoyment out of this game, definitely use a controller. Trying to input the motions for spraying graffiti is really clunky with the WASD keys, it takes a ton of getting used to, and it gets really uncomfortable after a while. It's certainly not impossible though, and you can still have fun playing it regardless (I know I did).\n\nThe amount of time it takes to finish the story line is somewhat on the short side (I play through games slowly and beat it in 10 hours). However, if you want to 100% this game and/or you want to challenge yourself to get Jet ranking on every level, I wouldn't be suprised if it was more like 100 hours because, again, it's a hard game to master. If you want replayability out of a game, I'm not very qualified to tell you, since I hardly like replaying antything.\n\nIn short, if you hate 90s culture, you'll most likely hate everything about this game. If you tend to prefer story-based games, JSR might be very forgettable. But if your preference is for gameplay, then JSR can be a really fun experience that I think you should try out.","May 4","true","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Jumping and doing a trick shouldn't be the same button, as doing a trick sends you significantly higher in the air than a regular jump does.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/205950/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","When Jet Set Radio debuted on the Dreamcast in North America as Jet Grind Radio back in 2000, it offered a unique experience that no other console game of that era could match. Players stepped into the skates of energetic graffiti artists residing in the fictional city of Tokyo-to. The goal was to tag as much of the landscape as possible with colorful graffiti designs, a task made difficult by the presence of rival gangs that were attempting to do the exact same thing--and by a police force that believed the best punishment for such vandalism was death by guided missile. The only way to stay ahead of the threats was to keep cruising and grinding, leaping from one point to another and pausing only just long enough to spray an intricate tag before resuming the crazy rush.\n\nGraffiti may be artwork, but don’t forget: it’s also a crime!\n\nJet Set Radio relies heavily on its presentation and it doesn’t always stress the details. Stages end abruptly once you tag all available points (marked by red arrows), not when you achieve a certain score or defeat a challenging boss. The energetic beats looping in the background and the vibrant cel-shaded visuals have always been the primary reasons to keep playing, and those elements are especially effective now that all of the familiar artwork has been upgraded for high-definition televisions. Most of the original music also returns. Players discovering the game in 2012 may wonder what they’re missing, though, because there’s not a lot to savor beyond the funky presentation.\n\nJet Set Radio's most regrettable issue is its simple but somehow ineffective control setup. As your skater cruises through the various areas, even the simple act of skating in a straight line can sometimes prove difficult if you're not grinding a railing, because you have to hold the analog stick forward to build speed. The tiniest nudge of the analog stick can wreak havoc, since your skating graffiti artist is prone to wide sweeping movements rather than more precise motions. Yet if you need to change direction slightly while flying through the air (usually because your skater launched unexpectedly toward one side or the other rather than pushing forward in the anticipated straight line), fiddling with the analog stick often has almost no effect at all.\n\nThe rails you must frequently grind also lack stickiness, which makes landing on them at the end of a leap a tricky proposition. You may overshoot your intended destination, and that often means you must backtrack through hazardous territory so that you can make another attempt. Building up speed so that you can manage the long jumps required to clear gaps is also an issue, since by default your skater moves at a snail's pace. You're forced to pay entirely too much attention to the controls the whole time you play, lest a split second of inattentiveness lead to disaster.\n\nGetting around Tokyo-to can be a bit of a grind.\n\nThe inadequate camera does nothing to alleviate such control issues, either. Many of the environments are practically barren until enemies begin appearing in response to your vandalism, but you still stumble across a few unwelcome piles of debris in the most inconvenient of places, or perhaps a series of vehicles parked along a street between you and a wall that you need to tag. The camera gets stuck on objects in confined spaces, jerks crazily if you're following a path through a winding corridor, or spins in such a way that you can't see environmental obstacles that in any other game would be easily spotted. The only way to make crucial runs in some stages is to first memorize their layouts through trial and error.\n\nIn some instances, you also must tag objects with precise timing, but since the left trigger serves two functions, it's easy to accidentally start messing with the camera instead of tagging the environment as you may have intended. Such goofs delay your ability to paint for a brief moment, which is time enough that you sometimes miss spraying a target that you should easily have been able to tag on the fly.\n\nInstead of finding ways to alleviate the camera and control issues, the game's original developers at Smilebit used those flaws as a means of providing additional challenge. In one stage, for instance, your chosen skater must race along an arcing passageway, then leap onto a narrow and winding ledge, ride it along an S path, and finally leap over a balcony to land on a narrow bit of piping that when viewed from a distance blends in with the background. This scenario would be fun but not especially challenging in a game with responsive controls and a friendly camera, but in Jet Set Radio it is a chore. Building up speed requires a rush down a corridor with horrible visibility, and the leap from one construction beam to another requires that you guess properly about the precise positioning of a rail that often is off-camera.\n\nThe game has no shortage of great tunes, and the kooky DJ is still fun.\n\nIn a few other stages, your skater's goal is to tag members of a rival gang with paint. The environments where you must do so are built to slow you down at every turn. In the first such mission, the cowardly goons skate along a sewer pathway that includes stairs, pools of murky water, and an enclosed passage that is littered with piles of immovable barrels and equipped with a trapdoor in the floor. Your job is to direct your skater as he or she races after those foes--who all move with an easy grace that most human players will never reproduce with their skaters--and spray them from behind several times. Until you memorize the stage layout in its entirety (along with the route your rivals follow), you don't stand a chance.\n\nNot every stage is frustrating in the same way, and there are moments when you find yourself having some fun, but each new environment presents an exasperating wrinkle of some sort. The most common stage objective simply asks your skater to roam around and tag key areas while avoiding an ever-increasing police presence. Such levels begin with almost no resistance at all, which gives you time to gather paint cans (since your graffiti-loving skater always starts with none on hand). After you tag a few locations, though, you have to avoid tear gas, dogs, SWAT teams, a trigger-happy captain, helicopters that fire missiles, and other similar hazards. That had the potential to be exciting, but the finicky controls and ineffective camera make it difficult to track the location of your enemies until they're pelting you with bullets, grenades, or missiles.\n\nAs if the control and camera issues weren't bad enough, sometimes you may also find yourself accidentally exiting stages. The city environments you explore have invisible boundaries, and you receive a warning if you're about to pass one. However, no barrier prevents you from actually doing so. You are simply taken to the level selection menu. So if you're most of the way through a stage, an onscreen arrow indicator might be pointing you toward a point that you need to tag, and it may direct you along a path that leads you near an exit. Then you could get hit by a car or an explosive blast and knocked out of bounds before you have a chance to recover.\n\nJet Set Radio doesn't feel as much like a game as it does a test of endurance. Entertainment options have come a long way since 2000, and consumers now take smooth controls and a capable camera system for granted. Most gamers will find little joy in the outdated design elements that so thoroughly color this particular experience, even if they are in the mood for something retro. While the game was once an interesting way to pass the time, its value has expired, and a shinier coat of paint doesn't change that.\n\nThe Good\nPrettier than ever\nFunky soundtrack\n\nThe Bad\nTouchy controls\nInept camera\nFrustrating stage design\n\n4.5\nPoor\n","May 16","false","0.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I was already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at wasting my money on Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed from the cheap a** players online so I thought $5 couldn't hurt for a classic hd remake game like this yet Sega still manages to screw it up like always. It starts off great. Everything is fine through the tutorial but it's until you realize the loophole Sega created once you reach the cutscenes and missions is where everything get infuriatingly annoying.\n\n\nAfter doing the tuturial I quit the game once and come back to see it makes me do it again. I didn't realize this until I had to keep doing the same tutorial from Gum and Corn the 3rd time that's when I thought of doing the missions so hopefully I can finally save the game. I thought the game had an auto-save feature but it was never mentioned so I go to the menu that states "save and options" yet I see no save option anywhere. Just achievements, leaderboards, bonus, and options, yet no save? Not even Steam could at least save my progress.\n\nI did though see a button to return back to the title screen so I decided for one last time to retry the entire tutorial and finish the stressful 2nd mission and once I finally did, I returned to the title screen to exit from the game. Didn't even close it down from the windows taskbar and what does it do when I come back on the game...? Takes me back to the tutorial once more as if I just started on the game! This is the 2nd game I buy and can't even at least half enjoy because of this bug. Even if there is an custom fix, it shouldn't have to come to this especially from an hd remake of an old game.\n\nSeriously Sega, get your act together and for once fix this obvious save issue. If not then at least release Jet Set Radio Future as compensation since I obviously can't refund this game or take off from my library.\n\nGo ahead and talk trash or thumbs down I don't care. I have the right to my review after wasting my money so I might as well speak the truth of it. Anything you Sonic fans say is not going to convince me otherwise so don't bother trying.","November 2, 2014","false","21.8"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","0"

The vibrant visuals, diverse soundtrack and anarchic spirit struck a chord with critics and fans back in the day. Unfortunately, while the the art direction and audio still hold up remarkably well, the gameplay doesn't. Most missions consist of you spraying graffiti over a designated number of hotspots in an area within a certain amount of time. So far so okay, but once you've sprayed a certain amount of graffiti, the police come and make completing the mission an exercise in tedium and frustration. Other missions task you with copying a rival skater's moves, racing them, or spraying them with enough graffiti. The controls and camera just aren't tight enough for the demanding challenges that the game throws at you. You'd think that with such a lack of precision that the game would be a tad forgiving towards minor mistakes. That's not the case. One jump a little too far, one minor bump against a wall, or one little brush against your opponent can cause you to fail. There's no option to restart a mission if things aren't going well; you have to either wait for your opponent to beat you, or go back to the garage and go though the entire mission briefing all over again. Completing these tasks feels laboring when it should feel fun, clunky when it should feel tight, and frustrating when it should feel liberating. If you loved the original, these objections won't matter to you. If you haven't played this game, I'd recommend you check out either the superior Jet Set Radio Future or Tony Hawk Pro Skater.","June 1, 2014","false","5.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The game is hard because the controls are stupid and not responsive enough.\nYou'll find yourself looking up videos of gameplay because you can't beat levels and you don't know why.\nAlso there's no open world at all, just set levels with predetermined goals. It would have been fun to just cruise around doing tricks and exploring. Run over time or out of health and you have to start again.\nNote that the top positive reviews are old fans of the game, and they are actually asking for the sequel to this game to get ported.\nLooks great, sounds great, controls are crap (even if you have a controller, which I do).\nVery frustrating and annoying.

Here's hoping JSRF also gets ported one day, it's the superior game in every way.\n\nEdit: It's discouraging to see all of these reviews with legitimate concerns being thumbed down only for reviews with a few basic words of approval achieving such a high rating.

What could go wrong?\nLong-winded "jokes" aside, Jet Set Radio is probably one of the most fun games I've ever played, and I'm honestly pretty obsessed for only just finishing! With funky tunes, eye-catching characters that make one hell of an impression, beautiful graffiti designs, and gameplay that is simple to pick up but hard to master, Jet Set Radio certainly deserves a go if you are looking for something fresh and different from today's market. Even if you aren't interested in the game, give the soundtrack a listen!\n\nYou might want to get the bugfix, though, since it will not load your saves otherwise due to a small overlook on the dev-team's part. Check the community page for more information.\n\nOh, and try the sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, too.

A fix can be downloaded from the forum.\n\nAlso, you really need a controller for this one.\n\nOkay, you know this is one of the most stylish action games out there, with a legendary soundtrack and a great theme brought home by some of the earliest and best use of cel shaded graphics. However, this game is often criticized for having annoying enemies and being frustrating and awkward to control, and in larger city sections the zones are connected with clever but rather silly design workarounds that take some experimentation to navigate.  Ultimately though, the cops are dangerous, the controls are like learning to roller blade, and traversing the levels feels like exploring a living, breathing world.\n\nNext time you feel like writing a diatribe about design conveyance, in-game tutorials, or how you're "giving up on gaming", you should probably just step back, stop trying so hard, and play some Jet Set Radio.

It has an amazing soundtrack and an interesting visual style. Don't go into this game looking for more than a very average skating game, though. It has a story that makes absolutely no sense, the control takes some getting used to, and many enemy attacks cannot be avoided. It lacks replayability aswell, unless you enjoy tedious tasks in a very small amount of areas. It is just a port of a Dreamcast game, too. The textures aren't updated at all, the draw distance is terrible (rather, the game only loads a small chunk of an entire level at a time, causing pop in for other chunks), and the camera is still garbage. It adds nothing new but a couple of new graffiti souls to spray and a movie you could just watch on youtube. For all of these complaints, it's still surprisingly fun and engaging. Get it if it's on sale, it's an okay game but nothing amazing.","December 23, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music magnificent, gameplay is fun and satasfying, (but after playing the game a second time, I ran into some frame rate issues, but that might be just be a problem on my part), The game looks nice in HD, and some songs from Jet Set Radio Future (By the way, please port JSRF to today's hardware SEGA!) are included as a nice bonus.\n\nThe one thing I wish that was in the game was a way to import pictures (Not using graffiti manager) as graffiti. Also, the currunt version of the game has a game breaking bug in the EXE that makes it so when you load your save file, it starts you back from the very begining of the game (no matter where you are in the game). But, people have fixed it themselfs (SEGA has yet to realease a patch or anything). Also, YOU MUST PLAY THIS WITH A CONTROLER. The game is almost unplayable without it.\n\nIf you don't want to deal fixing this bug yourself, or deal with getting your controller to work on PC, and don't mind spending a little more for the game, Go and get one of the other ports of the game (It's on PS3, PSVita, and Xbox 360).  Other than that, this port is OK (once you fix the bug, and get the controler working on the PC, It's an awesome)\n\nAs a port, in it's current state, it gets a 6.5 spraycans out of 10 for the game breaking bug and playing with the keybord and mouse is hell.\n\nAs a game though, I give the game 9.4 spraycans out of 10, would spray up tokyo-to again, and again.
