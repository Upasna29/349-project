Game is a lot shorter than I remember, but that might be because the last time I played it I was 7 years old. Still fun though, puzzles are neat. A lot of detail went in to the artwork and there's a billion little "easer egg" things to click on and watch some short animations. I didn't even know there were different ways to play through the game, the endings are the same but the story is randomized, which is cool for a 14 year old game.\n\nThere might be some replayability but like I said the game is short, like an hour or so per play.","June 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

This was the only Pajama Sam game that I never got a chance to play growing up. I could have done the demo with my eyes shut, but I never got to play the actual game. That said, when I saw that this was on Steam, I was ecstatic.\nI will say, I don't think that this is quite as good as the original Pajama Sam, but that could be the fault of my rose-colored nostalgia glasses. Even so, this is still a worthy addition to the Pajama Sam series, and a fun point-and-click puzzle game for the kids.","November 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConanHuynh/recommended/292800/","ConanHuynh","ConanHuynh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConanHuynh/","115 products in account","Our protagonist, Pajama Sam, is about to finish the last cookie box for his favorite action figure. As he reaches for the last box, a familiar voice calls out. "Sam, it's time for dinner!" Not feeling quite hungry for a meal, Sam notices something strange. The cookies come to life! As they flee, Sam searches for a logical place - the pantry. The door shuts, trapping Pajama Sam into a world full of scrumptious sweets, delectable delights, and tasty treats.\n\nYou play as Sam, a little boy looking to stop the general from declaring war. How does Sam do this? He needs to find members of each food group so they can hold a conference together. The only problem is...they've gone missing! Pajama Sam will need to consume candy canes to escape prison, drive on a donut, resolve balance between beans, and much more. The cool thing about this game (and the other Humongous Entertainment games) is that your second gameplay might be different than the first. The different food groups might be in different places next time, so replay value is actually fun.\n\nI loved the creativity put forth in this game. Foods  of all sorts come to life with memorable personalities.\n-Strong, beefy muffins draw cupcakes on the coast.\n-Candy canes substitute jail bars.\n-The names. Plums nicknamed "plummers." A granny smith apple named Granny Smythe. The sweet troops marching around.\n\nFans who have not played this game yet will love the cameo appearances. The carrot from the first Pajama Sam game makes a return. There's also Sprinkles the Donut who helps Sam travel. (It reminds me from Otto from PS1).\n\nNot only is this a fun game, the name is definitely true. Sam makes a valid point at the end of the adventure. You are what you eat from your head to your feet.","July 4, 2014","true","1.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It gave me a chance to finally have a closure to one of my favourite childhood game.\n\nThroughout the game, it gave me a very nostalgic feeling as we've been constantly playing games of high graphical quality, contrasting a lot with the graphics of games used in the 2000, making me enjoy every moment of it.\n\nEven though this game is recommended to kids of ages 3-8, it doesn't seem that way as I'm sure that there are many adults here that would like to ride the nostalgia train and enjoy the game like how we used to when we were kids. Playing it as an adult sometimes surprises me at times as I remembered completing a particular stage of the game as a kid, but was stuck at it for a while when replaying it as an adult. I'm proud that I've not succumbed to the temptation of reading guides when I'm stucked since guides of any games are so readily available everywhere on the internet now. I mean, there ain't many guides when I was a kid and I almost completed the game. Even if there is, I doubt I know how to surf the internet at that age.\n\nTo those that have played the game before as a kid, but have never completed it before, or simply just want to play the game for nostalgic purposes, it is worth every penny to buy the game.","April 21","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is also probably one of the more difficult games because a lot of the puzzles don't really make sense and a lot of offhand comments can send you off on a "wild goose chase" of sorts which can take a really long time to find out you've been fooled. The story is fun and the game in general is very Pajama Sam and it's very cute. Pajama Sam fans will enjoy this game, but be prepared to be frustrated (young children will need help).\n\nThe game took 2 hours to complete (longest of the Pajama Sams thus far) by two teenagers who like to think they're reasonably intelligent.

Right when he opens the final box, all of the cookies come jumping out and storm into the kitchen. Sam knows they were up to no good and decides to trial them as "Pajama Sam". Upon entering the kitchen Sam soon enters yet another world of his imagination inside the kitchen storage room which is a gateway to a food world. All six food groups of the world aren't in peace with each other and the only ones who can stablize peace are the food delicates of each food group. It's up to Sam to prevent a war from breaking out. Unlike in the previous two games, Sam isn't over coming any fears in this game, instead it's about preventing war and learning about the food groups as he progresses his mission. The story is just as inventive as the previous installments and the characters and jokes once again are clever and well thought out. If you love the last two Pajama Sam games, then you can't go wrong with this one.","April 14, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm glad Humongous got back on track for Pajama Sam.\n\nI don't think companies should stick to a solid formula if they create a franchise. Nintendo has managed to evolve the Mario franchise over the years, but with very few distinct changes. That's honestly one of the biggest problems with series. How far do you go to make a sequel distinct and different, while also keeping the same general formula of your previous installment(s)?\n\nI think Pajama Sam 3 did alright. I liked what it did. It was different, but it was still distinctly a Pajama Sam.\n\nThe story is similar to the other installments, where Sam has a problem and some supernatural imaginative event carries Sam to a separate world where he learns the error of his ways. Although, this is the first time in the series where Sam doesn't deal with a fear: it's more or less a personal flaw of overeating.\n\nThe world, much like the Land of Darkness from the first game, is incredibly imaginative. It's a massive rendition of Sam's body, as he goes around and "restores balance" to the food groups. There's no B.S, random conflict that comes out of nowhere. No random World Wide Weather business complex. It's simple imagination- like the first Pajama Sam.\n\nBut, despite what good things there are, there are still plenty of bad things. The mini-games are absolutely awful. I hate the bean-sorting game and the ski slopes. And some puzzles were a little vague, especially if the game was made for kids. Like specifically finding the sand castle for the bag to fill for the Cheese Delegate guy. And, the voice actress for Florette the Broccoli sounds like she's just reading a paper in front of her face.\n\nHowever, the game follows the original Pajama Sam formula, without using the first game as a crutch, like Pajama Sam 2 did. It tells a new story with new characters, while keeping the charm, subtle humor, small symbolism, and story of personal growth that the original game created. And I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. I'm giving this one a 7/10.","May 8","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it holds up quite well and gets a lot of laughs out of me.\n\nThe humor is very endearing, though you'd be hard-pressed to call this "edutainment" as there's nothing really to learn about foods other than the general message of "don't just eat one type of food." That said, I had fun with the game, but I think some of it is because it reminds me of the first two games, so it's still indirectly influenced by nostalgia.
