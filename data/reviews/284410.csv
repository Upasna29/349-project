"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/284410/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes, but that won't affect my opinion of the game in the end\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZC29VEd_Z4\n\nTarget Audience:    Those who like getting lost....and have a high frustration tolerance.\n\nSummary:\nThe kickstarter described a game that was Wind Waker Meets Dark Souls. And here's where you realize that having a small indie game compared to 2 big franchises is a bad idea, because the game is neither of those games, and has a bunch of problems out of the gate that it never recovers from. The writing is very hit and miss, and the misses whiff hard, as breaks in the story progression and the dead nature of the world is always dragging the good aspects of it down. The exploration can be fun at times, but there's not a lot TO explore, and the game doesn't really like you going off the beaten path. The “puzzles” and trap avoiding in dungeons can be fun at times, but they are so few and far between. And the combat has MAJOR issues, in particular with it just being.....boring. Oh, and don't get me started on the bugs. Look, the game needed more time in the oven, that much is clear. But for no, I can't recommend Song of Tyrim.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe Viking backstory is interesting at its core, and I wanted to see more of the villages and its back story.\nPuzzle solving elements are simple, but can do the job in terms of progression, and feeling like you're an “adventurer”.\nTyrim's smartass nature is fun for a bit.\nControls reasonable work for both the controller and keyboard/mouse. Either one will work.\nStealth mechanics actually work at the basic level. It's not the focus, but I was impressed at how well it was implemented.\nI like the weapon degradation, only because it causes massive chaos. And I like the chaos in this game. It really needed it.\nNegatives:\nThe combat is not Dark Souls. It's repetitive, it's predictable, and it's boring. No seriously, Combat is boring. Have I mentioned how bad the combat is?\nThe combat is bad. Yes, I'm repeating this. I just want to make it perfectly clear.\nIt's buggy as hell. Just watch the video, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Broken Progress, weird physics bugs.\nWhy make utility items degrade. The crafting system can really be annoying at times, especially when you can't easily find a resource.\nYou'll get lost. And you'll get frustrated at times. The map doesn't do a good job of providing any real useful information.\nSome performance/load issues.\nCollision detection feels a hair off at times, as you'll notice it in particular with platforming. You'll need to hit platforms with “all” of your body, if that makes sense.\nSome things just don't make sense in terms of the natural “detective” gameplay of figure out what you need to do next. The game isn't going to help you at all with hints either, at least most of the time.\nSide stories don't get a good conclusion to them, and that sucks, because several of them were interesting. You're left wondering why. And that's when it doesn't break it's own continuity. In fact, it's almost like those side stories don't matter, other then giving you what you need.\nThe world feels so lifeless. There's not a lot there, and those who are there won't react naturally at times.","April 26","false","12.2"," 57 of 91 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","57","91","4","4"

I pre-ordered it through Humble Bundle weeks before it actually came out, so it's fair to say that I was really anticipating this game. It's similar to games like The Last Tinker: City of Colors, and I enjoyed that one on PC before adding the steam version to my collection.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, and the detail in the characters, including facial expressions, is really a showcase of the developer's talent. Parents can also be assured that the content is suitable for a younger audience. If you or your child enjoyed Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas, The Last Tinker: City of Colors, or any of the 3-D Mario or Sonic games, this is definitely one to pick up.\n\nThere are multiple areas to explore, well-developed characters and a storyline that includes questing and interacting with members of the viking community. So far, it's evident that the developer put a lot of time and effort into giving these characters unique characteristics and personalities.\n\nThere is also a crafting component and a variety of items and weapons that can be crafted. I can see myself spending many hours with this game and definitely intend to do so.\n\nFull controller support, responsive controls, and attainable achievements are always a plus for me, and this game has them all.\n\nThere's only one thing I want to point out that detracted from my experience, and that's motion sickness that I've experienced with some 3-D games that have a reduced FOV. I had to take a break once I realized that this was going to be one of those games for me, and the fix, for me, is a cooler, brighter room, sitting further away from the screen, and increasing FOV while reducing screensize. My rig is an ASUS gaming laptop with GTX 970 and G-Sync, so FPS, resolution, and stuttering are not factors for me, though they may be for others who experience motion sickness while gaming.\n\nOverall, I'm intrigued with the game, and I feel that it's worth the price I paid for it. I intend to finish the game and explore to my heart's content. Definitely recommended for younger and experienced gamers looking for a new adventure RPG.\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","April 27","true","9.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","4"

As advertised, it has a similar artstyle to Zelda The Wind Waker, which I find quite charming. I don't really think there is much resemblance to Darksouls to be found here frankly: There is a checkpoint-system, which one might argue is similar to the Darksouls-bonfires, and you drop your weapons when you die but that is really about it.\n\nGenerally, I don't enjoy the combat very much. It is very basic and feels a little clunky, but it's working and so far isn't too big of a focus of the game. What the game does really well is the exploration. Especially on the first island I had a lot of fun running across the island, searching for things to do, hidden upgrades for the inventory-capacity or new blueprints.\n\nMost interesting I found the crafting-system though: Whereas in most games, the crafting is more a thing you do every now and then outside of combat and inbetween quests, here it is very much the main mechanic. You could start crafting a cannon-turret mid fight if you wanted!\n\nThe writing is fine and has a few humourous lines here and there (Sometimes intentionally breaking the fourth wall in a humourous way, but in my opinion the writer didn't overuse it at this point and I did chuckle a few times). I noticed a few spelling-mistakes though, but nothing unfixable. I've seen much worse.\n\nI can't say much about the length of the game yet, since I have yet to complete it. But I'm assuming, in the very least it will be 10 to 15 hours.\n\nI do recommend it if you like the art-direction. It's not a combat-heavy game though and when it comes to puzzles, I haven't found anything very challenging so far. But it has a very nice, bright atmosphere, an interesting world and a story of which I'm curious how it'll continue. I would call it an explorationgame, and a good one too. But you shouldn't expect Darksouls and not even Wind Waker in a sense. It looks like Wind Waker, but it doesn't really play like it. I don't think that's a bad thing though. It's not a Wind-Waker-copy, it's something new, even though the art and the music (The music is very well made actually. It does a great job at enhancing the atmosphere further. Quite like it!) are reminiscent of it. :)","April 28","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crowbeak/recommended/284410/","crowbeak","Crowbeak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crowbeak/","645 products in account","I have 1.8 hours on the game as I write this. It's not quite what I expected when I backed the Wind-Waker-meets-Dark-Souls Kickstarter campaign, but it's close and I'm loving it anyway. I was surprised by the initial emphasis on crafting and it can get a bit tedious to have to re-craft items as they break. I got used to it quickly, though, and don't really mind.\n\nI'm loving the game in spite of its rough edges. It's a bit buggy; sometimes plants float and the player gets stuck inside of things. But so far, I've been able to get around any such bugs.\n\nThe crafting and physics engine combined often give the player multiple ways to overcome challenges and traverse the world. This is part of what makes the game so fun. However, this means that it's possible to find story/quest triggers out of order, and the game doesn't account for that possibility. When sent to find a pair of people early on, I accidentally took the long way around, spawning boxes to climb up one side of a bluff and down the other, saving the girl in distress and then carrying her (literally) to the other person, who proceeded to inform me that the person I'd just rescued was in trouble.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough into the story to know if that will negatively affect my enjoyment later. For now, the exploratory gameplay is fun enough that finding things out of order like that makes me giggle quietly to myself. It helps that the dialogue tends to be amusing in general, with jokes scattered throughout.\n\nI haven't played Dark Souls, only watched a let's play, but while I can see similarities to the Dark Souls combat system, I'm thinking that Cornerstone's combat won't live up to Dark Souls' punishing difficulty. Granted, I'm just about to get off of the starting island, so it could ramp up in difficulty from here.\n\nAs for comparing it to Wind Waker... I think that's an apt comparison in terms of the overall feel of the game. It's been a long time since bright, colorful, and lighthearted was common in games. Cornerstone captures that very well without feeling like a Zelda copy.\n\nEdit: Major downside is that keys are not rebindable. :(","April 29","true","9.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's a little rough around the edges with poor combat but the physics based puzzles, exporation and crafting make up for the games faults. It has a beautiful art design with some humourous dialogue.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oWc3SCT65gM","April 26","true","2.3"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

You are playing a young viking who will need to travel to various islands on his journey to rescue the missing viking men. While the game is not perfect and suffers from some minor problems, it is indeed very enjoyable and you will get enough game for your money.\n\nAverage game length will be around 10 to 12 hours, if you are willing to find all secrets you should plan 15 to 20 hours.\n\n+Good value\n+zelda-feeling\n+decent graphic\n+good presentation\n+definitely a great game for the younger audience with easy to learn controls, fights and not too complex puzzles\n+the world and atmosphere is lovely\n+you can surf on sand :D\n+free demo if you are still unsure whether this game is for you\n\n+-crafting may annoy some of you, I would have wished for longer lasting equipment\n\n-some minor bugs\n-sometimes the jumping feels odd\n-easy fights\n-more boss fights would have been good","April 26","true","8.6"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"
