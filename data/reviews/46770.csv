(Parentheses are examples)\n\nPositives\n\n+ Change History! (Romania kings of the world!!\n+ Easily understandable, especially to new players in the strategy games like these.\n+ Fun to crush every country around you with your massive military might (YARGG)\n+ Follows ideologies to connect to follow the historical path (AI UK actually allies with AI US and AI France)\n+ High mod support (Canadian colony in Somalia in an 1861 scenario!)\n+ Many different types of units to be built.\n+ All those factories are making me rich!! (Bucharest is more industrialized then New York, London, and Berlin Combined!)\n+ You can form rediculous alliances (The Swedish alliance containing Sweden, Liberia, Argentina, and Bulgaria)\n\nNegatives\n\n- No casus belli\n- Declaring war too many times causes other nations to join in against you (I'm looking at you United Kingdom)\n- The AI just builds up military and doesn't really care about economy (Switzerland at $-200,000,000,000 at end game)\n- Rebels too easy to crush (Why wont you let me become fascist Norway?)\n- Countries only surrender to you if you crush them super fast with a massive force (I just want Ukraine not all of the USSR)\n- If you ally with a nation ('Cough' 'Cough' AI 'Cough') When they declare war you're dragged into it as well, if you want to be in in or not\n- AI sometimes extremly random (AI Finland at war with every single country but Hungary, AI Germany allies with AI Albania and kills AI Italy)\n\nOverall though, fun to play and good to think about what would really happen if Luxembourg conquered South America\n\n9.7/10","June 3, 2015","true","86.9"," 65 of 67 people (97%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","97","65","67","26","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984782430/recommended/46770/","76561197984782430","Gesia","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984782430/","49 products in account","Going to be a long text, so TLDR; get the first installment of the series, The Calm and the Storm. Its definatly more worth its pricetag.\nIf you already own the first installment, keep playing that, as you will not gain much for the 20 Bucks here.\n\nThe game, while theoreticaly quite fun, has some problems which just ruin the experience, the biggest one being that it just runs poorly. While I do have a decent machine, nothing fancy, but also not bad in any way (AMD 6300FX, 8gb, R9-290). Turntimes start off very fast, but do get longer over the course of the game. Not too long, but still somewhat annoying, considering that you will spend the majority of gameplay clicking away idle turns (If you're playing historically about 230 turns, just until the beginning of the war).\nMy main issue is however, that everything feels "slow" and "lagging" as in. Scrolling the map makes the scrolling "stutter", so the map doesnt move smoothe but keeps jumping. This also is technically not a problem, as you can easily get anywhere on the map, but it just doesnt feel right and stressful. Giving commands to units, opening Menues and virtually clicking anywhere has a delay of ~0.5-1 second (didnt measure it, but its just... you feel it, you know?). That doesnt seem like much but it is annoying as hell and makes the playing experience simply feel "unsmooth" and, to some extend, especially when giving a large amount of orders, stressful. This is enhanced by the games second problem.\n\nThe second problem im having with this game is its interface. Everything feels like it needs at least one click too much. For example: Merging 2 units requires you to have both units in the same province (of course...). Then you select one and right click on the other one. Then a dropdown menu appears and you can select "merge units" at which point you need to select the unit you JUST rightclicked on from the appearing "list", which (in the 6 hours i played so far) has never shown more that the exact unit I rightclicked on anyway, even if there are multiple units in the province. Or for example research, where there is no "each laboratory that can, research the same thing" button. You need to select a research option for each single laboratory when you just want all of them to research the same thing. Why 30 clicks instead of 1?\n\nThe game has no tutorial and close to no tooltips but only an encyclopedia. This is in most cases only a minor inconvinience since, in opposition to lets say the hearts of iron series, most things are grasped somewhat easily and without explanation. However, in production and research, this lack of help is very annoying. When selecting production over the City-Screen you get a LITTLE bit more info, but usually you will be chosing production from the production menu (where you see all cities) and here you get virtually no help to tell you for example the difference between a cottage factory, a mechanised factory, a large factory aso.\nResearch is even worse. In the research tree, options are only shown linked to the last thing they need, however, they may have other requirements from earlier in the research tree. This is only shown as a symbol which will give you the name of the required prerequisit research, which you may then search in the researchtree yourself, followed by searching that researches mandatory prerequisits. If you want to know what any of these researches does (What it gives is also just shown as a Noun, like "Highway", you may go to the enzyclopedia and search for Highway to figure out if this is useful in any way to you. This is of course not linked but requires you to actually look through the encyclopeida.) This is a joke, and, once again, Civilization did it better 1/4 Century ago.\n\nThe building menu is not sorted. When clicking on production you will get a dropdown menu with ~20-40 production possibilies to scroll through (the dropdown isnt that large, so for some things which you will be chosing a lot, like Tanks, you will need to scroll down), changing your production around for a larger country, for example when switching to tank or airplane production, is just a chore.\n\nThe game has barely any feedback to "problems" in your country. For example when your researchers have no goal set you are simply loosing turns in research for no reason, but the game doesnt tell you, instead you need to either memorize every time when you current research is going to be done, or you need to check every couple of turns. There is no reason why the game would let you end your turn with no research selected, like EVERY OTHER GAME ON THE MARKET, starting from 24 Years old Civilization!\n\nThe Idea of making the game more sandboxish, allowing countries to ally and fight whoever they want (with some path laying out, but not mandatory) is very good. The execution is rather poorly, with the world AI reminding me of the Total War Series in regards to its "intelligence". While only playing 6 hours I have witnessed twice countries declaring war, just to be annihilated themselves minutes later, since they were not even close to being a match to the enemy. Making Alliances and Trade agreements is just a gamble with no rhyme or reason whatsoever as to who will ally/trade with you. (There is somewhat of a "like"-meter, but it appears to have no influence on the other countries decision and it is almost impossible to change the like-meter anyway.\n\nAll in all, if you, like me, are looking for a simplified hearts of iron (Thanks to youtube I didnt find Hearts of Iron III to be that difficult to understand, I just found it to be chore with the bazillion provinces and no fun to automate the War-AI) I would recommend the first part of this series (the calm and the storm). While that game definatly has problems of its own (max resolution of 1024x768 with no widescreen option for example) it runs way better, the AI seems more predictable (in this case meant in a positive way as in - the guy with MASSIVE amounts of food who loves you will probably sell you some) and it felt more fast-paced as this one. Also its only 4Euros (got it for 1 in a sale), as to the 20 of this game.","January 29, 2015","false","15.3"," 62 of 79 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","62","79","2","1"

There is a very hard learning curve at first but once you get used to it the game will keep you playing and planning for diffrent things. Just like the game itself the editor is hard to figure out but once you get the hang of it the editor is really interesting to use. The only real complaint is that if you have a large nation you have to do a lot of clicking per turn and that leaves your mouse hand sore after only a few turns. One thing I like is that the AI has done somthing I did not expect every game. For example in my most recent game the ussr invaded norway only for germany to declare war on the ussr and both duked it out in norway. (germany did not conquer anything at that point so the only line of contact was norway) A good game and one I would like to continue playing into the future.\n\n\nUpdate: multiplayer is broken beyond belief for several reasons. one is that steam version of this game is no longer updated. two the game crashes on lan games all the time. and three to play online multiplayer you have to go to the website of the game and register and you can't play senarios online\ni would still get this game for single player but not multiplayer","December 5, 2013","true","152.8"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","1"

Luckily, you can write up your own trade agreements, make alliances (even if they are not historically accurate) and declare war on whoever you damn well please.\n\nThe game is incredibly realistic and a metric butt ton of fun.\n\nThere is no tutorial, so much learning will be trial and error: but it's totally worth it.\n","February 23, 2014","true","368.8"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","1"

With improved UI and the good kind of simplification(compared to the first one), this game is a must consider for those who love history, military, or strategy. Although the main downside is a not good tutorial and you are thrust into WW2 not knowing sh*t. Also those with no or little patience will most likely not like the game or at least some of the nations (cough) USSR (cough) due to the large amount of starting regions. To sandwich the bad I can also say no game will ever be the same in any way, whether it be the Italy AI taking France or the British commonwealth and America taking on Russia, all AI with no player interference. The diplomacy is good especially in war time when you can take advantage of another nations need in a war (me aka Germany sideing with America and the UK to fight Russia).\n\nIn short- Try it.

Death stacks of a few hundred infantry units will weather almost any attack with their high defence value and then happily mop up anything left of the attacking army. Focusing your economy purely on infantry will always give the most bang for your buck - delving into the game's impressive variety of units to build a mixture in each stack will never be as potent as pure infantry. Front lines don't really exist either, the AI will roll through in one province with a gigantic death stack of infantry - there is rarely a nuanced breakthrough or any sort of meaningful strategic warfare.\n\n--------------------------------\nThis is even the more painful because, that said, it's a game that almost gets it right. It never comes close to rivalling Hearts of Iron 3 (Hoi3) in terms of depth or detail but it doesn't attempt to - it's a game not a simulation (despite the developer's claim that it's educational). Building up industrial capacity and research is refreshingly simple and engaging, allowing you to change history within reason and raise medium-sized countries into great powers. Unlike Hoi3 there's plenty of value in playing as countries other than Britain, America, Russia and Germany. When the game works it's fun. The tech tree is a good balance of detail and simplicity and there are plenty of historical units. The problem is there's no point in building them because infantry is so strong in defence.\n\nDiplomacy is a weak point: there are few options, there's no way to take single provinces in a peace deal (you either take everything you've occupied or annex the whole country) and alliances are almost impossible to make (unless you're already fighting a mutual enemy, by which time they are largely pointless).\n\nThe interface is ok. The map's pretty ugly but on the whole it's clear. However, things are undeniably clunky. It's sometimes difficult to select units as the stacking fuction is poor and basic tasks can be overly complicated. There's no way to merge fleets whilst in port than I know of and you can't combine two fighters on the same aircraft carrier without unloading them from carrier, which is a feat of messy clicking in itself. Selecting army and air force stacks that are near each other is also difficult. On the upside, the national roundels underneath each unit are cool.\n\nThe game would still be enjoyable even with the niggling issues in diplomacy and the interface (and it is fun until you actually go to war) but the combat balance is so off that I can't recommend this game. Watching my upgraded army of 40 infantry+20 artillery+10 engineers+10 tanks be attacked and -completely- wiped out by 200 infantry in -one- turn, (yes, 80 casulties to 0) despite having a higher defence value than the opposing infantry stack's attack value, was when I gave up on this game.","January 9","false","33.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaltmiete/recommended/46770/","kaltmiete","Kaltmiete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaltmiete/","51 products in account","I'd like to start off with just saying. I like this game in some ways and think it has a lot of cool things about it. I honestly have one major complaint. The game progresses turn by turn. I"m not saying turn based gameplay doesn't work ever or that it isn't a good idea. It's an interesting idea for a game like this, but personally I found myself having nothing to do each turn after a point and just clicking end turn over and over again trying to finish building factories or other production which I need for the war. As a more minor but still somewhat significant complaint is that it seems like after a point combat becomes kind of confusing and muddled especially when the actual world war starts. I actually like a number of things about how industry and politics work. It is a lot like Hearts of Iron 3. Which I would tend to recommend more. Making History II: War of the World can get kind of slow and aggrevating with a turn based rather than real time system. I would also say the combat in Hearts of Iron is less confusing once you get past the immediate confusion I've heard some players have with it's battle mechanics.\n\nI'm sorry if that got a bit muddled. In closing. This is a ok game with some flaws to it which make me not able to really recommend this, it's predeccesor or sequel since they all seem to share the core gameplay without significant changes. I'm not saying they need to develop a direct clone of Hearts of Iron or any other game. But am saying a turn based grand strategy game is interesting, but probably as it turns out not the most efficent way to progress in one. When I purchased this I didn't know about Paradox Interactives grand strategy games and I would recommend someone who thinks this game looks interesting to first check out their cataloge. Shop around.\n\nPOSITIVE\n\n+ A nice industrial system\n+ A long tech tree\n+ A scenario editor\n\nNEGATIVE\n\n- - -Turn based system makes the game kind of sluggish It's the main reason I don't play it anymore\n- - Combat isn't great","April 2, 2014","false","55.1"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","6"

A good example of this would be the British trade with USA for destroyers to fight the atlantic war in exchange for war technology, making this a possibility would grant the small nations an even bigger chance to grow fast.\n\nAll in all, a good fun game that doesnt hurt your wallet, i would reccomend to any airchair general.","June 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It is exceedingly difficult to sustain any large scale attacks without leaving huge numbers of defenders behind to guard your flanks. Also combined arms armies seem to mean nothing.

There are few games like it that incorperate navy,army and airforce into single game with having over 35 different units for each branch. I am surprised to see the sale of this game to be so low. For how great of a game it is I really thought that this would be giving more competition to so many other titles such as Company of Heros, Total war and Men of War. The one con about this game would have to be is that it does not have a tutorial so learning how everything works just takes time experimenting with options. The pros definatly overwhelm the con and it is a great buy on steam.","June 28, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm refering to the board game Axis & Allies.\n\nI am a huge fan of turn base strategy. Until now, could never find a war simulator that was accesable (i.e. not a huge learning curve, or too much micro-management). I am hooked as this game has huge replayability. I've played Sweden, Germany, and am longing to finish my current game to only try out a new country.\n\nI highly highly highly recommend this game.
