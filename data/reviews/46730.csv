Skeletons dont seem to mind, they die anyway.\n\nGo into town, no story at all, just asked to get some keys to lock a gate. The skeletons wont be able to get in if the door is locked.\n\nAs I walk around, scenery pops in everywhere. Graphical glitches are frequent. Ambient sound loops for abour 4 seconds before it repeats.\n\nI spec to be a mage as I usually do in these Diablo clones. Find a basic staff, and start shooting ice bolts at skeletons. 45-50 dmg. I upgrade my INT and skill level, and start to do 65 dmg. I run out of mana, and start swinging my staff. 250 damage per hit, one shotting everything.\n\nFind a donkey which gives you a quest. Nothing appears on the screen, I have to go into the quest log to find it. Apparently the town in which I came not only has a locked doors issue, but now needs flour. This donkey has flour. Time to save the day via bread.\n\nThen it crashed.\n\nBest part of the game in my opinion.","March 14, 2015","false","0.5"," 65 of 70 people (93%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","93","65","70","30","1"

Well its still for sale. Its as bad now as it was in 2010, no patches or updates. Even the latest news from 2010 is for the wrong game on the wrong format. Take a look. 'Haze' got 4/10 back in 2010 from Eurogamer. 'Hazen' didn't even get a review, and if it had done it wouldn't be worth a 4 lol.\n\nSo go on. Put your money away. Go watch a Hazen gameplay video on Youtube, then go play Path of Exile for free (or anything else, your choice),  and be thankful Hazen is not a nasty stain on your Steam collection.\n","August 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

It has graphics that are cartoony (similar to Torchlight) and somewhat realistic. It mixes both of them really. I'm not that far in, but I really haven't seen much a story so far. Gameplay is like any other action RPG, so, lots of combat and a bit of quest solving while doing that. For a cheap game it's not that bad. Bit unpolished maybe. And I've been told it's pretty short (since it's an episode). My advice ? Hmm, I don't know... But I'm sure you can find out on your own if this is the game for you.\n\n[Rating: 61/100]","June 14, 2011","true","0.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I actually reloaded this game and forced myself to learn and play the game.  Objectively, it's pretty sound - as most hack-n-slash follow similar key-binding layouts and mouse-behaviours of well-known games of this genre (i.e. Diablo).  I think the majority of the negative reviews come from those that have played Diablo or similar hack-n-slash games as Hazen introduces a differing layout for control movement and attack.  I played this game with the notion - "this is not Diablo, don't expect it to be Diablo".  Looking beyond that, the game does quench the hack-n-slash thirst for those willing to overlook it's unique default control layout.","April 14, 2014","true","2.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

The art style is not bad for the time it was made and the mechanics work... to some extent.  Fun loot drops and you can feel yourself getting stronger and taking less damage as you get increasingly better armor.  In spite of all the complaints here, Hazen surprisingly ran fine on my Win7 x64 system with only one crash when entering a dungeon.  When reloaded, the game left me back where I was.\n\nNow for the bad parts:\n1. No saving allowed in a dungeon.  If the game crashes you may lose up to a half hour of progress.\n2. There is some kind of memory leak that slows down the game the longer you play.  Your melee swings and casts get slower and slower while the enemies rush you at the same speed.\n3. It takes a while to get used to the backwards controls.  You move with rt. click and everything else is left click.  No key rebinds.\n\nWorst of all are the ungodly respawns that slow you down as you travel to your destination then back to your village.  No teleports or shortcuts, just the long, slow trek back while fighting the same enemies you fought on the way there.  The first two hours had me traveling the same path numerous times while fighting the same respawns.  It can be maddening.\n\nCompared to a far superior ARPG like Torchlight that came out a year earlier, Hazen: The Dark Whispers just can't compete.","May 16","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
