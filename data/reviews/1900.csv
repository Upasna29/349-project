Has a bunch of extra maps added to it, some of which I recall seeing in fan patches.\n-The game natviely supports most modern resolutions up to 1920x1080.\n-Despite its age the graphics are still very neat to look at and features like its day and night cycle make the game quite pretty.\n-Note: You will have to register the game ingame via its product code allocated by steam to unlock its full content, which might scare some people off but I dont exactly see any harm in it. (not like most modern games dont require you to make accounts :p)\n\nGameplay:\nEurasian Dynasty (ED)\nThe ED originated from Russia and while they may not be the fastest, they certainly have some of the toughest units in the game featuring heavy tanks, artillery and bombers. They weaponry ranges from conventional weapons to heat rays.\nTheir basebuilding consists of placing a main 'core' at the center of your base from which you build pipes to connect a variety of structures and generators to power your network of buildings. They can also build walls and a variety of other defenses.\nTheir ressource gathering is done by mobile refineries which can hover from depot to depot and process all ressources gathered on the spot for a steady income.\n\nStrength: Very tough units, able to turtle quite well using a ring of walls around the mainframe, simple ressource gathering\nWeakness: Slow units, buildings are vulnerable to get disconnected from the frame and can get disabled due to lack of power, basebuilding takes up a lot of time and needs to be planned ahead a bit in order to make room for future buildings.\n\n\nUnited Civilized States (UCS)\nThe UCS originated from the United states of america, they have a variety of mechs and jets at their disposal and use a lot of energy based weaponry as well as ballistic missiles.\nTheir basebuilding is probably the most 'normal' and executed by flying drones that place structures which then build themselves as they drain the ressources needed. Their bases have the unique feature to use add-ons to enhance buildings in a specific way, such as making generators create more power or making refineries generate more income.\nTheir ressource gathering is rather traditional and has flying harvesters land on top of the ressources, gathering them and returning back to the nearest refinery for dropoff.\n\nStrength: Fairly easy to master, strong missiles backed up by laser weapons, simple basebuilding which doesnt need babysitting. Can place turrets and walls to some extend to provide decent defense. Can teleport freshly trained units.\nWeakness: Their structures while efficient can get costy to replace with a bunch of add-ons added to them and expanding to get more ressources does require you to set up additional outposts. Their laser weaponry is prone to get tackled by shields early on which renders them inefficient.\n\n\nLunar Corporation (LC)\nThe LC created orbital colonies and initially settled down on the Moon. They were able to study alien technology and feature the most advanced weaponry out of all the races. Their vehicles are hovertanks, infantry has jetpacks and aircraft are speedy.\nBasebuilding for the LC means placing a basic module on the ground and stacking other modules on top to create a tower which depending on modules you places can fill in a variety of roles from research and unit training to combat modules to turn them into tough fortresses. They can also place external turrets and laser walls and all structures can be placed anywhere as they are dropped in from the sky. (you can only call in a limited number of buildings at a time though)\nTheir ressource gathering is as simple as dropping a mining base next to a ressource field. They will harvest and process it automatically.\n\nStrength: Some of the fastest units in the game, very strong weaponry that is specialized to usually fit a single purpose, probably have the ability to expand in terms of ressources easier than any other race, can build foward or hidden bases anytime, anywhere.\nWeakness: Due to their 'stacking' mechanic of modules their structural integrity is often at risk and they are prone to have their buildings get sniped which are even more expensive to replace than fully modded ucs building, their early game units while fast are fairly weak in terms of hp.\n\n\nAliens\nThe aliens are a new addition in Earth 2160 and feature the most unique playstyle using cloning and evolution to create their units and having no ressource gathering in the traditional way.\nThey can morph strong defensive structures which are able to provide heavy cover for units while they clone and evolve or block off ressource points from your enemies.\nInstead of ressource gathering their units absorb a small amount of ressources to evolve into different species, starting with a basic unit that has no way of attacking and a basic mothership you have to clone them to create more and evolve those into different strands to create the perfect army.\n\nNote: It is advised that you keep at the very least one basic unit to replicate as you might be unable to reproduce if you dont!\n\nStrength: Strong structures, heaviest aircraft in the game, fast and lethal units, can easily poke at hostile bases and harass them.\nWeakness: Beyond static turrets no way to defend yourself, take great amounts of planning and macro management to keep track of your units and their evolutions, easy to get harassed and crippled if cloning units are exposed.\n\n\nVirtual Agents:\nVirtual Agents are 'Hero units' which will offer their services for the highest bidder. As Aliens have no means to store ressources they are unable to obtain any.\nAgents pop up every now and then , initially after a few minutes three random ones will pop up and ask if the player wants to hire them. You have to be quick and go for whichever suits you best or simply bid on them all if you feel generous with your ressources. Your enemies also have the chance to obtain them and can make them a better offer. In the end they will join whichever side is willing to spend the most money on them.\nOnce hired you can spawn the VA anywhere you like and they will remain in your service for a limited amount of time till their contract expires, after which you have to pay them again. If they get killed their contract is also terminated.\nThose Virtual agents offer a variety of bonuses for certain playstyles, such as reducing the cost of flying units by 25% or having your ground units start as veterans. The VA's also come in a variety of shapes and often are a powerful unit on their own that if used right can pack quite a punch.\nYou can have up to 3 agents at a time which will most likely start to chat with one another at some point. This usually leads to quite some hilarious conversations which might entertain you if you like bad puns and sarcastic comments.\n\nNote: Virtual Agents can be disabled during game setup if you dont want to have them around.\n\n\n\nThats about all I can tell ya, if youd like to know more you should just take the game for a spin, especially since its currently on offer for a laughable price. The rts genre usually doesnt bring forth as many games as other genres do currently which is why many of us still play 'older' games to pass the time.\nThis one is a little gem, sure has its flaws but it can be a bunch of fun, especially if you're looking to get it to play with some friends of yours who are also willing to spend a single dollar or euro to get it.","August 12, 2014","true","17.2"," 82 of 90 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","82","90","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/1900/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Earth 2160 is the third game in Earth 21XX series, a polish RTS that tried to put small innovative features. It came out in 2005 and then got Steam release in 2006, quiet early stuff. Didn't get any expansion packs, unlike Earth 2140 and 2150.\n\nSo, let's get to technical part. Around half of negative reviews that you see over this game comes from people beliving that game requires full registration, with your name, adress and such, for it to work fully. Actually, what is required is "Activation", which is inputting CD-key and then authorizing it on Internet, while "Registration" is optional and can be skipped. It's like in old PC games where they would ask if you want to "Register Now" after installing the game.\nOn bad side, some people on forum seemed to have trouble with CD-key itself. I don't know, I had no problem there, but maybe it's related to reinstallation on different computer.\n\nSurprisingly, widescreen is supported and works as intended, so to say. Even interface looks fine. But widescreen will often show parts of game's cutscenes that weren't supposed to be seen. You will often see that space background is just textured wall that was placed over the ground of current's level, not helping immerison.\n\nAs for multiplayer, it's either local or Internet. And Internet option is possible only through EarthNet, which, from what I heard, was shut down a while ago. To be honest, I didn't bother to check past account registration for that. And I doubt that many people were playing it nowdays. But could be wrong. I, myself, count that multiplayer is dead there.\n\nStory is that all 3 factions escaped Earth as it was about to be burned by sun. Lunar Corporation, an advanced faction of womans who lived on moon previously, came to Mars first. Eurasian Dynasty, soviet-like faction from Earth, arrived later and now tries to take it's place in solar system. In meanwhile there were no news about starship of United Civilized States, factions that uses robots heavily, even as leaders. And then some self-cloning aliens started to pop up.\n\nAt the core, Earth 2160 is same old classic spammy RTS, which was getting old as W40k: Dawn of War came out year before. Classic because it still makes you build bases, command directly any amount of units you want and has limited recources, making you move around. Spammy because you want to have more many buildings to produce many units to send into battles. You would even want to have no less than three research centers, otherwise you will not be able to research everything needed even in a hour. It did introduce population cap, but it means that you have to build lots of storages.\n\nIt takes some features from Earth 2140, some from Earth 2150 and doesn't forget to bring it's own. From Earth 2140 it got Infantry. Doesn't play with idea of any kind of friendly general AI this time around though. In all honesty, I didn't find Infantry useful outside of early Skirmish games. They die very quickly and don't seem to be cheap enough by comparison to spamming light mechanized units. They can capture the buildings or something, but base defences in this part are too strong to allow that.\n\nFrom 2150 it keeps customization of non-infantry units. It kinda improves, as you get to choose a bit more. Though, some chassis allow only some kind of weapons, but seeing how you get to choose from 4 types most often anyway, it's still awesome. And yes, it's built with counter mechanics in mind. You want to put armor against what your opponent uses and put weapons that will counter his units. 2160 is quite focused on countering: if you try to use laser weapon on unit with reflective armor it may take half of a minute to destroy it, while with counter it would have took just few short seconds. Goes same for base defences, you either use artilery or die.\nNo, they didn't keep those clunky tunnel mechanics and basic terraforming it had. It's already overwhelming with all features that 2160 got.\n\nAnd 2160 adds Aliens race and makes the 3 factions from 2150 even more unique to each other. They also gave us aircraft that you have to manually call to attack something from airbase. Sadly, they are bad. They have to see object the whole time that they get there. As soon as, say, your soldiers get destroyed around turrets and fog of war covers it, they will immeditly turn back around and will refuse to bomb anything until they return.\nAnd they added Virtual Agents. In campaign they are heroes who have inventory. Outside Campaign they are powerful units, who give passive benefits to your base, while being strong enough to possibly turn the tide of battle early in the match. The interesting part is the way you hire them when they randomly pop-up: it works like auction between all players! The highest bidder get them. Is it worth chasing after the increasing price? Or maybe you want to increase price for other players? Or maybe you are just trying to stale time while you are winning the battle? Fun addition. They also bring in a bit of personality, each with it's own car and even recognising and chatting with each other.\n\nRaces are mostly different in the way that they set up a base. As well as many smaller changes in units. Or the way that they use only two recources out of three available. It's a good fun to learn them all.\nED connects buildings around colony base with pipes. They can also build walls with wall turrets they can slide around freely. LC build tall towers, placing additional buildings on top of a main base. UCS feel mroe traditional by comparison, but they put 6 of basic buildings into field and then build additonal upgrade-buildings on sides of them. Aliens just clone and upgrade, sucking nearby needed recource.\nHm, I remember reading interview where developer warned that LC towers shouldn't be built too close together as they may fall onto each other if root building is destroyed. Sadly, no physics feature made it into final game. The only physic thing that remains are rocks that you can shoot at in campaign.\n\nIt has a campaign which is nice on theory, all four races being connected by ongoing storyline, while game slowly introduces you to game mechanic. But it's flawed kind of RTS campaign, where each mission drags on slowly, with times when you don't have anything much to multitask or to even do. And sometimes it's also difficult in such way that you will have to replay it. Like, in the last mission of ED the heavy weapons of tanks get disabled and you have to find traitor, who spawns in only when that happens. And you don't know where traitor. So you better restart mission and pre-place units in location where traitor will spawn, otherwise waves of Alien forces will overwhelm you. And well, I gave up on campaign at that point, kinda was too bored in some spots.\n\nSkirmish is quite intense and fun by comparison. Don't expect AI to ever let you space to breath after five minutes or so. Now, he is weak if you expand early and take all recources for yourself, but if you let him have some bases for itself, he will not be so weak. He may even wreck you good. If at one moment you will be destroying his army with laser weapon, then in next moments you will be facing laser-resistant army that will be destroy yours in seconds instead.\n\nIt's a shame that audio-visual enjoyment is a bit more lacking when compared to 2150. That game had different soundtrack for each faction, shame that 2160 uses only one for everybody. While graphics were spectacular when it came out, with bump-shading even on infantry and cool special effects, I felt that more atmospherical effects were lacking. Like explosions on ground. Or lighting during night. In 2150 it was looking great to see bases slowly activating red and white colored lights. Kinda weak here.\n\nSo, it's RTS which is usual at core but tries to be unique with it's own features, not unlike other Earth 21XX games. It's a bit clumpsy, a bit too spammy. Still joy to try all factions.","August 18, 2015","true","24.5"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/1900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Featuring four races, each unique and interesting in their own way, Earth 2160 has an average storyline that doesn't really enthrall or engage in any way. There are three groups left from Earth who are fighting it out and trying to maintain a foothold in the future of mankind. Add to that an interesting alien race that has some especially unique features, and you have a recipe for a fun game. Earth 2160 has a campaign for each of the four groups: The European Dynasty, Lunar Corporation, and Union of Civilized States represent the groups from Earth, and the aliens representing the fourth playable race. If you're looking for a deep single-player experience, you're sure to find it with Earth 2160, as it takes time to work through the campaigns for all four groups.During the campaigns, you'll find out that each group really is different and depends upon a certain strategy to achieve victory. Another great aspect is the ability to research and create new units to combat the enemy tactics you encounter. Unfortunately, if you find yourself up against a unit that your newly created and research units are ill-equipped to defend against, you'll quickly find yourself on the losing side of the battle. Relying on a single strategy, weapon, or defense type will quickly lead to defeat. The key in Earth 2160 is to maintain a constant vigilance and be on the lookout for what sorts of technologies your enemies are employing, and work to create your own units to combat them. There is a ton of strategy involved in this, and it works to great effect.The interface for getting around, controlling your units, building your bases, and handling other options is a bit clunky. There are icons that have convenient tool tips that appear, which makes things a lot easier, but when you're looking for a specific action, you don't want to have to hover your mouse over each icon to find the one you are looking for.Graphically, the game is one of the best looking real-time strategy games I've ever played. You can zoom in to insane levels, and each unit looks as good up close as it does from a distance. Battles between groups of enemies are fantastically exciting and explosive looking, providing a brilliant show that almost overshadows the results. The environments are large and pleasant to look at, and once you've gotten your bases built up and lined with defenses, it's like gazing at a landscape straight out of a science fiction movie. One of the coolest things is the transition from day to night; watching your units light up the night is extremely cool. Another great graphical aspect is the trails that your vehicles leave on the ground. Tire treads, steps, it all looks amazing and comes together to form a fantastic-looking experience.Sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. One of the worst aspects of Earth 2160 are the voiceovers. The soundtrack is pretty good, and changes with the action, which is nice. It's nothing really excellent, but it does provide ambience and helps with the suspenseful atmosphere.There is a skirmish mode as well as multiplayer, and if you get tired of the lengthy campaign, you can always find a friend to play against or take on the computer in the skirmish battles.Earth 2160 is an excellent title that is sure to stand the test of time for real-time strategy fans.","March 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","44","56","0","0"

Also, it seems like the shields aren't doing their job... they SHOULD absorb all kinds of damage... and not let any projectiles or beams through... so devs, PLEASE, patch these glitches to perfect this game!

Furthermore it's a somewhat slow paced game that requires time and thought put into it.\n\nIt's a science-fiction based RTS game featuring advanced base building, ressource gathering and combat. The economic aspect of the game is quite basic. Gather ressources to fund your base and units, base building is pretty extensive depending on the factions. The combat is quite good but challenging. One of the most important mechanics is the unit customization, through research you can design your own units with various strengths and weaknesses. This allows for some major tactical planning and you really need to think what type of unit is effective against another type of unit. Overall this mechanic is very rewarding but can be frustrating. Sometimes your units will just be annihilated and you won't have the time or patience to find a new design that suits your needs.\n\nTwo aspects of this game that I find very appealing are the factions and the campaigns. The factions are completely different and feel distinct. Each faction has a unique way of playing and focus, some have completely different structures and designs that opt for different playstyles. The mission campaigns are extremely well done, especially for an rts game. You have dialogues and cutscenes, some rpg elements as well and a decent storyline. Furthermore you will have several campaigns at your disposal to play.\n\nThe multiplayer is seviceable and works quite well. So are the graphics and soundtrack. Nothing to complain about.","November 29, 2014","true","3.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This even extends to regular units, for example, if you have a tank with regular armor, it will only take 10% damage from regular attacks, but 100% from everything else.  So if you happen to guess what the enemy is using, they're ♥♥♥♥ed, if you guess wrong, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.\nUnit customization only leads to more hardcounters, and doesn't really give you much freedom\nAnti-missile defenses don't work properly\nUnits feel cartoony and wimpy compared to Earth 2140","December 11, 2011","true","75.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Seriously, if you leave your guys unattended and the enemy attacks en masse, there's a really high chance your troops will try and pursue the farthest unit, ignoring everything else.\n- Only "Hold Fire" and "Pursue Enemy", no "Defensive" stance (if you've ever played Age of Empires 2, you know how much of a difference the 4 stances make when leaving troops unattended)\n- Order too many troops from point A to B and they'll happily move in a line (like in C&C Generals), easy pickings for entrenched enemies\n- Tech Tree is somewhat confusing.\n- Fog of War is a static on areas you haven't explored yet. Without shades/shadows like in C&C Generals or Age of Empires, enemies simply "pop up" from nowhere, since you don't know what is your exact visible field.\n\nThe game does have some really interesting points, though:\n- Factions are VERY different, from base building to unit training\n- You can edit your units and create variants with parts you research\n\nI won't recommend this game to anyone but RTS junkies","April 6","false","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The UCS build a central hub and attach 4 other buildings to that structure their mines are built as a refinery which sends out termites that harvest metal and crystal.\n\nThe LC are a faction who ever soldier seems to be female, their vehicle style is entirely hover tanks, the fastest units in the game but not very armored. their buildings are built on top of one another as towers, while their mines are planted by the resource and mine directly from it, harvesting crystal & water.\n\nThe ED build by connecting each base to a central hub, this provides their bases with a decent defense, their vehicle style is tanks they are usually the slowest but have the best armor. The Ed mine by using mobile miners that just sit on the resources harvesting metal & water constantly.\n\nThe Aliens, are an entirely mobile and aggressive force moving from resource site to resource site absorbing a different resource depending upon what breed of alien is feeding, to allow them to grow in-strength and size. they don't build a base instead their morphidian units clone themselves after absorbing enough water, or metal or crystal. this also allows that unit to then evolve into a new breed of Alien soldier or vehicle equivalent.\n\noverall a good game although still slightly flawed but the only flaw with 2160 is they took out my underground bases from 2150..","October 25, 2011","true","67.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bought it when ported to  GNU/Linux. The game falls short of Starcraft (either 1 or 2) but is way better than other contemporary games, like Red Alert or Tiberian Sun. The graphics are good, but surely dated.\n\nThe game is somewhat complex (which means less fast than say, SC), it has 3 different resources, but every race uses only 2. You get a lot of micro management, like drivers can exit vehicles, soldiers level up, you can design vehicles (from limited options) and you have "hero" units (called agents). Base building is great, and varies a lot depending on what race you choose.\n\nThe races are kinda reminiscent of SC, but each has it's original story and characteristics (not widely original though). You got the soviet like Dinasty, with heavy units, the United Civilized States, more agile and fully robotised (some units kinda look like T-800), aliens that look half like a zerling, half like a bug from Starship troopers, and the all female Lunar Corporation, that looks like they come from a 1970's Sci-Fi film.\n\nBottom line: Get it if you liked RTS 10 years ago, but don't expect it to be up to today's RTS standards.","April 19","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It gets confusing, and you mostly have to learn by trial and error.  I imagine the campaign may help and serve as a sort of tutorial, but I never made it past the first mission.\n\nThe tech tree for each race is also fairly overwhelming at first glance, and you basically need to sit alone with the aliens for a match or two to slowly figure out how they work.  Again, trial and error.\n\nAlso, the AI is extremely hard.  Even on the easiest difficulty, my friend and I who are fairly new at the game have to go two against one, and often barely scrape by with wins.  Granted, we are new, but the easy AI should not be anywhere NEAR this hard.  It's fairly ludicrous.\n\nAlso, the factions don't appear to be very well balanced, at least in the vanilla (un modded) game.  Late game, aliens are invincible in most cases.\n\nAnd now to the pros!\n\nThe factions in this game are my favorite I have ever seen in an RTS, and I am not exaggerating.  They all feel COMPLETELY different, unlike most games where the factions are basically reskins of each other, build slightly differently, etc.. It is quite fun learning how to play each of them, and figuring out which one best suits your style.  The three non-alien races have their own different tech trees, and you can also construct custom units to make the perfect army.\n\nAnother thing: the battles are epic in every sense of the word.  Just in the last match I was playing, my friend and I were fighting with the computer over the middle ground of the map.  My buddy was the alien faction and moved in with large cruisers, while I supported him from the ground with anti-AA tanks (in this game, you can build custom units with different weapons equipped: in this case I outfitted tanks with anti-rocket flares, which protect your air from AA rockets).  The computer mobbed at us with endless anti-air units and large mechs, which my flare tanks mostly took care of, while both sides were being bombared with long-range artillery from each player.  Random other ground-on-ground tanks battled in the middle.  Lasers and flares and rockets all exploded overhead, and explosions were everyhwere.\n\nBattles like this happen all the time in Earth 2160.  It's extremely fascinating to watch, and the game gets incredibly intense in pitched fights.\n\nThis is probably the longest review on the game, so I will shorten it up and conclude with this:\n\nYes, it has flaws, some of which are fairly aggravating, but when the game shines it truly shines.  It's a grind to learn the factions at first, but if you have some friends to play with, you'll find few RTS titles with more intense battles or more interesting factions.

Has a bunch of extra maps added to it, some of which I recall seeing in fan patches.\n-The game natviely supports most modern resolutions up to 1920x1080.\n-Despite its age the graphics are still very neat to look at and features like its day and night cycle make the game quite pretty.\n-Note: You will have to register the game ingame via its product code allocated by steam to unlock its full content, which might scare some people off but I dont exactly see any harm in it. (not like most modern games dont require you to make accounts :p)\n\nGameplay:\nEurasian Dynasty (ED)\nThe ED originated from Russia and while they may not be the fastest, they certainly have some of the toughest units in the game featuring heavy tanks, artillery and bombers. They weaponry ranges from conventional weapons to heat rays.\nTheir basebuilding consists of placing a main 'core' at the center of your base from which you build pipes to connect a variety of structures and generators to power your network of buildings. They can also build walls and a variety of other defenses.\nTheir ressource gathering is done by mobile refineries which can hover from depot to depot and process all ressources gathered on the spot for a steady income.\n\nStrength: Very tough units, able to turtle quite well using a ring of walls around the mainframe, simple ressource gathering\nWeakness: Slow units, buildings are vulnerable to get disconnected from the frame and can get disabled due to lack of power, basebuilding takes up a lot of time and needs to be planned ahead a bit in order to make room for future buildings.\n\n\nUnited Civilized States (UCS)\nThe UCS originated from the United states of america, they have a variety of mechs and jets at their disposal and use a lot of energy based weaponry as well as ballistic missiles.\nTheir basebuilding is probably the most 'normal' and executed by flying drones that place structures which then build themselves as they drain the ressources needed. Their bases have the unique feature to use add-ons to enhance buildings in a specific way, such as making generators create more power or making refineries generate more income.\nTheir ressource gathering is rather traditional and has flying harvesters land on top of the ressources, gathering them and returning back to the nearest refinery for dropoff.\n\nStrength: Fairly easy to master, strong missiles backed up by laser weapons, simple basebuilding which doesnt need babysitting. Can place turrets and walls to some extend to provide decent defense. Can teleport freshly trained units.\nWeakness: Their structures while efficient can get costy to replace with a bunch of add-ons added to them and expanding to get more ressources does require you to set up additional outposts. Their laser weaponry is prone to get tackled by shields early on which renders them inefficient.\n\n\nLunar Corporation (LC)\nThe LC created orbital colonies and initially settled down on the Moon. They were able to study alien technology and feature the most advanced weaponry out of all the races. Their vehicles are hovertanks, infantry has jetpacks and aircraft are speedy.\nBasebuilding for the LC means placing a basic module on the ground and stacking other modules on top to create a tower which depending on modules you places can fill in a variety of roles from research and unit training to combat modules to turn them into tough fortresses. They can also place external turrets and laser walls and all structures can be placed anywhere as they are dropped in from the sky. (you can only call in a limited number of buildings at a time though)\nTheir ressource gathering is as simple as dropping a mining base next to a ressource field. They will harvest and process it automatically.\n\nStrength: Some of the fastest units in the game, very strong weaponry that is specialized to usually fit a single purpose, probably have the ability to expand in terms of ressources easier than any other race, can build foward or hidden bases anytime, anywhere.\nWeakness: Due to their 'stacking' mechanic of modules their structural integrity is often at risk and they are prone to have their buildings get sniped which are even more expensive to replace than fully modded ucs building, their early game units while fast are fairly weak in terms of hp.\n\n\nAliens\nThe aliens are a new addition in Earth 2160 and feature the most unique playstyle using cloning and evolution to create their units and having no ressource gathering in the traditional way.\nThey can morph strong defensive structures which are able to provide heavy cover for units while they clone and evolve or block off ressource points from your enemies.\nInstead of ressource gathering their units absorb a small amount of ressources to evolve into different species, starting with a basic unit that has no way of attacking and a basic mothership you have to clone them to create more and evolve those into different strands to create the perfect army.\n\nNote: It is advised that you keep at the very least one basic unit to replicate as you might be unable to reproduce if you dont!\n\nStrength: Strong structures, heaviest aircraft in the game, fast and lethal units, can easily poke at hostile bases and harass them.\nWeakness: Beyond static turrets no way to defend yourself, take great amounts of planning and macro management to keep track of your units and their evolutions, easy to get harassed and crippled if cloning units are exposed.\n\n\nVirtual Agents:\nVirtual Agents are 'Hero units' which will offer their services for the highest bidder. As Aliens have no means to store ressources they are unable to obtain any.\nAgents pop up every now and then , initially after a few minutes three random ones will pop up and ask if the player wants to hire them. You have to be quick and go for whichever suits you best or simply bid on them all if you feel generous with your ressources. Your enemies also have the chance to obtain them and can make them a better offer. In the end they will join whichever side is willing to spend the most money on them.\nOnce hired you can spawn the VA anywhere you like and they will remain in your service for a limited amount of time till their contract expires, after which you have to pay them again. If they get killed their contract is also terminated.\nThose Virtual agents offer a variety of bonuses for certain playstyles, such as reducing the cost of flying units by 25% or having your ground units start as veterans. The VA's also come in a variety of shapes and often are a powerful unit on their own that if used right can pack quite a punch.\nYou can have up to 3 agents at a time which will most likely start to chat with one another at some point. This usually leads to quite some hilarious conversations which might entertain you if you like bad puns and sarcastic comments.\n\nNote: Virtual Agents can be disabled during game setup if you dont want to have them around.\n\n\n\nThats about all I can tell ya, if youd like to know more you should just take the game for a spin, especially since its currently on offer for a laughable price. The rts genre usually doesnt bring forth as many games as other genres do currently which is why many of us still play 'older' games to pass the time.\nThis one is a little gem, sure has its flaws but it can be a bunch of fun, especially if you're looking to get it to play with some friends of yours who are also willing to spend a single dollar or euro to get it.","August 12, 2014","true","17.2"," 82 of 90 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","82","90","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/1900/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Earth 2160 is the third game in Earth 21XX series, a polish RTS that tried to put small innovative features. It came out in 2005 and then got Steam release in 2006, quiet early stuff. Didn't get any expansion packs, unlike Earth 2140 and 2150.\n\nSo, let's get to technical part. Around half of negative reviews that you see over this game comes from people beliving that game requires full registration, with your name, adress and such, for it to work fully. Actually, what is required is "Activation", which is inputting CD-key and then authorizing it on Internet, while "Registration" is optional and can be skipped. It's like in old PC games where they would ask if you want to "Register Now" after installing the game.\nOn bad side, some people on forum seemed to have trouble with CD-key itself. I don't know, I had no problem there, but maybe it's related to reinstallation on different computer.\n\nSurprisingly, widescreen is supported and works as intended, so to say. Even interface looks fine. But widescreen will often show parts of game's cutscenes that weren't supposed to be seen. You will often see that space background is just textured wall that was placed over the ground of current's level, not helping immerison.\n\nAs for multiplayer, it's either local or Internet. And Internet option is possible only through EarthNet, which, from what I heard, was shut down a while ago. To be honest, I didn't bother to check past account registration for that. And I doubt that many people were playing it nowdays. But could be wrong. I, myself, count that multiplayer is dead there.\n\nStory is that all 3 factions escaped Earth as it was about to be burned by sun. Lunar Corporation, an advanced faction of womans who lived on moon previously, came to Mars first. Eurasian Dynasty, soviet-like faction from Earth, arrived later and now tries to take it's place in solar system. In meanwhile there were no news about starship of United Civilized States, factions that uses robots heavily, even as leaders. And then some self-cloning aliens started to pop up.\n\nAt the core, Earth 2160 is same old classic spammy RTS, which was getting old as W40k: Dawn of War came out year before. Classic because it still makes you build bases, command directly any amount of units you want and has limited recources, making you move around. Spammy because you want to have more many buildings to produce many units to send into battles. You would even want to have no less than three research centers, otherwise you will not be able to research everything needed even in a hour. It did introduce population cap, but it means that you have to build lots of storages.\n\nIt takes some features from Earth 2140, some from Earth 2150 and doesn't forget to bring it's own. From Earth 2140 it got Infantry. Doesn't play with idea of any kind of friendly general AI this time around though. In all honesty, I didn't find Infantry useful outside of early Skirmish games. They die very quickly and don't seem to be cheap enough by comparison to spamming light mechanized units. They can capture the buildings or something, but base defences in this part are too strong to allow that.\n\nFrom 2150 it keeps customization of non-infantry units. It kinda improves, as you get to choose a bit more. Though, some chassis allow only some kind of weapons, but seeing how you get to choose from 4 types most often anyway, it's still awesome. And yes, it's built with counter mechanics in mind. You want to put armor against what your opponent uses and put weapons that will counter his units. 2160 is quite focused on countering: if you try to use laser weapon on unit with reflective armor it may take half of a minute to destroy it, while with counter it would have took just few short seconds. Goes same for base defences, you either use artilery or die.\nNo, they didn't keep those clunky tunnel mechanics and basic terraforming it had. It's already overwhelming with all features that 2160 got.\n\nAnd 2160 adds Aliens race and makes the 3 factions from 2150 even more unique to each other. They also gave us aircraft that you have to manually call to attack something from airbase. Sadly, they are bad. They have to see object the whole time that they get there. As soon as, say, your soldiers get destroyed around turrets and fog of war covers it, they will immeditly turn back around and will refuse to bomb anything until they return.\nAnd they added Virtual Agents. In campaign they are heroes who have inventory. Outside Campaign they are powerful units, who give passive benefits to your base, while being strong enough to possibly turn the tide of battle early in the match. The interesting part is the way you hire them when they randomly pop-up: it works like auction between all players! The highest bidder get them. Is it worth chasing after the increasing price? Or maybe you want to increase price for other players? Or maybe you are just trying to stale time while you are winning the battle? Fun addition. They also bring in a bit of personality, each with it's own car and even recognising and chatting with each other.\n\nRaces are mostly different in the way that they set up a base. As well as many smaller changes in units. Or the way that they use only two recources out of three available. It's a good fun to learn them all.\nED connects buildings around colony base with pipes. They can also build walls with wall turrets they can slide around freely. LC build tall towers, placing additional buildings on top of a main base. UCS feel mroe traditional by comparison, but they put 6 of basic buildings into field and then build additonal upgrade-buildings on sides of them. Aliens just clone and upgrade, sucking nearby needed recource.\nHm, I remember reading interview where developer warned that LC towers shouldn't be built too close together as they may fall onto each other if root building is destroyed. Sadly, no physics feature made it into final game. The only physic thing that remains are rocks that you can shoot at in campaign.\n\nIt has a campaign which is nice on theory, all four races being connected by ongoing storyline, while game slowly introduces you to game mechanic. But it's flawed kind of RTS campaign, where each mission drags on slowly, with times when you don't have anything much to multitask or to even do. And sometimes it's also difficult in such way that you will have to replay it. Like, in the last mission of ED the heavy weapons of tanks get disabled and you have to find traitor, who spawns in only when that happens. And you don't know where traitor. So you better restart mission and pre-place units in location where traitor will spawn, otherwise waves of Alien forces will overwhelm you. And well, I gave up on campaign at that point, kinda was too bored in some spots.\n\nSkirmish is quite intense and fun by comparison. Don't expect AI to ever let you space to breath after five minutes or so. Now, he is weak if you expand early and take all recources for yourself, but if you let him have some bases for itself, he will not be so weak. He may even wreck you good. If at one moment you will be destroying his army with laser weapon, then in next moments you will be facing laser-resistant army that will be destroy yours in seconds instead.\n\nIt's a shame that audio-visual enjoyment is a bit more lacking when compared to 2150. That game had different soundtrack for each faction, shame that 2160 uses only one for everybody. While graphics were spectacular when it came out, with bump-shading even on infantry and cool special effects, I felt that more atmospherical effects were lacking. Like explosions on ground. Or lighting during night. In 2150 it was looking great to see bases slowly activating red and white colored lights. Kinda weak here.\n\nSo, it's RTS which is usual at core but tries to be unique with it's own features, not unlike other Earth 21XX games. It's a bit clumpsy, a bit too spammy. Still joy to try all factions.","August 18, 2015","true","24.5"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","1"

The most interesting aspect of the game lies within the customization of the loadouts of individual units upon construction, while progressing through the impressive research tree.\n\nCompared with the predecessors the differences and specific characteristics of the factions were further developed (e.g. unique base building and unit types).In addition the micromanagement of units and buildings has been simplified.\n\nOn the other hand the clarity of the user interface still remains an issue, which would have needed more attention.\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nEarth 2160 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2005\n\nEarth 2150: Lost Souls (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2002\n\nEarth 2150: The Moon Project (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2000\n\nEarth 2150 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 1999\nLink to Steam review for Earth 2150.\n\nEarth 2140 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 1997\nLink to Steam review for Earth 2140.","January 19, 2014","true","51.7"," 75 of 97 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","75","97","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/1900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Featuring four races, each unique and interesting in their own way, Earth 2160 has an average storyline that doesn't really enthrall or engage in any way. There are three groups left from Earth who are fighting it out and trying to maintain a foothold in the future of mankind. Add to that an interesting alien race that has some especially unique features, and you have a recipe for a fun game. Earth 2160 has a campaign for each of the four groups: The European Dynasty, Lunar Corporation, and Union of Civilized States represent the groups from Earth, and the aliens representing the fourth playable race. If you're looking for a deep single-player experience, you're sure to find it with Earth 2160, as it takes time to work through the campaigns for all four groups.During the campaigns, you'll find out that each group really is different and depends upon a certain strategy to achieve victory. Another great aspect is the ability to research and create new units to combat the enemy tactics you encounter. Unfortunately, if you find yourself up against a unit that your newly created and research units are ill-equipped to defend against, you'll quickly find yourself on the losing side of the battle. Relying on a single strategy, weapon, or defense type will quickly lead to defeat. The key in Earth 2160 is to maintain a constant vigilance and be on the lookout for what sorts of technologies your enemies are employing, and work to create your own units to combat them. There is a ton of strategy involved in this, and it works to great effect.The interface for getting around, controlling your units, building your bases, and handling other options is a bit clunky. There are icons that have convenient tool tips that appear, which makes things a lot easier, but when you're looking for a specific action, you don't want to have to hover your mouse over each icon to find the one you are looking for.Graphically, the game is one of the best looking real-time strategy games I've ever played. You can zoom in to insane levels, and each unit looks as good up close as it does from a distance. Battles between groups of enemies are fantastically exciting and explosive looking, providing a brilliant show that almost overshadows the results. The environments are large and pleasant to look at, and once you've gotten your bases built up and lined with defenses, it's like gazing at a landscape straight out of a science fiction movie. One of the coolest things is the transition from day to night; watching your units light up the night is extremely cool. Another great graphical aspect is the trails that your vehicles leave on the ground. Tire treads, steps, it all looks amazing and comes together to form a fantastic-looking experience.Sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. One of the worst aspects of Earth 2160 are the voiceovers. The soundtrack is pretty good, and changes with the action, which is nice. It's nothing really excellent, but it does provide ambience and helps with the suspenseful atmosphere.There is a skirmish mode as well as multiplayer, and if you get tired of the lengthy campaign, you can always find a friend to play against or take on the computer in the skirmish battles.Earth 2160 is an excellent title that is sure to stand the test of time for real-time strategy fans.","March 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","44","56","0","0"

It will provide some decent entertainment in the here and now but it will never be remembered for anything.\n\nEarth 2160 sets you in the future, corporations fight for control over the Solar System's dwindling resources as a new discovery rocks the power structure and sets the game's events in motion. As you start out you get to play as either a generic male dominated corporation or the curiously female dominated Mars corporation. They both, not surprisingly, turn out to be evil rather quickly into the campaign and you eventually get to play as the "good" faction, a generic robot corporation that really has no personality and eventually, a menacing alien horde.\n\nThe storyline really isn't anything to write home about, it's all pretty standard stuff, good guys works for the bad corporation but eventually rebels against them. The dialog and cut scenes are of a particularly low quality that will often make you cringe at just how awful it really is.\n\nWhere Earth 2160 gains a points is in the gameplay however, each faction has a unique set of units and a unique way of base construction, the Mars women for example focusing on individual strong point structures that can have additional modules added on top for research, defense or unit production whereas the alien horde have no real base construction instead focusing entirely on cloning and evolving their units.\n\nAnd as if this uniqueness to each faction wasn't enough each faction come with a complete research tree and the ability to customize each unit with various types of weapons, shields and engines allowing you to really make the faction your own. This customization does have it's flaws however, particularly where single-player is concerned as the AI does not adapt to your unit builds it is fairly trivial to make an exact counter to what the AI is building and just stomp them using rock-paper-scissors.\n\nThe slight RPG elements wherein you occasionally have a hero unit or two that can pick up items feels somewhat misplaced and rarely add anything beyond something to worry about as losing a hero often leads to a game over.\n\nEarth 2160 is not a bad game and it's a game you can get a lot of fun out of especially if you skip past the cut scenes. it is however not a game that will stand the test of time and as such it's not really something I'd recommend anyone buys any longer.","January 15, 2013","false","67.0"," 28 of 60 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","28","60","2","0"

Sadly that's not really possible.\nMaybe I'm overly nostalgic from what earth 2150 has and 2160 hasn't but even as a fan of RTS games this game feels very halfhearted.\n\n\n1) The Unit Editor\n\nThis is why the Earth series felt so unique: Build your own army, by picking a chassis, add weapons & shields and voila. Earth 2160 even added a few extra features. Now you can add engines, armour as well as gimmicks such as auto repair drones.\n\nIn the old Earth games, shields kept you alive deflecting plasma or electro canon fire. Now armour is way more important than shields as most weapons simply bypass shields. What sounds like a great feature simply turns the game into a game of rock, paper, sicssors, lizard, spock. Either your army wipes the floor with your enemies or they get crushed within seconds. Reload, build units using other armour and try again.\n\nOnce you get to the enemy base, the game really starts showing you the middle finger. Almost all weapons have reduced damage against buildings and if you don't want to get shreaded by basic defense turrets you'll need artillery units to slowly tear the base down bit by bit. Remember how much more fun it was to have your army charge in and blow up buildings? I do -.-\n\n\n2) No Mainbase / Veteran units\n\nRemember when you could do research between missions at your mainbase? Now you'll have to do all your research during missions. It helps that each research center you build no longer gives a timebonus, but instead allows simultanious research yet in the end you're just waiting for new chassis to unlock. Very boring.\n\nVeteran units you can take from mission to mission can no longer be picked by you, instead the game apparently randomly chooses units from previous missions as starting units. Granted, each unit now has a pilot who earns the XP and can be placed in another vehicle, but it's just not the same.\n\n\n3) Hero Units\n\nI loved "Fang" from the previous games, so I was curious how this one would play out. Fang was pretty OP, but not as OP as the new hero units in earth, that can take out armies without breaking a sweat. Not to mention the horrible dialogues and voice acting. No idea why the games doesn't pause during dialogues *or* why I can't control units during this blah blah *or* why everyone wants to talk during attacks.\n\n\n4) Bugs bugs bugs\n\nI was stuck on a mission because I've taken a different path to my objective, not triggering a dialogue. Still not as fun as  watching my units drive right next to the enemy before opening fire or simply not attacking at all despite "follow enemy" settings and being under heavy fire. Also why does my hero move in slow motion sometimes? No idea.","January 9, 2015","false","12.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

It was just a regular skirmish mode with some limiltations and cutsceens. there are few mission where i controll a single unit and do stuffs.....but they are pretty boring as well.\nThe factions in games are also miss repressentive, i mean the ED stands for Euroasian dynasty, so you prolly excpecting Russian and/or Chinese together right? But no, appearently they are American.  The voice acting are horrible it would have been better if they just showed us texts, the voice actors are just reading the script without acting. They didn't even bother to fake an accent.  The units voice are also horriducily act.\nPlus there are a lot of bugs in the game that make you don't want to play, for example if you have a fighter engage in air to air combat against a group of gunships, the fighter would get stuck on the other gunship nearby when it strafe the target. The fighter can't be moved unless the gunship that it stuck to is destroyed. Tank  skim side way instead of turning.\nThen the unit itself are so unbalanced, one shot kills are common, i understand the devs trying to make us mix units and make different type of armor and custmoze my army, but it just too much when you have a gunship with sheild at full health with armor good against laser to be one shoted by anti air that fire missile.\nThe path finding in this game are also terrible, veichles all clogged up when in tight area which make them unable to move, this is especially irritating in the campaign because it has a lot of narrow pathway. infantry would dance around the edge of the clif instead of finding a way to go around it, have to manually guide them. They also tend to"stack" onto each other making it almost impossbile to select them indivusially.\nGraphic wise the game was ok for it's time, the explosion is pretty nice looking and the day/night cycle lighting are very good.\nThe animations are horrible most unit don't even have any other animation beside move stop when they die they just have a huge eplosion and dissappeared, when infantry die they fall like they are in a 3d max testing animation so unnatural,  ground control 2 was released in 2004 and it has far better animation than this game.\nBut since i got this game for a dollar i didn't losing anything, You can give the game a try but don't expect much.","August 12, 2014","false","8.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraxous/recommended/1900/","kraxous","Kraxous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraxous/","173 products in account","The Earth[en.wikipedia.org]series has always kept me highly entertained, energetic and on the ball: until this. Earth 2160[en.wikipedia.org]was on sale for around 69p and I thought, "Hell, I loved Earth 2150 so why not buy this one?" so I did. I played it for a little while and what... an utter... disaster. First question: why is there infantry? The Earth series was all about strategy with VEHICLES never infantry and that's what made it unique. It's not all bad though, with a highly [yet unnecessary] complex camera controls, it gives a better feel for the combat with increased zoom. That's about it. The rest is just icing on the cake to make it look pretty.\n\nImmediately afterwards, I repurchased Earth 2150 (as it was a childhood game) and that saved me from certain destruction. Earth 2150 became my saving grace that day, a purchase I certainly don't regret. So anyway, you open up Earth 2160 and are immediately greeted with this incompetent and unsuiting theme music. Like, what? What the hell, seriously? You can listen to it here on YouTube.\n\nPros:\n» Graphic update, yet it still suits the old graphical feeling which is nice.\n» New units and structures.\n» With there being infantry, the commanders now have faces and unique voices.\n» Missions that make sense.\n» The Lunar Corporation are a women's faction?! WHAT?!\n» Multiplayer support with GameRanger.\n\nCons:\n» Music does not flow, at all.\n» My opinion: addition of infantry. The game lost its touch.\n» Still no fluent tutorial (or none at all.)\n» Weirdly expensive.\n» Seems as if this game was released before Earth 2150.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone. If anything, Earth 2150 will win your heart forever as it's an amazing RTS game. Earth 2160 is just not for me, I don't like it all too much. If you're looking for CQC battles, Earth 2160 seems like your type of game rather than vehicular and aerial combat. I would rate this game a 3/10.","July 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

I first heard about the series many years ago. I only played Earth 2150 back then, but then I heard about Earth 2160 about 6 years ago and decided to try it. To my surprise, it came out to be a fantastic game. Much better, than its predecessor, the 3D setting of this game is quite revolutionary for a 2006 strategy game! I love it! And the gameplay? Amazing! You can customize your units as you wish, give them many different weapons, and level them up. Though, there are some unsatisfying things. When playing against the Alien race, the LC faction is quite weak against them. The second thing - you can't really tell what damage you are getting from the aliens... I tried all kinds of armor against them and none worked... Also, it seems like the shields aren't doing their job... they SHOULD absorb all kinds of damage... and not let any projectiles or beams through... so devs, PLEASE, patch these glitches to perfect this game! It's already a beautiful game as it is, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this to any RTS lover!

Furthermore it's a somewhat slow paced game that requires time and thought put into it.\n\nIt's a science-fiction based RTS game featuring advanced base building, ressource gathering and combat. The economic aspect of the game is quite basic. Gather ressources to fund your base and units, base building is pretty extensive depending on the factions. The combat is quite good but challenging. One of the most important mechanics is the unit customization, through research you can design your own units with various strengths and weaknesses. This allows for some major tactical planning and you really need to think what type of unit is effective against another type of unit. Overall this mechanic is very rewarding but can be frustrating. Sometimes your units will just be annihilated and you won't have the time or patience to find a new design that suits your needs.\n\nTwo aspects of this game that I find very appealing are the factions and the campaigns. The factions are completely different and feel distinct. Each faction has a unique way of playing and focus, some have completely different structures and designs that opt for different playstyles. The mission campaigns are extremely well done, especially for an rts game. You have dialogues and cutscenes, some rpg elements as well and a decent storyline. Furthermore you will have several campaigns at your disposal to play.\n\nThe multiplayer is seviceable and works quite well. So are the graphics and soundtrack.

(As I did) Hell ,you have to make your own units as one of the factions which is great but might be really REALLY hard for beginners. Overall a decent RTS game!","December 31, 2014","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

To get "the full experience" the game has DRM that requires you to manually type in a 16 character Key, enter your name, address, and pc info, then write down and track some access code. Fun start. Presentation is kinda cruddy, though, it's an older game, so I don't expect the best graphics, but older games did a better job with what they had in my opinion (intro video to ED campaign looks fake, talking characters are just jabbering their mouths in animation). Pathfinding is non-existant - instead of the AI finding the best path in a mountainous valley, you have to manually click them through the path. My "hero" died after the first group of enemies after I earned a squad, then my team was massacared by the next. I'm sure I'm just "playing it wrong". I may give this game another chance in the future, but considering I don't play strategies much, I'm more likely to look for a better game in the first place.","September 3, 2013","false","2.9"," 9 of 42 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","9","42","0","2"

For me, the game doesn't crash, the exit button is just EVERYWHERE, if you see a message saying 'Are you sure you want to exit?' and you are just trying to leave a menu click no and use the back button.

Seriously, if you leave your guys unattended and the enemy attacks en masse, there's a really high chance your troops will try and pursue the farthest unit, ignoring everything else.\n- Only "Hold Fire" and "Pursue Enemy", no "Defensive" stance (if you've ever played Age of Empires 2, you know how much of a difference the 4 stances make when leaving troops unattended)\n- Order too many troops from point A to B and they'll happily move in a line (like in C&C Generals), easy pickings for entrenched enemies\n- Tech Tree is somewhat confusing.\n- Fog of War is a static on areas you haven't explored yet. Without shades/shadows like in C&C Generals or Age of Empires, enemies simply "pop up" from nowhere, since you don't know what is your exact visible field.\n\nThe game does have some really interesting points, though:\n- Factions are VERY different, from base building to unit training\n- You can edit your units and create variants with parts you research\n\nI won't recommend this game to anyone but RTS junkies","April 6","false","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While not as good as Civilizations and other elite RTS this game was well done.

The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack sets the mood.  The AI is challenging and realatively adaptive.  It is reminiscent of Warzone 2100 in that you can design units, albeit with some limitations.  My only complaint is that you can get into situations where cheats are almost nessecary.  On big plus for me is that there is no hard unit cap, only what you have built as far as structures.  If you want a fast paced RTS, then you will enjoy this.  Be warned though, if you want to avoid cheating, have a good idea of what your faction has available.\n","June 22, 2014","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say it's a really good game.\n\nThe one major thing I like about the game is the fact you can custimize your own troops with Armor, Weapon, Speed, Shield/Repair to help you fight against the race you are facing. There is tons of different unit combinations you can choose from for each race and it brings out the full RTS.\n\nThe Battles are fairly epic as well. If you are just trying it out, I recommand to play on easy difficulty. Medium/Hard is over the top for the AI's on some parts so you have a good challenge and epic battles.\n\nOverall the game is entirly just fun.

The UCS build a central hub and attach 4 other buildings to that structure their mines are built as a refinery which sends out termites that harvest metal and crystal.\n\nThe LC are a faction who ever soldier seems to be female, their vehicle style is entirely hover tanks, the fastest units in the game but not very armored. their buildings are built on top of one another as towers, while their mines are planted by the resource and mine directly from it, harvesting crystal & water.\n\nThe ED build by connecting each base to a central hub, this provides their bases with a decent defense, their vehicle style is tanks they are usually the slowest but have the best armor. The Ed mine by using mobile miners that just sit on the resources harvesting metal & water constantly.\n\nThe Aliens, are an entirely mobile and aggressive force moving from resource site to resource site absorbing a different resource depending upon what breed of alien is feeding, to allow them to grow in-strength and size. they don't build a base instead their morphidian units clone themselves after absorbing enough water, or metal or crystal. this also allows that unit to then evolve into a new breed of Alien soldier or vehicle equivalent.\n\noverall a good game although still slightly flawed but the only flaw with 2160 is they took out my underground bases from 2150..","October 25, 2011","true","67.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bought it when ported to  GNU/Linux. The game falls short of Starcraft (either 1 or 2) but is way better than other contemporary games, like Red Alert or Tiberian Sun. The graphics are good, but surely dated.\n\nThe game is somewhat complex (which means less fast than say, SC), it has 3 different resources, but every race uses only 2. You get a lot of micro management, like drivers can exit vehicles, soldiers level up, you can design vehicles (from limited options) and you have "hero" units (called agents). Base building is great, and varies a lot depending on what race you choose.\n\nThe races are kinda reminiscent of SC, but each has it's original story and characteristics (not widely original though). You got the soviet like Dinasty, with heavy units, the United Civilized States, more agile and fully robotised (some units kinda look like T-800), aliens that look half like a zerling, half like a bug from Starship troopers, and the all female Lunar Corporation, that looks like they come from a 1970's Sci-Fi film.\n\nBottom line: Get it if you liked RTS 10 years ago, but don't expect it to be up to today's RTS standards.","April 19","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It gets confusing, and you mostly have to learn by trial and error.  I imagine the campaign may help and serve as a sort of tutorial, but I never made it past the first mission.\n\nThe tech tree for each race is also fairly overwhelming at first glance, and you basically need to sit alone with the aliens for a match or two to slowly figure out how they work.  Again, trial and error.\n\nAlso, the AI is extremely hard.  Even on the easiest difficulty, my friend and I who are fairly new at the game have to go two against one, and often barely scrape by with wins.  Granted, we are new, but the easy AI should not be anywhere NEAR this hard.  It's fairly ludicrous.\n\nAlso, the factions don't appear to be very well balanced, at least in the vanilla (un modded) game.  Late game, aliens are invincible in most cases.\n\nAnd now to the pros!\n\nThe factions in this game are my favorite I have ever seen in an RTS, and I am not exaggerating.  They all feel COMPLETELY different, unlike most games where the factions are basically reskins of each other, build slightly differently, etc.. It is quite fun learning how to play each of them, and figuring out which one best suits your style.  The three non-alien races have their own different tech trees, and you can also construct custom units to make the perfect army.\n\nAnother thing: the battles are epic in every sense of the word.  Just in the last match I was playing, my friend and I were fighting with the computer over the middle ground of the map.  My buddy was the alien faction and moved in with large cruisers, while I supported him from the ground with anti-AA tanks (in this game, you can build custom units with different weapons equipped: in this case I outfitted tanks with anti-rocket flares, which protect your air from AA rockets).  The computer mobbed at us with endless anti-air units and large mechs, which my flare tanks mostly took care of, while both sides were being bombared with long-range artillery from each player.  Random other ground-on-ground tanks battled in the middle.  Lasers and flares and rockets all exploded overhead, and explosions were everyhwere.\n\nBattles like this happen all the time in Earth 2160.  It's extremely fascinating to watch, and the game gets incredibly intense in pitched fights.\n\nThis is probably the longest review on the game, so I will shorten it up and conclude with this:\n\nYes, it has flaws, some of which are fairly aggravating, but when the game shines it truly shines.  It's a grind to learn the factions at first, but if you have some friends to play with, you'll find few RTS titles with more intense battles or more interesting factions.  Worth five bucks, easy.","April 9, 2014","true","15.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It will provide some decent entertainment in the here and now but it will never be remembered for anything.\n\nEarth 2160 sets you in the future, corporations fight for control over the Solar System's dwindling resources as a new discovery rocks the power structure and sets the game's events in motion. As you start out you get to play as either a generic male dominated corporation or the curiously female dominated Mars corporation. They both, not surprisingly, turn out to be evil rather quickly into the campaign and you eventually get to play as the "good" faction, a generic robot corporation that really has no personality and eventually, a menacing alien horde.\n\nThe storyline really isn't anything to write home about, it's all pretty standard stuff, good guys works for the bad corporation but eventually rebels against them. The dialog and cut scenes are of a particularly low quality that will often make you cringe at just how awful it really is.\n\nWhere Earth 2160 gains a points is in the gameplay however, each faction has a unique set of units and a unique way of base construction, the Mars women for example focusing on individual strong point structures that can have additional modules added on top for research, defense or unit production whereas the alien horde have no real base construction instead focusing entirely on cloning and evolving their units.\n\nAnd as if this uniqueness to each faction wasn't enough each faction come with a complete research tree and the ability to customize each unit with various types of weapons, shields and engines allowing you to really make the faction your own. This customization does have it's flaws however, particularly where single-player is concerned as the AI does not adapt to your unit builds it is fairly trivial to make an exact counter to what the AI is building and just stomp them using rock-paper-scissors.\n\nThe slight RPG elements wherein you occasionally have a hero unit or two that can pick up items feels somewhat misplaced and rarely add anything beyond something to worry about as losing a hero often leads to a game over.\n\nEarth 2160 is not a bad game and it's a game you can get a lot of fun out of especially if you skip past the cut scenes. it is however not a game that will stand the test of time and as such it's not really something I'd recommend anyone buys any longer.","January 15, 2013","false","67.0"," 28 of 60 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","28","60","2","0"

Sadly that's not really possible.\nMaybe I'm overly nostalgic from what earth 2150 has and 2160 hasn't but even as a fan of RTS games this game feels very halfhearted.\n\n\n1) The Unit Editor\n\nThis is why the Earth series felt so unique: Build your own army, by picking a chassis, add weapons & shields and voila. Earth 2160 even added a few extra features. Now you can add engines, armour as well as gimmicks such as auto repair drones.\n\nIn the old Earth games, shields kept you alive deflecting plasma or electro canon fire. Now armour is way more important than shields as most weapons simply bypass shields. What sounds like a great feature simply turns the game into a game of rock, paper, sicssors, lizard, spock. Either your army wipes the floor with your enemies or they get crushed within seconds. Reload, build units using other armour and try again.\n\nOnce you get to the enemy base, the game really starts showing you the middle finger. Almost all weapons have reduced damage against buildings and if you don't want to get shreaded by basic defense turrets you'll need artillery units to slowly tear the base down bit by bit. Remember how much more fun it was to have your army charge in and blow up buildings? I do -.-\n\n\n2) No Mainbase / Veteran units\n\nRemember when you could do research between missions at your mainbase? Now you'll have to do all your research during missions. It helps that each research center you build no longer gives a timebonus, but instead allows simultanious research yet in the end you're just waiting for new chassis to unlock. Very boring.\n\nVeteran units you can take from mission to mission can no longer be picked by you, instead the game apparently randomly chooses units from previous missions as starting units. Granted, each unit now has a pilot who earns the XP and can be placed in another vehicle, but it's just not the same.\n\n\n3) Hero Units\n\nI loved "Fang" from the previous games, so I was curious how this one would play out. Fang was pretty OP, but not as OP as the new hero units in earth, that can take out armies without breaking a sweat. Not to mention the horrible dialogues and voice acting. No idea why the games doesn't pause during dialogues *or* why I can't control units during this blah blah *or* why everyone wants to talk during attacks.\n\n\n4) Bugs bugs bugs\n\nI was stuck on a mission because I've taken a different path to my objective, not triggering a dialogue. Still not as fun as  watching my units drive right next to the enemy before opening fire or simply not attacking at all despite "follow enemy" settings and being under heavy fire. Also why does my hero move in slow motion sometimes? No idea.","January 9, 2015","false","12.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Very painful to just set up your units who simply die in one second each.\n\nThis game suffers from the same problems games like Red Alert have. The AI knows what you field, and they know where you are, or how your base is defended, so they will constantly produce counter-units to your's and attack you where your base isn't defended.\n\nIs there even a plot to the campaign? Maybe there is, I admit I didn't play a lot into it.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Red Alert, Earth 2160 is a cost-efficient deal to try out. As for myself, I can't play these.","September 15, 2014","false","1.4"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","0"

It was just a regular skirmish mode with some limiltations and cutsceens. there are few mission where i controll a single unit and do stuffs.....but they are pretty boring as well.\nThe factions in games are also miss repressentive, i mean the ED stands for Euroasian dynasty, so you prolly excpecting Russian and/or Chinese together right? But no, appearently they are American.  The voice acting are horrible it would have been better if they just showed us texts, the voice actors are just reading the script without acting. They didn't even bother to fake an accent.  The units voice are also horriducily act.\nPlus there are a lot of bugs in the game that make you don't want to play, for example if you have a fighter engage in air to air combat against a group of gunships, the fighter would get stuck on the other gunship nearby when it strafe the target. The fighter can't be moved unless the gunship that it stuck to is destroyed. Tank  skim side way instead of turning.\nThen the unit itself are so unbalanced, one shot kills are common, i understand the devs trying to make us mix units and make different type of armor and custmoze my army, but it just too much when you have a gunship with sheild at full health with armor good against laser to be one shoted by anti air that fire missile.\nThe path finding in this game are also terrible, veichles all clogged up when in tight area which make them unable to move, this is especially irritating in the campaign because it has a lot of narrow pathway. infantry would dance around the edge of the clif instead of finding a way to go around it, have to manually guide them. They also tend to"stack" onto each other making it almost impossbile to select them indivusially.\nGraphic wise the game was ok for it's time, the explosion is pretty nice looking and the day/night cycle lighting are very good.\nThe animations are horrible most unit don't even have any other animation beside move stop when they die they just have a huge eplosion and dissappeared, when infantry die they fall like they are in a 3d max testing animation so unnatural,  ground control 2 was released in 2004 and it has far better animation than this game.\nBut since i got this game for a dollar i didn't losing anything, You can give the game a try but don't expect much.","August 12, 2014","false","8.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Earth 2160[en.wikipedia.org]was on sale for around 69p and I thought, "Hell, I loved Earth 2150 so why not buy this one?" so I did. I played it for a little while and what... an utter... disaster. First question: why is there infantry? The Earth series was all about strategy with VEHICLES never infantry and that's what made it unique. It's not all bad though, with a highly [yet unnecessary] complex camera controls, it gives a better feel for the combat with increased zoom. That's about it. The rest is just icing on the cake to make it look pretty.\n\nImmediately afterwards, I repurchased Earth 2150 (as it was a childhood game) and that saved me from certain destruction. Earth 2150 became my saving grace that day, a purchase I certainly don't regret. So anyway, you open up Earth 2160 and are immediately greeted with this incompetent and unsuiting theme music. Like, what? What the hell, seriously? You can listen to it here on YouTube.\n\nPros:\n» Graphic update, yet it still suits the old graphical feeling which is nice.\n» New units and structures.\n» With there being infantry, the commanders now have faces and unique voices.\n» Missions that make sense.\n» The Lunar Corporation are a women's faction?! WHAT?!\n» Multiplayer support with GameRanger.\n\nCons:\n» Music does not flow, at all.\n» My opinion: addition of infantry. The game lost its touch.\n» Still no fluent tutorial (or none at all.)\n» Weirdly expensive.\n» Seems as if this game was released before Earth 2150.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone. If anything, Earth 2150 will win your heart forever as it's an amazing RTS game. Earth 2160 is just not for me, I don't like it all too much. If you're looking for CQC battles, Earth 2160 seems like your type of game rather than vehicular and aerial combat.

To get "the full experience" the game has DRM that requires you to manually type in a 16 character Key, enter your name, address, and pc info, then write down and track some access code. Fun start. Presentation is kinda cruddy, though, it's an older game, so I don't expect the best graphics, but older games did a better job with what they had in my opinion (intro video to ED campaign looks fake, talking characters are just jabbering their mouths in animation). Pathfinding is non-existant - instead of the AI finding the best path in a mountainous valley, you have to manually click them through the path. My "hero" died after the first group of enemies after I earned a squad, then my team was massacared by the next. I'm sure I'm just "playing it wrong". I may give this game another chance in the future, but considering I don't play strategies much, I'm more likely to look for a better game in the first place.","September 3, 2013","false","2.9"," 9 of 42 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","9","42","0","2"
