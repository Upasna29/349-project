Even at a fiver you’re probably going to get better value buying a cheap bundle from Indie Gala than you are going to get from this game. Sure, there’s some fun to be had here but not enough to justify the price tag. It’s a game that you can pick up and have some fun for small play sessions. I have heard that the co-op is pretty solid so the free gift copy may allow you and a mate to have some fun together – I haven’t tried co-op – and there is some good action sequences.\n\nThe major problem is that in its current state there’s not enough content so you’ll get through what is there rather quickly and then be done with it. A problem that I came across and I don’t know why but my controller  would work fine except for the shoulder and the thumbstick buttons. Nothing I would do would make them responsive. I haven’t seen any complaints about this issue from others so it may only be me and my cursed Xbox One controller. It’s so disappointing that the Xbox One has now been out for over two years and still there are issues plaguing the controller and Windows computers. It’s mind boggling, really.\n\nSo no, sadly, I don’t recommend Zombie Hunter, Inc. I do hope that the developers respond to the criticism and questioning on the Steam forums sooner rather than later and show some interest in their own game rather than DOTA.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","false","1.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Inc\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nZombie Hunter Incorporated is looking for new recruits! To be able to join this corporation you’ll have to successfully pass a tough test! This challenge is rather simple really, going through one end of a tunnel to another, killing as many zombies as possible and coming out the other end in one piece!\n\nZombie Hunter. Inc is an action game. This current version has a tutorial, campaign and survival modes. The tutorial will teach you how to use the controls and play the game. In survival mode you have to stay alive as long as you can either by yourself or with a group of friends. The campaign mode is limited at this stage.\n\nWhen you start a campaign, you will be able to customise your character from his head to his clothing. Then you will start the level - make sure you open every car boot to collect additional ammunition or other goodies. You will fight several types of zombie and will have a fair number of weapons at your disposal.\n\nAs this game is early access, it is short but shows great potential. It froze several times when restarting and I feel it needs more content to be able to give it a score. In saying this, I must say I enjoyed what I have seen far.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good collection of weapons\n-	Fun character customization\n-	Fun Gameplay\n-	Good graphics\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Couple of freezes when restarting a game.\n\nZombie Hunter Inc is an early access game but shows great potential. More content is needed to post a score.\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The game may not be completed, although the developer has said the game will still be worked on (supposedly), but will take much longer, as in 2+ years.\n\nAlthough it is sad to hear about this, I cannot recommend the game to future players, not until more big updates get released.  I would say follow the game and put it on the backburner to see if anything gets done.  Otherwise save your money.\n\nI will be changing this review to a "do not recommened" for now.  I will leave my original positive review below for those that are curious about the game.\n\n\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially to those that like top-down shooters.\n\nReasoning:\n\nI may be a bit biased as I love top-down shooters, but I feel this game has a good foundation already in which everyine can enjoy regardless if youre a fan of the genre or not.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid and satisfying. Currently there are two modes, 1 campaign and a survival mode.  At the moment the campaign consists of getting from point A to B while fighting zombies.  Survival is based on fighting waves of enemies, while preventing the zombies getting past you, if they do you lose.\n\nWith that said the combat is very enjoyable combined with the mechanics in the game, make for a great experiece.  It is your standard zombie killing, but this game makes it fun.  You have a handful of guns to use which you have to purchase by earning money killing zombies.\nSo what separates this from other top-down shooters is you can headshot the enemies for more damage.\n\nAlso another which goes along with the headshot mehanic is the ability to only shoot in two directions, left and right.  There is no full 360 aiming or even 8 directional aiming for that matter.  And enemies too move in one direction left/right but can also move up and down.  Yea this may sound lame, it did to me at first, but when I played the game it felt very intuitive and any ill feelings toward this issue was dismissed quickly.\n\nthere is online  co-op multiplayer (yay!) and runs quite smoothly (for me).\n\nthe graphics, it has a charm to it.  Nothing like triple-A stuff, but very warming to look at.\n\nThere are customizable options such as changing your characters clothing and head.  Not a whole lot at the moment, but i can definitely see more being added.\n\nMy gripes so far is the weapons interface is a little bit cluncky.  Not much content at the moment either in terms of modes and campaigns.\nOne other issue which might turn off some is if you read the early access statement on this page.  The development time is estimated at 2 years, this is a long time.  So if you are patient and dont have a good interest to play this game I would wait.\n\nOverall I can see a lot of potential in Zombie hunter inc.  It is very early access, but the foundation is there, so I can only see this game going up as time goes on.  Definitely pick this game up!  It is my nee go-to top down zombie shooter that I will definitely enjoy playing as development goes on.\n\nLastly I would like to add a note about the developer.  They are super nice people and take feedback very well.  I had an issue with this game and the dev spent an hour with me trying to solve my problem, after the issue was fixed we ended playing a couple rounds of survival online.  Seriously, I dont know any other game where you get this kind of awesome attention and service!","January 20","false","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the brand new Indie/Action game Zombie Hunter, Inc. Zombie Hunter, Inc. was released into Steam's Early Access on January 18th, 2016 by Developer/Publisher Maya Gameworks.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using keys provided by the Developer/Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://youtu.be/igWlr_ESN3M\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat fun, great Developer. Play with friends for best experience (so far). 3/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nHonestly, when I first started reviewing this game, it was impossible. Literally. It was crashing, constantly, for all three of us who were trying to play the Co-op. While live on Twitch. Then, things got better....quickly. Why? The developer has a fantastic PR guy who watched us play, reported the bugs ASAP to the Developer, and we were receiving updates MID SESSION for the game we were playing. You cannot get more responsive than that. It is the definition of responsive. For our patience and determination, we were rewarded with a pretty fun little experience.The game boils down to basically you and your friends mowing down waves of enemies before they reach the other side of the screen. You can create your layout before you get started and purchase weapons/items to upgrade your offensive capabilities during the game. It's not deep or complex, but it's a hoot with friends. This is the main appeal of the game to me, so far. There is a Solo Campaign as well, which seems more difficult. While the Solo Campaign appears to be a lot of fun, it has a much steeper difficulty curve and I can't help but feel it would be made better by being able to plow through it with friends as well. The best news, is that this is Early Access and has an very, very receptive, active and friendly Developer. I can indeed recommend at least following this game along, as it's already quite a bit of fun with friends, even in it's very early state. 3/5\n\nHappy Gaming!","January 31","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/387130/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","44 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nZombie hunting seems to be all the rage and has been for quite a few years. You’ve got your first person zombie shooters, budget mobile games that rely on well-known TV shows for players, and now there’s a top down, survival style shoot ‘em up from Maya Gameworks that throws you head first into the action.\n\nGimme The Gist\nZombie Hunter, Inc. follows a very basic concept. Zombies will run at you and you have to kill them. However, there is a slight twist that provides more of a challenge. You can only fire horizontally in the direction you are facing by pressing the mouse button.\n\nZombies will come at you from the left or right, sometimes even from above or below you. You need to move your character using ‘WASD’ so your weapon’s crosshair is lined up with whichever baddy you want to fire at.\n\nChanging direction is as simple as pressing the ‘F’ key by default. However I feel that firing entirely on a horizontal level lacks depth and entertainment. Seeing as you are already firing by using the mouse, it makes more sense to aim your crosshair with the mouse as well.\n\nEnemies pack a mean punch and can very quickly overwhelm you, leaving you desperate for a health pack, or utterly decimating you to the point you have to restart or exit.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, I feel Maya Gameworks have put together a good contrast of zombies. There are the regular walking dead which slowly approach, runners that charge at a faster speed, larger zombies that absorb a lot of your hard-earned ammunition and some zombies that accurately aim at you and spit poison underneath your feet.\n\nThe range of enemies is great and it certainly adds to the difficulty of the game but some might find the masses of zombies a little bit too overpowering. Especially when you try out the first level of the campaign.\n\nAside from the campaign there is also a survival mode where you (and a friend if you wish) take on hordes of zombies whilst protecting survivors and upgrading your gear with cash earned from your kills. The fact you can play co-operatively brings about a great social aspect that is sorely desired among gamers.\n\nAesthetic Charm\nThe character and enemy graphics are drawn quite nicely and the animations are awesomely put together. Voice acting isn’t too bad so thankfully you don’t have to cringe whilst listening to the directives being barked at you.\n\nBeing able to customise the look of your character also brings about a uniqueness to take pleasure in when running around blasting through the undead.\n\nWeaponry is varied and each piece of equipment at your disposal feels satisfying to fire. Shotguns will knock you back with recoil, AK47s will rip through enemies with ease and pistols give accurate aiming for headshots.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nZombie Hunter, Inc. is still in early-access on Steam so there are going to be a few hiccups. Sometimes you can end up getting caught on walls and all you can do is watch your health dwindle away until you are dead. Other times you could have the game crash on you, forcing you to restart the whole program. But being an indie developed game, there is a surprising amount of promise in Zombie Hunter, Inc.\n\nAt the moment I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who wants a complete game, ready to play. But do keep an eye on it and see what people are saying. There’ll come a time when the bugs have been smoothed out, gameplay made a bit more fair and perhaps even more added it to it.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","January 31","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
