It's a brilliant game with an exceptional story.  It reminds me of the Adventure games of yore where it is best to take notes, make maps, draw diagrams and exam everything.  I took my time and I worked on a section at a time trying to complete it before moving on.  The puzzles can be challenging, but your note taking efforts will greatly help.  This also comes in mighty helpful when it is necessary to go back into an area.  These efforts will help to complete the game as it should be completed and the rewards for doing so are three-fold.  The story is in-depth with a lot of substance.  It's also a teaching experience.  I finished with tears in my eyes, a filled heart and a mind enveloped in wonderment.

Gotta say: mind blowing. Without trying to spoil anything, let's just say the game puts you on somebody's shoes living a terrifying experience, one impossible to picture, unless it actually happens in your life at some point (hope not). It's an indie game delivering completely different experiences, the ones you don't find in most AAA games.

Simply put, it's boring. And when it's not boring, it's just frustrating, two qualities that will ruin a game every time. Why do I play games? For fun. This game misses that mark by a longshot. The voice acting is good. There is not much else I can say that is positive.\n\nDespite the use of Unreal Engine, the rendering is cartoonish, stylized and outlined as if it were hand drawn. I understand if this was a creative decision, but it's a shameful waste of Unreal Engine's potential. Texture resolution is extremely low, even on max settings. Regardless of this, performance is not great, indicating shoddy construction and poor use of the engine's resources.\n\nIt is never clear what can be interacted with and what can't be, and the interact mechanic often doesn't work, so you end up clicking on something multiple times before discovering if it's static or not. Solutions to puzzles are arbitrary, counter-intuitive and make no contextual sense, so that it becomes a random guessing game with a lot of back and forth expirementing. It has that old-school Hidden Object Game feel to it, where you end up trying every possible combination with everything in your inventory. Except you don't have an inventory. You can only carry one item at a time, while other items you have collected are stored in a seperate location that requires a loading screen upon entry and exit. Why they thought it was a good idea to exchange an inventory for a stash room that requires a double loading screen for the retrieval of each individual item, I do not know. But tedious is an understatement.\n\nIf the point of the game was to get you to feel the frustration of memory loss and dementia, then it succeeds. It could have more appropriately expressed itself with logic and memory puzzles. The mind is a use-it-or-lose-it faculty, so a game designed to exercise it, while addressing the issue in the story, may have been the admirable goal of the developers. They over-reached, and fell miserably short.\n\nWorst of all, achievements that I earned did not unlock for me. That was the final straw that prompted me to write my first ever Not Recommended review. For the price, there are many more far superior games to choose from.","April 3, 2015","false","3.8"," 186 of 277 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","186","277","9","10"

But when you did, you saw none of what this person described? That's Ether One.\n\nThis is going to be a spoiler free review, largely because there isn't much to spoil so it is easy to avoid.\n\nWhen you start the game, there is a great deal of promise. Presentation is good and the pacing is decent. Voice actors are good. The art-style is interesting and the environments well designed.\n\nBut it doesn't take long before you find yourself in a game where you find yourself casually walking through the clearly marked core of the story but completely unaware of side-quests which make up the bulk of the content. When you start to understand that mundane objects have a larger significance you turn into a kleptomaniac, expecting to encounter some truely ingenius puzzles which remind you of games like Resident Evil or Myst, but suddenly discover that the developers have hidden the puzzles so well that half the time you're walking past them or completely clueless about where to start. So you start poking everything randomly to see if anything happens. Not to mention that much of what you've been collecting doesn't actually have a use at all. It's like buying one of those Lego kits and then discovering you have loads of bricks left over and actually feeling like somebody intended to use them for something but never did.\n\nEther One pitches itself as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. What you get is a short-story which starts off being subtle, then gets bored and screams all its secrets at you part way through the story resulting in an anticlimactic and utterly unsatisfying ending which you unfortunately saw coming if you were paying any attention to the many blatent clues peppered throughout the game. I get the impression that the developers had all these ideas in their heads but didn't really understand how to deliver them. So to ensure players didn't miss the point they painted the 'clues' in neon pink, wrote them in capitals and also attached sirens and bells to make sure you saw them.\n\nFor a game intended to convey how confusing dimentia is for a sufferer of the condition, the developers have clearly gotten too close to their source material. Because the game itself ended up being as incoherant and haphazard as the memories of a typical dimentia patient. I actually worry that they intended to make the game like this on purpose and completely forgot that it was still meant to be about having fun.\n\nI really cannot recommend that anyone hands over money for something like this. If you want to have a game like this I'd actually recommend Master Reboot.","September 4, 2015","false","10.1"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","66","86","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/265950/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","In this game, you play as a professional puzzle solver, who has travelled to a curious village to help a bunch of helpless villagers who have all conveniently lost the fourth slider wheel from their combination safes, broken all of their projectors, and rearranged their homes and workplaces into Myst-like puzzles. The game does a good job of capturing that classic Myst feeling of wandering around an expansive puzzle-filled area for 20 minutes, flipping a lever to test it out, flipping it back after wondering whether or not you were actually supposed to flip it yet or not, and then exploring for 20 more minutes until everything finally starts to come together.\n\nThe only problem is the strange inventory system, in which instead of having a typical inventory system, you can only carry one item at a time, and have to warp back to your "Case" (which acts as a hub between the different maps) and place items on the various shelves in the main room to store them. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds since the transition between the map and the case is mostly seamless and the shelves are right beside where you arrive in the Case, but it's also somewhat glitchy - at one point early on, one of the safe wheels found in the Case itself vanished after I put it on a shelf and went back to the map, and it never came back. It was presumably a spare wheel since I was able to fully complete the game without it, but if it were to happen to someone else to a more important item it could be game-breaking. But the inventory system also lends towards the "fun confusion" factor of the game, because since a somewhat large amount of items can be picked up and stored in the game you're never as sure whether you need to use a particular item as you would be in a game where you only had three items in your inventory. This was particularly relevant in my case, since on two separate occasions the instructor gave me a friendly reminder that I could store items after picking up an item, and in both cases, that item was a bottle of alchohol. This led me to believe that the bottles might end up somehow being important, and it wasn't until the credits began to roll that I realized that there was no great alcohol puzzle, and I didn't actually need a shelf full of 30 bottles of the village's finest cider for anything other than a good time.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzle games, especially exploration-based ones, this is a pretty easy recommendation. The story is great, and the puzzles are challenging. It's worth noting that while almost all of the real puzzles are optional and completing them only fleshes out the backstory, you won't really get a good experience if you just wander around collecting the ribbons that are the only thing completely necessary to finish the game, but if you're looking for a reasonably challenging puzzle game then this is a great choice.","July 12, 2015","true","19.3"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","45","54","15","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/265950/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","It's not easy to properly comprehend the effect debilitating diseases have on people until you experience their effect yourself. It's easy to see them as terrible but improbable occurrences, something that clearly happens but is impossible to envision yourself suffering from. And yet, dementia scares the hell out of me. The idea that there's this invisible force that has no cure, no prevention, that will almost certainly affect you at some point in your life and only becomes more likely the longer you live somehow feels so much more real to me than cancer, or ebola, or any other life threatening disease that I could come in contact with.\n\nPerhaps that's due partly to how much dementia affects not only yourself, but the people around you. Watching your grandparents forget you along with themselves is a cold shock to reality that puts things into startling focus the way statistics and symptom lists never could. And it's the inescapable nature of something you can't predict or counteract that makes it difficult to just push the thought out of your mind that one day you might wake up and have forgotten who you are.\n\nEther One isn't really about a hypothetical cure for dementia, or the life of someone finding slowly losing themselves to it. To me at least, it's about giving that human perspective to something in all likelihood we will all go through. Inhabiting the memories of someone undergoing experimental treatment, you travel through their life learning the events that shaped them and then watching them fall away as the disease takes hold and they struggle to hang onto even the moments most important to them.\n\nIt's depressing but not in a way that makes you sad, so much as it causes you to feel empathetic as you watch a character you've become emotionally invested with have everything taken away from them. Reading through personal letters, town events, job descriptions, and fidgeting with character belongings, you get to know these characters to even their most mundane and ordinary level. Life is often unfair, but Ether One captures the sense of uncontrollable tragedy and desperate attempts at resolution that's almost painful to see because it's so understandable.\n\nEther One has built a world so close to our own, but given it a purpose and a life that makes every scrap of paper and ordinary item feel meaningful. I wanted to know more about these characters, to pry into their emotions and personal thoughts to try and understand what they were going through, and Ether One allows you to do this in a way that doesn't feel intrusive or emotionally manipulative. You're trying to help your character remember who they are; trying to put things back together in a desperate hope to save their memories, and prove the procedure a success so nobody will have to go through something so destructive\n\nEther One's only real problem is that it tries harder than it probably needs to to be a more traditional game than first-person exploration games are often considered, and ends up making it incredibly hard to see most of its content that it hides behind obtuse puzzles and logic that's often difficult to understand. There are a lot of objects you can interact with, but just enough which you can't that it's often incredibly difficult to know which items are for solving puzzles and which have been included just as a means of world building. My solution to this was to attempt to scavenge everything I could pick up, but that makes for an extremely cluttered and impractical playstyle that still often left me clueless when it came to solving an actual puzzle.\n\nI say puzzle, but the projectors you need to reassemble in Ether One were often more comprehension barriers than logical conundrums. I was at such a loss as to know even where to start that even with the answer typically staring me in the face it was near impossible for me to solve anything without the help of a guide. In a lot of ways it feels very much like the sort of obtuse puzzles found in a lot of old adventure games, an I imagine people missing those games will feel right at home, but in my case I was more frustrated at trying to parse an endless stream of relevant and irrelevant information than I was satisfied by actually managing to solve one.\n\nAnd it's a shame because it makes it extremely easy to miss huge swaths of content for those less inclined to sit and ponder solutions or look them up online, content which gave a larger context to the story that I feel is important anyone playing the game experience. Were it any other game I'd have likely given up and just skipped to the end, but Ether One deserves more than that. I felt like I owed it to the game to see all it had to show me, no matter how trivial it might be because even meaningless documents and items could eventually serve some significance.\n\nEther One certainly hasn't dissolved my fears of dementia, but it definitely helped show me that I could be doing more for those affected by it instead of turning away because I'd rather not deal with the emotional trauma of someone you have to reintroduce yourself to every meeting. What that might be I'm not entirely sure of yet, but I feel Ether One is important for even daring bring these ideas up, and I hope they won't be lost on others who play it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 27, 2015","true","10.4"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","39","46","0","0"

There are two paths you can choose, one where you casually experience the story and another where you test your own mind by solving the many optional puzzles sprinkled throughout the game.\n\nPuzzles became challenging (at least for me) which I loved. The pacing of the story is perfect and I never felt rushed through the experience. I was able to go at my own pace and fully enjoy the Bioshock meets Half Life art style and the triple A quality voice acting.

But before you do play it, just some words of advice for you to get the most out of this game.  You can complete this game just by finding these ribbons throughout the game, which kind of trivializes the entire experiences.  There are optional puzzles in this game and they provide a lot of the story along with notes that you find throughout the world and both make the world feel as though it’s living and breathing.  I encourage you if you want to truly fully experience this game, complete the side puzzles and read the little bits of exposition, and if you get stuck do not hesitate to look up a guide, I repeat DO NOT HESITATE TO LOOK UP A GUIDE to 100% this game.  You get so much more out of the story, and trust me the story is amazing, it may seem nebulous at the beginning, but once you have all the info you can scrap from the world it all comes together in a beautiful narrative, that is really, really worth the time and effort.  Also if you do 100% this game there is a second ending, and it adds to story just that much more and really makes you understand everything.  Sometimes the puzzles while they are really interesting are just really obtuse, and don’t feel bad if you don’t get it, just try it out for yourself, and if you aren’t figuring it out, use a guide.\n\nAlso one big flaw with this game, there are some bugs in it, not like game crashes or graphical bugs, but things that won’t let you progress and you can’t seem to figure out why, like you just needed to re flip a lever to progress.  For this, again, LOOK UP A GUIDE, a video guide may help a bit more here, but most of the time, you won’t be able to realize the bug, but once you see how things were really supposed to go you’ll be able to see what went wrong and how to fix it in game no problem.\n\nAll that said, if you like, say, old point and clicks, or games with really deep stories, than this game is a must, but even if you don’t like those kind of games but are still interested, than still try out this game, it may be an awesome experience for you.  Really this game is amazing narratively, it's just a matter getting past the sometimes annoying quirks/bugs and getting past the sometimes fairly obtuse puzzles to enjoy the narrative fully.\n\nTL;DR: This game is awesome, but take the time to 100% it, and DON’T BE AFRIAD TO LOOK UP A GUIDE, can’t stress this enough, but if you put in the time and effort the game will give back like no other.\n\nEDIT: The Ether One Redux is included if you buy this game, which may fix some bugs and definitely will make the game run much better, as it now runs on a newer version of Unity than previously in the game.  Now I can't confirm if this will fix the bugs in it since I have not played through the redux version.","July 23, 2015","true","21.2"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

The overarching concept is fascinating, the presentation is very slick, and the voice acting is superb. Unfortunately, some of the puzzles are mind-bogglingly counter-intuitive, and remind me a lot of some of the worst puzzles in old point-and-click games which would have you tearing your hair out randomly clicking on every item in sight and mixing every item in your inventory with every other item. Progression through Ether One occasionally feels very much like this, which is enough to make it a truly maddening experience at times. Furthermore, and possibly most importantly, the story becomes frighteningly dull towards the latter half of the game. Whilst - again - the overarching story remains interesting, teasing apart the tiny little mundane fragments of the lives of Jean and her friends and family in Pinwheel and the surrounding areas is just painfully boring. This is a game that could have been brilliant, but just ends up being a frustrating and dull waste of a great idea.","October 7, 2014","false","4.4"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","46","60","0","0"

Everything about it, from the great voice acting, to the nuanced story-telling, to the stunning world building. The feeling I had upon completion of this game was not unlike finishing a beloved novel. Once I am done I enter a period of post story depression, wherein I am sad the world I had been living in is now over. That is exactly how I felt after completing EO. I wish I could take my memory away of this game and play it again for the first time so that I could have the same feelings of awe and wonderment. The feelings I had were not unlike playing/completing the amazing games I played as a youth.\n\nTo point, I highly recommend this game to ANY player. With one caveat. Know that the game you're about to play has a set pace, is not an action game, requires remembering details and difficult puzzle solving, and maybe 30% of the incredible story telling comes from notes/newspapers/items/ect. you must find YOURSELF in the world of the game. This game requires and deserves your time and attention. Also, like a good book, the story and answers to questions are not all handed to you in a gift wrapped box at the end. You, like the developers trained you throughout the game, must use the pieces to solve the puzzle that is EO. If any of this sounds like the worst way to play a game, then wait until you do feel like something thought provoking. Like many pieces of great art/entertainment you need to be in the right mood. If I had just finished playing something like Call of Duty and then tried to play this game, I might not have enjoyed it as much. So wait for yourself to be in the mood for this game, that way you give yourself the best opportunity to enjoy it.\n\nPros\n+Voice acting(waaaay above average)\n+Graphics (it has a style, and does it well)\n+World Building (I don't know if the town the game is set in exists, but god did it feel like a real place with a real history)\n+Story-Telling (There is a deliberate pace to the story-telling, and its executed superbly)\n+Game Play (Again it requires reading and collecting, both things I already do in any game that allows me. But it is an adventure exploration game, so there is a lot of reading/collecting)\n+Ending (without revealing too much, there are two endings. Both are great, but the second one, which I stumbled on accidently, left me without words and nearly in tears)\n+Puzzle-Solving (to say the puzzles in EO are difficult is an understatement. I had to consult a guide on a number of them. Luckily I found a guide on the steam forums that gave three hints before giving the solution so I felt like I was cheating less)\n\nCons\n+ bugs (this game has them, every game has them. Luckily the ones I encountered in no way effected my gameplay)\n+ length (I wish it were longer. I don't feel cheated in any way, but like all good things, I just wanted more)\\n\nBottom line - You should play this game, just play it when you’re in the mood for it.\n","February 22, 2015","true","9.7"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

BUT you can completely ignore them (just find the ribbons) if you just want to finish the game and unlock one of the endings.\n\n- Story: Confusing until you get to the end, which means you're just floundering for hours in a world that doesn't really make sense. For me, the pay-off didn't offset the frustration I felt while playing this game (or I wouldn't be writing this lengthy review).\n\n--- "GAMEPLAY" ---\n\nThe "gameplay" in Ether One is an absolute game-design abomination, breaking many obvious game-design principles. As you've probably seen from many other reviews, the majority of the game mechanics is you walking around (similar to Gone Home) solving puzzles. This isn't bad by itself (and I really enjoyed Gone Home); it's just executed very poorly in Ether One.\n\nThe main complaint everyone has is the puzzles are EXTREMELY random and frustrating. As an example, one of the first puzzles you encounter has you free-form type out the answer. By free-form I mean you can type whatever you want, selecting letter or number character-by-character with zero guidance whether you're on the right path or not. TERRIBLE GAME DESIGN MECHANIC!!!!!!!! I have never, ever seen that in any other modern game. Maybe in games from the 80s, but modern game designers should know better. Now here's the kicker, you can't use your keyboard! Let me say that again: you have to TYPE the answer, on a COMPUTER, and you CAN'T USE THE KEYBOARD. WHAT. THE. F!!! Yes, you have to press up/down dozens or hundreds of times to sequentially type out a single word. If this game mechanic was submitted in a game design school, the teacher would probably smack this student up-side the head. Requiring the player to type out free-form answers to puzzles is *already* a Game Design 101 atrocity, but not being able to use a keyboard is idiocy to the absolute MAXIMUM. This kind of typing-puzzle mechanic occurs many times throughout the game and infuriated me every time I saw it.\n\nContinuing on with this same puzzle, not only do you have to free-form type the answer by pressing up/down repeatedly, but there are not one, but TWO notes a few feet away saying that this item is a "shoe" or whatever (avoiding spoilers). I spent what seemed like ages trying variations on "shoe" or "dancing shoe" with capitalizations etc to no avail. Finally I looked it up and (minor spoiler) you have to find the item somewhere else, pick it up, and HOLD the inspect button to find out its true name. That should tell you right there how unforgiving this game really is, with nearby notes meant to confuse and lead you astray. The amount of rage I felt for having wasted so much time for following the clearly designed notes left nearby was indescribable.\n\nThis puzzle was when I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that I was in for a VERY frustrating experience. Another early puzzle has you use a wire in a place where it doesn't seem like the wire should fit at all, since the two wires are *completely* different. GRRRRRR!!! Another section leads you to a locker room where the combination is already in place. You can open/close the lockers freely but (and I'm hoping this is a bug) as soon as you change the combination by 1 number, and change it back, the combination no longer works. WHAT THE !??!??!?!?!?!?!?!\n\nI decided to press on with the game instead of just quitting, purely because I didn't want to waste the money I paid. That being said, a few hours later I found out that you don't really need to solve the puzzles (just find the ribbons). So I ignored all the puzzles for the rest of the game, hunting for the ribbons hoping to get to the end as soon as possible.\n\n--- CONTROLS ---\n\nWhat makes all these puzzles incredibly insanely frustrating is that the game offers zero clue on what you can interact with and what you can't. There are no colored outlines on interactive items, no clues as to when an item needs to be inspected or used, no sounds, absolutely nothing at all. I'm not looking for an easy-mode, but the game is a flat world that expects you to basically just spam your mouse buttons for hours on end because the graphics do not do an adequate job of showing what items can be used. Even worse is that there are hundreds of items that you can pick up but are never used. Having unimportant items isn't bad by itself; but when 99% of them are useless, it makes puzzle solving even more frustrating. This is worsened again by the fact that you can only hold one item at a time. Frustrating beyond belief.\n\nThe controls themselves are another section where the game designer's drunkenness shows true. The controls clearly list that there are two buttons that basically do the same thing (use an item). I went into the controls area dozens of times not understanding what the heck I was doing wrong because some buttons did nothing. Little did I know that more than halfway into the game you find something and then understand why some of the buttons do nothing. Very poor game design. The controls section should either not have those buttons until after you find "X" or have a note that says "Some actions may not be available until later".\n\n--- STORY ---\n\nThe main problem with the story is that you can't appreciate the story (and thus the entire reason for playing the game) until AFTER you finish the game. You are 100% lost and confused and wondering what in the heck is happening for 6-10 hours, and then the game explains it at the end. *** BUT *** that means you spend 6-10 hours in complete and utter frustration. The problem is a huge one: THAT ISN'T FUN!!! If it was a movie or a YouTube video, fine. But a game is supposed to be fun while you're playing it, or at the very least, avoid frustration. Look at Gone Home for an example of how exploration-focused gaming is done right. Things actually make sense and the story makes you want to keep playing.\n\nThe other problem is that the game, before you understand what is happening, is completely and utterly just plain old BOOOOORING. I had to stop playing many times simply because I was falling ASLEEP! No, I'm not kidding. This game literally put me to sleep with its boredom on numerous occasions.\n\nLastly, the way the game handles the ending is yet another game-design abomination. Here's a quote from the official PC Gamer review: "The ending sits in contrast to a game of impressive freedom. In the final half-hour, Ether One forgets its free-form puzzling. It worries that you've missed the story teased at on your journey and decides to rectify that. It sits you down, bids you be quiet, and lectures on the details in a fit of exposition to rival Bioshock Infinite. It's unnecessary; a blunt-force ending to a game which should have left us guessing." Yes that's right: the last half-hour of the game forces you to literally just sit and watch. Why not save yourself the money and just watch a YouTube video then?\n\n--- CONCLUSION ---\n\nA) Make sure you're ok with the frustrating puzzles (or will just hunt for the ribbons) and before buying this game.\n\nB) If you're ok with the preceding point, make absolutely sure you buy this on sale please. Don't get it at full price.\n\nC) I will admit that the story about dementia is somewhat of a tear-jerker and actually does make you think. That is by far the only positive redeeming quality the game has, in that it brings more attention to mental health issues.\n\nThis game is overly difficult to the point of frustration. Difficulty isn't bad by itself, but how it is handled. Dark Souls is incredibly difficult, but when you beat a boss, you feel a sense of accomplishment. This game is difficult, but when I finished a puzzle, I only marveled at how poorly designed the puzzle solution was and became even MORE frustrated.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. To the developer, PLEASE if you make another game, make it less frustrating. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from a frustrating experience.","May 16, 2015","false","15.3"," 70 of 113 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","70","113","7","4"

I heard so many great things about the story, but I never got far enough to know if it's really that good or not. The controls are terrible, the gameplay is obtuse, and the whole thing seems designed to induce motion sickness.\n\nThe motion sickness was what really got me (and I see from other reviews that I'm not the only one). I play first person 3d games all the time and I never have a problem, but in Ether One I never last more than 15 minutes or so before I have to turn it off (and I get a headache and upset stomach for a long time afterwards). I suspect the main cause of this is the movement of your character. You can reduce the head bob, but you can't turn it off. More importantly, you walk *excruciatingly* slow (feels like walking underwater wearing a heavy suit), while the mouse sentivity for looking around is ridiculously high. They don't match, and the dissonance causes motion sickness. Now, you can reduce the mouse sensitivity, but in order for it to match the movement speed, you have to turn it all the way down, and then you're not only walking through water, you're also drugged and unable to move your head around.\n\nI persisted long enough to solve a couple of puzzles, but the game really gives you no guidance whatsoever on what to do, and everything is counter-intuitive. The level design is quite poor. For example, there are several points where there is a lengthy audio clip playing, but you have to stand still to hear it all, and there's literally nothing to do while you listen. No reason to stand there. So you either keep walking and miss some of the background, or you just stand there until the audio finishes feeling bored and foolish. Furthermore, for some reason you're only allowed to carry one item at a time, yet you can store as many items as you want on a shelf which is instantly accessible from any point in the game. Why make the player jump back and forth? Either you only want us to have one item (and there should be a reason for that), or you want us to have access to many items, in which case we should simply be given an inventory.\n\nIt may be true that the story is extraordinary, but it's not worth the slog to actually experience it. I think there is potential here, but the problems are too severe for the game to be playable.","January 11, 2015","false","2.2"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","35","53","0","0"

The gameplay seems to consist of inspecting every little nook and cranny of the world, hoping that you've picked up or looked at the right things so you'll be able to solve future puzzles. The "puzzles" seem to consist of remembering stuff you've picked up and figuring out that you need to use it on something or put it somewhere. Having to remember things doesn't make for very fun gameplay or puzzle solving. Having to explore every stupid item and look in every stupid, boring drawer in an office or mining facility isn't very fun. Compare this to something like the Zero Escape series where you aren't having to manually wander around and just have to look at still scenes and it's clear what you can and can't interact with. I don't feel that the freedom of moving about in first person contributes much to the fun of this game; if anything it detracts from it.\n\nThe gameplay is definitely "exploration oriented" but I don't personally find that very fun. Wandering around and sometimes getting lost in a bleak, boring mining facility while the occassional weird ambient sound plays is just annoying and I can think of many things I could be doing that are more entertaining. There were times where I was just wandering around trying to figure out how to get back to a place I wanted to go to and not being able to do it because there are so many branching paths in the levels. I'm fine if puzzles are self-contained, where all the elements for solving a particular problem are in the same, clearly delineated area, but this game doesn't do that so something on one far end of a level might need to be used with something on the other side of the map.\n\nAnd finally, the worst part for me, is that this game gave me motion sickness. I've played other first person games without this problem, but I had a problem with this game. I'm sure I'm not alone.\n\nIf you want a fun puzzle game, this isn't that. I'm not sure what's fun about it other than a compulsive desire to advance the story (I'd rather read a book if I wanted that, considering the gameplay isn't fun for me).","October 28, 2014","false","2.2"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","28","41","0","3"

That may not be what you want from a video game, and if you're in the latter category it's probably not going to be your thing. However, if you're open to it, there's a very unique experience here that has the ability to tug at the heart strings of even the most cynical, hardened gamer. Ether One shares a lot aspects with games such as Gone Home and The Stanley Parable - that is those games which present a narrative primarily through exploration. Although similar, it has a much stronger puzzle element than most of it's peers which is refreshing and really brings it into its own. So word of warning - If you're one of those people who doesn't get the exploratory narrative genre (sometimes referred to as walking simulators) you're probably not going to find much to like here.\n\nEther One revolves around an experimental treatment for dementia in which a volunteer (dubbed a Restorer) enters the mind of the patient. You play as one such volunteer, who apart from being a Restorer is a somewhat non-descript character. The restoration process is presented  through a combination of exploration and puzzle solving inside the patients memories alongside a hub known as "The Case", which is accessible instantly at any time with a single button press. Most puzzles involve a form of  "filling in the blanks", which entails restoring the missing parts of memories into a comprehensible whole. Everything needed to solve the puzzles is strewn somewhere in the patients memories, usually in the form of a collectible item. These items are sometimes hidden, sometimes  in plain sight, and they don't always have an immediate use. To make things slightly more complicated a Restorer can only hold 1 item at any time. The game provides a mechanism for this by allowing you to store items at "The Case" for retrieval when required, and you'll be wanting to stash anything that seems unusual right from from the very beginning.\n\nThe memories explored are meticulously crafted, although usually jumbled and sometimes nonsensical due to the patients dementia, and they weave a thought-provoking story that will keep you guessing until the credits roll. Graphically speaking, Ether One has a hand painted feel similar to Dishonored, although it is a more simplistic art style that fits the dream-like qualities of the patients memories. The music is excellent (particularly the main theme) and the voice acting presented throughout is extremely well done.\n\nFor fans of narrative exploration this is a must play. Anyone who enjoys puzzle solving should get a kick out of it too.\n\nHighly recommended.","July 11, 2014","true","12.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The large majority of the puzzles are solved by performing totally random actions. Other reviewers has used the term  'counterintuitive', which sounds like you need to think outside of the box here. This is not the case, most puzzles are just random, which can work in small games where you have a screen or two and just few items in the inventory. Here the map is huge and having to go back and for continously and interact with everything with no clue of what you are looking for or trying to achieve is exhausting and frustrating. In my case I also had a couple of bugs, which meant I had to lose +2hours of game to back to an earlier save to be able to proceed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chandrila/recommended/265950/","chandrila","chandrila","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chandrila/","91 products in account","This game is a borderline one, but ultimately I have to come down on the side of not recommending it.\n\nTackling something sensitive and complex like Alzheimer's is ambitious, but sadly I find that the gameplay itself is confused, disjointed and frustrating and the plot doesn't make a lot of sense.  Perhaps the developer was trying to elicit those feelings to make the player experience something akin to an Alzheimer's sufferer (NB: I'm not trying to be sarcastic; I genuinely can't tell if that was their intention or not).\n\n[SPOILERS FOLLOW]\n\nYou are a "restorer", working to restore the memories of a patient suffering from Alzheimers by reliving important events from their life in a deserted representation of a small mining town called Pinwheel.\n\nThe gameplay consists of wandering around, looking for red ribbons to collect and store in "The Case".  The Case is a safe-haven that you retreat to when you're not delving into the patient's memories and it contains various items of importance to you.  It should therefore come as no surprise whatsoever that the patient is actually you, since these items crop up in the patient's memories almost immediately.  Despite having guessed that this was the case very early on, it didn't help me to make much sense of the plot.\n\nOnce you have collected 10 of these ribbons, you return to The Case to play a music-box, which makes a door appear.  You walk through the door, slow to a crawl and point a camera at anything that is slightly colourful and take a photo of it.  This causes the scene to change subtly, then once you've photographed enough things, you're catapulted back to The Case (or something random happens) and then you move to a new area and repeat the process.  At some point you pick up a lantern that has two purposes - one; to restore/rewind some broken elements of scenery (the number of times that you are required to do this can be counted on the fingers of one hand) and two; to make things brighter.  It's also possible to miss large sections of the game entirely before you get to the "end".\n\nIf this sounds like a mess of disjointed ideas, it is.  There is a real problem here; the game doesn't explain itself particularly well at all, so your objective really is to just wander around and click on things.  In addition to the red ribbons, there are countless random objects of (presumably) some importance.  You can only carry one at a time, so you teleport back to The Case and put them on a shelf for later use.  Once you realise how frequently this is needed, the veneer peels away and The Case is revealed to be little more than one of the worst-implemented inventories I've ever seen in a game.\n\nCombine the "first-person inventory" with the completely bizarre puzzles and frustration and tedium abound.  In addition to the red ribbons, you can restore broken projectors by completing arbitrary, completely unrelated puzzles nearby.  Sometimes this means placing an item in a particular place, or using an item in some way to make something else happen.  Then presto - the projector is restored piece-by-piece.  The total lack of any indication of which puzzles do what (and the lack of a map to navigate by), make this process excrutiatingly tedious.  If you want to try to use a different item to interact with the world, you have to teleport back to The Case, swap your current item for the new one (you can only drop items in pre-determined places, presumably so it's harder to lose them), teleport back to the memory and try again.  Just in case that wasn't frustrating enough, when you teleport back to The Case, you always return to the same spot, so you have to walk over to the shelf that you want, or downstairs to look at a note that you'd only half-remembered.  Fortunately the game remembers where you were in the memory, though that does little to reduce the ridiculous amount of wandering around.  I nearly quit the game entirely after spending a small eternity traipsing around the Industrial area looking for the tenth ribbon needed to proceed.\n\nThe game has some interesting ideas and there are some moving moments, but there are just too many ideas here and not enough gameplay or refinement to make it worth recommending.\n\nThe ending does little to explain the plot.  Is Thomas really undergoing an advanced medical treatment to restore his memories, or is the doctor just visiting him in his care home and showing him objects from his past that trigger memories?  Does the Ether One facility really exist?  His wife Jean is presumably dead, but how and when?  Did she suffer from Alzheimer's too?  Where are all the people in his memories?  When did this all take place (Alexander Graham Bell seems to have been a resident, but the telephone was invented in the late 19th century)?  Why does picking up small troll figures cause a narrator to start recounting a children's tale?  I'm a big fan of ambiguity, but when you feel that even the developers can't fully explain things, it kills a lot of the interest.\n\nMaybe this all makes more sense if you complete all the puzzles, but the pathway to achieving that is so daunting and tedious that I just can't face attempting it - and that is ultimately the game's biggest failing.","July 28, 2014","false","12.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","3"

i only mean to say that i'm newer to exploration games). recreating the life and times of Pinwheel -- even something as simple as putting coffee on someone's desk -- is something i'll have a hard time forgetting, because nearly every puzzle was so meaningful in and of itself.\n\nthe "inventory" system was also one that was a pleasantly odd choice: instead of having a "bag" or "backpack", the player will be able to physically store items on shelves in a small room you can instantly transport yourself to and from. this, although seeming to be inconvenient at first, really serves as a 'centering' place, and allows the objects you pick up to really and truly seem like objects of interest and not just flat tools you equip and never see again. you have the ability to misplace things (if you're stupid, like me), which really does add to the immersion, as odd as that sounds.\n\nnow, onto the more negative aspects:\n\ni may just be inexperienced with these kinds of games, but the puzzles ended up being relatively difficult at times. keep in mind that the core of the game doesn't necessarily involve puzzles as much as the "projector side quest" does, but i was dead set on trying to get as many as i could and, therefore, did a number on myself trying to solve a thousand puzzles.\n\nmy favourite area, the harbor, was followed by my LEAST FAVOURITE EVER area, the industrial area.\n\nhear me out when i say i LOVED this game, but i HATED the industrial area. this is probably a highly personal issue, but i got lost ALL THE ♥♥♥♥IN TIME and i ended up getting frustrated to the point where i had to go have a snack to calm down.\n\ngranted, this frustration made it slightly more worth it in the end, but i think the layout of the area was confusing with no real signs pointing anywhere or telling anyone what to do. although this contributes heavily to the realism -- you must solve puzzles as you would in real life, which is one of this game's shining points -- it ended up being very difficult, at least for me. it was something that held such promise and followed through with a lot of it, but ended up causing a lot of frustration that pulled away from the depth of the immersion -- and the deeper you are, the more annoying it is to have to come up for air.\n\nanother issue i found was actually a result of this realism: the game does not always react so realistically. moving through water has no effect (no ripples), you cannot just place things down on the floor or on a table -- in fact, if you pick something up and decide to hold onto it, you can only put it down in PLACE of another item you pick up, or on one of the surfaces in your "home base", or scattered sparsely across the maps. some items -- we'll say a bottle of beer, for example -- can be picked up, and others are just textures in the background. this is also quite frustrating, because when you feel like everything in the world is so real, it's jarring to be unable to touch something or move somewhere.\n\nin spite of these issues, however, Ether One is a gem of an indie game. the story is rich and compelling, unfolding itself deliciously slowly as you learn to love the characters within, the environment feels real, even without next-gen graphics -- i wanted to walk through the forests of Pinwheel more times than i could count, and if i had been able to open the fridges and see some fresh food in there, i would've wanted to live in this world forever. this game took the hours i invested into it and rewarded me with a subtle, sweet, and heart-wrenching conclusion -- it made me cry, and i'm glad it did.\n\nan easy 8-8.5/10.\n\nif you have some time on your hands, some patience, and a penchant for the enchanting and bittersweet, this is absolutely a game to pick up.","June 24, 2014","true","11.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

On it's surface, Ether One seems like another stab at an Amnesia game, and whilst it does borrow alot of key features from them, it is something so much more different.\n\nI have never quite played a game like Ether One, but it is one I have always dreamed of. A compelling narrative that can be enjoyed without the need of puzzles (but there are tons of optional ones) and a story that just makes you want to keep playing and playing until you reach that ending. Despite the core narrative being rather short, you can get well over 10 hours out of this game.\n\nWhilst the game begins off rather tedious, Ether One quickly grabs you in with it's impressive story. Impressive is an understatement.

Ether One delivers an interesting narrative, but ultimately I am not recommending the game due to poor gameplay elements.\n\nEther One suffers from a lot of negative possibility space.  You will spend a lot of time exploring rooms that ultimately have nothing in them. The two core gameplay objectives are solving puzzles (to learn more about the story) and collecting ribbons (to progress through the game).  There are hundreds of objects scattered across the levels.  Similar to L.A. Noire (but even more poorly implemented), a lot of the difficulty comes from determining which items are needed to solve puzzles.  The inventory system is atrocious: only one item can be held at a time. and picking up an item will put your currently held item in its place.  Items can be deposited at vault-like location that is easy to access at any time, but the player will often not know if an item is actually part of a puzzle or not.  So, if you were to pick up a puzzle item, travel a bit, swap it for another item, and then continue, you will no longer have any way of knowing where the puzzle item is located.  In addition, movement is very slow and the maps are pretty big.  You may know exactly what it is you need to complete a puzzle but end up spending a long time slowly trying to find a building or item.  Solving the puzzles is not required to progress, but the puzzles are the only engaging part of the game.\n\nSome of the puzzles are fun and engaging, but other puzzles are extremely lacking.  The most frustration came from combing the levels for items and trying to determine which items are puzzle items.  Many puzzles make you search for a needle in a haystack.  Some involve leaps of logic that are difficult to make.\n\nEther One has some positive aspects.  The narrative and writing are good.  The environments are well crafted.  You will find notes that do a good job of describing the residents and events of the village.  The sound, music, and voice acting are all very good.\n\nOverall, Ether One is too slow paced and frustrating to enjoy.  The great narrative is hampered by poor design.","September 7, 2015","false","7.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

Themes such as loss, love and the beauty of the mundane echo throughout the game, which on a full playthrough took me around 10 hours.\n\nVisual and sound design come together beautifully in Ether One. Soft, melancholic tracks complement the watercolour aesthetic, and an attention to detail gives each area a vibrant, lived-in vibe.\n\nThe gameplay design is pretty intriguing. There are two main pillars. Exploration, and puzzle-solving. Exploration simply involves walking through each location, and finding all ribbons to progress the story. It's not as linear as it sounds though. These levels are sprawling. The environments tell additional stories, some self-contained, but most tied loosely with the main tale. Through scattered notes, diaries, and voice overs you learn about the inhabitants of this small, seaside town; a town that slowly lost its relevance as the decades wore on.\n\nThe puzzle sections are optional, but make up the bulk of your gameplay time. As you explore, you will stumble upon projectors, which can be restored by interacting with objects and buildings, in a similar vein to classic adventure games. These puzzles vary from stupidly easy, to obtusely hard, which can be problematic if you're aching to 100% the game. I know many people find the puzzles frustrating, however, they really aren't necessary to enjoy the game's story in full. They're really more like collectables. You do the ones you can, and puzzle the rest out later if you want.\n\nIt was a masterful stroke for the developers to do this. Instead of alienating players of either exploration or adventure games, both could experience the beautiful story while playing the game as either or.","June 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Those who enjoy puzzle games such as Riven or Schizm, this game is sure to impress. It'll encourage you to explore the detailed enviroments in depth to uncover deeper parts of the plot. The music, area design and voice acting are fantastic and the story is enough to get atleast two playthroughs out of you.\n\nThe controls are somewhat sluggish however and it'll chew your ram and gpu to pieces. It's probably unreal engines fault more than anything. Ether One also requires a lot of back tracking and sifting through large areas to progress, so clipping on every single clutter object and shin high fence does get annoying. My pinky is tired from holding shift the whole time. As for the difficulty of the puzzles, I can't complain. Some were tougher than others, but the solutions were always surprisingly fair. I suppose going on treasure hunts for smaller items in random seemingly unrelated houses was a let down though.\n\nCompletionists beware, this game has other problems. Many of the puzzles are currently pretty buggy which is a real shame, considering their difficulty and general time consumption factor. These are very much game breaking ones that'll either reset completed areas or lock you out of them by having a moving object in the wrong place on loading the area. It's a save file related problem, most likely. If these are ever fully patched out, this'll sit as one of the better puzzle games on the market.\n\nAll in all Ether One is a real good package with a really solid story and world to immerse yourself in. Bugs let it down heavily.\n6.5/10 It's good. Check it out if you like this sort of thing.","April 2, 2014","true","18.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/265950/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","Ether One is a narrative and explorative puzzle experience. Immerse yourself into the mind of another person and find out about their long-lost past, solve their history and help them overcome a chronic dementia.\n\nDesign & ArtWhile using the Unreal Engine 3 (Redux Version uses 4), the art style is kept fairly simplistic, while still looking unique and refreshing. Ether One's visual style is comparable to "The Long Dark", since both games' textures essentially seem very similar with their cell-shading look. Ether One mostly shines, when you do not take a closer look into its art detail. Nothing really looks odd or bad yet visuals are noteworthy and interesting, because of their unique appearance. Overall, for a game in this genre, which mostly focuses on its storytelling (next to "MIND: Path to Thalamus"), graphics are okay.\n\nControlsYou can choose to control the game by standard keyboard & mouse or fully fledged controller support. Ether One delivers tooltips on how to play itself but most of the time, you will use standard first person shooter controls. I cannot rate controller support and key bindings, since I do not own one.\n\nSound and MusicSoundtrack of the game reeled me in: Very emotional and fitting for its genre. My favorite piece played near the start and is called "Total Relapse". Although the musical backdrop sounds mostly shallow and eerie, I can hear that it was created with utmost love and care, being a musical creator and lover myself. Absolutely magnificent and gorgeous soundtrack created by Nathaniel-Jorden Apostol! Give this man a medal!\n\nThat goes for sounds and voiceacting as well. At no time did the game disappoint me by its auditory design and I can remember a great trailer score to be most of my conviction to buy this game. Voiceacting is done nicely, the actors took care in displaying realistic emotions. Some text passages sound odd in their choice of words, yet everything is within the smaller bounds of a well done voicecasting. Awesome!\n\nGameplayEther One features a relatively well done level design with multiple areas. You are a "Restorer", a person sent into another persons mind to restore specific memories within their mind, that have been lost due to dementia.\n\nYou can restore said memories by collecting objects within a level. Next to that, there are certain side objectives you can complete (like restoring film projectors, who offer a deeper look into the whole operation and therapy process of the person in whose mind you are currently in). You complete a level by accessing core memories and hereby accessing mysteries of the past. Various and well hidden clues and sometimes baffling puzzles need to be solved to complete these side missions. In reward, you will uncover more about the backstory. You can always come back to areas you already visited, in case you want to try figuring out that last clue you never got.\n\nDuring your travel through the mind, you will encounter multiple objects of interest, which you can store within your "case", a secluded area within the mind of the person, that you can always resort to, to go over crucial hints or review interesting plot details. Everything is tied to one location, so no objects from other locations are needed to solve a puzzle in another area, especially if you use your storage often. Choose wisely!\n\nThe story is well written, cohesive and emotionally engaging; never did I lose interest or intentionally skipped parts because I knew what was going to happen. But I felt a little disappointed at the ending, maybe that is not because the writing disappointed me, guess I was just sad that the game was over. Feels were felt and need to be felt.\n\nWeakpointsNow here is the crux of the matter. As much as I admire the gameplay of Ether One, I also hate it for some of its parts. Solving some puzzles involves running and walking around. A LOT of tedious walking back and forth, since the levels tend to get bigger. Finding crucial objects you left behind on particular locations can be a thorn in your side, even more if only one instance of said object exists. You need to go back the entire way to pick up the object. I do not know if I am too stupid to figure this out, but I thought you can teleport yourself from the "case" to any area within the mind, but that does not seem to be the case; It only teleports you to your last location you teleported to the case from. This is enervating and should have been done differently and easier.\n\nGamebreaking bugs still seem to exist after a batch of patches. At some point, I needed to consult a walkthrough, because I couldn't figure out what to do. I did EXACTLY what the walkthrough told me to do and STILL nothing happened, which led to desperation quickly. This happened MULTIPLE times and was really irritating for me.\n\nThe achievements for the Redux Version of the game do not work for me at this time. And speaking of the Redux Version: It is a complete port of Ether One into the Unreal\nEngine 4 (UE4) and nothing more. You get it for free, which is a nice feature I guess, but I cannot see the value of this port. I actually hate the UE4, because most of the games I play which get imported from the UE3 look worse and run worse on my machine than before (the same happening for MIND: Path to Thalamus in my case).\n\nIn my opinion, most of the puzzles were really tricky and challenging, some really felt absolutely unsolvable for my tastes. Maybe I get frustrated too soon and give up easily, but the some of the bugs I mentioned above really gave me a hard time. Overall, the difficulty of the puzzles is above average and needs some serious wits. A fair warning for everyone.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsEther One is a narrative puzzle experience with several explorative aspects.\n\nFor what its worth, the game takes itself extremely serious to plunge you into an interesting plot and engages your gray matter. A game that revolves entirely around dementia, the changes, daily challenges and emotions that come with it all seem really well executed and realistic, even if some of the puzzles seemed way too hard for me. The game feels mature in its theme and actually seems to be directed to mature audiences. Dealing with loss, in any shape or form, is something we all have to deal with at least one time in our life. And Ether One delivers a beautifully, above-average experience of everything that comes with it.","March 27","true","11.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I don't think the game suffered at all from this decision. I think the game's visuals consistently managed to achieve what was necessary for the game, and then keep going (I'm thinking of the scenes after each core memory). I read another review complaining about the underwhelming use of the unreal engine, but how this game looked never distracted me, but rather fascinated me, except for when I had to brefly change resolutions to read handwritten things (my computer isn't great, so I don't use max settings).\n\nThe story is the money maker here. I'm the kind of guy that is surprised by a movie's "twists" when everyone else in the theatre saw it coming a half hour ago, so I'm not hard to captivate. That being said, I feel this game puts the player in a very unique position, one that generates a lot of empathy for the characters and also leaves you hunting for every last hidden bit of the story - to try to make sense of it all as your character does. The voice acting definitely makes up for the lack of character models in the game, I thought.\n\nThe puzzling is alright. The puzzles don't make sense in an exactly rational way, which is why you have to remember that you're exploring a person's mind and you aren't in the real world. Each puzzle is essentially about laying an anxious thought to rest, which is very interesting when combined with the story, but if you lose sight of that you'll probably find the puzzles boring, or at least run-of-the-mill.\n\nOverall the game kind of plays out like you're living in the audio diaries that you find in a game like Bioshock, say, though they are less of a distraction, and more the driving aspect of the game. Some people love that stuff. And those people will not be dissappointed by the attention to detail and careful exposition of this game.

A meatier Gone Home if you like. While you will spend most of the time exploring a masterfully handpainted British coastal village of the 60s (powered by the latest Unreal Engine) getting sound cues whenever you approach something meaningful, you will have to collect pieces of the various puzzles scattered around and put them together to learn more about the story of this now abandoned village and its long gone inhabitants.\n\nWhile one could maintain that the environment is beautiful and extremely fascinating by itself, and the puzzles easy enough that you feel compelled to complete them even if you are usually not a big fan, it's the story that draws you in. It begins without telling you much, other than you are someone willing to undergo a certain experiment apparently dealing with memory recovery and memory loss. You enter a high tech facility and sit on a weird chair that sends you back to the magnificent Pinwheel Village and its wonderful tangle of intense, dramatic and lovely little stories. As a detective of memories, that you will somehow piece together, you will learn about a slew of minor facts and most importantly what led the village to its downfall, not to mention the most important task you've been sent to solve: who are you.\n\nAs I mentioned, I don't have the patience for puzzle games anymore, but Ether One got me hooked since the very first minute. The smartest idea White Paper Games came up with is that you DO NOT really have to solve the puzzles if you don't want to. You can advance the main story simply collecting some red ribbons in the each area you visit, but it goes without saying that by doing so you will skip the large amount of content they filled Pinwheel village with. Every house has a story, every office of the mining facility seems to have some memories worth uncovering and every character you find traces of in one part of the little town might have more of his/her personal story revealed later on as the lives of all these people were intertwined with each other, and their sons and daughters, as you would expect from such a tiny community. Thing can get emotionally intense, which is a bonus for me, but never in a suffocating way. For a puzzle game this does a really good job in leaving the players freedom to play it the way they like.\n\nTook me about 15 hours to go through all the content I could find only to realize there's a whole extra section I missed that will totally make me replay the game. I feel like I am from Pinwheel too now, and I care about my neighbours or at least the memories of my neighbours, and feel bad for what happened to some of them or happy for the positive outcomes of some others. While I am sure that more expert puzzlers than me can finish the game in about 8 hours, there's much more to see and do than I was expecting from a 7€ title. The visuals are great and so is the level design, and a special mention deserves the audio department which does a wonderful job in giving life in an otherwise empty and abandoned village.","January 2, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has very good voice acting and the story is interesting, yet there is always something missing from the gameplay. Once the game was booted up, I had to go right to the settings and turn of the annoying motion blur. The lack of detail in the objects you pick up in the game really hurt it since you will spend most of your time trying to put these things in their places.\n\nThe game when you step back is just one big jigsaw puzzle that at times is fun, yet most of the time ends up being dull. You might end up fighting yourself to not stop playing in order to write down things, so you are able to solve a puzzle and progress with the storyline. At first this was charming, since it ties in with the story and games don't play like this anymore these days. But then I noticed the puzzles really don't go any further than just gathering notes and then using them to fill in the blanks. I found this to end up being boring and was the main reason I would save my progress and start playing something else.\n\nThis game trys to sell itself on the idea of two play styles, one being without the puzzles, yet if you don't solve puzzles, then the story really is lacking. That brings me to the puzzles themselves, which consist of nothing more than trying to remember or add things up. Most of them are not at all difficult and end up just being a chore in order to keep the story going.\n\nThe asking price is a bit much without any online or planned DLC. The game also uses an older game engine from time to time looking like it wants to be Bioshock but does not give any good reason to play more than once. I have found on more than one time the letters I picked up scattered around the game had grammar errors. This made it seem as if these were rushed and written without love. You can tell what this game wants to be and it gets so close. For ten dollars I would tell you to get it, yet what they think it is worth is far more than what you'll get for your money.","August 5, 2014","false","7.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

On the "cover" it is a first person puzzle adventure game. But it is much deeper and darker, where it deals with dementia and its treatment, while delving deeper and deeper in hidden memories.\n\nOne particularly good aspect of Ether One is its puzzles. Most of them are tricky and difficult, but they make sense as long as you pay attention to details and explore well. There are no "how the hell was I supposed to know THIS" puzzles, and if you experience them, it means you missed a clue somewhere.\n\nThe game looks, sounds, and feels very immersive. Graphic style reminds of Borderlands and is very pretty. Ambient music and authentic sounds for all locations are varying from relaxing to unsettling. The movement of the player feels natural and interaction controls seem clunky only till you learn how to use them.\n\nThe story is written well. In games like these with unusual themes the story tends to become a mess, and even though there are points of it in Ether One that you have to think over to understand, it's a story that could be a well written novel where you need to use your brain to interpret parts of it in your own way. The game invites to this interpretation, while at the same time remaining logical and clear on the main parts of the story.\n\nKeep in mind that there are a few bugs in Ether One, so some puzzles randomly may not be solvable. I am missing a certian part of a smaller story because of this. I hope there will be more patches fixing those.\n\nThe game is dark and emotional, and probably one of the most "grown up" games that exist out there. This was an experience I won't forget (hopefully no pun intended). Strongly recommended to anyone who is into psychology, thrillers, good puzzle solving, and anyone who likes getting immersed into atmosphere-filled environments.","April 17, 2014","true","27.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

You\nplay as a restorer going into the mind of a person with dementia.  It does a\ngood job of incorporating you into the game, but also keeping you separate,\nas you are involved in the story, but not personally tied to it.  As you walk\nthrough the different atmoshperes, you interact with both your 'handler' and the\nperson whose mind you are in.\n\nThe level design is fairly large and multi-layered, with plenty of areas\nto explore, which ties into the story well.  There's not just a linear path;  it\nhas weight and atmosphere, which lends to the aesthetic of the environment.  It\nfeels like everything you are seeing is new.\n\nThe puzzles however, which for the most part are optional, tend to be\nvery repetitive.  It's a lot of memorization as opposed to using your wit and\ncleverness to solve an issue.  While the levels are vast and the story is\nentertaining, the repetitiveness of the puzzles takes away from immersion into\nthe game.\n\nIf you really enjoy the walking and exploration genres of games, this\ncould be a game you would enjoy.  If you are new to this type of game, the\nnegatives may take away from enjoyment of the game.

The minutia, the lore, the style- still sticks with me, a handful of games later.\n\nI'm fond of this one, I would recommend it. I sat with my thoughts on it for a while, since I had not determined whether or not I felt it worth recommending. Despite the potent, vivid, beautiful imagery, we're left with a story, that I did not find satisfying at first. The framework, the conceits, the guises, are simply excessive for the story they want to tell.\n\nthis game is like an elegant tapestry, with many frayed strings, obscuring the main image. If you can look through them, the plot holes, the obtuse leaps of logic, the over the top ending- it's simply put. beautiful.\n\nAnd, months later- I figure it worthwhile, to leave it a positive review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprincessindistress/recommended/265950/","aprincessindistress","kayrad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprincessindistress/","231 products in account","This game is something else let me tell you. Firstly, it is a very good game and worth the buy. I like to call it an extreme puzzle game. You can solve the main story / smaller puzzles very quickly. However, there are 20 extra puzzles you can try and fail and fail and fail and somehow magically succeed to put together. The puzzles don't really have hints. You just try a bunch of different things and throw it together. But it's new and frustrating and makes me want to rip my hair out while saying "of course you write on the sheet of paper based on some other paper who may have read, of course."\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles adds so much to the game. You'll learn more about all the characters and even the town. There is notes you can read and collectibles you can find. The voice acting is great, the story is heartwarming at the same time heartbreaking. The graphics are superb, audio is wonderful and the different places are really cool to explore.\n\nThere are some downsides. For one, the game doesn't have enough music for me. Some will come on a play but that happens mostly when you're playing for the main part and not the side puzzles. Since I spent most of my 12 hrs on those puzzles,  I needed to play music myself because I got bored. Another is the fact that the puzzles aren't thoroughly explained. It does give you a small tutorial but you really have to simply play for long periods of time to even get the gist of the side puzzles.\n\nOne part of the game I thought I would hate actually turned out a plus for me which is the inventory. You can only carry one object at a time but you can teleport back to a home base and store a ton of items. It became a sort of game. Filling each shelf with the same object I found through out the game. And it was really cool to see how those random objects came into the main story.\n\nYes, I fully recommend it for those who like a challenge and a very pretty game.","December 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If, on the other hand, you are looking for something to challenge your intellect both via in-game puzzles and through a touching story, then by all means, take my recommendation and play on, Restorer.\n\nAs this is an independently developed game, I was prepared to grant some leniency for in-game errors.  Imagine my surprise when none was needed.  Sure, you may have some slight clipping here or texture issues there, but I have personally experienced far worse from AAA-developed games.  Early in the game's release, bugs seemed to be relatively commonplace.  After my playthrough, I believe that the vast majority of them have been addressed in an adequate manner;  I experienced no faults throughout my time in the game.  That having been said, let's get into the categorical scores.\n\nGRAPHICS:  8/10\nNot terribly graphics-intensive, but then again that wasn't the emphasis of the game.  If I had to describe it, it would be Minecraft meets Fable meets Borderlands.  The effective use of cell-shading and traditional art styles really gives the game a unique look that oozes style and mystery while still being relatively believable.  As mentioned above, there were some slight graphics issues, but on the whole seemed really well polished.  I'm giving it 8/10 because I feel that with a bit more work they could have made the game just a *wee* bit more realistic, which would have added to the immersion factor.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  9/10\nVery unique locations help the game's immersion.  Mines, lighthouses, harbor towns, industrial complexes, forests and laboratories; this game covers a wide variety of terrain, and does so well. The artwork helps blend them together into a seamless backdrop for the story.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  9/10\nGameplay was smooth as silk.  The game ran fine on my laptop, which is by no means a dedicated or optimized gaming rig.  You should have no issue playing this on a desktop.\n\nSTORY:  10/10\nAllow me to preface this by saying I wish I could give it 11/10.  Oh wait, I'm the author of this thing, so yeah, I CAN do that!  The story is brilliant.  The mechanic of dementia is not a common element in video games today, though if it is, it is most likely used in the horror genre.  The game sets you up on the path to unwinding the story and lets you go at your own pace.  There is no time limit, no pressure, nothing to compel you to complete it except for your own desire to know how the story ends.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this; the ending is well worth the time and frustration of figuring out the optional puzzles.\n\nTL;DR\nGreat game, thoroughly enjoyed it.  Puzzles left me thinking about the game even after I quit playing, and the compelling story kept me enthralled.  Refreshing change of pace from my usual games.  If you're on the fence, I recommend going for it.","June 4, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its a first person adventure game where you begin in a research facility whos main purpose is to study dementia/phsychological issues in various patients.  You are conscripted and given access to these patients most distressing memories in hopes of curing their psychoses. An omnicient female voice interjects various background info as you work your way through the memories.  This aspect, along with the research facilty reminded me of portal 2, but dont think the entire game is spent within the research facility, to the contrary, most is spent exploring rich environments within the memories of the above mentioned patients.\n\nIn terms of game play, movement is tradional with the ability to jump, sprint and crouch.  You use a "crosshair" dot to interact with various items in the game i.e open doors pick up items etc.  Now concerning inventory, this is where its a bit different than most adventure games i have played.  Typically you have an inventory bar right.  In Ether One you are only able to pick up and hold 1 item at a time.  So how does this work?  Their is a central room within the facility which allows you access to the patients memories.  This is the launching point for every "memory" walk.   The room is ringed with shelving which acts as your inventory store.  When in a memory and you pick up something of interest you press "T" and it teleports you back to this room where you drop of the item.  At first I was like wtf but it works surprisingly well and really immerses you in the background story as well as keeping your screen free and clear of clutter. Also of note - only when 1 memory walk is completed can you move to the next.  You have no choice in this regards everyone starts with the same one.\n\nThe environment is beautiful and up to now void of any life expect yourself and the female voice in the sky. Think Myst in terms of serenity and overall feel.  Welcoming but earie at the same time.  The art style within the memories immediately reminded me of orcs must die.  Its more cartoony than realsitc and gritty.  This is neither a positive nor a negative just an observation.\n\nI have yet come across a "true" puzzle i.e. circuit puzzles, contraptions etc. They seem to be more interactive enviroment type challenges. If you have ever played the pnumbera series, kind of like that.  They are logical but hard enough to be fun and challenging.  The memories are also fairly linear so you are not running back and forth between memories and the facility to hunt for missing clues.\n\nAll and all I highly recommend this game to any fan of the genre.

With a captivating story that focuses on something very real and scary, Ether One had me hooked the whole way through. The voice acting and soundtrack played a huge part in the success of the story also, both excellent. Graphically, the game is pleasing with some nice diversity in  locations.\n\nWhile the puzzles seem overly intricate and unintuitive, they are completely optional to progress through the story (bar the first one) and they serve a purpose. Dealing with a topic such as mental illness, it seems as if the puzzles were designed in such a way that you would feel lost trying to figure them out, like a real patient searching for lost memories. Naturally, struggling through puzzles may not appeal to everyone, yet there is a lot to be said for the feeling of solving a puzzle, using an item you obtained hours previous. (Any item you find can be stored in the main hub for later use.)\n\nTo those interested, there is an excellent community guide by Steam user 'Crinkle' called 'Ether One - Complete Guide'. Instead of simply giving you the solution to the puzzles, this guide provides hints to help you get through them yourself.\n\nI encountered a few bugs while playing, but they were mainly graphical and did not hamper my progress in anyway.","March 17, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What follows is  puzzle-exploration game where you explore locations from the patient's past and seek out their memories in the form of ribbons and optional projectors all while the patient's past is slowly unveiled.\n\nThe game's puzzles range from the somewhat obvious to the incredibly obscure, to the point of its detriment (you may well go through entire areas being unable to solve any of the optional puzzles), especially when considering the projectors ultimately lead to a longer ending (I'd advise anyone who wasn't able to 100% the game to at least view the bonus ending on youtube).\n\nTrying to complete the projectors, which really are the meat of the game regardless of how optional they are, leads to long segments of backtracking and trying to work out red-herrings. This is a shame as they also carry a large chunk of the narrative along side all of the puzzles.\n\nThere is also a segment of the game, the Mines, which can be entirely missed if you do not spot the entrance along the path of the river. Missing 1/4th of the game by accident was a rather terrible design choice.\n\nThe graphics are also not stellar, being the clear product of trying to leverage a small art budget as well as possible and muddy textures are omnipresent. Although it does its best to mask the low fidelity through a painterly art style.\n\nMusic, voice acting, and sound design are very well produced however. Although until you've completed an area's projectors you will not see the sound design in its entirety. When you've fully completed an area it gains back the sounds of life. Children laugh, miners work their machines, and pubs announce closing time.\n\nThe game ends fittingly for its chosen subject matter, straying away from tasteless fantastical elements which could have been present. It did not surprise me in any strong way, but it was emotionally effective.\n\n8.5/10 -  A game with great narrative strengths, but weak and occasionally obscure gameplay design. Play it, but have some walkthroughs on hand.","September 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sometimes frustrating, as all the puzzles aren't completely obvious, but I think that is what makes this game a truly great game. You actually have to think and recall things. They don't lead you around by your hand and make everything obvious. Throughout the game, I got both endings and all 20 projectors. I sincerely recommend everyone do the same. You get so much more of the story and a great feeling by the end of it. The only issue with this game I've seen is if you are trying to listen to the voice recordings for the projectors again, sometimes they don't play and you have to restart the game.

The visuals are pretty good and the voice acting is excellent.  The exploration part of the game is great and some of the puzzles are great however many of the puzzles are overly obscure.

None of them were significant but I am going to list in detail as the developers seem very engaged on the community hub and responsive to feedback.\n\n- The game switches to Polish every couple of times I launch the game.\n- The texture detail reverts back to medium every time I launch the game. This is particularly infuriating as one of the puzzles near the start of the game requires  you to read a number off the back of a plate but the number is not visible at medium texture detail.\n- Most of the achievements don't work.\n- The trading cards only drop when playing the original version not the redux version\n- The miner's vigil projector wouldn't trigger after lighing the correct number of candles.\n- The piano won't play for the church projector, This is possibly because I saved my game whilst the tuning animation was running.\n- After triggering the plaque in Pinwheel village, I was stuck in the room with the red chair by the fire. I had to go back to the cage and travel to a different area and after that I was unable to jump.","March 13","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully the game itself also lived up to my expectation. The closest relatives to it are games like Dear Esther and Gone Home, which I both liked but weren’t really challenging or what some people call ‘traditional games’.\n\nEther One is in my opinion the better game. The story a bit tricker to figure out though but instead of one house like in Gone Home you have a small town on your hand.\nThe beginning is a bit odd, but once the games opens up it starts to shine. Ether One also proves once again that video games don’t have to offer traditional mechanics or violence to offer a deep and rich experience.\n\nThe main gameplay involves the player solving puzzles by picking up items, inspecting them and trying to find clues and hints in the environment. There are no NPC to guide or distracts you, the environment is the true main aspect of the game.\nFrom the moment you step into the town of Pinwheel you can see with how much love and care the world has been build. All the puzzles have a purpose in the context of the town itself and don’t feel forced or just there to be an obstacle for the player. This becomes even more apparent as a majority of the puzzles are actually skip able and completely optional.\nTheir difficulty levels vary but figuring out the creative way they are tied together is what makes Ether One truly shine and will keep you coming back till you solved them all. The moment when you realize a connection and solve a puzzle because of it is almost as good if not a better feeling than defeating a boss in another game.\n\nWeeks after beating it I still think of the feeling of being in Pinwheel and the time i lost sleep thinking over how a certain piece would fit in a puzzle. I can recommend Ether One to everyone who likes atmospheric games with challenging puzzles and who can appreciate subtle storytelling.","August 7, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As someone with a loved one who had dementia, this was something that I could really empathise with. It gets pretty emotional at times, and there's a The Sixth Sense-esque twist in the middle that makes it even more endearing. Also the puzzles are really contrived and can get frustrating, which I like, but it's something you either will love or hate.\n\nBut this game has too many @*&# bugs. I ran into at least three so far, and I had to either repeat things I already did to reset some programming, or load an old save and redo a half-hours worth of content. It's a shame really, because it breaks immersion in an otherwise immersive game. Also there's so much walking, and there's no run button. This would be fine if the levels weren't huge mazes with puzzles that involve you walking accross them MULTIPLE TIMES. Seriously most of this game was spent travelling accross the map in a slow walk, which just got boring after a while.","October 2, 2015","false","16.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

You wander around solving puzzles based on either environmental patterns and clues or basic written hints.\n\nThe twist is that theres no inventory (you can only hold one item) and "key" items arent as easily recognizable. This mug saying "Worlds biggest Dumbass" might just be junk - or a hint for a puzzle or directly usable for something. So you might decide to keep it for later and teleport to your hub and store it on a shelf. Then later when you find a paper saying "Worlds biggest ???" you teleport back to your hub, look at the mug and solve the puzzle.\n\nIf youre worried about aimlessly wandering around not knowing what the eff to do, the basic story path is very easy and amounts to finding things. Actual puzzlesolving is all optional and id say only 1/4 of it falls into the outlandish "snort two lines then it makes sense" category these games are always kinda endagered by.\n\nWhats it all for? Lets say to remember...\n\nBEWARE : You might ask why this review is not for the Redux version. Thats because while Redux is very pretty and a clear graphical update it also was very broken and glitchy for me. Stuff like activated levers with their related effects and such resetting on a map transfer.  Environmental effects like moving machinery and even audio missing when compared to "old" ether one or working once then breaking. Interactable stuff plain breaking and locking me out of progression (optional maybe but still). 5 hours in my hub teleport stopped working, couldnt retrieve/store items anymore nor access story progression stuff. Wasnt scripted, wasnt fixable so that was game over, fun fun.\n\nAfter i was done being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i tried the old version on a hunch and it had none of these problems. Obviously several scripts didnt survive the engine conversion.\n\nTL;DR : Ether One Vanilla : Polished, fun, recommended. Ether One Redux : Pretty, might ♥♥♥♥ the bed in varying degrees of severity so play at your own risk.","January 3","true","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The mystery of what you're doing is revealed later in the game and makes it all the more interesting if you happen to replay it. Suddenly things you overlooked towards the beginning make sense. The puzzles aren't all too difficult and can be fun to figure out, although the hardest puzzles simply reward you with more character development so it may not be worth it if you are not as invested into the characters as I was.\nThis game is something that appeals much more to storytelling than gameplay. It reminds me of playing through To The Moon. As it can get slow at times, I only recommend it to other people who are able to push through drab gameplay in order to complete the storyline.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elviscera/recommended/265950/","elviscera","elviscera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elviscera/","114 products in account","I've played this game for a few hours.  While it supposedly is a game based on dementia, I'd call it a exploration game with a story line mostly revealed by solving puzzles.  The puzzles are largely solved by finding objects/clues that enable certain actions to be taken.  When the requisite action for the puzzle have been taken the puzzle is considered solved.  It can be tedious.\n\nFirst off, the installation went a little oddly, I had to restart the game before it ran smoothly.  I didn't have any further issues with the performance but others have reported issues.\n\nThe game play seems fairly open in that you can find the objects and solve the puzzles out of order within a given level.  There are some bugs (or possibly arcane order requirements) that cause one to have to repeat the actions required to solve many of the puzzles.  I find this annoying even if one chgaritably assumes this is intended to simulate the confusion of dementia.\n\nSo far there is no tricky jumping such as in Talos for example (i.e. easy navigation).  In fact, the player motions are very hobbled even in areas where a player ought to be able to easily jump (ala HalfLife).  Restrained motions degrade the exploration aspects to that of poking around in persons underwear drawers (yes, really).  Also the many of the bathrooms doors can't be shut when you enter them (that's quite a flaw).\n\nThe game is built on the Unreal Development Kit (UDK).  Graphically, the game itself is rendered more like a comic book than like a typical 3D (not saying that's bad but it is not using much of the UDK capabilities).  The game supports Nvidia 3D vision well if you like that sort of thing in a comic book rendering scheme.\n\nThe audio is overall quite reasonable but the controls for audio are minimal.  Also the keyboard controls options are limited (a reflection of what is needed in the game).  I didn't try it with game controller as yet (in this game it might be preferable to a keyboard/mouse).   The walking pace is rather slow (even if you run).  The action controls are a bit awkward and do not repond uniformly across the game.\n\nI'm torn in my opinion of this game -- while It certainly has a few interesting puzzles, it's no Talos or Portal.  The clues it provides are rather peculiar/obtuse and some clues IMO are non-sequiturs.  The voice acting is adequate.  I sometimes find the game play compelling but more often it feels tedious.  I can't honeslty rate it a thumbs up even though I like the game enough to have played it for several hours.  I suggest that you first read the helpful negative reviews and if you still want to try this game, wait till it's on sale.","June 21, 2015","false","38.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I won't reveal much more than that to avoid spoiling the plot.\n\nThe world is well designed and entices you to explore every nook and cranny of it.\n\nThe mechanics mostly revolve around finding items in the world and placing them in their rightful locations. There is also a fair bit of deciphering codes to unlock safes, doors, etc. One of the more unique puzzle mechanics involves discovering key bits of information and writing them on chalkboards, envelopes, and the like to solve the puzzles.\n\nFor the most part, the puzzles don't require any outrageous leaps of logic to solve, although you will likely find yourself heading to the forums for a hint on one or two particularly pernicious conundrums.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is movement. Moving around the world makes one feel less like a human and more like a drunken pachyderm. This is not such an annoyance when you first visit a location, as you will want to move slowly to take in your surroundings. However, once you've explored a location and are trying to solve a puzzle that requires backtracking across the location in search of a note or item, the slow stumbling movement becomes quite frustrating.\n\nThe main plot is fairly interesting but I found the small side plots riddled throughout the world to be the game's forte. That said, I highly recommend this game on the basis of it's puzzles, plot, and interesting world to explore.","January 20, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a beautiful, poignant, peaceful and incredibly challenging game, based around exploring the memories of a dementia patient. Playing thorugh this game gave me 'Myst' vibes, through the challenging, puzzle and exploration based gameplay. I found the story telling to be top notch, a feat only compounded considering it was produced by a small indie team. Ether One is a little rough around the edges, as is apparent with some of the graphical features though the effect of this is only minimal, and I imagine it is merely a hallmark of not having access to all the latest tools and expertise. For me, these little nuances actually served the hit home the personal, and home-grown feel of the game.\n\nIt is overall extremely well done and deserves all the praise it gets. The game world is immersive and atmospheric (oh so quintessentially English!), The voice acting is superb, the way the story unfolds is intriguing and leaves a lot to the player's own exploration and problem solving skills, a welcome throwback to puzzle games from days gone by (there's no hint system or anything like that.

I genuinely did not expect the ending, but that may be partly due to an assumption about the story I made early on that I later took to be a known fact.\n\nThe puzzles are, at times, somewhat counter-intuitive, but I've never been good at puzzle gameplay so that might just be me.

Gameplay wise, it's kind of one is one part interactive story and one part puzzle game. It's like if Gone Home had a baby with the old school adventure/puzzle games like Myst. In Ether One, you'll be playing the role of "The Restorer". You're contracted to help a medical researcher treat a patient with dementia by entering the patient's mind Inception style and then finding and restoring the patient's lost or broken memories. Really interesting premise, right? Unfortunately, most of what's typed below are a lot of the faults I found with the game. There's a lot of good stuff to be found with Ether One too, but I chose to focus mostly on the things I thought could be improved to make a more complete experience. I want to submit some constructive criticism because I know that Ether One is the type of game that I usually like, but there were a few problems in the way of making my experience truly awesome\n\nLike Gone Home before it, the story of Ether One is told via voiceovers that occasionally kick in and give you narrative details when you're standing near or looking at something of importance. You'll be exploring a deserted island as it exists in your patient's memory and discovering your patient's life history by exploring this small island. The primary voice you hear is that of the lead researcher of the project you're assigned to. She chimes in now and again to give you your objectives and bark out orders on how you're to carry them out. Her character reminded me a little bit of GLaDOS from Portal. She serves to guide the player and move the game along, but her motivations seem questionable. You don't feel like you can completely trust her. The game seemed content to keep this character sort of ambivalent all the way up until the end of the story. Actually, I found a lot of the story's details to be a little vague and I'm not sure if this was intentional or poor narrative execution.\n\nAdding to the confusion and the vagueness of this story is the other female character's voiceover who just starts talking to you out of nowhere. For the longest time, I thought I had missed some important cutscene where the game delivered a bunch of narrative exposition and this other voice was introduced, but nope. For most of the game, you're not sure who this voice is supposed to be or what the relevance is of the details she provides are. To me, this sort of ambiguity wasn't even interestingly vague or mysteriously vague. It was more confusingly and annoyingly vague. A lot of what either of the two voices talk about seemed incohesive and irrelevant to the rest of the story. Because of these problems, it took Ether One quite a while to grab me and for the game to really click with me. There's some really well executed scenes about halfway through the game that pulled me in and there's also an interesting twist at the end, but unfortunately you'll have to tough it out while the game stumbles through the confusing introduction of the setting and characters.\n\nThe focus of the gameplay in Ether One is on exploration. You need to find a certain number of red ribbons in each area before being allowed to proceed to the next one. The game also includes some puzzles, but interestingly, nearly all of the puzzle sections in Ether One are completely optional. Since they're not required, solving these puzzles serves only to give you an extra bit of narrative about whichever area you're in. I think it's fortunate that the designers made these optional, because the puzzles I attempted to solve were so frustratingly poorly communicated. I had absolutely no idea what the game wanted me to do with some of these puzzles. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if what I was looking at was supposed to be a puzzle at all. I happened to accidentally solve one of the puzzles, and I wasn't even really sure what I had done to complete it. A lot of them involve placing the correct items gathered from various places around the island, but you can only carry one item at a time for some odd reason. It felt like the game designers were hacking around the game engine rather than coding a decent inventory system. It was a pretty unintuitive mess. Mercifully, these are indeed optional. Aside from the puzzles, the rest of the gameplay was sort of unremarkable and uninteresting. If you're playing Ether One, you're doing it for the story, nothing else. But just like its story, I felt that there was something missing from Ether One's gameplay that could have really made this game special\n\nDespite all of my ranting above, I still liked Ether One. I wanted to like this game more than I actually did, but there was some bungled narrative and some really poor execution in gameplay that I just couldn't get over. It's also another pretty short game. That is, unless you try to figure out some of those crazy puzzles. That might pad the game a bit, but I'd advise against it. Skipping nearly all of the puzzles, I was able to knock this game out in about 3 hours. The subject matter in this game is really interesting to me and there are a few short sequences in where Ether One really shines. However most of the rest of the game is unfortunately kind of dull, incoherent or overly vague. Artsy folks who like the "open to interpretation" kind of story may dig this, but I found too many details were missing and my interest wasn't adequately captured at the game's opening. I really still did enjoy playing through this game though. Just not as much as I hoped I would.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","September 26, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole concept of exploring another characters mind isn't something new, but this game brings it to a new level by introducing memory fragments which, when put together, tell a story of a dementia patient.

Given its subject matter, it's definitely very dark. But it's also very haunting. I will say this game haunting me in a way I can't describe. It is definitely worth "finishing" the game, and the find the ribbon quests before you complete all the projectors.\n\nCompleteing the projectors on your own I'm pretty certain is impossible. Which I'm also pretty sure is part of the point of the game/the message of the game.\n\nOthers may complain about the inventory system, in which it is easy to lose objects. Again, I think that's part of the point of the game. Simliar for the lack of any map.\n\nOverall, I have nothing but very high recommendations for this game if you are one who looks to have an experience/looks for artistic merits from a game. From a purely "gaming" standpoint, the software lacks, but I do not think that delivering a A+ gaming experience was the intention of the developer.","December 5, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My Top 5 all time includes Talos Principle, Mind: Path to Thalamus, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Portal 2, and, say, Naissancee. But this game is not up there, imho.\n\nFor me, it started out very well. I managed to solve riddles one by one using no walkthroughs. It felt natural and empowering. However, it got tougher. Much, much tougher. And I didn't want to go through without solving puzzles - which is an option in this game - because when you do, the game starts resembling Dear Esther, which I didn't like at all... But the main problem was the lack of motivation to press forward (i.e. to look for walkthroughs) to see what happens next. Maybe that's because I have no relatives with dementia, or maybe because I myself have it, I don't know ;)\n\nAnyways, there were also graphics. Not impressive, imho. And incredibly slow. In the age of Ethan Carter, technical implementation like that does not deserve more than 5/10. And now it's redux (I played the original), so probably even slower (did not try).\n\nThat's more or less it. I agree with one of the reviewers that a somewhat simmilar Master Reboot is more engaging, even though the graphics there are actually even worse than in this game. Sure, if the price suits you, try it. Many people loved it, so maybe you will too.\n\np.s. I've played this game at least a few times longer than my Steam record suggests.

If you enjoy first person adventure games with puzzles, then you'll likely enjoy this game. I will do my best to avoid spoilers, the only one i'm mentioning here is literally explained in the first moments of the game (the entire premise of the game is based on it). You are delving into the mind of a person suffering from Dementia with Lewy bodies. You play as "The Restorer" who is searching through this person's memories. You explore beautiful worlds, but they seem to be a bit off. Things are scattered about, the world is devoid of other human beings, and you are wandering about trying to put the pieces back together. In doing so you learn more about this person, about their life, about their struggles with the disease. What you'll find is an interesting look into the mind of a dimentia patient, and it is an absolute wonder.\n\nOne word of recommendation. Look up how to get there if you have too, but do the Brimclif Mines BEFORE you do the Village. The area isn't intentionally hidden, but it seems to be common for people to run right past it.

I was expecting a rather standard low budget Myst-like FPS puzzler and, to a certain extent, that's exactly what Ether One is. However, what I wasn't expecting was a thought-provoking and genuinely touching exploration on the issue of degenerative brain disorders. Sure the puzzles are sometimes a little too obscure for their own good, which leads to a bizarre sort of kleptomania where you end up picking up every single item you see in the hope that somehow that one shoe you found in that house might be able to open that door you've been struggling to get through in that factory. But, once the methods of puzzle progression becomes clear, the pace picks up and I found myself utterly immersed in the fiction before me.\n\nA wonderful mixture of Science Fiction and psychological thriller/horror creates a game world where you're always second guessing everything you see and do. You are freely able to move between every zone of the game world and can return to do any of the puzzles that you possibly struggled with before. If you're not really 'feeling' the puzzles offered, you can actually ignore a large quantity and blast through the story. Completion of the puzzles does affect the story somewhat in ways I would prefer not to spoil, so I honestly think it's worth taking some time to do them.\n\nThe puzzles themselves vary in complexity, from simple fetch and place puzzles, to some really rather obscure ones that might have you reaching for the aid of a walkthrough. The game actually offers multiple routes to completion of some of the larger puzzles so using a walkthrough can be very handy to make sure you are at least thinking about the puzzle correctly. Sometimes the obscurity of the puzzles can seem a little....too much, but I recommend just going with it and treating it as a part of the narrative itself. The human mind is a complex thing, seems only apt for it to construct such complex puzzles ;-)\n\nThe story and game world for me are the main selling points for this game. Wonderfully atmospheric locales that are as creepy as they are strangely beautiful and serene - based just enough in reality to make the games many anomalies create a sense of unease. The story itself is wonderfully told and involving, with the many puzzles having a consequence on how and when details are revealed to the player. Thematically I was really rather moved by what White Paper games did with the story and the main revelations revealed throughout are as disturbing as they are beautiful.\n\nWell worth the price of admission I'd say :-)","January 1, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
