"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkonezero/recommended/359440/","darkonezero","Karsing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkonezero/","197 products in account","As of this review I've played about 6 hours on the non-steam version and haven't beaten the game yet, so please keep that in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know is that this game is meant to be replayed in order to find different routes and equipment. I would expect every run to be at least over 6 hours if you attempt to complete every quest you come across. It is immediately apparent that the game expects you to experiment due to having complete control over party composition and what the starting gift is. The starting gifts vary from stat boosts, to an airship, to a key to access temples throughout the world. This first choice significantly impacts how you play the rest of the game since temples would give you quick travel points and treasure while an airship give complete freedom in travel. This first choice lets you know what the rest of the game will be like, to make one of multiple choices that will permanently prevent other choices. Each game is associated with a specific save slot, so it isn't possible to have multiple saves associated with different choices made my the same game session.\n\nThe game itself is pretty standard, you move between towns and dungeons to prepare your party for the final boss. Battles are simple and involve attacking, defending, casting spells and using items. From what I've seen so far every battle will be more or less the same outside of the scale of how much damage is being exchanged. The spells that your party can use are entirely dependent on which artifacts you've found and who it has been assigned to, I haven't encountered a situation where a party member learned as skill after leveling up.\n\nI cannot recommend this game if what you're looking for is a complicated story with realistic characters. None of your party members have any dialogue and there doesn't seem to be any reoccurring characters throughout the game. What story you do get is periodic exposition if you get the key of time. However, I find the situations and events which occur while completing quests to be satisfying in providing the game with character. One moment I've wiping out a town of Deep Ones, the next I'm learning to speak crab.\n\nDifficulty-wise it is fairly unforgiving to those that are unprepared or inexperienced. Poison status will last until it has been cured or the character dies, so it is important to always have antidote available. It is possible to permanently lose 3/4 of your party early in the game by accidentally selling them into slavery. Fight enemies that are too strong and they'll have multiple actions each turn.\n\nOverall, this game is for someone who wants a game in the old JRPG style. Equipment, spells and quests are all you'll find, but that's enough to have fun.\n\nFeatures that are absent:\nQuest log\nMap\nMultiple saves for the same party\nRanged weapons with unlimited ammo\nDetailed artifact descriptions before you permanently bind an artifact to a party member\nAnimations for spells\n\nFeatures that are present:\nPalette swapped enemies\nEco-terrorists\nAmbiguous morality choices\nAI which heals too often, but can't use items\nLimited inventory slots per character\nManually initiating boss fights\n\nIf you do get the game, one thing to keep in mind is Q and W since these are the keys for switching which character is active. This will let you easily swap character when binding an artifact and moving between characters in menus.","June 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","49","55","2","0"

The battle music is particularly good; it will get stuck in your head!\n\nNarrative: Simple and ManyWhile the game has one overall objective of defeating the Swamp King, there's no "main" plot line. There are many little side stories. Some of the quests present the player with moral choices; a couple of these really made me stop and think.\n\nGameplay: Addictive!Throughout the game, Artifact Adventure is strong on exploration and player choice. This starts at the beginning of the game, when you pick your party members' classes (similar to Final Fantasy I) and choose one of three gifts the King offers. The vast majority of the quests from there on out are optional yet provide significant benefits, and many of these quests have differing outcomes depending on how you choose to handle them. Since a party member of any class can accept any Artifact and learn a skill from it, there are many possible ways to allocate skills. Thanks to all the possibilities, this game is good for many hours of play and several replays.\n\nFlaws: Some failures to communicateWhile most of the dialogue is translated well, there are occasional errors that can cause confusion. Directions are sometimes wrong: take any reference to "west" with a grain of salt. Also, the game lacks a tutorial, so I'll provide a few pointers below...\n\nHelpful Hints:Alt+Enter: Toggle full screen mode\nQ and W keys: Cycle through the party while walking around or in a menu. This is especially important while collecting Artifacts, as an Artifact always binds to the person currently leading the party.\nBlue Artifacts cost MP; orange Artifacts do not. If a non-spellcasting class ends up with an Artifact that costs MP, it's not a complete waste. You can boost that character's max MP using elixirs, so that he can use it occasionally. Or if you prefer, you can return to your last save via the title screen.","August 21, 2015","true","51.1"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

I started playing it in hour long sessions because of time constraints and I always look forward to going back to it.\n\nYou should know that this game is old school hard but also fair. Dragon Warrior was a hard game but if you stocked up on healing items, equipped yourself with the best equipment you can find, and knew your limits â€“ you could make it through no problem. Artifact Adventure follows this same kind of philosophy -- there are no cheap tricks.\n\nIt does use random battles but the encounter rate is manageable. I have failed to run from battles but I find that more often then not, I can run.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand. There is no quest log and sometimes you discover something and there's no way to know what it is. What I absolutely love about this game is that you are rewarded well for exploring. If there's one thing that I hate from RPGs is going through a detour only to find an antidote that you'll never use. No, this game gives you much needed gold, new equipment, and some new powers.\n\nThe music reminds me of Dragon Warrior, the graphics feel just right, and piloting an airship from the get-go is just so cool. I can't believe that I have never seen a jRPG with an open world because it seems like a concept that should have been done before (especially with the popularity of series like the Elder Scrolls or The Witcher).\n\nThe game is broken down in chunks that don't consume too much time. So far I can finish a dungeon in 15-20 minutes while fighting most random battles.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is that certain elements were not translated really well. Artifacts aren't always clear so you're never sure what you're assigning to your character. I have given a MP consuming spell to my warrior class (a class with no MP) thinking I was giving him a DEF boost.\n\nI definitely recommend this game and invite you to take a peek at my Let's Play series of the game to get an idea of what it's like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMus7mXRPBE","June 1, 2015","true","0.1"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","34","48","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poppyfox/recommended/359440/","poppyfox","MoominPappa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poppyfox/","165 products in account","Artifact Adventure actually manages to capture some of the best parts about retro RPGs without just being a sensless appeal to nostalgia.  There are some definite issues with the game, most of which are related to the UI, but overall the game is both novel and engaging, and it's reasonable price tag makes its less appealing elements more forgivable.\n\nIt's certainly not for those who want a lot of story; the story largely exists to serve the gameplay as well as occasionally giving the player quests that are essentially short ethics thought exercises. It's nothing particularly complicated, but it is interesting, particularly because the scenarios aren't totally hamhanded or arbitrarily devided into "good option" and "evil option".  Not to say it's perfect or deep - but it can lead to engaging and occasionally mildly disturbing results.\n\nIf you enjoy NES-era Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games then you'll likely have a good time; to be more specific it almost feels like a mix of the experimental vibe of Final Fantasy II with Dragon Quest III's large world and flexible party setups set loose in a non-linear world with some consquences that can actually be noticed.","January 28","true","23.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

If you're still with me, read on.\n\nI've seen AA described as an "open world jrpg" in the vein of Skyrim etc, and while it is more open ended than your Dragon Quests and Final Fantasies, there's no level scaling to speak of, so it's made linear in the same way DQ was; you cross a bridge, and a monster one shots you.\n\nBut taken just as a JRPG, it's a good one. The overall story set up is paper thin ("swamp king evil, go kill"), but there are all sorts of smaller stories as you progress through the game and help/hinder people, all of which is reflected in the ending you get.\n\nThe gameplay is substantial enough to sink your teeth into, but it's not too long. The dungeons are brief, never really longer than 15 minutes (which is good, because the only place you can save is the inn, and there's no quicksave). I didn't grind once -- I think I walked back and forth to trigger a battle for exp/gold approximately five to six times total in my play through. Progressing in this way the bosses had a decent ramp. Feeling challenging, but letting me beat them by changing tactics rather than grinding.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks. It's an RPG Maker game, which I've no problem with, but the underlying engine has some technical issues; the fullscreen mode has a low framerate on my machine, and controller binding is a bit of a mission.\n\nYou gain skills by collecting 'artifacts', rather than getting them by levelling up. When you encounter an artifact, it gives you a semi-cryptic speech about what it does, and you choose to whom you'll give it to. Most of the time this wasn't an issue, but it can lead to some suprises and loading your save if that artifact did something you didn't expect. Also, some of the dungeon layouts are not so great, with similar rooms joined by similar corridors.\n\nSo, if you can stomach NES era JRPGs, give AA a shot.","June 19, 2015","true","34.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unfamiliarceiling/recommended/359440/","unfamiliarceiling","UnfamiliarCeiling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unfamiliarceiling/","1390 products in account","The concept for this game is excellent. I love the idea of taking the traditional 8-bit RPG and giving it more meat and options. The fact that you can up your own difficulty level right away by trimming down your party is pretty clever, and I like the non-linear approach to the game.\n\nCombat and magic-wise, if you've played the NES you know what to expect. Turn based, straightforward, a little grindy but that's not always a bad thing.\n\nIn addition, the dialogue is pretty well written. We have a good balance between typical RPG-trope prompts and hints, mixed in with some decent framing and a couple tongue-in-cheek jokes along the way. It's not mandatory to talk to every NPC, but I think it's worth your time.\n\nTons of different ways to approach the game and really just a pleasant trip down a memory lane you've never walked. If you enjoyed the RPGs of the 8 and 16 bit generations you'll have a good time here, and seven bucks is definitely a good price for this much re-playability.","June 4, 2015","true","32.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You'll recognize the tunes, you'll remember the sprites and the tile sets, you'll relive the journey through the caves and push forward to get that one last treasure before the long trek back out the cave.  You'll cheer as you roll a critical hit at just the right moment, and you'll cry as your last hero falls to a random encounter.  You already know what to expect from just the screenshots... but the game is so much deeper than that.\n\nArtifact Adventure is a simple tale of four heroes who journey the lands, building strength and helping others on their quest to kill the Evil Swamp King.  The game has been available on Playism for a while, but just released on steam where it makes good company among the other retro-indie inspired JRPGS.  The game has the "hook" of choice.  Something that's familiar to many fans of modern RPGs like Dragon Age or The Witcher; choice is a large element of this game.  However, the choices don't lead you down a "good" or "bad" ending.. but instead open you up to over 70 different endings in the game.  Choices are varied enough to make each town and each event interesting.\n\nDo you tell the old man his son is dead, or soften the blow with a white lie?  Do you help some stranger poison a guard to steal a relic, at a great profit to you - or protect the relic and secure the town's future.  These choices matter, and have a lasting impact on the world.  A rarity in this type of game.  Also, not all choices are black and white, with choices having impacts you don't immediately realize.\n\nThe first choice given to you is by the king.  He asks you to pick between an airship, powerful magics, and the Key of Time.  Once you make your choice, you are locked out from the others.  This is just a taste of the choice system included in this game.  Truly a treat.  There is no "right" choice, and its not a binary one.  You have three options, which is actually pretty common in this game.  You can even choose not to choose... something i'm exceptionally pleased to see in a game.\n\nConclusion:  If you love NES era JRPGS, Christmas came early this year.  If you prefer high graphics hold-your-hands style gameplay with quest logs and high quality cinematics, move along, this won't be your jam.

You're free to go pretty much anywhere you want, provided you have the gear to survive the encounters in tougher areas.\n\nOn top of that, the game takes a very Western RPG approach to the questing, with many areas having sidequests that in turn will affect the ending when you finally save the world or give up and sail home. Your choices have impact, and sometimes what may seem like the morally correct choice is the wrong one in the long run.\n\nAs for the titular Artifacts, they're how you learn all your spells in this title, as opposed to every class having its own predetermined spellset.\n\nWhat really makes the game interesting though is the choice you get at the start of the game which in turn will heavily affect your progeession. Do you:\n\nA) Take the Airship so you can go virtually anywhere in the game's world right from the start?\nB) Take the extra Artifacts for a stat boost at the game's start to give your party some extra fighting power?\nC) Take the Key of Time in order to learn more about the game's lore, get unique items you won't find anywhere else, and unlock a special fast travel network?\n\nIt's all up to you. Throughout the game, you'll do everything from foil bandit schemes to saving kidnapped children, and even less expected things like preventing the ressurection of Chtulhu-esque Deep Ones by evil cults. Oh, and you'll learn how to talk Crab.  Through your questing, you'll gain money, gear, and Artifacts to unlock new spells, all leading up to a confrontation with the main antagonist, the Swamp King, who you could theoretically take on at any point, though without preparation, you'll probably die.\n\nCombat is simple, oldschool turn based combat. Pick actions, watch things happen based on RNG. If you've played Dragon Warrior, you know what to expect here. Simple combat that gets the job done with no real fancy bells or whistles. But hey, it works.\n\nIt's the first time I've purchased an RPGMaker VX Ace based game on Steam, but I do not regret that purchase, as it's making my inner child squee due to sheer nostalgia.\n\nIf you enjoyed the 8-bit JRPGs of the 80s and 90s, get it.","June 3, 2015","true","14.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azure_knight/recommended/359440/","azure_knight","Onyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azure_knight/","91 products in account","In a sentence this game is about old-school RPG gameplay. There's power gaming, story, and lots of replayability. You control 4 schmucksor just 1 and a wad of dirty slaver cashon a quest to slay the Swamp King and halt the creeping poison from consuming the world. There are many quests and moral dilemmas you will face as you rise to be the heros the world deserves, but history is never silent; are your swords, fists, and guns good enough to remain pure?\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like J/RPGS. That being said, here's some more details and greivances:\n\nThere's 3 primary paths that will give power gamers a lot of variation in playstyle: Airship, Key of Light, and 4 artifacts that each have an associated skill & stat boost. In all honesty the stat boost path is boring, the only nice thing about it is the literature spell which can be very satisfying way of wiping out an encounter or boss. The Key of Time opens paths otherwise unavailable to the player and follows along with a more linear path than the airship.\n\nHoly jar goblins Batman! Let me tell you about the beauty that is the airship\n\nThe airship can be acquired within 3 minutes of starting a new game with no difficulty whatsoever and it appeals to the power gamer more than every other option. It stops encounters, takes you all over the world (outside of a few areas that are related to a quest that you can't land on sort of deal), and gives you access to far more power far more quickly than the other options. With clever planning you can even weasel your way to level 10-13 and over 200,000 gold, soaring all around the world completing quests at theheavyexpense of the NPCs in a little under 30 minutes. Every quest is open to you (outside of tiered quests with 1-2 prerequisite quests) as soon as you start the game. It is without a doubt what every power gamer would be questing for hours on end for and the King is ready for you to take it without even slaying a slime Mite. I love the airship.\n\nThe game has a couple of classes, but a Warrior and Mage Shaman form the core of every easier to play party. The warrior is the most expensive, requiring gold to get the most out of his tankiness. I believe that the enemies target the party members towards the front more often, which is why you want him looking shiny. The Wizard Shaman goes in the back as he is the best healer and spell caster. No spells are learned by leveling up, only stats are gained, and you have to get artifacts which are only teachable to one character and then they're gone. So make sure you don't accidentally teach your Warrior that super powerful spell that you really need to beat a boss or you'll have wasted that resource forever unless you saved recently. The other classes include Explorer who's special ability is to be good with guns, the ArcherHermit who's ability is to be able to use bows, Monk who's is to be able to take double rounds of attacking along with critting more often but is better without a weapon. Finally, there's Red Magesincorrectly translated for some reason the developer wanted to call them dreamerwho are what you expect with their only special ability being universal compatibility with equipment.\n\nI personally prefer a Warrior, Monk, Hermit, Shaman setup. I've seen people recommend playing with 2 Warrior + 2 Shaman, but you will waste a lot of equipment that way since the warriors won't make use of any bows/guns/lighter armor while the Shaman will have difficulty until later in the game when you have more spells that you have picked up along with equipment as Shaman equipment isn't often came by, leaving them prone to getting randomly focused down by encounters. If you were to do a solo run I would recommend the Monk or Dreamer, but I don't really recommend you do a solo run as the game was not designed with that much in thoughbut you can make some mad bucks doing so.\n\nProgression is very clear and laid out but it's also laid out in such a way that you've got options. You don't have to find every quest, but you'll want to do at least a few around every area so that you aren't struggling against the grind. While the game isn't especially grindy it does punish death harshly (and oddly). Warriors cost far more to resurrectwhich is also why having 1 warrior is nice to not have to foot a huge bill to the Witch Doctorthan other classes for some reason, and resurrecting costs big time after you've got a few levels on you. This is one of the most frustrating things about the game as you're first playing; you don't know where to go, what to fight, how to fight well, and what you do know to fight takes 15 minutes to safely level up on. On top of that there are no classes that start out with a heal so you will soon learn to stockpile on herbs until you find your first healing artifactyou did take at least 1 class with some MP...right?. Once you make it to about level 15 or so the cost of reviving becomes quite low and there are 2 revive spells along with an artifact that will revive a second character if your party wipes, which greatly alleviates this pain. Still, I found this incredibly annoying before I was able to avoid beginner deaths.\n\nQuests come in the form of a few decisions that result in different rewards. Now some rewards are clearly better but aren't available to compare until you actually make the decision and end up with an item or artifact that you would have rather traded in for the other. While you can keep playing with it and try to roll with the punches it gets a little bit too rough if you haven't geared up your warrior in a while and really need a new sword only to be given a gun when you have no explorer. Quests also give a little amount of experience but it's really all about the rewards. At the end of the game you get to see a different ending depending on your decisions for each quest, only a few have a single outcome. Also, there's no quest log so you gotta make sure you commit the information to memory.\n\nCombat is about being prepared, not so much being smart. Some enemies have type resistances and the auto-fight option is quite stupid at times, but you will quickly realize what hits what harder. Bosses are not too hard if your party composition isn't terrible and you have a decent combination of levels, gear, and spells. That being said you need to get a non-item source of healing ASAP since there are no advanced healing items and herbs stop being very effective after level 5. Sometimes the enemies randomly target your backline and others they do nothing but hit your warrior. You'll want to have your warrior defend a lot later on in the game as you need to specialize each character's role in battle. Later in the game you will also be able to afford arrows and bullets more if you chose to take a bow or gun wielding character, but early in the game they're practically impossible to afford while not packing the bang for your buck.\n\nStory wise the game is decent and pokes holes in traditional tropes of the genre while remaining faithful to the traditional RPG style of story like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. There's no overarching theme being pushed on the player that they are forced to adopt, but every consequence of your actions are visible, sometimes even only if after the end. You're best left to judge for yourself.\nOther Stuff that annoyed me:\n-NPC blocking\n-Not being able to flee from encounters that I could wipe in 1 turn in auto\n-Some encounters have terrible experience relative to how much damage the enemies deal/take\n-Sometimes I don't get my stats restored when leveling up and I have no idea why\n-Poison is too strong\n-I've played this much and still find myself troubled to identify towns properly at times","May 22","true","51.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you find an artifact, sometimes it gives you a party wide special power, and sometimes it assigns a power to the first character in your party, which in my case is a warrior. Warrior get no int or mana, so in this case the special power/spell will be unusable. So before finding an artifact you have to open up party management, switch the tank with a spell caster, and use the artifact. Then you have to open up party management and switch the tank back to the first party spot. Then you look at the spell you learned and guess at what it does, based upon the description, which doesn't give you any numbers so you won't know how much damage it will do, etc.","June 3, 2015","false","2.5"," 27 of 58 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","27","58","0","2"

The game is awful.  The controls use the ARROW KEYS?!  Did I fall through a time portal into the 80s?  It would explain the graphics at least.  Not that the graphics are a problem, I'm all for retro style graphics.  So the game gives you no direction as to what to do at the beginning, and even if you go into combat you can basically mash the spacebar and you'll win.  Did I mention the combat?  You can't click anywhere on the hud to do things.  You use the arrow keys and spacebar for everything in the game.  This is awful!  I WANT WASD CONTROLS!  Did I mention it's basically a Final fantasy rip off.  I'm not just saying that because it's a jrpg but you have 4 heroes with 10 classes that are all the same besides using different weapons.   It doesn't have any of the GOOD things about FF though.  This game is awful.  I rate it -2/10.

The first game I played first on Steam that I've completed.  The decisions that impact the endings made me restart because I wasn't happy with what I chose (and often, you wind up choosing before you realize it).  Almost want to play again to try something completely different with the class set-up.  And the early choice between Artifacts, Airship, or Key of Time impacts the way you play the entirely game.\n\nThe story is not the driving factor in the game (something something kill the bad guy), but each town has a sort of identity.  And what you choose to do will determine what happens to those places.  Not every result is as obvious as you'd think!\n\nI bought it on sale, but having played it, I would have paid full price, as I am sure I will go back and replay this again.","May 25","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's good, if you like those kind of things! The look and sound is pretty charming, it's not just some thrown out sprites and beeps because the creator can't do any better.\n\nYou're just thrown out into the wild with vague clue on what you're supposed to do, and go wild. At the beginning you get choices of artifact to start the game, that wildly change how the game plays. One of them is an airship for example, that let you go wherever you want in the world /right at the beginning of the game/. It's really fun.\n\nBy the nature of it, and choices in the game, most likely you won't be able to do everything in one run through. That's how it's supposed to be.\n\nBut if you don't like 8bit graphic and interface, mostly nonexistant storyline, classic jrpg turn based combat, and hints mentioned by townspeople that aren't recorded in-game, I guess you won't like it.","June 4","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
