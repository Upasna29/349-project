Valiant Hearts adds a human element to the game that is missing from a lot of these war games that we see and is a fresh break from the whole "Kill kill kill" mindset you need for those games.  The majority of Valiant Hearts is done through puzzles.  The player needs to find ways to navigate around in the game, and do it by using their smarts rather than their trigger fingers.  There are indeed parts where you do attack the enemies (you have to so they don't detect you and end the game), so it isn't just puzzles.  Each of the characters are very likable and have their own unique stories, motivations, and reasons for getting involved in "The Great War" - and the best part is that those reasons, like these characters, are all believable.\n\nValiant Hearts also does well in capturing the nightmare that was World War I, and does it without graphic depictions of blood, gore and violence that is prevalent in games set in war.  In the final chapter of this game the full scope of exactly how brutal and bloody this whole sordid affair was becomes obvious (there is a part where you have to take cover from machine gun fire by hiding behind solid cover- a few piles of dead soldiers are used this way at one point).  There are also many very interesting facts this game presents about WWI that most players may not have known, so history buffs and fact lovers are going to be in for some good info.  In my opinion, it is not only good to see a game that is set in WWI when most game studios seem to prefer WWII (perhaps it is because of the "noble cause" of the allies in that conflict), but Valliant Hearts takes both an unflinching and unapologetic look at the first World War and presents something as vile as trench warfare in a manner that is much more palatable than a shoot 'em up sort of game would have been.\n\nJust a heads up, though: Valiant Hearts FORCES you to download and install UPlay.  This is a fact that is not READILY visible on the store page unless you have enhanced Steam (which I do not).  While that fact may not have prevented me from getting this game, I just don't want to HAVE to download a new DRM console every time I get a new game from a different publisher.","June 25, 2014","true","10.6"," 1,334 of 1,408 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","334","1","0","53"

I couldn't have been more wrong.\nThe game will last you about 5-6 hours, which is well worth the normal $15 that this game goes for. If you see this on sale for any less, buy it instantly.\nThe game is simple to learn, with challenges that will stretch your brain, but once you figure them out you'll think "My god, I'm an idiot".\nThe story of this game is the main thing that will keep you playing this game. You easily get attatched to the charecters. They will make you laugh, cry, worry, smile, and laugh out loud. There are plenty of plot twists to keep things interesting, but not so many that the story is hard to follow.\nThe game displays plenty of historical facts about the time period, and place, that you are playing in the game. While you are motly never directly tied to the events except for a few level designs, it was refreshing to get some background information about the world, and the war, while you go through it.\n\n\nTL;DR version\n+great story\n+great characters and development\n+simple, yet challenging missions\n+realitvely cheap for what you're getting out of it\n+The BEST intergration with music that I have ever seen in a video game\n\n-first time I've cried over a video game since Mass Effect 3's revamped endings\n","November 3, 2014","true","6.6"," 249 of 258 people (97%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","97","249","258","16","0"

As soon you start the game the first thing you will notice is the simple yet very creative art-style from the world during dark times. With brights colors and a very warm design, soon you find that while the cartoon style may try to tone down some aspects of the true events of war, the pages of the Diaries as well the photographies from these past events may hit you. I dare to say that, depending on your sensitivity one or two can actually make you feel uncomfortable, but war never was a pleasing sight to start.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite simple but it’s strong enough to make a nice companion here and there or even on those tiny bits when you find a solution to a puzzle or when are about to discover something related to the main plot. You can expect one or two plot twists but it’s nothing serious, yet, the story managed to keep me hooked until the very end. I simply couldn’t stop until I found out what happened to them, and I’m glad for being able to experience this game from start to finish without feeling any sort of boredom. There was however, some emotions which brings the next point.\n\nThe game may offer a big contrast depending on who is playing and how someone plays a game. If you play for a mere completionist purpose or because you simply like to play videogames, you will find a 6-8 hours long depending on how much time you take to discover the solutions to the puzzles or if you are interested in collecting every hidden object. However, this game offers much, much more depth. It’s clear that the creators did their homework and worked hard to deliver great content for those interested in the culture of war. The “Facts” are filled with a variety of knowledge from all sorts of equipment, weapons, special events, conditions from the soldiers such diseases and locations where this war took place. Since a little bit of knowledge is always welcome I found this to be a satisfying surprise to see in a 2D game. Then there is the immersion. I felt for it and I’m glad I did. By letting myself "fall" into the game I could enjoy the Story as it might be intended by the creators. A warm hearth will love the constant ups and downs that the player will experience. This game did not made me laugh, but it did made me smile quite sometimes and while It didn’t made me cry, it made me a bit emocional because they created a story showing the horrors of war, where when you are faced with a bit of hope, it quickly dies and you are in deep trouble yet again.\n\nIt’s not a fair story, there are no heroes, there is no right or wrong, only wrong because this game showed how pointless and destructive is the war. The letters who are based from real ones, written by the people back then showed how the quick turn of events made regular people into soldiers and how bonds like family and brotherhood can play a decisive role during such times.\n\nI honestly hope anyone can play this game with a open heart and look at it as a mean, cruel time-machine who let you experience a tale of the horrors that happened during war and how love can patch a wound, offer hope or give the only strength to sustain such adversities when all seems lost and pointless.","June 26, 2014","true","9.2"," 297 of 319 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","297","319","0","12"

It's mix of simple yet interesting puzzling and storytelling, combined with its gorgeous visuals make a game well worth it's price. While the driving scenes act like a rhythm game, trying to dodge various things popping up on your screen, they don't distract from the overall game.\n\nThe story of the first world war is somewhat simpled down to make a game that could be played by a young child, perhaps to teach them about the war. However, the diary and history facts littered throughout the game allow you to delve into the history and the story of WWI.\n\nYour faithful canine companion gives some depth to the puzzles, and also a character to feel for and love. Even though the characters themselves aren't developed massively, you can connect with them on a personal level.\n\nOverall, Valiant Hearts gets an 8/10.","June 25, 2014","true","6.1"," 347 of 388 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","347","388","0","3"

A mix of a beautifully composed musical score, stellar artwork, great story, impressive puzzles, and real life historical content. This game actually made me think about the collectibles and ponder the historical facts as much as I did the story at times.\n\nSet during World War I (The Great War), Valiant Hearts gives you a look at individuals in war and how this particular group of individuals finds themselves connected. A German man married to a French woman who is forced to go back to Germany and fight. His father-in-law forced to fight for France. An American who befriends the Frenchman. A female doctor that finds herself crossing paths with all of them. Then there is Walt, the war dog, who becomes their ally, friend, and savior at times. While they all may battle for different reasons, countries, or leaders, they all care for one another. They all find ways to help one another overcome struggles, support one another in troubles, and connect to one another as humans rather than enemies.\n\nWhile the art style is cartoonish, you feel immersed with its very stylized and life-like animation. Faces and body language are done well so that you can see the story without having to hear dialogue. Even most of the speech bubbles are only pictures to give you clues as to how to solve the puzzles, or where you should go. The puzzles that are incorporated into the gameplay are interesting and clever at times. They aren't overly difficult, but a few make you feel like you figured something clever out. They are easy enough to keep frustration low and you focused on the story.\n\nBesides puzzles there are quite a few action sequences. This makes the genre tip a bit away from a point and click adventure as it would seem from the outside. These action sequences aren't hardcore fighting, or anything extremely daunting, but there is a lot of interacting with objects and other people in the game to push it away from a traditional puzzle solving adventure game. You even have a pet dog named Walt that you can have fetch you items, pull levers that you can't do, or have him distract an enemy while you slip in and steal something you need. It adds a nice change to just simply having to solve puzzles in the old fashioned way. You can actually die in the game as well, although it is only about 2 seconds of time lost if you do. Dodging bombs, bullets, and even driving sequences become part of some action sequences that keeps you on your toes and gives certain battle heavy chapters more immersion. Then there is what many may feel is annoying, the doctor rhythm quick time event sequences. They aren't difficult to pass, but can seem annoying to some with slow reactions.\n\nWithin the game there are dozens of collectible items that are some of the best collectibles for any game I have ever played. Each chapter has 4-6 of them where you must find items that are pieces of war memorabilia. You will find things from war helmets, dog tags, items that soldiers made themselves to pass time, and even things like bars of soap. Each items carries with it an explanation of its historical uses in the war. You will see some very interesting and thought provoking items here. Sometimes you will find old letters from soldiers to family, or wives. Everything is quite interesting and adds a lot to the overall feel of the time period and the war. Some of these items are even from contest winners who shared things their ancestors had with them during The Great War and were used in the game. All of these are materials and collectibles you will want to read, and find not for some Achievement and completionist ideal, but because they are just that interesting that you want to see what their story is. They put a human face on the war with a bit of a shared humanity and recognition. They make you consider what it was like to be a soldier based on the things they carried, and this is why they are such a great addition. These are items that we can understand because they are simple and we can put them into the context of how they were used while in the battlefield.\n\nOn top of all these collectible items you get historical data that will explain the real life battles that you are playing in the game, talk about all aspects of war from the economics, farming, civilian life, military police, and many, many others. All this additional material is fascinating and a phenomenal addition to the game. Some of these items, or histories had me pondering war and just how horrible it must have been as a soldier in these battles. Trench warfare, the weather, barbed wire, the mud. Even the idea that they were fighting in mines underground where enemies would set explosives below them to have them crushed. They really tried to give you a sense of the reality of it in this material.\n\nValiant Hearts is a complete adventure game that excels in all areas. It is a polished experience with lovely art, a soundtrack worthy of separate purchase, and a “feels” story. It has some of the best collectibles and supporting material of any game I have played.  I would recommend this game to any fan of story games. Especially those of you that like to feel some emotion. Point and click gamers should be fine with it, but realize that there will be some action sequences that you may get a bit frustrated with if you don’t have OK reflexes, but I would still give it a chance because it is worth it.\n\nIncluded are 3 card drops. There are NO Steam Achievements in the game because...this is a uPlay game. It does have uPlay Achievements, but who cares about those. uPlay I had to go online just to paste the CD key in after I bought it, then I put it in offline mode immediately and never had to go back online. The game will start from your Steam Library, although it will launch uPlay before running the game every time. Since I already have about 5 uPlay games I have no issues with it. If you do then either buy it on a console, directly from uPlay, or don't buy it at all. Your loss. ;)","July 16, 2015","true","26.6"," 162 of 177 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","162","177","9","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CappnRob/recommended/260230/","CappnRob","Casino Cowboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CappnRob/","99 products in account","Valiant Hearts is a puzzle-platforming game with a rather unique subject matter: World War I. Instead of shooting waves of enemies or commanding massive faceless armies as is the usual in most war games, Valiant Hearts instead decides to focus on the lives of several characters with WWI merely serving as the backdrop that changes their lives forever. The main cast of characters are Emile, a Frenchman getting on in his years who is conscripted into service despite his age; Karl, a German living in France who is married to Emile's daughter Marie; Freddie, an African American Creole who enlisted in the French military to avenge a loved one; Anna, a Belgian field medic who's father designs weapons for the Germans; and Marie, the daughter of Emile and wife of Karl who struggles to maintain her family farm as the war escalates.\n\nThis game is first and foremost about its story. Not just the written story per se; in fact there is very little spoken dialogue that isn't from the interlevel narrations and most of the in game diction is handled through speech bubbes with cartoonish graphics inside them along with body gestures. Rather, this game is about story in a much deeper and meaningful way, its about how these characters as well as the minor and even nameless NPCs are shaped and affected by the terrible war around them. It says so much with very little, letting the emotions and feelings of the situation grab ahold of you and fill it in itself. There's no egregious monologues or exposition or self-indulgent angst; just pure humanity in all of its forms, and it touches you in a very personal way because you really feel for what these characters are going through.\n\nNow the game itself, as a game, is nothing too terrilbly spectacular: it is about a 10 or so hour game given or take a few more for finding all of the hidden items (it can't be an Ubisoft game without a hundred odd pickups, could it?) with basic sidescrolling and controls. You move left and right, can climb over ledges and sneak behind cover when permitted, perform context specific actions as well as character specific ones (such as using Emile's shovel to dig through tunnels), all while solving modest item based puzzles where you pull levels and turn wheels and blow up walls or unlock doors. It is honestly nothing groundbreaking or new, and the puzzle solving is broken up with a handful of obstacle course style driving levels (which are my personal favorite) and the occasional quicktime event. Nothing about the gameplay is truly spectacular, but it is adequate enough to serve its purpose and keep you interested in progressing.\n\nHowever, while the gameplay might be standard fare, everything else does truly stand out. Along with the story, the game has a beautifully composed original soundtrack, as well as a few classical bits too (Brahms's Hungarian Dance no. 5, the French Cancan, Flight of the Bumblebee, and Night on Bald Mountain all play during the various driving segments). The art direction is simplistic and charming, but deceptively dark and grim when it needs to be (and given the subject matter, that is often). Backgrounds are beautifully illustrated and detailed, and character animations are smooth and well made. There are collectibles as said before, over 100 items spread throughout most of the game's 20+ levels which are divided into four chapters. These items are all historically researched and finding them adds an entry to the in-game "Wiki" describing what it is, what it was for, and why it came to be during WWI. There is also more history to be found every level with short articles about what is relevent to the current level: be it a battlefield history, an elaboration on colonial army units, or chemical warfare. The game goes the extra mile to really help you feel what it was like to live during this time and in turn that helps you better associate with the characters in the story.\n\nUltimately, Valiant Hearts is a simplistic and unassuming puzzle sidescroller that has a LOT of heart and soul in it. Beyond the so-so gameplay is a gripping and upsetting tale of one the 20th century's greatest catastrophes, uncensored and unabashed in a beautiful package that serves to keep the past alive and help us never forget the tragedies that were had. Forgive the underwhelming gameplay and let everything else engross you and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I have. It is a work of art.","November 16, 2014","true","13.4"," 91 of 93 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","91","93","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/260230/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a puzzle adventure game, developed and published by Ubisoft, being released in 2014, on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One, and with a further port to Android and IOS. Valiant Hearts is also made by the same team that developed another original IP from Ubisoft, Child of Light.\n\nGameplay wise, whilst this is a puzzle adventure game, there are no really generic puzzles, and they are only puzzles if you think about it specifically when you are playing. The game takes place during "The Great War", and you play the role of a couple of different characters throughout the story, an American soldier named Freddie, a Belgian Nurse named Anna, a Frenchman named Emile, and his German son-in-law, Karl. All four of these characters have their own story and all cross paths throughout the game.  At the core, the game is a side scrolling adventure game, as you have to either find certain items to progress, solve puzzles or defeat bosses. A lot of the game is also revolved around avoiding fire fights with enemies, so using bunkers and trenches to avoid fire is also something you should get used to.  Each of the characters also has their own special ability. Anna is able to heal patients via a quick time event; Freddie is able to cut through barbed wire, whilst Emile has a spade which allows him to dig tunnels in the ground to get around certain obstacles.\n\nThe graphics in Valiant Hearts are very nice. Whilst they are not high quality ultra-realistic, they do present a nicely drawn out look to the game. These are some of the best 2D graphics I have seen in a game and they really fit the setting well.\n\nValiant Hearts also has one of the most compelling and interesting stories to be seen in a very long time too. As you play as all four main characters, you learn about their history and how the war is affecting their lives, more than the expected misery. This game will pull on your heart strings and may even bring a tear to your eye at parts. You get attached to all of the characters instantly and will be immersed completely into its world.\n\nThis is another game that has a major role in it for a narrator, and most of the story is told through his voice. The main characters in the game, whilst they do speak, they don't speak very much. The story is mostly told through their facial expressions and the narration. The rest of the sound effects are really good too, there are plenty of ambient sounds in each level to really draw you further into the immersion to make you feel like you are actually there in the trenches. A couple of the levels also have some classic musical sound tracks, such as the can-can when you are escaping Paris as Anna.\n\nValiant Hearts is not a difficult game to complete; all of the puzzles are easy enough that you can work them out without much effort, but not so easy that you can breeze through without any thinking involved. Sometimes the most difficult aspect of the game can be when you are trying to maybe go a little bit too quick for yourself and end up running into bullets when you should really be taking it a little bit slower and hiding in cover. I think if the game had incorporated puzzles which were too difficult, that it may have ruined the immersion of the game if it forced you to look up guides to progress. The fact that even I (someone who is horrendous at puzzle games) was able to finish the game without a walkthrough just shows how easy the game can be.\n\nThis games levels are so widely explorable, and there is so much to find and interact with too. You can get some form of dialog out of the majority of the other characters in game, but nothing more than maybe a few special grunts, or speech bubbles with pictures in, which maybe a clue of some form for your puzzle, or something completely unrelated. Each level also has a couple of hidden objects which you can set out to find, these bear no influence on the game play, and are merely there for the complentionists.\n\nValiant Hearts is split into four chapters, and a full play through of all four chapters took me just under ten hours, for me that is the absolute perfect length for any story driven game, as it allows all of the loose ends to be tied up sufficiently and still leaves you wanting just that little bit more. There are achievements in the game, but are not linked to Steam since this uses uPlay, but you can go off hunting for them too. There is however no reason to play it through for a second time, the story is linear and will not change in anyway depending on how you play.\n\nI didn't have any technical problems whilst playing. The game has full controller support, but also works perfectly well with a keyboard and mouse. I personally went with the controller just for the ease of being able to sit back in my chair and enjoy the story. The game did not drop below 60 fps at any point and has a really nicely built in auto save feature too. Some people may be put off with the need for uPlay to play, however it's not exactly like its intrusive when you are playing, and it’s simply not a major problem; so please don't be put off by the DRM on the game.\n\nI loved this game, it was one of the few games I was able to get fully immersed into and played it from start to finish in one day - I just had to find out the ending of all the characters. I completely and utterly recommend Valiant Hearts to anyone; this is a must play game for me even if you aren't a fan of adventure puzzle games, you will still enjoy it immensely.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

A bit of a pain, but worth it if you love a good story!\n\nThe screen resolution is adjustable anywhere from 640x480 through 1980x1020, and you can play Windowed if you wish.  We have separate sliders for sound effects, music, and brightness, and if you want subtitles, they are NOT the default.  Luckily you can adjust the settings at any time.  If you're using the keyboard you can rebind the keys to whatever you wish, but the controller buttons are not adjustable.  Speaking of which, we have full-controller support on this title.\n\nThe game is rich in history, though dosed out in segments small enough to keep one from getting overwhelmed (or bored ^_~ ) if not a history buff.  These tidbits are easily accessible, and while it's not required reading, it surely enriches the story!  In addition to the facts that are unlocked as you play, there are 100 collectibles, and each has its own story to tell.  We also have a diary with separate entries, which I didn't realize until later on in the game.  The diary, like the hints, is accessible through the game menu (hit Esc.)\n\nSpeaking of hints, there are multiple modes of play -- regular and veteran.  I believe you have to complete regular mode before you can access veteran mode, however.  Hints, if you wish to use them, are tiered, and give you a picture of one of the steps you'll need to take to progress in the game.\n\nWe play as multiple characters, giving us varied views of the war and its toll.  These characters' stories are beautifully weaved together in a touching story.  The gameplay is a combination of point-and-click, puzzles, light platforming, and arcade-like action scenes.  Anyone looking for a thrilling ride, rife with action and glory might want to look elsewhere, as the compelling story is the driving force behind this game, and it's the story that will keep bringing you back to the game.\n\nThe narrator will explain things as we transition, and his voice works beautifully with the story.  Our characters' voices, on the other hand, are intentionally garbled -- you don't actually need to understand what they're saying.  It may sound strange, but it really does work well.  Any person you see who has ' . . . ' over their heads means you need to "talk" to them.  You will see what they want or need via images in speech bubbles.  It's not terribly hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing -- most of the time when I was stuck it was because I had missed seeing an exit or some such. :p\n\nI highly highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, with one caveat:  Some of the action scenes need to have quick reactions, and I know that some of my friends have issues with this kind of thing.  Let me give you an example.  This will not be a spoiler as long as you don't watch the whole video -- Just watch the first ten seconds or so:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saKbYGB7JwA\n\nI had to redo the above-referenced kind of scene more than once, but that is not the part of the game I'm worried about.  There are sequences where you have to press buttons quickly in succession, switching around between buttons, and sometimes hitting more than once button at a time.  I don't know how well I would have done if I'd been on the keyboard instead of a controller!  I can't give you a visual of what I'm talking about without potentially spoiling some of the story, just be warned!\n\nI finished the game in somewhere between four and five hours -- not really certain since I got interrupted a few times.  Remember those collectibles I mentioned at the beginning of the review?  It turns out that you can replay any part of the game you wish in order to gather all of the collectibles!  Go to the Chapters & Collection section of the main menu, and you will be able to see how many items you gathered, and how many you missed for each section.  Personally I think it would be better to go back to get some of these rather than grab them as you play, as sometimes they're sitting out in the open during a time when you could easily get killed!  It interrupts the flow of the story a bit to stop and examine these things during the action sequences.\n\nValiant Hearts: The Great War is a moving journey that kept me guessing 'til the end, and had me happily learning about the first World War (history is NOT my forte).  I really did love playing this game, and recommend checking it out if the above review appeals to you.","January 3, 2015","true","7.9"," 101 of 109 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","101","109","7","5"

Probably one of the biggest suprises of 2014 for myself, I had only first heard of and seen this game during the trailer that was shown during E3.  Even during that time I had no idea how the game would play, but the interesting visual artstyle caught my eye.  I played the game over a course of 4 days (1 chapter a day) and it played out well as each Chapter was broken into 6-7 sections each that would have you switching over the course of 4 characters, telling how their stories interweave with each other in a war ravaged time.\n\nThe game itself plays like many adventures games before it where you are tasked to use the enviroment and items around you in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game.  I just felt something special about how they mixed the gameplay perfectly with the art sometimes during what you would think are cutscenes, are scenes you are actually playing yourself.  Another surprise for me was how well they had woven the boss battles into the game, with each chapter having at least 1.  In between the chapters where you are solving puzzles, you also have fun minigames that also fit perfect with the story being told, whether it's you being a medic and having to time presses to keep someones heart going so they don't die, or driving away from a whole bunch of bombs in a car minigame that actually goes along to the rhythm of the music.  Just pure amazement all around for a game that I thought would be more just a story with a few interactive moments.  There are even items to collect for those that wish to truly investigate each part of the world (I ended up with 82/100 collectibles) and each collectible has it's own history and write up in the menu section.\n\nThis brings me to the story of the game.  It's really hard to say much without spoiling anything in the game.  It's about 4 different lives all from different countries affected by the war, and their tale of hardship and friendship.  The story will have it's high happy notes, but also very low times once the game is reaching it's conclusion.  The ending of all things is what got me the most.  Those who have finished it know what I mean, but just the fact that the finale is playable just adds that much more emotion to it.  Also <3 Doggie\n\nThe game is done all the better by a amazing soundtrack, and the shining gem of Ubisoft, the UbiART engine.  What you see in the screenshots on this steam store page are all actual playable portions in the game.  The animation is just done so perfectly, and a game where the art can be so bright, vibrant and colorful is also to display huge emotions of despair and sorrow within the actual images itself.  In fact most of the story of Valiant Hearts is told through it's art, and the short narration sequences at the beginning of each level. The characters themselves do say words in their native languages, but it's usually simple commands or just them being relieved, but they leave the storytelling up to the brilliance of the UbiART engine.\n\nHonestly this is my favorite game to have been released so far in 2014, and was a huge surpirse to me as I don't have much experience with Adventure games in the first place and didn't expect to fall in love with this game as much as I did.","July 2, 2014","true","18.9"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","85","90","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinovera/recommended/260230/","sinovera","Sinovera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinovera/","1537 products in account","-SPOILER FREE-\nWithout a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. The graphic style is cartoony but the story and theme are deep and touching. The puzzles were great, gameplay was fun... and all the while, the story moved you. I don't even know how to really recommend this game other than: play it. It's an amazing experience.\n\nIf you've played the game and you're here to read other people's thoughts, read on. Otherwise, be warned, there are **SPOILERS** from here on out.\n\n-REVIEW WITH SPOILERS-\n\nValiant Hearts is now among my top games. I'm not going to say it's a perfect game: it's not. But for me it was an amazing experience.\n\nThe graphics of the game might turn some people off... You know, the people who want realism all the time and want life-like HD textures. Well, VH is one of those games that prove realism isn't everything. I loved the art style of this game. It does what it needs to do: It's attractive, appealing, yet clear. It artistic enough to be pretty and illustrate what's going on but simple enough to keep the focus on the story.\n\nSame with the game play. It's not overly difficult but entertaining enough to keep you playing and interested; and simple enough to keep the focus on the story. Most puzzles in the game are fairly straight forward. Yet I still got that little feeling of accomplishment as I solved them and moved forward.\n\nThe more action packed parts of the game also served their function well. There is obviously no emulating the feel of actually being in the battle field and having bombs raining down on you nor is that the game's purpose. It strives to ride that balance between showing the player a bit of chaos and still keeping it fun. For me, it achieved that balance. The digging part with Emile near the end is a great example. It was hectic with the cacophony of explosions in your ear, new bombs appearing out of no where, and realizing that you need to go as fast as you can or you're not going to make it. I failed a couple times... and that's when you have a little voice in the back of your mind saying, "You get another chance but this kind of stuff really happened to real people and they only got one try. Failure was fatal." Fatalities of war... so easily accepted by the "higher powers" yet so devastating on an individual level.\n\nThe story of the game is really its best part. Each character shows the different kinds of people in the war: farmers and fathers who wanted nothing to do with the war; the nurses who had a never ending job to do; and the people with real anger in their hearts. The plot wasn't ground breaking. It had lots of cliches and was a little predictable but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I feel like these people's stories were meant to be a little more wide angled and "general" because that's who they represent... people like them in general. It's predictable and cliche to us precisely because the kind of stuff that's happened to them in the game have really happened in real life and we've already heard so much about it.\n\nI feel like the little touches the devs put in really helped this game feel like a piece of art. It was a very good decision on their part to have the player decide whether Emile kills that officer or not. Clearly, there was no real choice. We can all recognize that it would be wrong to send out a man into certain death for no reason like the officer did. The fact that you're the one pressing that button makes you feel complicit in Emile's action. I used to be against that kind of thinking for video games really... and I still am for the most part. If I have to kill some guy to progress in a game, I'm generally NOT going to feel bad about it. It's a GAME. But the fact that the situation they created here evoked a feeling of helplessness out of me speaks volumes. That's what art does; it evokes emotion.\n\nDon't even get me started on the end. You may or may not have noticed from the video but it is the player who has to walk Emile all the way out to the shooting post. YOU are the one marching Emile to his death and there's absolutely no choice about it. The decision has been made already by those in power. I tried to hide it in the video but I'll be honest here: I cried. It's why I didn't really give any good analysis in the credits. I was still trying to deal with the emotions. It wasn't sad just because Emile died. It was sad because it was so unfair. He didn't mean to kill the officer; he just wanted to stop another man from being killed. It was also doubly emotional because I pressed that button to make Emile do that. I didn't even need to see whether the game wouldn't let me progress without doing that. I knew what I had to do, and I did. I expected it only to knock him out but that's what Emile thought too. And so, Emile has to die.\n\nIt was also an interesting contrast of endings. On one hand you're happy that Karl is reunited with his family... then they throw Emile's death at you. You watch the credits thinking it's over but then you see Freddy, clearly about to participate in further battles. There's no end to these war stories. They go on and on.","January 17, 2015","true","8.2"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","67","71","3","0"

You gonna play alot of different characters in the game but all of them are well connected with the main story. Basically the story is about Karl finding a way back to his family after he got separated and deported to serve the german army. To me the game tells and teach much more than that Valiant Hearts made me realize once more how important family  and true friends are. It also shows how  unnecessary war is you are just a fighting slave fighting for other people interests, killing people who never wanted any war, people like yourself, people you would probably consider as friendly or even your friend. Beside from that the game is a little history lesson you can find a lot of facts happend during the first world war. The gameplay is quit simple for a puzzle adventure game at the same time well conceived. It force you to think without being unfair or unnecessary hard. For myself I can say the gameplay was entertaining from beginning to end. Who ever was responsible for the design of the game made a great job the levels are lovely created. One more point I wanna mention is the wonderful music fits perfectly to the atmosphare.

Situated in the First World War, Valiant Hearts is at heart a 2D side-scrolling adventure game with quite some puzzles added into the mix. While the gameplay itself is top-notch on its own (controlling the different characters is a breeze and solving the puzzles offers a decent but surely not too steep challenge), the true genius of the game lies in the way the story conveys all the emotions that can be linked to a catastrophic event such as the First World War.\n\nThe story tells in a gripping way the effect of the ware on four characters: a French soldier Emile, a German soldier Karl (the son-in-law of Emile, which offers a lot of possibilities for the story-writers), an American volunteer Freddie who gets befriended with Emile and a Belgian nurse, Anna, who tries to help and comfort as many wounded a possible, without looking if they are friend or foe. The game surely is not "heroic" in any sense: it's not the (often false) heroism of the war that stands in the spotlight, but rather the life of different "ordinary" people who try to survive amidst the carnage. If there is one theme that stands out, it's that of human compassion even in such horrible circumstances: not only does the nurse tend to all soldiers she meets, the familial relationship between Emile and Karl puts the French-German conflict in a completely different light. The unexpected but true friendship between Emile and Freddie offers yet another layer of interaction. Furthermore, on several occasions there are situations in which soldiers of the different armies help each other out rather than blindly slaughtering their enemies. You even get a dog as a companion, who helps out on many occasions and is often the key to solving a puzzle.\n\nThe story is told both during the actual gameplay and in different scenes between the chapters and portions of the game, and it turns out to be a true rollercoaster of emotions with a gripping, desolate end. It is rare for a game to move the player into tears, but Valiant Hearts managed to do so on more than one occasion. I truly felt emotionally shattered once the game had ended. Ubisoft Montpellier also went to great pains to provide a lot of historical background on the First World War, and it manages to do so without giving the impression one is playing a mainly educational game. It was a very smart move to introduce "collectibles" throughout the game, which add a lot of information about daily life during the war and which can be picked up during actual gameplay. Together with the diaries of the protagonists and the historical facts which unlock when the game progresses, one gets a ton of interesting information.\n\nThere really is no reason not to try and probably love this game. I know that it is a Ubisoft game and that it forces to use Uplay, but believe me: the quality, also from a technical point of view of this game is miles above the big budget games Ubisoft have released over the past years. The only downside is that there are no Steam achievements, which could have been a very fine addition - the Uplay achievements, though well done by themselves, are no match for the real stuff. Be sure to use a controller for this game; the controls are nigh-perfect and very intuitive.\n\nIn every other department the game shines as well: graphically it does a very good job at conveying the often bleak atmosphere of the front - using a cartoonish comic-book style was a risk, but it pays off very well in the end. The sound department is even better, with a wonderful soundtrack and exactly the right background sounds at the right moment.\n\nEssential purchase and gaming experience, a true classic of the adventure genre and a deep emotional experience.","April 10","true","21.9"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","51","52","0","5"

It's story is placed in first world war, connecting the stories of German Karl, French Emile, Belgian Anna and American Freddie. The story is based on actual letters sent from the war to the peoples families.\n\nThe visual style was the first thing that really cought my eye on early E3 trailer, had been waiting the game to release since. The music and sound also added to the great experience. Unfortunately the gameplay is bit lacking. Some action scenes and puzzles feel a bit repetitive, though it doesn't grow to be a big problem because of the games quite short lenght of 5-7 hours.\n\nAlso there is a "villain" a German Baron whos character is bit too over the top and caricaturized. So it broke the atmosphere for me a bit. Otherwise the little moments of humour didn't bother me at all.\n\nOverall the game was great experience while played in short bursts. There is also lot to read about events, locations and items of the war for those who want to educate themselves a bit.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of great mature stories and/or  casual puzzles.\n\n[Score: 85]","January 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","43","47","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/260230/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","It seems only natural that since we are in the midst of the centennial anniversary of the war that was to end all wars, a game should be released. In the gaming world, it seems that almost every war has been covered. Sadly, little to no recognition has been given to the war that launched the world into the modern age and changed how we live today. Valiant Hearts proves to be one of the first games to give a great picture of the struggles of World War I as well as a satisfying gaming experience.\nIn Valiant Hearts, we follow the stories of five heroes: Emile, a Frenchman; Hans, Emile's son-in-law who is deported from France because of his German origins; Freddie, an American who volunteers and fights alongside the French in his quest for revenge; Anna, a nurse searching for her father in Belgium; and Walt, a German first aid dog that comes across the path of each of these heroes and helps any way he can. While it may seem highly coincidential how these five individuals continually come across each other's paths, their backgrounds and motivations are very believable. The friendships that they build are genuine and felt by the players, without dialogue. Most conversations in this game are done by comic book bubbles and short distinct phrases that are spoken by the characters.\nThe gameplay is fairly simplistic since it is a side scroller with puzzles and mini game scenarios spread throughout the game. These two aspects seem to be the only thing reminding the player that this is a game. These puzzles serve to help bring missions to successful conclusions and do not feel thrown in for the sake of having a puzzle.\nThroughout the entire game, there is a narrator that tells the story. The narrator serves to take the place of the spoken dialogue between characters and any reading. Having a matter-of-fact narrator makes the game feel like a documentary. As you play each scenario, there are pop ups that inform you about the historical events that inspired the in game events. The pop ups cover everything from battles to the affects the war had on civilian lives.   This is a great part of the game, making it entertaining and educational at the same time. Honestly, who really remembers being taught anything about The Great War in school?\nIt is hard to criticize Valiant Hearts because of the emotional attachment that will develop. Unlike most war games in which the protagonist is the only competent character and can take on entire armies by themselves, our five protagonists are thrown into a conflict that is much bigger than them, and outside of their personal story arcs, they are just cogs in a giant machine. While they do a lot, they are shown to help other soldiers accomplish their duty, not do it for them. The protagonists go through being wounded, watching comrades die, suffering as POW's, and watching their hometowns be destroyed. There are also the subjects or desertion, mutiny, and treason. I have played games that have brought me to tears. This game was a sobering experience that was beyond tears.\nTechnically, the game is put together very well. The look of Valiant Hearts is unique in that it looks like a comic book. While the look may seem somewhat childish, it does not change the fact that mature content is being dealt with. World War One contained some of the most brutal war conditions. The first gas attacks, trench warfare, and the controversial decisions that resulted in the unneccessary deaths of millions are all looked at in this game. The music is very appropriately used, from being contemplative, to exciting during a charge, to showcasing the popular classical music of the day during the mini game chase sequences.\nThis game was entertaining, sobering, and educational. While there are other games being released that deal with The Great War, none of them approach it with the heart that this game does. Valiant Hearts is more than a game. It is an interactive memorial that brings to mind a conflict that changed the world yet today gets so little recognition. Valiant Hearts should not be missed by anyone.\n","May 30, 2015","true","15.1"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","0"

Valiant Hearts: The Great War is definitely part of the third kind.\n\nAn intriguing story which keeps you in suspense from the start till the very end. During the game you play with 4 characters: Emile, Karl, Freddie and Anna. Your mission - to guide them towards peace in a world torn apart by an awful war. Unlike most games about war - there is almost no violence inflicted by the characters except the necesary one to survive. It focuses on deliverance, redemption, human emotions, friendship, love and sacrifice rather than on destruction. The whole game is a chain of smart puzzles which must be solved in order to allow the characters to continue in this living tragedy, and after each sad part of the game there will always be a flash of hope to motivate the purpose of each character.\n\nThe story is amazingly touching, graphics are superb and the voice acting is great. I urge you to try it it and see for yourself how much enjoyment can provide a game which depicts a war focusing on the emotional appeal rather than the war itself.","July 23, 2014","true","16.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sendou/recommended/260230/","Sendou","Sendou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sendou/","712 products in account","Shortly put it's very easy to recommend Valiant Hearts. The basic gameplay reminds me of The Cave in the sense that it shares a lot with the logic behind traditional adventure games while mixing in 2D movement, puzzles and even some action. Gameplay isn't why I would recommend this title. It's simply passable meaning it's not the best in the genre but it won't annoy you. Puzzles in this game aren't really hard at all. Some action scenes and even a few classical music levels where you dodge bombs and other obstacles appearing in rhythm with the composition (they reminded me a bit of the music levels in Rayman Legends) act as good pallet cleaners.\n\nWhere this game really shines is everything else but gameplay. Main draw is obviously the presentation. It's as beautiful as you could expect if you have followed Ubisoft's UbiArt Framework games (Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends and Child of Light). You may look at the screenshots wondering if it really looks as good in motion and indeed that is case. Actually that comic book artstyle in motion really makes this game what it is. It's just hard to find anything bad to say about the presentation of this title. Some very minor problems present themselves when the game combines 2D art with 3D environment but it is not nearly enough to draw you out of the experience. Music fits perfectly the overall mood of the game and the OST is up there with the other great soundtracks.\n\nUbisoft has managed to create a very powerful story with Valiant Hearts. First of all it is about World War 1 that is very a very underrepresented scenario in video games. That is just the surface though. The really special part of this game is how it treats this period of time. Some of the themes the game is all about are something you just aren't expecting to see in video games. It's hard to go too much into detail without spoiling it all but one of these subjects is war's effect in civilians. This is just one of the many examples I could provide. Ubisoft Montpellier managed to put a lot of substance under the beautiful coat of paint.\n\nThe cast of characters in this game is quite diverse. As a main characters there is a war dog, belgian veterinarian now acting as a war nurse, American man fighting as a volunteer in the war, older french and younger german (who is a son-in-law of the french man) drafted to fight in the war on different sides. All of the characters are very believable with different things motivating them. You grow quite fond of the cast while going through the story. The story is mainly told through narration and diaries. The character interaction consists mainly of symbols which actually works very well.\n\nI have to give extra mention to the amount of WW1 trivia they managed to get into the game. It's all optional but if that kind of thing interests you then I think you will be like me and read everything available to you. You shouldn't underestimate the value these bring to the game. They bring the game alive. Attaching small facts about the war-time life during WW1 to the collectables makes collecting them feel worthwhile.\n\nThe game featured a few small but still unfortunate bugs. It's just not acceptable to have game-breaking bugs in the game as short and limited as this. Especially considering the powerhouse publisher behind it. On two occasions I was forced to restart the chapter. The checkpoint system is rather baffling. There are too many places where checkpoints are situated so that after a quick death you are forced to go through some monotonous tasks before getting to the point where you died again. In a game where the challenge is more about figuring out what to do rather than the execution the checkpoints should be far closer to each other.\n\nThis game features Ubisoft's in-house DRM solution called Uplay. It brings no value to the table whatsoever. Uplay is a funny thing because usually it's in the background and you don't mind it at all but that's just when it works. When it doesn't work it quite literally can stop you from playing the game. Some of the common issues people (me included) have had with Uplay in the past include disappearing save files and various problems when Ubisoft's puny servers are down (common with a new game release or Steam sale). There is just no reason to use Uplay while neglecting the far superior Steamworks. At best it's just another program you have to run in background.\n\nThe Good\nPresentation\nStory\n\nThe Bad\nFew minor bugs\nCheckpoint placement\n\nThe Ugly\nUplay\n\nValiants Hearts is a beautiful story I can recommend to everyone. I feel it's especially crucial for people that think the history and WW1 as a scenario for video game is interesting. It is as essential for people that like to play video games where the main draw is a really good story.","June 28, 2014","true","14.7"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","0"

But the game doesn’t just focus on the brutality but the humanity as well. It shows the innocent people caught in the crossfire and it makes its main cast quite likable and endearing. The game also does not take sides, showing that there was no good or evil side, just a whole bunch of normal people dragged into a situation they had no control over and forced to kill each other. It’s also very clear that the devs did their research and there’s a butt load of articles and entries detailing facts about the war.\n\nThe game does have some tonal issues at times, the main villain kind of seems he would be more at home in something like Professor Layton or Henry Hatsworth than a game trying to be a mostly realistic take on WWI, especially because he's pretty starkly evil in a mostly morally gray game, but ultimately it’s not a major flaw.\n\nIn the end, Valiant Hearts is a well-written and powerful game that will keep you invested until the end. This game is going to be on everybody’s GOTY lists, I guarantee. An absolute must play.","June 25, 2014","true","8.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","4"

Needless to say, it's very tragic already to remember one of the worst of humanity's darkest history. But hey, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, right? Not my quote, though. It cleverly incorporates the story of WW1 war into the game and adds more background story in a log book for you to review.\n\nAnyway, the game's one hell of linear one. You mostly control one protagonist (swapping around four as you progress) at one time.... and a dog. Puzzles are fairly simple and don't require you to do much. Some don't make sense - and mostly it's just like hidden object games bring this stuff to there rinse and repeat, but more often than not it's engaging. There are some boss battles, a bit nonsensical on top of it, but fun.\n\nPlaying with controller is my preference, and this game's great at it - suitable to lay comfortably on the bed, read the narration and play. It's even able to detect controller on the fly.\n\nAchievements and game saves are stored cloudly on uPlay. If you detest it, alas, there's no help for it. I also found one game breaking bug, because of it I failed to pass the level so many minutes. It's on chapter 2, but there's a workaround for that, at least I was able to pass it. And no patch so far, either. uPlay also prevents me to take screenshots at all on Steam's Overlay. It doesn't even appear. Ah well... an annoyance, but isn't gonna do anything against my enjoyment of the game.\n\nReplayability only involves collecting more hidden objects. There's a progress bar in main menu that helps you to track what's missing. Other than that, the game has literally zero replayability unless you just want to remember the story again. Though, for sure, the value diminishes after first playthrough - I sure have no interest to beat this game again, did once already. That doesn't change the fact that the story is sad but beautiful.\n\nSo, for once, I have to say "Well done Ubisoft!".","January 28, 2015","true","54.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

An extremely rare setting for games since, more than most wars, "The Great War" was an abyss of futility and horror that should never have happened. The gameplay here is pretty much puzzle-solving and a few sequences which is rather reminicient of music rhythm games. The gameplay works, but that's not what you play this game for.\n\nNo, what this game does, and does very well, is atmosphere and painting a picture of just what kind of war WW1 was. The game is chiefly focused on the French perspective of the war and the horrible price that was payed by France to ultimately win a pyrrhic victory. The game follows the course of history, and particularly upon the general attitudes about the conflict as it progressed.\n\nYou start off in the optimistic summer of 1914 when it was believed this would be a short glorious war. But when plans for quick victory fall apart, the trenches are dug and the war descends into an abyss of horror. Most of the major battles on the Western Front during 1914-1917 are featured in this game: 1st Marne, 2nd Ypres, Verdun, The Somme, Vimy Ridge, before closing things with the Nivelle offensive at Chemin des Dames. This does make me a bit disappointed since they came pretty close to covering the entire war and ended up missing both its most horrific campaign (3rd Ypres/Passchendaele) and its most dramatic (Kaiserschlacht and 1918 in general).\n\nDespite that, the ending works just fine, though it is a downer. But by the time you are coming close to the ending having played this game for a few hours, you already know this won't have a happy ending. And it chooses it's conclusion to be the battle that broke the spirit of the French Army and led to widespread mutiny within it. And since this game is very French-centric, ending here is okay with me because although the French remained one of the great Allied powers for the rest of the war, it was the British, its Commonwealth allies, the Germans, and finally the Americans that took center-stage from this point onward in the west.\n\nWW1 is one of my most extensively studied periods of history, so I really appreciated the work that went into this game in keeping it close to the setting. Games set in this time period are so rare that any that do things reasonably well in regards to representing it accurately are liable to getting my wholehearted recommendation. Alas, I cannot do that here for one reason: Uplay. That is reason enough not to touch a game for alot of people and I don't blame them. But if you can get past that, then this is a pretty good game to pick up, especially for those with an interest in history and specifically WW1. :)\n\nEnjoy the abyss!","April 7, 2015","true","6.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadownetX/recommended/260230/","ShadownetX","Shadownet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadownetX/","1598 products in account","The story of Valiant Hearts begins in 1914. Archduke Franz Ferdinand has been assassinated and Germany declares war on Russia in response. In anticipation of a war, France begins to deport all German citizens. Karl a young German farmer is forced to be separated from his family, consist of his wife Marie, their son Victor and his father-in-law Emile. Karl is forcefully drafted into the German army while at the same time Emile is drafted into the French army.\n\nThe story follows their journey of Emile and Karl as they try to survive a war neither of them want nothing to do with. Along the way they meet many wonderful characters, faced countless hardships and joyful moments.\n\nThe gameplay is a side scrolling game. You're controlling either Emile or Karl most of the time, sometimes other characters. Most of the time you'll be solving puzzles and picking up items to advance on to the next area, while following the story. Gameplay-wise it isn't incredibly difficult at all, if you're good at figuring out how to use your environment to solve the puzzles you should be just fine. Certain part of the game required you to sneak through behind enemy lines. So patience is more needed here than skills, other times you are required to dodge artillery shells which can be a bit frustrating until you learn the patterns. There are parts of the game where the game turned into short of a dodging game where many vehicles are chasing after you and you must avoid bullets, grenades and incoming traffic. Last but not least, there are quick time events. You will encounter them at scenes when you have to heal someone. They get progressively harder as you go through the game, the last QTE is quite difficult, at least for me.\n\nThe game does a wonderful job with the narration between loading screen, even though most of the characters does not speak at all, they only provide you with speech bubbles to portray the feelings and thoughts of each characters. The narrator does most of the heavy lifting. In the game you will be able to find many collectibles, that when you open up the menu, you can examine them and read about the history and interesting fact regarding the Great War. I highly recommend reading them, as it will enhance the experience. The music was very fitting with the game, since characters do not talk, the music help give you the sense of danger and sadness that you normally need words to describe.\nI have not encounter any game breaking bugs when I played it, the only bugs I encountered was one time my character was stuck in a ditch and I could not dig my way out of it, so I had to restart the chapter, the other time was when I was healing another character and an extra arm appeared out of nowhere on my character. But it was gone the moment the healing QTE was finished.\n\nThis game being one of the first games I played after the Summer Sale, I highly recommend this if you enjoy a grand, epic and emotional story. The only major problem I have with this game is that sometimes, certain part of the game might dragged on for a while, but others might be over very quickly, a bit inconsistency in pacing. There are many great characters that you will like, the way they accurately portray the hardships of warfare at the time is also a welcoming addition. It took me 10 hours to finish the game, but if you want to get all the collectibles. It might take you a bit longer. This game is definitely one of my Game of the Year contender, or at least for great storytelling. I hope if you already played it, that you enjoyed it. If you haven’t, what are you waiting for? =]\n","July 26, 2014","true","11.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Instead, it takes on the First World War and all the associated brutality that came with it. And while it does a good job of driving home the differing perspectives, showing you the meaning of loss, and hammering you with the trauma of war, one can't help but wonder if the Great War was the right setting.\n\nGames tend to demand three things: 1) player agency, 2) the feeling of progress, and 3) the feeling that the world responds to your actions. World War 1 presented correctly could never do that. You grow attached to the characters because of their clear relatable goals, but a proper picture of the war would leave them wholly unable to act upon them. And by placing your characters in some of the rare pivotal moments of what was otherwise a four-year intractable meat-grinder of a conflict, it feels like individual moments of heroism can really save the day. It stands in jarring contrast to the reality of the war: a bureaucratic nightmare where political expedience and officers' incompetence fed young men into machine-gun fire by the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe game that was truly faithful to the war would kill everyone around you regardless of your actions. Your decisive push for new ground is turned back the following week. One day, your commanding officer gets it in his mind to secure glory by feeding as many of you into bloodbath of No-Man's-Land as possible. As you seek cover from machinegun fire, a howitzer shell bursts the thin strip of ground between you and a muddy crater and you drown in the blood, mud, and necrosis. Your commanding officer is later promoted for bravery. There is no rationality or narrative, just the slow drift of whole economies toward each other and a tectonic snap at the point of conflict. Valiant Hearts just barely scratches the surface of this.\n\nIt's hard to imagine any game in the traditional sense being able to convey that. Valiant Hearts does the best job of it I've seen, but it's still much too far from the truth.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Valiant Hearts uses Uplay, Ubisoft's utterly needless third-party DRM and achievement/social system. It's less obtrusive than in some games but still ought to be removed.\n\nENDING SPOILER:\nThe last "puzzle" does attempt to drive home more of the senselessness of the war by having a commanding officer shove your squad through increasingly brutal segments of a French counterattack. I feel like the solution may be more effective on other players than it was for me. The growing sense of despair, confusion, and hopelessness that comes from your commanding officer demanding you push through a literally impassable section may drive players to the horrifying conclusion that they need to mutiny against their own officer as the only way to survive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/260230/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Valiant Hearts:The Great War is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nValiant Hearts is a game that takes place during the Great Scuffle of 1914 to 1918, the less popular older sister to her much prettier younger sister: Hitler's Invasion of Poland. You take the roll of several different characters from different backgrounds, or as I like to call them: The diversity squad, as they attempt to survive one of the most horrific slap fights of the 20th century. You take the role of characters such as: Emile the Frenchmen, Karl the German, Anne the Belgian Nurse, Freddie the American volunteer, and Bobo the lovable and wise cracking mascot monkey character.\n\nI lied about the last one, I fooled you. I bet you feel really silly.\n\nMuch like my life, Valiant Hearts is a linear side scroller that leads to tragedy and sadness at every turn. Though there are some puzzle moments where you can freely move left and right, much of the game is spent moving forward. As a war game, it stands out as being rather pacifist in it's approach to conflict. Although it looks like a character may have killed someone through explosive means, it's always implied that they're either simply knocked out or escaped in some way, making the four lead characters the world's first Batmen.\n\nThe puzzles are rather simple, and there's a hint system in place in case you do manage to get stuck. I mean, you COULD use it. If you're a big baby.  Although they seem to just be there to give the game something to do other than run, hide, and bonk people on the noggin, they're simple and fast enough that they give the game just enough flavor to keep it from getting boring. Not only that, but there are collectibles hidden throughout the game that tell stories and give more info about the world's most horrible game of Red Rover. You also have a dog companion, who goes about finding hidden objects for you and other actions like pulling switches and getting belly rubs.\n\nNot only does the game go about telling a narrative, but it also goes out of it's way to educate. The characters are mostly silent outside of a few gibberish phrases uttered in their native tongue, but they still manage to get objectives and goals across with the use of speech bubbles with objects and arrows inside them. What dialogue you DO have comes in the form of a narrator who serves as both a history teach and a story teller, explaining the events of both the war and the characters involved. Every stage also gives you a short glossary of events, actions, and cultures important to what was happening at the time. It gives the game an anchor in a real world war and keeps the cartoony animations from pulling you away like police pull me away from Victoria Secret.\n\nBut should you play Stedfast Kidneys: The Okay Fist Fight?\n\nSee, this is where things get iffy. The game itself is good, don't get me wrong. But the way Ubisoft goes about things may be the deal breaker for you. The game uses Uplay: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Child of Ubisoft and Satan. It was a struggle to get into the game at first because of it, Uplay refused to load Valiant Hearts and instead pushed me into Splinter Cell: Black List, another game set to damnation in the eternal hell fire that is bad corporate decisions.\n\nSo not only do you need to load up a second client to play Valiant Hearts, but most of the things attached to the game are through Uplay. There are achievements for the game, but none of them mean anything because it's through the Uplay client and not your Steam account. Why would I want that, Ubisoft? Why would you think this is a good idea? I give you gold and you crap bronze.\n\nBut by the time I write this review with the use of a lap top attached to a small windmill generator, Valiant Hearts is about $3.74 CAD. Is the price worth Uplay? That's up to you. I, however have no self respect and am known to eat garbage, so take that into consideration. If you can find someway to perhaps step over Uplay, then I say go for it. But 3.74 isn't a bad deal for slow, tender tongue kissing with the devil.\n\nValiant Hearts: The Great Disagreement gets 3 sad war-time piano pieces out of 5.\n\nPink was originally a masculine color.\n\nThe Curator, a place where I go to weep bitterly: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","March 14, 2015","true","6.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","13","17","14","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/recommended/260230/","Corpekata","Corpekata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Corpekata/","2463 products in account","The game has been a bit mishandled. It was announced around the same time as Child of Light but did not get near the marketing push that game did. It also was advertised as being this very somber tale about the gruesome realities of war. But that's really not the case. Quite a large chunk of the game is sort of action adventureish. I might even dare use words like "caper." There's even a few comedy segments. The game is sad when it gets down to it, but if you're looking for a game that maybe does more than lecture you on the horrors of war, this might be it.\n\nAnyways, gameplay was never really shown much for this game. It'd say it's a bit of a blend of genres. 3 are most prominent though, and each level tends to devote itself to one or the other. 1st is the adventure genre. These are typical "You need Item X, but it's guarded by Person Y that wants Item A which is guarded by Person Z that wants item B," sort of things so that you end up helping every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you come across in order to get a measly pair of bolt cutters. These levels tend to be either for character introductions or as pace breakers. 2nd are puzzle levels. These tend to be the biggest chunk of the game. You're often navigating large environments and trying to figure out how to alter the environment so you or NPCs you're in charge of can progress in the level. Lot of valve turning and sending your dog to go fetch items in these levels. They also often have some stealth elements, where you'll need to avoid patrols or distract guards. 3rd are more arcade / action stuff. Usually in the middle of a big battle and dodging incoming bombs and constantly running. Some of them have what could even be described as boss battles. They tend to get mixed up so you won't get too tired of one or the other. It's pretty well paced overall.\n\nGame is pretty easy overall. It's probably a bit more "game like" than say, Telltale's recent output, but most of the adventure elements are about the same difficulty, so expect more of a console "adventure" game than an old school PC one. There is one pretty big moon logic puzzle though toward the end. Puzzles seem to me to have never really been one of Ubisoft's strong suits, and it's largely continued here. But it's overall pretty fun, just not going to stump most people.\n\nThe game is told through the eyes of 4 characters and you'll switch between them a lot. Usually you'll have the dog with you too. The art style is a bit weird at times. Very comic bookish, but more art comic book than superhero. It sort of reminds me a bit of Terry Gilliam's It's generally gorgeous. There's no real dialogue in levels, it's all very basic stuff like names or basic emotes (the cast is varied in language so I think this mostly works versus everyone speaking English or subtitling 3/4 of the game). In between levels there's actual dialogue. It largely works well but a couple characters end up a little short changed in the character development side. One of the 4 in particular doesn't have near the importance to the story or even a compelling character arc and honestly feels like could've been cut without changing much. The music in this is great and used very well. One of my favorite moments is a car chase set to the Can Can. There's a load of well used classics as well as originals.\n\nAnyways, the game is relatively short. Ubi for whatever reason tried to pad the length out with a bunch of collectibles scattered through every level which don't have a ton of relevance. I honestly kinda just decided to ignore them after a while, as I thought they kinda detracted from things. Seems to be a sort of current trend with some story heavy games where they don't seem to think they can hold your attention so they just vomit doodads to collect every 10 feet (recently Murdered Soul Suspect was awful about this too). But even if you try for 100 percent I'd wager you're looking at a 7 hour game tops, if that bothers you. But I think it was very well paced and ends pretty perfectly.\n\nHonestly I'm a bit flabbergasted that Ubi pimped Child of Light over this. I think Valiant Hearts will have more staying power than CoL, which is a game I enjoyed, but largely for the battle system. Overall, get it, it's good. Just don't expect it to make you cry every 5 minutes. But it does pack a wallop when it needs to.","July 3, 2014","true","8.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This game is NOT for you. Not unless you really want to play a game that makes you feel like you're in a REAL war.\n\nThe game its self consist of solving puzzles and getting from Point A to B to C to... It is not open ended and very laniary. BUT it is still an amazingly fun game to play. The puzzles are challenging and there are a few moment where you're going to laughs. But that's about it. The rest of this game is a real emotional trip down a series of REAL WW1 events. Although the story its self is fictional, the game is filled with historical facts and REAL historical values. This game is simply AMAZING!\n\nOne of the things that I love about this game is that FINALY we have a game that shows war as war. It's not Terrorist vs. Soldiers, Black vs. White or Good vs. Evil ,  its war. You can save a German soldier as much as saving an Allie, befriending an someone and then have to kill him moment later... why? because my friends ... that is war.\n\nI hope I am not spoiling anything here but I cried . . . I freaking cried real manly tears at the end of the game and yet I still want to go and play this game a second time.\n\nSo if you want to know if this game is really worth the 15$ Hell yes!

Finally the real war experience in all its true emotions and fights.\n\nIn closing, this game arrives just in time for the 100th year anniversary of WW1, good timing Ubisoft!\n\nLest We Forget!\n\n","July 7, 2014","true","27.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

I didn't have high expectations for this game, because frankly, I'm not a huge "puzzle" fan. However, Valiant Hearts plays its role of a puzzle game perfectly.\n\nOne of the most compelling and story driven game I've ever played in my life, has 4 playable characters, Anna, Karl, Emile and an American solider that becomes your friend at the very beginning of the game.\n\nThe life of these four characters is rather well described as they suffer and feel on their own skin the outcomes of  the war. They fight for, not only their own life, but the life of their dearest friends and family. It's a life of survival, and a game that shows how cruel war is, and what consequences it has for the whole mankind.\n\nPros:\n\n+soundtrack - one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in my whole lifetime. The game excels at that part and the sound is done so well, you'll stop and listen to the music before you finish your puzzle even if you know the answer\n+story - the story isn't anything that SPECIAL, but is very well made, and isn't as robust as some of the stories in the same genre\n+gameplay - now, Valiant Hearts is a puzzle game, and puzzles in this game aren't as hard as maybe they should be for a person that bought Valiant Hearts in inention to play it for hardcore puzzles. This is the part that I like in the game, and the reason why I don't have a fond of puzzle games is that they end up being hard which affects storyline and it's tempo. I really like how puzzles are not quite hard, but sometimes enough challenging for the player to stop for a minute and think about them thourughly.\n+graphics - The artstlyle, whole graphics of this game are wonderful, it's really amazing how well they are detailed even tho they have cartoonish look for them.\n\nCons:\n\nI honestly don't have any real cons for this game, as this game is one of the most charming and exciting games I've played. My honest conclusion is that this game is apsolutely worth 15€, and it's a fari price for what this game can offer.\n\nMaybe only negative thing about this game is the lenght of the story itself. You'll need around 6.7 - 8 hours to finish the game, but there are also collectible items that may impact on the lenght of the game.\n\n9.5/10","June 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

A lot of people seemed to dislike this game for the sometimes clumsy narrative (notably, the boss fights), the numerous clichés present in the game or the fact that it is "unfinished" (the story of George, the British, will be coming as a DLC). If I can stand those reasons, I can safely say they are missing out so much.\n\nValiant Hearts is phenomenal, and as someone who knows the Great War very well, I can say Ubisoft Montpellier has done a monstruous work with their new baby. Many notable moments of the war are depicted in a very rightful way (the Marne, Ypres, Vauquois, Verdun, the Somme, Vimy or the Chemin des Dames) and the characters (Emile the French, Freddie the American, Anna the Belgian and Karl the German) are likeable and realistic. The gameplay follow as well with multiple types (minigames, QTEs, point & click) but never feels bland. Sure, this game can make the events a bit easy or naive (notably with clichés), but the Great War is a very complicated conflict and this game does a wonderful job simplifying it (even if it is only the Western Front!): also, I really liked the fact there are no "bad guys": you fight Germans as well as French as most people from both camps will try to stop you in your quest (war reasons...). Also, the folks at UbiArt (who already worked on the new Rayman games) did a superb job with their artstyle, cartoony but never childish. This is a different way of depicting the war far from all those FPS cliché styles, and it feels very fresh.\n\nBut if I recommend Valiant Hearts, it is also for the awesome documentation that Ubisoft prepared with the folks that made Apocalypse (this spectacular series gets also a must-view mention from me btw); whether it is for the letters, the objects you get in the game or the simple documentation on the events, they do a great job explaining little details of this war.\n\nValiant Hearts is a really good game, a bit expensive maybe, but it delivers very well, and even more. If you like everything around the Great War, wants to discover this conflict more or if, like me, your family has been involved in it, I would highly recommend giving it a try.\n\n\nAlso: there is a dog in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattnovosad/recommended/260230/","mattnovosad","IlluminatiRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattnovosad/","726 products in account","World War One is a conflict that is severely underrepresented in all forms of media, but for videogames, it is in an interesting position. Many cry that it would be too difficult to make a game about World War One ‘not boring’, or ‘not too difficult’. Ubisoft announced Valiant Hearts: The Great War quite suddenly late last year. A new IP from a AAA Publisher and Developer is always news. Valiant Hearts is not only a new IP, but is a 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle game about World War One. Valiant Hearts is the answer to the cries of “Not too hard” and “Too Boring”, as it is neither of those things. It encompasses great art direction, style, music, story, and atmosphere. It is rare to see a new game like this from a AAA publisher, and I am quite shocked, and pleased.\nIf you are buying from Steam, as with other Ubisoft titles, it does require Ubisoft’s U-Play DRM service. In addition, for some, the length may seem short (7-8 hours for my first playthrough). However, for its price of $15 USD, the length is just right. Ubisoft was smart in pricing Valiant Hearts.\n\nValiant Hearts features four Protagonists, each with their own personalities and skills. Anna, Emile, Karl, and Freddie. Anna is a Belgian woman who was studying to become a Veterinarian in Paris before the war broke out. When the Taxi to the Marne began, she drove to the front and started helping the wounded soldiers of both sides. In game, Anna is able to heal wounded soldiers with a minigame that is reminiscent of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.\n\nEmile was conscripted into the French army at the start of the war. He fought at the Marne, and was wounded and captured by the Germans. As a POW he was made to be a cook, and Emile has the ability to dig in certain areas. When general Mobilization by the French started, Karl (Who is Emile’s Son In-Law) was deported from his home in St. Mihiel and sent back to Germany. There, he was made to join the German army. Karl also has a wife, and young son whom reside at St. Mihiel for the duration of the war. Freddie was an American living in Paris at the start of the war. Driven by a lust for revenge, he joined the French army. Freddie has a pair of Wire Cutters and is able to cut through barbed wire whenever he pleases. As well, his strength allows him to destroy any obstacles in his path in one hit. These four people are brought together by a German medical dog.\n\nThe game is described as an interactive Comic-Book, and that is something I can certainly agree upon. Many sections of the game feature comic book panels showing something else going on as you are solving a puzzle or moving through the lines. The art itself, although it looks like it could be aimed at children, lends itself to a mature story about humanity and the true cost of war. It is a unique, fresh style that is surprising coming from a AAA publisher.\n\nHowever, in some cases the Comicbook style is a detractor. For the first 3 chapters, there is a comic book style villain, and he mainly pertains to Freddie. There is a boss battle within each of these chapters, and each of them feels forced. They are extremely out of place, in what is otherwise a poignant story that does not paint one side as the villain. However, the epilogue to that portion of the story is a fitting conclusion. As well, Anna’s healing rhythm minigame can get tedious quickly. Had it been used less, or in each case shorter overall it would have been better.\n\nIn spite of those issues, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a good game. It does not hold any punches in showing the senselessness and horror of the First World War. My favorite level is towards the end, at Chemin des Dames, during the Nivelle Offensive. With an officer to his back, threatening to shoot if he starts retreating, Emile is forced to charge forward and watch his fellow soldier be slaughtered. It is moments such as those that truly make Valiant Hearts a beautiful, poignant puzzle game.\n\nThe Dog is also used as a good puzzle solving tool. He is able to go through spaces too small for the humans, and is able to retrieve objects for the characters, and is also capable of pulling levers. He helps tie the stories of Emile, Karl, Anna, and Freddie together well. He provides something that they can all communicate with, and loves them no matter who they fight for, or what their beliefs are. It is also an interesting addition to the game, due to the prevalence of dogs that were used for war purposes during World War One, one of the most famous being “Sergeant Stubby”, who was a member of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th (Yankee) Division. Showing that the war effected not only humans, but our closest animal friends, helps show the destructive power of The First World War, and war in general.\n\nA detriment to some would be the historical accuracy in some places. Although the game is littered with facts (Hit tab in any mission, and historical facts relating to that mission will be shown. You can find a variety of objects in the game, and it will have a fact about that object, but more on that later). There are levers, anachronistic clothing, and objects abound (looking at that giant Chlorine Gas machine early on at Ypres), and to some that would be something to be put off by. Now, I am someone who is obsessed with World War One, and everything to do with it. However, in this case those sorts of things only enhanced my enjoyment of the game because it complements the comicbook style well, and helps keep the story and gameplay flowing at a good pace. An example of that would relate the story, as it would go nowhere if our protagonists were not allowed to freely move about the front.\n\nI am actually a fan of the charge sequences, in which your character is running to the right side of the screen, and you must dodge shells and machine gun fire. It helps break up the game some, and to keep you focused. In addition to those sections, I also enjoyed the vehicle sections. There are two types of those: Tank and Taxi. The Taxi sections have you driving towards the bottom of the screen automatically, and you must maneuver the car around obstacles and enemies. They also seem rhythmic as they are timed with the song that is playing. My favorite of those is when Anna is driving her Taxi away from Paris, to the “Can-Can” song. The Tank Sections have you moving left and right, firing at obstacles and enemies. These are also a nice change of pace, and keep things interesting.\n\nSomething mentioned earlier was the objects that you can collect in the game. Some have noted that this seems out of place in a game like this, but personally I feel that the objects that you can find, and where you find them make sense. A lost Dogtag or Helmet dropped in the mud, a child’s gasmask in a cabinet in a bombed out building. When you pick up these objects you are treated to a factoid about them, and what ttheir context within the conflict was. It is an interesting way to shed some light on the war, and the objects that people used every day during the conflict.\n\nIn the end, I really enjoyed my time with Valiant Hearts: The Great War. It is a remarkable game from a AAA publisher, and although it does have some minor issues, they are dwarfed by the good things about it. The “Come Back” trailer for the game said this: “Lives shattered, love lost. One day a farmer, the next a soldier. Sent far from home, torn from their loved ones. These unexpected heroes are swept away into the Great War that rages on, always hungry for more. War makes men mad, but Humanity can shine, even from the darkest of hours. And those Valiant Hearts stand up fighting for love, friendship, and honor. To the point of sacrificing everything, even their own life. Some made it, some did not. These are their stories”.  That is what the game is about, although names may fade, deeds and sacrifices never will. So those with Valiant Hearts, fear not, as your sacrifices are not forgotten.","June 28, 2014","true","20.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

Well, it depends...\n\nFrom the game-mechanics point of view, it's not particularly appealing. Especially in the first few hours the game feels really dull because there aren't many game-mechanics to speak of. But as the game progresses it's getting better, even though the mechanics remain the same and there are only about five different things you can do, they are used in different circumstances and they bring a breath of fresh air into the game.\n\nYou will do basic puzzles which aren't hard, but at least they make sense. There'll be stealth parts which are really basic and some driving instances which are really bad. The most interesting mechanics is that you can give orders to your dog, who can do stuff that you can't. The important thing is that even though the mechanics and little quests you have to do are not strong, they communicate a strong message (most of the time). It shows what was important for those unfortunate enough to be a part of the Great War.\n\nSome actions are there to represent the conditions of the soldiers, like digging through mud. This had a strong impact on me, because I've read all the little historical information offered by the game. The problem is that if people don't read them (and I bet there's a huge number of those who don't), the message will be lost to them. It would be much better if all the historical information was presented through the gameplay itself, or via the narrator, who did a really good job.\n\nThe game caught my eye because of its art style and it was the main reason why I bought it in the first place. And although it's really nice in most cases, it brings the game down in some situations. The graphical fidelity of the art assets isn't particularly great and when the game zooms into an item, it looks bad. And I mean really bad - the game looks really unprofessional and feels really cheap in those moments. But most of the time the game does a great job of setting the mood with the colour pallet and all the assets.\n\nThe story is about four more or less random people whose lives are closely tied together and you will play the roles of all four of them. The connections between them and their motives unfold as the story progresses and you'll grow to care for them.\n\nSo, it's not the best "gamy" game but it brings about a really strong experience, if you can endure the first few hours (which you should). As for the price tag, I would buy it in a sale.","December 18, 2014","true","8.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

So far, I didn't have to look up any hints or anything of the sort. There is a Veteran mode, but I'm not sure what that does. I've been playing on "normal" as this is my first playthrough.

But you will not regret the pain.\n\nNote: Took around 10 hours not 14 as I put game on hold to watch a bit of The Walking Dead which turned into a marathon, silly me. :P\n\nIn life there are those with very certain objectives that they are intent on completing. Many of us look up to these individuals. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is tremendously goal orientated. It is a game that deserves the praise we give to those focused enough to live their existence out, dedicated to an important cause. I am sure that many games look up to it for the superior level in fusion of storytelling and gaming entertainment it delivers.\n\nAt first the familiarity is reminiscent of point and click games though it is far from it, the more you advance. Progression is achieved through guiding several main characters through a set sequence of actions to continue on their respective journeys as they experience the First World War. It is a puzzle adventure game that is the most basic it can be as a game without falling into any variation of boredom. You will be taken along an interactive journey of warfare, dodging bullets while under fire, digging trenches, plonking soldiers on the head with fist or ladle and receiving aid from an enormously well trained and helpful war dog named Walt. Walt is “uberadorable” and if you are anything like me, you’ll be turning to him for comfort by rubbing his belly each time you feel a little jolt of heartache playing this game. The lives of the main characters will interchange constantly over the course of this game and they will save each other’s lives and make new-found friends.\n\nIt is a story about average people and their part in a war that will never be forgotten. It is not biased or too depressing. However, it is intense towards the end and also during some of the later “boss battles”. Thankfully this game has zero tolerance against procrastination. You will not find yourself sighing like in some puzzle adventure games where you don’t know why you’re collecting a bunch of items or trying to finish the same puzzle for hours on end. Not a single function is for mere substance within the game. Every detail owns its own historical relevance and is provided to successfully enlighten the player about WWI (including weapons and tactics). It was a joy to search for as many artefacts as I could find (you can go back after finishing the game and look for any previously missed) and read all the extra material provided through photographs and descriptions. I will bet on the likelihood that some cool history teacher out there is using this as the most spectacular teaching material. It is not overly story-driven that it winds up like a visual novel and also has a good percentage of logical puzzles and basic “mini-games”.\n\nThe art is splendid like a good portion of Ubisoft games tend to be. It knows no age, gender or background and imagine it would be wonderful game play, not just for adults but for families together or even younger children alone. I took my time trying to read everything and indulging myself in all the gorgeous art but as the controls are basic, most will find the game play short, efficient and rewarding. Hints will appear courtesy of war pigeons and they are impeccably timed so you will likely figure things out yourself before the hints appear. They are clear solutions or obvious clues so calls for less online surfing. Saving is automatic but is frequent enough not to be bothersome after your initial adjustment at the start of the game.\n\nThough the game is fiction it is based on truth that should be told until the end of all mankind and deserves all the “feels” it will make you muster. If there were a perfect book in this world specifically designed to amuse gamers, this would be it. The bookworm in me also wishes there were a book.\n\nI think this is a first but I literally have no cons to note.\n\nUplay is aesthetic and has a separate achievements and points system where you can unlock extra features. I feel it lacks the community Steam has but it is a well made client that I do not mind using at all. It is a shame Steam doesn’t have achievements for this game as of yet. Also, this game disallows me from regretting my Uplay installation.\n\nTackling Steam’s “already running” error using Uplay (was a problem I encountered)\nShut down Uplay & game from Task Manager – Delete game content from Steam library – Delete Uplay – Go to Ubisoft website and download Uplay from there – Open Steam if not already open – Go to game list in Uplay and press PLAY from there – Steam’s navy popup will appear (may be in background, minimise windows to see it) – Click that popup to download – When finished click PLAY via Uplay. Imagine Steam as a guy in the shadows, they need to be there but when you play Uplay always play from Uplay client and just leave Steam in the background to do its thing.\n\nEdited for layout.","March 25, 2015","true","14.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's set during World War I (one), telling the tales of four characters: a French conscript farmer, a German expelled from France who then got enlisted into the German army [also, the son-in-law of the French conscript], an American who lost his bride during a German bombing in Paris, and a Belgian nurse. Oh, and a German rescue dog, as well.\n\nThe most immediately striking feature of Valiant Hearts is the art: it looks like an animated Belgian/French-style comic. Of course, any game about trenches, piles of corpses and Mustard gas will look bleak, but the bleakness here is extremely beautiful. Watch the trailer, and you'll immediately see what I mean.\n\nThe French narrator (who also voices the French version of Dumbledore) is excellent and, judging from the trailer, so does the English-speaking one. Other characters speak some kind of gibberish with a couple of recognizable words, and it works well. Overall, it's hard to not be extremely happy with the audio-visuals.\n\nIt's clear that Ubisoft Montpellier had three aims with this title: to entertain, to tell an emotional story, and to teach about the "Great War". The result is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the biggest success lies in the "teaching". Thanks to its different environments and to the 3 years that the story spans, many aspects of the first world war are evoked. Those aspects are sometimes barely hinted at in the actual game, but the touch of a button brings small explanatory texts, all well written and illustrated with actual pictures of the war (taken from "Apocalypse", a highly successful French documentary series that used actual footage from the war, colored especially for it). At the end of the game, you'll have read a micro-encyclopaedia (or not, it's always optional). What's more, there are 100 collectible items scattered throughout the game. Finding one brings another small text related to that object, though those are focused on the mundane, daily lives of soldiers instead of the bigger themes from the encyclopedia. Sometimes, those get too mundane: I really don't need to know about all kinds of ID tags that were used by the belligerent armies. But most help ground the story into something I could relate to, because of human scale.\n\nThe actual story is more of a mixed bag. For the biggest part, the heroes are alternatively living the life of ordinary soldiers (or nurses), and partaking in extraordinary, completely unrealistic adventures, the like of which would not have looked out of place in the pages of a pulp magazine. This tended to create an unfortunate distance between me and the characters. Fortunately, the last hour largely redeems whatever silly stuff I was subjected to: an especially gripping action sequence, very effective at conveying the horrors of big assaults between the trenches, is followed by an extremely emotional conclusion. Yes, I cried a little.\n\nSadly, the actual game is lacking. It alternates between adventure, puzzle and action sequences, but stays average (at best) in all the genres. The adventure segments are especially disappointing. When they don't consist of boring fetch quests, they don't always make a lot of sense: your actions rarely have logical consequences, and you are left guessing at random. Thankfully, the adventure environments are so restricted that the guesswork never truly blocks your progress (that, and the built-in hint system). The rare puzzles lack variety. Only some action sequences are able to enthuse: You can't beat the driving levels, where the to-be-avoided obstacles arrive in rhythm with a French Cancan or with "Night on Bald Mountain".\n\nOverall, Valiant Hearts was a disappointment to me, because I was so in love with its trailer. I still admire the concept and the art is unarguably fantastic. I can forgive the uneven story thanks to the great finale. But when you strip the game to its core, you're left with decidedly uninspired mechanisms.\n\nIt is unique, though. WWI is rarely explored by video games and war in general is rarely treated from this kind of perspective. Therefore, I would still cautiously recommend the experience, expecially given the soft price of entry.","June 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","4"

Yet I still can’t help recommending it. Unlike Brothers A Tale of two Sons this game doesn’t marry the gameplay and story particularly well. There’s even sections of pure padding where you’re solving puzzles for no reason and with no payoff.\n\nThematically it largely manages to pull off the WWI setting without disrespecting the dead. There’s a few sections where it feels like an adventure, like the kind the soldiers marching into WWI imagined they’d be having. I’m not entirely ok with these sections. It has a comic book villain, which I guess is appropriate since it looks like a comic book. But because it also tries to convey how horrible WWI was it feels out of place. I understand the need to not bum out the audience too much since it’s “entertainment”. But I personally would’ve preferred it to be darker and more authentic. Compared to WWII games though this is still way better.\n\nAs a puzzle game Valiant Hearts isn’t great. Or even good. But thanks to the art direction, music and the attempt at a poignant story it’s worth playing. Some sections are brilliant, and the ending was particularly good.

There is a brief encyclopedia updating itself throughout the game giving info on the places you're finding yourself in and there are collectibles that are actually interesting to seek out because they relate to specific situations, behaviors or events of the time - for example bullet/artillery casings turned into other tools or decorative items by soldiers out of boredom, logistical necessity or in an attempt to keep the mind occupied when hunkered down in the trenches (I can't always be bothered with the brainless collectibles in other games; I might actually replay this one at some point just for those).\n\nThe story has you switch between characters rather frequently, each having their own abilities of sorts and reasons to join the war (willingly or unwillingly) in some form or another until the individual lines of at least parts of them converge into one. This was done rather well, and has you wonder how everyone is holding up when not playing them, even though at times it can feel a little artifical how by the unlikeliest of circumstances and against all odds they still find each other again in a conflict as chaotic and brutal as this one consuming lives left and right regardless of ambitions and hopes.\n\nThe story itself has some emotionally striking moments but otherwise left little impression to me. That's no real issue though since this game is more about the people and their imminent struggles within this time period which all works well enough as it happens. Even so I could've lived without the first half or so of the game having you chase down some evil German general criss-crossing Europe in his Zeppelin because that was just too much a cliché for my taste. There is a genius scientist of sorts too, fortunately not a mad one. If you can forgive these stereotypes you still have a beautifully designed and emotionally engaging experience that can be called bold for presenting things in such a rather unique, thoughtful manner and tackling a war that might be criminally underrepresented in games.","March 10","true","9.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I decided to play it again on PC. I'd say, by far, this is one of the best games on World War I.\nThe four characters were tightly connected by the war they fought. Other than the French soldier was the father-in-law of the German one, the rest of them did not know each other until this very war. They trust each other with their lives. They saved each other, and would die for each other. This is a sad story with a stunning ending. It's a story about "the little people" during the war.\nThe First World War affected everyone, regardless if one was a soldier or a civilian. WWI put both sides into a 4-year agony. In the frontline, war was no more glorious. The future of Europe lay dead in the trenches while machineguns firing, artillery shelling and poisonous gassing took souls. In the Battle of Verdun, on average, 1 French and 1 German died in every minute. And this tragedy lasted for 10 months! Back at home, families were shattered in pieces and family members were apart. You would even know if your loved ones had survived the bombard if you were a soldier in the front line. Remarque once remarked that none of his generation had escaped the war, including those who survived. He believed that his generation was destroyed.\nNowadays people are still slaughtering each other in every corner of the world. We are experiencing war in video games and movies while people in Gaza, Syria, Iraq, etc are experiencing it themselves.

I just finished this and I must say everything about this game was beautiful, the story, game-play, music & sound, historical importance and art. I recommend this game to anyone who loves history, especially WW1 (which seems to get overlooked, not only in games but in historical remembrance). This isn't an FPS, this is a game with a beautiful story and amazing historical lessons. I didn't even mind reading the long history mini lessons thrown in there, and the collectibles were nice too and gave some nice added character to the environments. The story wasn't a very huge lore oriented plot, it was simple, and I actually cared. The game-play was innovative and fun and I was absolutely never bored. Music & sound, just play it, beautifully done. As for the art, it seems like everything was tastefully drawn and quite attractive. The 4 chapters were an absolute joy to play through. I recommend this game to anyone, seriously, buy it.\n\nLe verdict: 10/10 - parfait !","May 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You don't see many puzzle games based around war but Valiant Hearts pulls it off. I can not recommend this game enough. Just buy it, whether it's on sale or not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/260230/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","This game sort of resembles an old school point and click...only you don't use the cursor, if that makes sense. You'll interact with objects in the environment in order to progress and solve puzzles and move along the story. You'll be hinted at what to do through simple cues given by the npcs, and more direct clues in the menus if you need more explicit direction. You'll play as multiple people throughout the story, and each of them focuses on slightly different abilities.  You can carry only one item, which you can either drop, give to your dog (if it is present) or throw. So this limits what you can do and the complexity of the puzzles, which is okay. Some of the puzzles are tricky but there's always only one solution so with the limited number of items and small areas, it's generally not hard to exhaust your options and figure out what has to be done.\n\nThe game leans style over substance, but not to an excessive extent. The artwork is great and very pleasant to look at, and the music is equally fitting. It has an emphasis on piano instrumentation, which I always enjoy. The limited scope of the puzzles is somewhat disappointing but there's enough variety to what the game has you do that it never feels like you're iterating the same thing too many times.  It even has a pair of events that's reminiscent of something out of Rhythm heaven, to give an idea of some of the ways the game changes how you'll progress. The only exception is that the nurse character, Anna, will have to go into a QTE-GuitarHero-Lite sort of minigame far too many times to treat people. The game itself is fine, nothing special, but you'll do it maybe 3 times as many times as you should have needed to.\n\nMight go without saying, but the game is extremely easy. Checkpoints are very often, and the boss encounters (not that many, maybe 2) are obvious general-fair that you've surely seen before in a different coat of paint. The story is not told with much voice acting, but what little is there sounds fitting and is narrated from a third person view, with the characters only rarely ever speaking full lines for themselves. There's also optional diary entries for the characters, as well as little factoids that will act as educational snippets about WWI. It's all optional, but it's good to see that at least some deal of research was done to keep this portrayal of the war to be somewhat faithful and respectful.\n\nIt probably took me like 6 hours to go through. There's collectibles but that don't seem to do anything other than...be collectible. The UPlay unlock is just 4 parts of a comic. Yeah, it requires Uplay. Once I remembered my login and updated, I didn't have any issues. So a fun game to spend a couple evenings on, especially if you got it for cheap. The last sequence is pretty memorable. Just don't expect something complex or challenging.","June 28, 2014","true","8.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This alone should be enough to convince you to buy Valiant Hearts, but let's go on. :D\n\nAt first I was puzzled about what this game was about, since the marketing campaign of Valiant Hearts was handled poorly. In the end, Valiant Hearts is an adventure game with puzzle/action/stealth elements. The gameplay is pretty basic: the game is more about telling a story and making you learn something. Even though the gameplay is basic, it's still appealing and well-paced enough to keep you engaged until the end.\n\nThe plot is about four characters (and a dog), which stories intertwine as the First World War rages on. It tells about their struggles, their motivations and their desperations. It's a grim tale where hope is the only element that makes men and women keep going on. You'll grow fond of the characters, and as you play you'll empathize with them. The presentation helps greatly in making you 'feel' the story and empathize with the characters: the artwork is phenomenal, the music is always spot on. Playing is truly a joy for the eyes and ears, the UbiArt Framework has delivered once again. The game is also full of information about the war. Reading such information is totally optional, but you should not skip it. :)\n\nMy only gripe is that there is a story arc which could have been excluded from the game without consequences. It's not a meaningful story arc, actually it's detrimental to the whole plot (you'll see by yourself, no spoilers here).\n\nI hope this game and Child of Light performed well, so we can get more games like these from Ubisoft.","July 2, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ brings you a classic deep and emotional drama that would make you shed tears without the use of romance."\nValiant Hearts: The Great War™ is a point and click game set during World War I. You play interchangeably between the four protagonists of the story. The game very well emphasizes the hardships and struggle during the Great War. You'll be able to see the Great War through Four perspectives. You'll encounter some puzzles as you progress through the story. The game is quite short with only 4 chapters but the plot itself is very much worth it. The story itself is the main selling point of this game. It also features some historical facts about the Great War and challenges the player to collect all historical items scattered throughout each chapter. The game's music and graphics are well-made. The narration is also done very nicely. You'll sink in into the feels as the story goes deeper.\n\n[b1]My Personal Rating:[/b1]\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nOverall Rating: 9.25\n\nI recommend this game to those who love point and click games. If you're not much of fan of Point and click games then how about trying it for the game's storyline? Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ offers not just the usual point and click puzzles but there are also unique minigames which are totally connected to the story. Once you start playing this game, the only thing left for me to say is:\n\n"Brace yourself for the feels are on their way!"\n\nNOTE:\nThis game requires you to run UPlay so it'll be quite a burden to computers who don't have good RAMs and processors.","July 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

The genre can most accurately be described as Adventure game with some light arcade elements, however the actions you will be performing range from "Pipe Dream" style puzzles to angle based tank artillery combat. The stoy keeps you interested and the characters are almost instantly lovable. Each "Valiant Heart" has their own speciality and personality which makes them all feel like people you'd like to see make it to the end of their Great War tale. Sadly, this won't be the case (as you know from the outset). Who will live and who will die provides drama, but the great music and haunting backgrounds do more than enough to create atmosphere without the fear of death.\n\nIf you enjoy games about human strife and warfare without the need to constantly shoot someone, or if you just like a good adventure game with a fairly easy difficulty curve, you will love this game.","June 26, 2014","true","6.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The Graphics have a cartoony/artistic feel to it which matches nicely with the 2d sidescrolling-puzzle world. The Puzzles themselves are not too complicated However, they are intelligent and really interesting to solve. Also, if you get lost there is a hint system which can be turned off. The Soundtrack is a mix of orchesteral music that meshed quite nicely with the plot.\nThe PC port is managable but it has no graphics options to tweak within the menus and is capped to 60fps. But, the game ran smoothly and I didn't encounter any problems even though it had uplay. I played this game using an Xbox 360 controller as it felt more natural since most of the puzzles have rotating levers that suit the analogue stick. Note that you have to plug in the controller first before launching the game so that it can recognize it.\nHighly recommend to buy this game. The story is very addictive and you cannot stop until you see how it ends.\nSerious historical setting, touching story with a dash of comedy.

But that's not what this game is about anyway, so if you think you can overlook that, stick with me and keep reading.\n\nWhat really stands out, and I mean really stands out in this game is the storytelling.\nValiant Hearts follows four different personas with interwoven stories throughout the course of World War 1, "The Great War". You quickly become attached to the characters - a French farmer serving in the French army, his German son-in-law in the German military, a US soldier and a Belgian student serving as a medic - and feel involved in their and their families' fates, which lets you be a witness of the gruesome war in a way no documentary can convey.\nThe game depicts the war in an authentic, accurate and thus very cruel way, not hesitating to show the suffering of women and children - war doesn't stop where the battlefield ends. Still, there are many moments of joy and humanity to be found within the tragic, war-torn story - it simply is an impressive, eye-opening and absolutely beautiful experience.\nIf you enjoyed Telltale's The Walking Dead you'll most likely love this game - same goes if you're interested in history, of course.\nThe game comes with 2D-optics, so there's not much to say about high fidelity graphics, but the game has a really nice art design. The drawn, sort of cute graphics stand in stark contrast to the the terrible, all to real horror that was World War 1, but somehow that doesn't hinder you from identifying with the characters of the game - quite the contrary, actually.\nWhen I finished the game, it seriously send a shiver down my spine.\n\nValiant Hearts really shows the potential of the medium videogame. There aren't many other games that left me as impressed as this one.\n\n-> 10/10","March 30","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's rare that a game shows you that you don't have to feel victorious to make the time worthwhile.\n\nThis is not a "no guts, no glory" game about war. This puts you in the position of unwilling German infantryman, just trying to get home to his wife and son. It puts you in the position of a Belgian nurse, trying to help out as best she can. You direct an old French farmer through the trenches and tunnels, and never feel like a "chosen one". And the American leading the charge? He feels more fallible than heroic.\n\nWith items to find that bring up pictures and short pieces of real WWI history associated with them, you're more connected to these beautifully animated characters and the dissolving world around them. Well chosen music just helps to set the tone.\n\nI've wanted to play this one properly since it came out, and with ANZAC Day strongly in my mind, I'm glad I found time for it this year. I'd encourage anybody with an interest in the history and sombre side of war to check it out.

You are put in the shoes of 4 different  characters, each set on their own personal goal. Emilie, the old father, drafted in the french army against his will. Freddie, A american volunter fighting for his wife. Anna, A belgian nurse looking for her father. Karl, emiles son in law and german soldier.\n\nAmazing story worthy of an oscar\n\nFirst thing first. I mainly bought this game because of the story and setting. I had read so many good reviews for this game and the fact that I am interested in both world wars. I got what I paid for and more. At first the story starts of a bit slow. Emile says goodbye and are drafted in the army. We dont know what Karl is doing for the moment and we meet Freddie at the train station. However the story picks up quickly and once it does you heart will be pumping. Now I am going to try and keep this short and not give away too many spoilers considering this game focuses a lot on story. The story is very similair to the classic war movies/series like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and Generation War. This game is not like the story of Call of Duty, Battlefield or Medal of Honor (Comparing to the topic here). In this game war is hell on earth, and there is nothing worse than war. Now that is what makes this game different from those games. You can also learn a lot from this game aswell. While playing the game you can pick up collectibles. each time you find a new collectible, you get a new entry in the journal, which describes the object and gives us information about it. each chapter and mission has it's own entry in the book and tells about the battles like, verdun, somme etc. During my history class I can tell you that I pretty much owned the test thanks to this game.\n\n\nVery simple puzzle based gameplay\n\nI had already seen gameplay of this game, so I already knew what to expect. To be honest I was surprised by it, and I had alot of fun. The gameplay is so simple but yet addicting somehow and the puzzles are simple but yet tricky in some parts. I think that the collectibles also has a very strong part in the gameplay considering I was looking for them throughout the whole game and it added alot more to the experience. Not much more to say other that it was fun and simple.\n\n\nWould buy again\n\nThis game lives up to it's reviews and more. Got a good grade on my history test and I enjoyed every second playing it.

I loved this game from start to finish, a 10 hours dip into WW1 and in a melting multi-character story about war's harshness, stupidity and senselessness.\n\nAt first glance, looking at its screenshots, someone could be fooled thinking this is a kid's educational game; but once you take the gamepad in your hands, you'll discover the comic style graphics are perfect for it, as every location is so full of character and detail. And when you'll hear the FANTASTIC instrumental soundtrack, so emotional and vibrant, you'll start to be captured by Valiant Hearts.\n\nThe gameplay is on the easy side indeed, the environmental puzzles and action sequences will not block your progress towards the end titles. But during the game you'll guide different characters and in some instances you'll have to switch between two or more of them in order to help each other. This brings a bit of diversification in puzzles and level design, which is not bad at all. I also think that difficulty and game length are perfectly and intelligently balanced, keeping you interested and never bored until the end.\n\nSomething that started as a small project to commemorate the victims and heroes that died 100 years ago in World War 1, in my eyes became one of the best games produced by Ubisoft in the last years, and one of my personal favorites. Not to mention all the very interesting infos about all aspects of WW1 the game provides to the player, from daily routines in trenches to the war's consequences on civilians. As someone said, this could be easily used as an educational tool in schools!\n\nPlease Ubisoft, continue to support this little projects of yours, Valiant Hearts is the perfect example of what a very talented team can realize with a small budget but great ideas. We love "triple A" games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell and Far Cry, but sometimes a brief but refreshing breath of wind is necessary. And you, hardened videogamer who's still dubious about VH, don't hesitate and click on that green button below, you'll not be disappointed!","February 24, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The story centres around the interwoven destinies of five characters, inspired by actual letters in that war.\n\nEach character has their different motivations, and it is through their camaraderie that they can act upon them. Each story is compelling, and you'll definitely be whole-heartedly immersed.\n\nThe art direction and animation style is probably what you'll find the most striking.  The 2D comic-style art doesn't attempt to hide the gruesome and brutal truths from the Great War  , which is very important. These are incredibly sombre themes they were trying to tackle, and the fact they didn't skirt around or trivialise the horrors, is admirable. Its not all horrible, however. There is some great humour in parts, which eases up the tension.\n\nWhen travelling through each area, which is usually a famous setting or turning-point in the war, you can bring up war facts about the area, the conditions the soldiers lived in, etc. In addition, each level has collectables to find, which sheds further light in retelling what life was like at those times. This experience wasn't only immersive, but also educational. I learned far more here than I probably would in a lecture environment. Maybe, in future, games like these can be used for more formal educational purposes.\n\nThe orchestral soundtrack was perfectly fitting to each scenario.  Haunting when trudging past piles of corpses, yet delightful when in a car chases (to the music of the can-can, to name one!).\n\nThe puzzles themselves have a perfect difficulty curve as you progress. In no point did I get truly frustrated, yet you feel pretty clever when you get it right. The tasks range from going on scavenger hunts, trading with several people until you get what you need, to digging your way around trenches, to safe-cracking. Plenty of variety.\n\nOverall, this small-scale human perspective of the war is an excellent way of not only retelling an important time in history, but also producing a heartfelt story that resonates with you for a long time after completion.\n\nIGN Review\n\n","May 1, 2015","true","25.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

The best part about this game for me is all the knowledge you get from the many facts and curiosities that are given as reward for collecting optional items and such. As someone that loves the subject of wars, specially the 2 world wars that happened, it was a good experience for me since I got to learn about things I didn't know before by playing this game.\n\nThe story is good. Before I played this I saw a lot of people saying it was really emotional heavy and I was expecting lots of things to make the players cry or feel bad somehow, but after completing it I must say it isn't that heavy. You'll probably only get the "feels", as they say, by the end.\n\nThe only thing that I think is missing from the game is another character with a different perspective from the others (they are all on the allies side), it really bothers me how there's no one having their story told from the German side (Karl doesn't count), specially since that kind of perspective is very often not known by people. I wouldn't say the game tries to deliver the "good guys vs bad guys" crap, but if I was making the game I would add another character.\n\nI rate this game 7/10 and recommend buying it during a sale if you like games that focus on the story and find the history of WW1 interesting.","May 7","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Not enough space.)\n\nI received this game from a friend that I consider my brother and know in person, Earl[33rd], and thank him immensely for the opportunity to play this heart-pulling title! Also a special thanks to LockeProposal of Locke’s Big Day Out for reviewing this lengthy review! Valiant Hearts is a game that is, simple enough, one that focusses on the story as an experience with puzzle elements, with World War I taking the setting in comparison to the generic World War II setting. This title takes approximately 7 hours to finish-probably much less if you do not mess up on the puzzles as much as I did-but thought the game to be challenging as it was intriguing. Oh, and this requires UPlay, which does not take long to set up.\n\nApart from the practical things you might hear about Valiant Hearts, I must say that the game pulled at my heartstrings quite severely, boasting an amazing story that is effectively presented in ways that will be explored below. Even if you believe yourself to be proficient in World War history, the pure magnitude and scope of this game's masterful storytelling will find ways to show you something new. It does well to explore the conflict, more as a person affected, and less as a distant observer.\nThere are a few things that I found really interesting about this title:\n\nVoice Acting (or the lack thereof) - Valiant Hearts takes an interesting approach on telling this gripping tale. Though there are short phrases utilized by some of the characters to give them more depth-such as Freddie saying, “Good dog,” whenever the companion is pet throughout the game-the story is only told primarily through between-chapter narrations, as well as through other means, described next. This take actually turned out pretty well, in my opinion, as it allows the characters’ actions to tell the tale rather than context having to be provided by openly speaking.\n\nCollectibles - Normally, collectibles in video games are just that: collectible figures that are meant to distract the players or add extra content without contributing or taking away from the story. This is one of those rare occasions-shared with other games such as The Darkness II-that actually utilizes collectible items as background to the story in contexts with history. Also, the items are pretty well placed, so they do not feel as random as collectibles in other titles.\n\nDiaries - As explained previously, there is almost no voice acting in this title, but that does not limit the characters from giving their view on story progression. You can access these through the Start/Esc menu, and can give perspective to how the characters are thinking at given times. Some diary entries may be a bit repetitive at times (e.g. Freddie speaking of a certain person and not being able to relieve his pain of loss) but still are a nice little read.\n\nComparison to History - Valiant Hearts moves between specific movements between key battles and events during World War I. The history lessons given in the Tab menu, diary entries, and collectible backgrounds allow the player to draw context between the game and the true history of World War I. For example, the Germans were the first to utilize chlorine gas as chemical warfare during this war, and these gas attacks appear in numerous portions of the game. However, if you review the entry on chlorine gas in the Tab menu on the level when the deadly gas is introduced, you are given a background from history as to why this agent was introduced in the game.","June 18, 2015","true","7.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","5"

It was the amount of time I spent crying at the end of the game. I was crying for so many reasons, I was overjoyed and I was heartbroken at the same time, the ending will do that to you. This game has a story that will blow you away. Recently it has become a trend to compare the quality of a game's story to that of a Telltale game's story. So I will do just that. This game, has brought out more raw emotion in me, than the ending of Walking Dead Season 1, which I thought was my favorite game until I played this.

The stalemates and trench warfare of World War 1 do not lend themselves to compelling game design however and as such has largely gone untouched. Ubisoft has stepped up and put together a creative game that not only recreates the events of mankind's first world war but has managed to do so with a bit of personality and even a touch of levity. The end result takes a bit of side scrolling, a dash of puzzle solving and a tablespoon of history and turns them into one of the most compelling games of the year.\n\nDiverging from action and focusing on the narrative and history of the first world war, Valiant Hearts follows the lives of Karl, Anna, Emile, and Freddie. Karl, a German immigrant living in France with his wife and child is deported in anticipation of war. Emile, Karl's father-in-law who is drafted into the French army. Anna, a Belgian veterinarian student in search of her scientist father taken captive by the German forces. Freddie, the volunteer American out to exact revenge on those responsible for the death of a loved one and lastly Walt, a doberman pincher canine companion who plays a key role in the lives of his human counterparts.\n\nDespite it's cartoon visuals, Valiant Hearts doesn't shy away from the cruel reality of war and puts you in the shoes of those affected by it. Whatever the reason the harsh truth is that War changes lives and the fight for survival is not only for ones self but friends, family, and country. It isn't always a dark experience, its visual charm and humor often gives it a soft hearted touch reminding you that even in war we can empathize with our foes in the darkest hours. The lives of our heroes repeatedly intertwine, along the journey, whether it's to support a fellow soldier in battle to aiding in an escape the journey is repeatedly done along side a partner developing them not just as individuals but as group. Each with their own goal but with a shared link.\n\nWith each new chapter Valiant Heart lectures the audience by giving the player a bit of history via pictures and artifacts. They not only give insight on the history but inform the player of the roles and purposes of the items found and the evolution of the war tactics.\n\nAs a sidescrolling adventure game Valiant Heart's gameplay is largely composed of puzzles. The controls are the same all around with certain characters having unique abilities. Some puzzles involve item gathering and swapping while other become a bit more elaborate without becoming too difficult. They often develop the character and never feel too tedious with a only few coming off as filler. There's enough variety to keep  the proceedings fresh with a few tasks becoming a bit of chore while other are too complex for their end result. One moment you're assaulting a strategic point and the next you're escaping a POW camp through stealth, it's a brilliant perspective not often explored by developers with the given context.\n\nPowered by the same engine that gave life to Rayman Origins, Legends and Child of Light we could only expect the best from the artist of Montpellier. The necessary amount of color, and grudge depict the world brilliantly. The multiple layers and comic book strips are not only aesthetic implementations but a gameplay accessory. Most of the in-game audio chatter is expressed though jibber jabber while the narrator does most of the telling. It's a perspective that gives insight between character shifts without being out of place. The soundtrack fits the era and immerses the players into the experience, an orchestral tone compose of wind instruments sets up the action intense moments, as the strings tag the tense heavy scenarios. Let's not forget to mention the enchanting piano pieces through out the emotional segments, all in all it's an exceptional soundtrack.\n\nInspired by the letters of soldiers fighting along the western fronts Valiant Heart inspiration is given a the proper care. It may seem short and easy for the average and hardcore gamer but in the end the experience is well worth the asking price. Valiant Hearts is an educational for those not so keen on history and a delightful take on a subject that usually leans heavy on action. The characters are memorable, the art is beautiful, and the subject at hand is real. There is justice done for this horrific time in history and developer Ubisoft Montpellier implemented their style to create an experience that honors the Valiant Hearts of World War 1.\n\nScore: 8.5\n\n+ Amazing art direction and soundtrack\n+ Memorable cast of characters\n+ Variety in puzzles\n+ Fresh take on a game inspired by war\n+ History lesson for non-history gurus\n\n- Boss fights are underwhelming\n- Easy for the average gamer\n- Low replay value\n- Short length","August 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/recommended/260230/","lefiath","lefiath | CZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/","583 products in account","Truly great adventure and experience! This humble game came out of nowhere and has a lot of going on. Gameplay is varied and combines puzzle solving with rhytmic fast-paced sections, it even has some boss battles. While generally consistent, it always adds something fresh and new. But most importantly, the biggest drive of this game is the feeling, overall atmosphere and art style. There is always stuff happening in the backgrounds, graphically the game is simply gorgeous and the biggest thing is, that you feel like a soldier trying to survive in madness that war is. Sometimes you'll get to kill others, but most of the time you spend doing ordinary things that aren't boring in the slightest. For majority of developers, FPS is the first thing to come in mind when we talk about war in general, and shooting anything that moves and has a wrong color is a theme that overshadows anything else happening on battlefield. Here, it's the opposite. Battlefield is the theater, but you're not playing crazy gunman #315 that kills every nazi (most war FPS happen in WW2 anyways), you're playing as a group of different people, none of them being Rambo.\n\nWhich takes me to the next point, characters. Are all great and likable, while being quite different. One of the driving things is also that the game is almost silent, there is very little dialogue, well, characters and NPCs say stuff, but it's quiet and unless you speak german, french and english at once, you won't understand these shouts anyways. The game can be very light hearted (it feels like an old fable, but it's not disrespectful, it's still has a very mature settings) but sometimes dives into downright silly situations with crazy inventions or invincible airships, which kind of takes you out of the otherwise naturalistic and brutal portrait the rest of the game is painting. Well, I guess they had to add at least some shooting stuff as a safe bet. It would be perfectly fine without it, but it's not like those sections are annoying or anything, they just feel out of place. Most of the time though, it's great. And the music is brilliant too - doesn't feel out of place, but doesn't feel too old or archaic as well.\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles which I wasn't sure about at first, but after I've found out that it's basically building a little encyclopedy for you (everything you find adds a little bit of an interesting background information), I've collected pretty much everything, because I love games that educate you in an entertaining and noninvasive way. It's completely optional of course, but it's fun, brief and interesting, because first world war is generally overlooked, so many of us never learns much about it.\n\nAs I've said before, game is quite varied, there are no two levels that would really look the same, content is a king. I beleive you can finish it in 6-7 hours, which can look short on paper, but because there is always something new going on, beleive me, it's more than enough. Story and game itself feel complete, it doesn't look like they had to cut something because of budget limitations like in other games (namely Kane and Lynch), you'll be enjoying every moment of this game and for that, six hours is just fine. Overall, the game only gets better towards the end, so you're left with satisfaction.\n\nThere are few annoyances like the occasional moment in any adventure game, where you just aren't on the same wave as the designer and it isn't obvious to you what you're expected to do. Annoyingly enough, it usually happened to me when there was no hint available, so I guess I'm just an idiot. I was fighting my keyboard before I've just given up and plugged in gamepad, it's clear they haven't spend much time making the keyboard version, if you have gamepad, just don't bother with it. Some bugs here and there, and the difficulty of quick time events can get a bit annoying, but those are small issues, there is nothing that would prevent you from enjoying the game.\n\nVerdict: This game has personality. Gameplay is decent, but it's secondary to the overall experience you'll get. So if what you see doesn't touch you, don't buy it, because you'll probably won't enjoy it.","September 9, 2014","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Valiant Hearts brings the other side of wars (in this case, World War I), so instead of killing enemies to win the game (SPOILER ALERT: although at nearly the end of the game you are forced to kill someone), you will solve puzzles (and collect items, which is completely optional but required towards 100% completion of the gam... ahem... achievements). There are only four characters, and most of the time you will control only one of them. Don't get disheartened; a canine friend will help during the quest of war (and sometimes your cooperation will be required to continue). This game needs only less than 10 hours to complete, and if you are stuck on a particular puzzle, wait until the game gives you hints (or pay attention to your canine friend, mostly he will bark to item of interest). Great story, the last minutes are pretty tense, and the ending is quite emotional; be warned. Assassin's Creed players will be familiar of the Animus Database; this game also offers similar journal, or real-world facts about WW I, and you can fire up the browser to find more information. What a fun way to learn history!\n\nIn short, this game is for you who love historical events and to show that wars offer us no good.\n\nSome may be concerned about Uplay (and its frequent updating), but don't let it discourage you from buying and playing this game. If you can install Steam to manage your games, then Uplay is not a big deal.\n\nOh, and for some players, this game might be punishing. One hit of a bullet is a one hit kill. Explosions will kill instantly if you are within range. Gases will also kill. So enjoy your timing to avoid them at all costs :)","July 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Worth playing as a piece of art.\nHowever, I can't really call it a platformer game - it's indeed more of an interactive comic book.

The game is quite short and easy - you can easily finish it in 2 days with no haste. It's also filled with educational material and the violence of war is shown in a subtle way (yet your comrades are often being killed in front of you, be aware) - so it might be a good game for older children.\nIf you expect a challenging, fast-paced arcade game - don't buy it. You'll get bored.\nIf you want to recreate a sad, but interesting story, packed with artistic value, then Valiant Hearts might be a good experience for you.\n\nJust a warning - Valiant Hearts is an Ubisoft game, so it requires installing and running Uplay (even when bought on Steam).","October 6, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, I'd no idea that the very first dedicated title I'd receive to fill that desire was going to be Valiant Hearts. At first I was quite skeptical, it being a 2D side-scroller that lacked direct combat and all. But the trailers had me hooked none-the-less, and I was eager to throw down my pre-order the moment I was able.\n\nThis game had me emotionally involved the moment it'd begun, it has a very, very good way of toying with your psyche. At first, you're all hyped, the game's atmosphere when Emile goes off to join the army makes you feel powerful and ready, and the game does a good job at using the characters and imagery to make you feel a sense of patriotism for France. But then, you actually get into the war, and gradually that hope begins to falter as you lose faith in the grand scheme of your nation's war-effort. Instead, you begin to focus solely on these characters who're doing their best to keep their lives together in this harsh time, hoping that only the best can happen to them in the end.\n\nInstead of direct front-line combat, the characters you play have more support roles. Game-play is present, and it takes place in the shape of various puzzles and stealth-scenes that require a healthy brain to surpass, rather than an itchy trigger finger. Boss fights are satisfying, just like most of the puzzles, and the game does a damn-good job of making sure that there's no needless fluff or filler to waste your time; everything you do feels like it's where it needs to be and is relevant. This game's story is a tear-jerker, even if some of the plot is easily able to be anticipated. Yet, the writers did a fantastic job at unfolding this tale, and I can honestly say that it has one of the best endings from both a literary, and emotional stand-point.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't until the ending that I cried, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's not a story about martyrs, war-heroes, or soldiers, it's a story about people who just want to live their lives and be happy. As much as I want to write about the only ending in video game history that ever made me bawl like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I think it'd be better to just let people who've yet to experience this wonderful title to indulge in it themselves.

I highly recommend to any with a heart.","June 29, 2014","true","17.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBaDum/recommended/260230/","nBaDum","scoobz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBaDum/","223 products in account","Let’s state the most obvious flaw with Valiant Hearts prior to me actually talking about the game itself.\nThis is a Ubisoft game. Meaning you are forced to use their 3rd party DRM, Uplay.\nTake that as you will, I just feel that it is important to mention when it comes matters such as this as many people deal with many issues in Uplay.\n\n\nValiant Hearts is 2D puzzle game set in the first World War, following the story of several characters of which you get to play as Emile, Freddie, Karl, Anna, and a dog called Walt.\n\nThe art style in Valiant Hearts is that of a comic book.\nIn itself, this is no issue at all, it’s perfectly fine. However, graphically the game is unimpressive to say the least.\nCountless times I’ve witnessed the camera zooming-in slightly on a certain part of the scene, only to be distracted by the incredibly jaggy lines of objects or general area on the screen which I’ve stumbled upon.\nI understand that some would consider this a minor and petty complaint, but as I see it, it is still important to mention as it can completely pull you out of the game while trying to get immersed with the story telling the game tries to offer you.\n\nThe puzzles are a weakness of Valiant Hearts. They’re no-brainers, yet at times illogical. They easily break the pacing of the game and disconnect you from its narrative.\n\nYou follow our unlikely heroes’ unlikely story through unlikely puzzles.\n\nMost of the time the game is divided to the gameplay (mainly puzzle-solving) and the story. Both of which are the most important, main components of Valiant Hearts as an adventure-story-driven-puzzle game.\nValiant Hearts is incapable of balancing these two pieces, and fails in combining them so they could add up to make this an enjoyable game.\n\nThe story is emotional, tear-jerking, and as mentioned – unlikely. All which make it stronger together as a whole.\nIt’s incredible to think that it’s based on a true story connected through letter from the War.\n\nThe unlikelihood of the events of Valiant Hearts are what makes the art style fitting and not just a mean of presenting the irony and contrast in showing the grim, dark, horrific reality of war through a  softly painted world with the aesthetics of a children’s comic book.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that throughout the game you are provided with little bits and pieces of information regarding the War. These are very much worth reading through. They are not given to you for nothing and they’re not forced as you can access them through the menu.\n\n\nAll in all, in the end, after crying for a while, you don’t remember the puzzles. You’re only left with this one, final image from the last scene, and the beautiful, mesmerizing, heartbreaking soundtrack playing in the background.\n\nAnd that’s what makes this experience so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ worth it.","December 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Puzzles were not that hard but they were not that easy though ^^. And the best part is STORY, it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing that i couldn't stand crying at the end. Historical facts were absolutely awesome that you imagine that you lived in these age.

As someone who is an avid history buff, this showed me a different view of WWI that I have never seen before, a personal one. This game takes you on a journey of emotion among 5 friends, five comrades, five lost souls to the treachery of war. Emile, a Frenchmen, Freddy, an American fighting alongside the Entente, also Emiles best friend, Anna, the blue bird that saved them all on countless ocations, Karl, a French born man with German roots, that was conscripted to fight against his own family as a member of the German Empire, and of course, the beloved medical dog, Walt. These 5 characters take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they brace the harsh conditions of war together. You learn a lot about the First World War in this game, the bone chilling facts of the war and have your brain put to the test with the various puzzles in the game. I have never, in my life played a game that has given me so much emotion, ever. The ending of this game made me cry for 3 reasons; 1: This wonderful game came to an end. 2: It made me realize how lucky we of this generation are to have had such brave souls, members of that "Lost Generation" fight for us back when they did. 3: The ending was just terribly sad, I literally cried. I can't reccommend this game enough, it has taken me on a wonderful ride and I HIGHLY reccommend you all play this game, whether you know about The Great War, or not, this game will teach you about it, and do it while entertaining you.\n\nVerdict?\n\n10/10 Would cry again.","June 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's obvious. The storyline, the puzzles, the missions, the atmosphere, the music, the collectibles, the facts, the diaries, the characters - everything inside this game is excellent! But I just want to say about how I felt after playing this game. I felt educated, because I learned so many things about the war. I felt alive, because the atmosphere was so great that it felt like I was inside the game. I felt sad, because of the cruelty of the war. I really felt like I got aboard the feeling train, I went a trip with it, then I disembarked from it, and then it ran over me twice. I always enjoy games with a deep storyline, but no game ever has touched my feelings before. Why is it so hard for developers to make games like this? Why games nowadays are only mindless fun and they lack even a simple storyline? Why don't you take an example from this game? Thank you, Ubisoft, for making this game.","March 18, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I knew from the start that there would be a time somewhere in the game that I would break down and cry for mankind.\n\nAnd the tears did flow.\n\nValiant Hearts is a game that I haven't seen in nearly a decade: a game that has a story so simple, but so deep, that one gets sucked in and finds themselves thrown into the midst of warfare on a horrific scale. We've all seen death and war, we've all played those games.. but it's hard to feel sorry for the person you're killing; how often does a game tell you both sides? How often do we see the faces of the families that a soldier is forced to leave behind, or hear the letters and emotions that seep from their own stories and woes.\n\nHow often do we feel a connection all our own?\n\nFrom the start, from a simple farmer, to the bitter end - through good times and bad - we FEEL them. For once in generations, we can hear the echos from a time that I hope we never see again..\n\nWill you, my dearest friend, listen..?\n\n10/10","June 26, 2014","true","13.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

That said though, most of Valiant Hearts was a great experience, and almost alone amongst video games, portrayed war in a humanist manner. The puzzles and exploration of this point-and-click game is focused far more on surviving the fields, trenches, prisoner camps, and occupied towns of the Western Front of World War I, than on actually fighting the war itself.\n\nThis is also very much a character driven event, with a cast of fairly interesting and sympathetic characters for protagonists, representing several different nationalities from both sides of the war. I would say that the game succeeds at neither making heroes or villians out of either the Allied or Central Powers, but this attempt is undermined by a somewhat out of place and ridiculous sub-plot about a cartoon-ish evil German Baron some of the protagonists are chasing down for several reasons. Luckily it isn't the main focus of Valiant Hearts, but this story ultimately ends rather suddenly and bizarrely and serves almost no purpose other than to give a reason for the characters to move from location to the next.\n\nThe better moments of the game are the first half hour or so (as the blissful civilian life for one character is tranformed by the war's beginning) and the surprisingly emotionally end, though there are highlights scattered throughout. Overall Valiant Hearts is a mixed bag, and while I've mentioned a lot of things it doesn't do well, there's a real emotional core to this experience that made it worthwhile to me. Hopefully Valiant Hearts is successful enough to become a series, with future games that continue to maturely tell stories of living through a war, not just fighting it. Hopefully this series also does a better job with consistency in tone and having some greatly improved player agency and gameplay. That said, I still recommend Valiant Hearts if you are a history buff, enjoy character driven stories, or if anything else about this unique project seems interesting.","October 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Valiant Hearts does neither of these thing it instead focuses on a more narrative driven experience within a Semi 2-D world focusing on puzzles to progress the story. The story focuses on 4 protagonists.  Emile who is a French farmer who becomes a POW during his first battle while searching for his son-in-law. Karl was German living in France before the war started. He is married to Emile's daughter Marie, both of whom have a son together. Karl is deported back to Germany when the war begins and is conscripted into the German army. Freddie who is an American soldier who enlists as an engineer for the French and vows revenge on the Germans who took away the life of his wife and Anna a Belgian nurse tending to the wounded soldiers on the battlefield. In the search of her father, captured by the Germans, she continues to tend to the wounded and find her father and finally there is the dog, an unnamed German shepherd who becomes a valued and trusted friend to each of its four human co-stars at one point or another throughout the game.\n\nThe puzzles often boil down to simply finding an item in one location and bringing it to another, though the context of these fetch quests manages to keep them interesting as you race to save civilians or use stealth to navigate behind enemy lines. The dog's presence also augments the puzzles in interesting ways, allowing you to control two characters at once, reach areas into which no human could fit or distract guards by simply being an adorable puppy. There are also rhythm mini games and these are used for the charging the trenches section of the game where you have to avoid enemy fire in order to progress. There are also similar section where you do the same in a car avoiding obstacles while the can can, can be heard playing in the background which is a nice touch. The boss battles should also be mentioned because while they are very smart takes on puzzles and bosses together they do seem to stretch they do give the sense of new technology in the war and having to overcome insurmountable odds.\n\nBut that’s not to say that all the games aspects are solid. The medic mini-game, however, is dull to play and forces your attention away from the action at hand so that amputating a soldier's arm is treated with the same rote monotony as giving a tired soldier a sip of water through rhythm quick time events. There can also be some confusing puzzles in late game but that should not be held against the game as the game does give you hints if it sees that you are stuck in a certain section and these usually helped enough so that the narrative could continue and move on to the next section of gameplay\n\nValiant Hearts: The Great War is a superbly titled game. It does its job of showing that war is one of man’s worst creations and how families were torn apart back then and are still being torn apart today by current wars.  It is a valiant effort at a sincere depiction of war by developers whose hearts were clearly in the right place, telling a gripping story that is still respectful of its source.\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\n","October 31, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is set in the first three years of the first world war and covers the story of several characters of different origin and situation and does a real good work of what in a fully fictional story would be called world building, but in this game is history education.\n\nThe game has really good music, voice acting and audio design in general, and the aesthetic of the game is based in a comic book/animation style that really hits the mark for telling this kind of story that is in essence rather grim. And make no mistake, it is a really grim setting. The story of this game has it's ups and downs, but it is in content really a message of how bad life during and in the middle of war can get.\n\nThe puzzles are easy to medium difficult I would say (there is a hint system if you find yourself having trouble with any of them), the driving sessions and the rythm games are nice break ups from the puzzling, and there are a few boss battles as well.\n\nHowever, the story is this game is it's strong point. It is a really strong story, with characters whose motivations, dedication and emotions are well fleshed out and make you really empathise with them and the decisions and consequent actions they are forced into.","October 11, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

O game conta a história de uma família rural, de Saint Mihiel na franca, em que um dos membros (Karl) por sua descendencia alema, é chamado para o exército alemao e é obrigado a deixar sua familia. Paralelamente, o pai da esposa de Karl (Emile), personagem principal do game, recebe uma carta sendo convocado para o exercito Frances e é obrigado a deixar somente sua filha e seu neto Victor. O gameplay do jogo nao é focado em matar os soldados para progredir, mas sim utilizar de poucas cenas de ação combinadas com puzzles mto bem pensados e divertidos de serem realizados, fazendo uma das mais brilhantes aventuras que vivenciei em um game até hoje. Valiant Hearts nao é só mais um jogo baseado em guerras, mas sim uma história, assim como um livro, um filme, capaz de passar emoção e um vinculo de proximidade com os personagens, recomendo esse game nao só para aqueles que curtem uma jogatina, que queiram conhecer uma história fantástica juntamente com uma lição de vida, mas tambem para aqueles que acham que video game nao trazem benefícios e servem apenas para divertimento, pois um game bem feito é muito mais do que isso, é uma história pra vida inteira e Valiant Hearts é um belo exemplo disso.\n","December 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Have. I. Played. A. Masterpiece.\n\nThis experience, no, this.....once in a lifetime event, the commemoration of the centenary of the great war of 1914-18, is an absolutely immersive, heartwarming, cold, dark, and yet unique take on the trauma and consequence of a war that really did shake the world. From the start off, I was hooked, the simplicity of the gameplay, not to mention the loveable and  well constructed characters, with a backplot not over-emphasized but yet provides enough information so that you can relate to them each in a different way, from the tough Freddie, to a father's love of his family (Emile), enough to go to war, to a german's complicated existence (Karl), and a young woman's heartfelt (Marie), yet innocent journey to find her father, this experience of the great war is one that I will not forget. The feel of each level is clear, emotions are high when going through this, i'm not one to cry, but this had made me reflect on the life the world has today, and the frailty of human life, why wars happen again and again, and the effect it has on each of us as individuals and human beings. I have nothing to recommend further, than this game is  a pure, honest and heartfelt account of various persons, going through their own hardships and tribulations, with the most violent and reflective backdrop. There is no need for action, the game itself is a work of art, and a masterpiece of the difficulty of the first world war. A game that focusses more on the real life emotives of humans, how events can change us, rather than a game of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to invest a relatively small amount of time, I heavily suggest you give this great title a try, and being the 101st anniversary of the great war coming up, there's no better reason to reflect on what many of us take for granted today, and how easily things can change, and change each of us.....\n\n10/10, an experience i've never had.","March 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ubisoft has somehow made a game about one of the most devastating conflics in history without thrusting a gun into your hands and killing all those dirty huns. What's more, it has been pulled off spectacularly. The soundtrack is simply beautiful. The puzzles are clever. Hints are available if you get stuck (Which you will, don't think you can play this game without getting frustrated only to be shown the answer was right in front of you). The characters have so much personality. Although they hardly speak you know what they mean and what emotions they express. I could not find a single bug or glitch.\n\nIn my opinion, best game i've played in a while. Crying in those last missions is understandable (Half of my sadness came from the game actually ending).\n\n10/10 It deserves much more recognition than it gets, buy it for your friends.\n\nP.S I don't know why everyone complains about Uplay.

This game is about making friendships and losing comrades.\nBeautiful graphics, excellent music, perfect sounds and oh... the story is absolutely brilliant!\nThe game is not boring nor short, I enjoyed every minute!\n\nYou can follow more stories in the Great War, you can visit more places, you can see both sides. Fates will intertwine. The game is totally enjoyable and highly educative:\nThis is not just a game, more than it. The game takes place at real battles, the chapters have historical backgrounds.\nAfter completing a task, you can access diaries for deeper understanding. During the gametime, you find and collect hidden objects, such as gas masks, coins, notes, things from those ages. You can find them later in the items menu, where you can read about those objects and actually you can learn about them. After you begin exploring a new area, you can access actual refurbished and colorized photographs, and you can read about the story of the place in a few sentences, this makes the game more interesting!\n\nThere are several puzzles in the game, after you get familiar with the game logic, cou can solve them without thinking too much. Anyways, you always can access hints for a little help if needed.\n\nThe only downside of the game is the crappy Uplay, unfortunatelly you can't avoid that. Achievements and other contents are only available inside Uplay.\nMy final word is this game is best in its genre, I highly recommend to buy it.","January 15, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are point and click puzzles, dodging games, a rhythm game while doing first aid, puzzles involving swapping between your character and your dog (who can fit in fox holes, distract soldiers, fetch items and pull levers), and actual historical facts mixed into a solid plot. You play as four different people and a war dog. You'll be digging trenches, ducking mortars, escaping from behind enemy lines, impersonating officers, blowing up a zepplin, pulling wounded men from piles of bodies just to see them shot down, and taking cover from machine gun nests behind those same piles of bodies. Despite the stylized cartoon art, the game manages to connect on an emotional level, at least it did for me.\n\nThe simple mechanics are used in interesting ways. In my favorite segment you are driving an escape car and must dodge mortar fire, TNT barrels, road blocks, strafing machine guns, grenades and ramming attacks by the giant tank chasing you long enough that its driver gets impatient and opens the hatch to throw nades (leaving it open for YOU to throw a grenade into the tank). AND you do all this synchronized to beautiful classical music! (Flight of the Bumble Bee.) The music in this game is wonderful.\n\nThe main downside is UPlay, but it didn't get in my way much. Opening in Steam directly opened the game and UPlay was minimized.\n\nThere is genuine emotion in this game, you can tell the developers cared and treated World War 1 with as much respect as they could in a video game about it. They included artifacts with detailed descriptions for you to find, letters from soldiers you may read, they based levels on actual events in the Great War, and short factual write ups on aspects of the war for each level. One of those write ups includes the fact that chlorine gas bombs killed men by burning when exposed to water, so the insides of unprotected soldier's lungs burned and blistered until they died in agony, and one of the remedies the men came up with was breathing through urine soaked rags. Horrible stuff but this developer didn't shy from it, war is hell.\n\nIt's a perfect game for history buffs, indie and adventure gamers, and people who love dogs. It has some moderate challenge, but isn't a hardcore type of game, I finished it in 6 hours and my reflexes aren't great.\n\n8/10","January 20","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/260230/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","Can a video game be fun, emotional, and educational all at once? The short answer is 'of course' but it's a tough combination to pull off. Enter Valiant Hearts, a narrative-first, 2D puzzle game set in the oft overlooked First World War.\n\nLets start with aspects that provide most of the "fun". The mechanics are a smooth blend of point and click style puzzles and physics or action based puzzling. There shouldn't be any puzzles that cause undue frustration and for the most part the solutions are fairly apparent for anyone who's been around the video game block once or twice. In other games the relatively low challenge level of the puzzles would probably be a detriment but, at least personally, in Valiant Hearts the puzzles were there to simply add contrast and tension to the story. There was even a small section in the final third of the game where the complexity of the puzzles started to draw too much attention away from the story, opening some chinks in the immersion.\nThe hand-painted artwork is very well done, especially some of the character designs, but is easy to overlook because the setting doesn't allow for much color and variety. The animation style is simple but an effective use of parallax backgrounds give the scenes plenty of motion and depth. A simple but hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is used effectively and actually provides some needed levity during the driving sections.\n\nUnsurprisingly the emotional punch is brought mostly by the story. I say "mostly" because it was actually some background NPCs that delivered one of the bigger blows personally. With that said, the story is no lightweight, as is to be expected from a game dealing with the travesty that is The Great War. You play four, really five, characters whose personal stories weave back and forth in an implausible but satisfying manner. In fact that's probably a good way to describe the entire plot. While it's clear that the story is a work of fiction and contains some obvious embellishments, it manages to remain grounded through its presentation and focus on the personal side of war. The decision to not focus on nations and figure heads is terrific and gives the frantic and unexpected ending the gravity it deserves.\n\nNow to complete the tri-fecta we have the educational aspects. Despite loving pretty much all of the rest of the game this was probably my favorite part. In the U.S. at least, WWI is almost criminally overlooked in most educational curriculums, probably due to our late entry to the war and no fighting happening on our soil, so the chance to learn more in a game setting was exciting. Valiant Hearts accomplishes this in a couple of ways. First off they use real places, real battles, and an accurate depiction of the players involved (it likely would never have occurred to me that the Canadians were heavily involved let alone how instrumental they were at times). For me though the more intriguing tidbits came from the short historical background info, complete with real photos, provided in each level and the collectible system. Scattered through each level are a number of items relevant to the level and war in general. When you find an item you can open a page that provides a little insight to the nature of the item and life during WWI in general. The combination of dramatized but immersive story and real life accounts allows for greater impact than either could provide alone and there in lies the beauty of using games for education. I really hope that the developers can find a way to give some other overlooked conflicts the Valiant Hearts treatment.\n\nAs promised, that's fun, emotion, and education in one game shaped package. Usually when making recommendations there are caveats like, "probably best for fans of genre X" or "Feel free to pass this up if you don't enjoy Y" but Valiant Hearts has no such caveats. I really feel that there is something here for everyone. Even if you know all the WWI facts already or don't typically enjoy puzzle games (there is a hint system for you folks by the way), simply being reminded that wars are fought by humans, on both sides, is something we all could benefit from.","June 8, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The puzzles do get a bit repetitive sometimes, but they do get significantly more difficult towards the end. The hint system is really good and if you're ever stuck you can just press F1 the game will help you without giving the puzzle away. 9/10\n\nART:\n\nMy oh my, this game is beautiful. Sure, you're not getting the whole 3D world that RPG's can boast about, but the cartoony look of this game is magnificent. The animations are fantastic, and I never noticed any jittering or wierd animations throughout the entire game. 10/10\n\nSOUND:\n\nAgain, absolutely nailed. Since I speak french and german, I noticed the characters were actually speaking in those languages. However, the music is my second favorite part of this game (favorite part to come). Ubisoft really went out of their way to make the music in this game fantastic, and even the music in the menu is superb. 10/10\n\nSTORY:\n\nIf you're looking for a good story, this one is fantastic. There are highs, there are lows, the story is a real emotional journey. Ubisoft does an amazing job of getting you to like and connect with the characters. And the ending will make you cry. And if you don't cry, or feel like crying, then you're a cold monster and should be playing Call of Duty because it's obvious that you don't connect with characters in stories. Rating: 100/10\n\nOVERALL: 10/10\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will give you around 6-8 hours of the best story you've ever seen, then pick up this game. At $15, I wish all games of this quality were priced that low.","December 9, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I’m not a big fan of the genre, but the game’s setting and appealing art style was enough to draw me in. The game did a good job of creating a compelling story that didn’t feel constrained or restricted by the overall historical accuracy of following World War 1. Also, attaching interesting historical facts and information to the game’s collectibles was a smart way of adding extra content into the game worth finding, rewarding you with context and backdrops for the levels you were playing through. Even though the game’s story was pretty whimsical at times, the serious undertone of what was going on and constant clash between the playful art style and the horrors of war definitely made playing this game a captivating experience.

I haven't had issues with Uplay and after beating this game I don't have a need for it again. That aside, let's look at the game.\n\nFirst up is the most glaringly obvious, this game is not the standard Ubisoft triple A title. The graphics are 2d and it is a linear sidescroller. However, if you love this kind of beautiful art like I do or just can handle a game that doesn't have ultra realistic faces then you'll love it. Graphics : 10/10\n\nSecondly we'll get to gameplay! The gameplay is superb and even a bit challenging. There is a great collection of puzzles to solve, fun segments of action, and even a little rhythm based mini game. Everything is done well and I haven't seen a single guffaw. Not a 10 simply because there are a puzzle or two that are a bit obtuse so you need to wait for a hint, which drop after a timer reaches zero whilst solving a puzzle. Gameplay 9/10\n\nthe music is great. The classical music is wonderful and fitting in the car chase segments while the action segments are accompanied by a wonderful few tracks. The ONLY issue I found is that the piano segment, although beautiful and wonderful, doesn't have an alternative piano track for the sad segments. Not much an issue, but preventing a perfect score for me. Music: 9/10\n\nFinally, the story. It begins a bit cliched, but interesting. It follows 4 people, a German born Frenchman who is deported back to Germany and forced into the army, his father in law who is drafted back into the French military, an American man who joined the French military after a personal trajedy (no spoilers), and a medic from Belguim trying to find her lost father. 5 if you count the wonderful medical German Shepard that joins the team. These stories weave together perfectly as they track down the elusive Baron and then deal with the aftermath and the horrors of war. As you progress the story gets darker and darker, almost mocking the lighthearted art style. The last couple scenes hit hard, and the ending will make even the strongest man cry provided he has a heart. The characters don't even speak and I felt more connected to them than most games I've played in the last year. What starts as a cliche weaves together to form one of the best stories I've seen in a game in a long time. Story: 10/10\n\nTo recap\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nStory: 10/10\n\nThis is a clear cut winner, buy it even with Uplay. It's well worth it.","June 20, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game delievers something that I have never felt in any game before, and after more than a decade of gaming, it is the only game that has ever made me cry. Though being a fairly short game it delivers a message more than any other war game out there. It adds a twist of problem solving and the animation tops of the uniqueness of it all. It is important that we remember history and learn from it, for if we don't we are doomed to repeat it.  Bottom line, EVERYONE should play this game and learn what it has to teach.\n\nPS.

You will not, however, be making your way through corridors gunning down soldiers like most war based games. Instead you will be treated, or rather subjected, to a horribly realistic (in terms of history) war torn 2d puzzler that centers on the lives and challenges of 4 main characters (5 if you count the dog), and a few supporting personas. Valiant Hearts, ironically, is a game with heart. In this review I'll take you through Hearts' design, gameplay, plot, and some final impressions.\n\nArt Style Hearts is a beautifully realized game. It has a vast and vibrant pallet that's colors always reflect the mood and emotion of the scene they are presented in. Every level is packed with detail, making it blatantly obvious that the game designers worked on each environment as a labor of love and passion. Best of all, it's very unique. From the shape of the characters to the imaginative portrayals of the games objects, everything screams time and effort. I'm not sure what else I can say about Hearts' aesthetics, other than they are truly outstanding.\n\nGameplay As someone who really dislikes puzzles of almost every kind, I can say that Ubisoft Montpellier did a wonderful job balancing common sense and intelligent design. It was very rare (out of this games hundreds of puzzles) that I had to look at the given timed hints, or a guide. Hearts' inventive puzzles always kept my brain working, but never stumped me long enough to break its immersion. Other than puzzles there are a few QTE sequences, each of which are done very well and not poorly in any sense of the word. That's essentially the extent of the gameplay, other than a few battle sequences which could also be described as puzzles in some fashion.  All in all Hearts does a great job in this department, but doesn't do much that could be described as ground-breaking.\n\nPlot Here is where the heart of Hearts lies, its story and characters. The premise of the game is that you alternate back and forth from each of the 4 main characters through their hardships during WWI. You'll experience their crushing defeats, touching victories, and everything in between. Hearts will make you feel the truest aspect there was to the wars of the 20th century, which is undoubtedly heartbreak. You will act as a hero, but the game will at the same time make you question whether or not that heroism means anything. Hearts will make you realize there is no winner in war, only the dead and those who must bury them. I've intentionally left out the details of the stories, and descriptions of the characters valiant hearts, because it would be a crime to take that experience away from you, the reader. If any of what I've just stated resonates with you, please, do not hesitate to purchase and play Hearts.\n\nFinal Thoughts This is the second game I have any memory of having made me cry. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 7-9 hour emotional roller coaster that I believe everybody should play, especially if they are interested in war history or those who had to experience it. If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed I have not listed one true con of Hearts, because I genuinely believe there isn't a single one. Please, play this game.\n\nPersonal Rating: 10/10","March 26","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/260230/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","Can a video game be fun, emotional, and educational all at once? The short answer is 'of course' but it's a tough combination to pull off. Enter Valiant Hearts, a narrative-first, 2D puzzle game set in the oft overlooked First World War.\n\nLets start with aspects that provide most of the "fun". The mechanics are a smooth blend of point and click style puzzles and physics or action based puzzling. There shouldn't be any puzzles that cause undue frustration and for the most part the solutions are fairly apparent for anyone who's been around the video game block once or twice. In other games the relatively low challenge level of the puzzles would probably be a detriment but, at least personally, in Valiant Hearts the puzzles were there to simply add contrast and tension to the story. There was even a small section in the final third of the game where the complexity of the puzzles started to draw too much attention away from the story, opening some chinks in the immersion.\nThe hand-painted artwork is very well done, especially some of the character designs, but is easy to overlook because the setting doesn't allow for much color and variety. The animation style is simple but an effective use of parallax backgrounds give the scenes plenty of motion and depth. A simple but hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is used effectively and actually provides some needed levity during the driving sections.\n\nUnsurprisingly the emotional punch is brought mostly by the story. I say "mostly" because it was actually some background NPCs that delivered one of the bigger blows personally. With that said, the story is no lightweight, as is to be expected from a game dealing with the travesty that is The Great War. You play four, really five, characters whose personal stories weave back and forth in an implausible but satisfying manner. In fact that's probably a good way to describe the entire plot. While it's clear that the story is a work of fiction and contains some obvious embellishments, it manages to remain grounded through its presentation and focus on the personal side of war. The decision to not focus on nations and figure heads is terrific and gives the frantic and unexpected ending the gravity it deserves.\n\nNow to complete the tri-fecta we have the educational aspects. Despite loving pretty much all of the rest of the game this was probably my favorite part. In the U.S. at least, WWI is almost criminally overlooked in most educational curriculums, probably due to our late entry to the war and no fighting happening on our soil, so the chance to learn more in a game setting was exciting. Valiant Hearts accomplishes this in a couple of ways. First off they use real places, real battles, and an accurate depiction of the players involved (it likely would never have occurred to me that the Canadians were heavily involved let alone how instrumental they were at times). For me though the more intriguing tidbits came from the short historical background info, complete with real photos, provided in each level and the collectible system. Scattered through each level are a number of items relevant to the level and war in general. When you find an item you can open a page that provides a little insight to the nature of the item and life during WWI in general. The combination of dramatized but immersive story and real life accounts allows for greater impact than either could provide alone and there in lies the beauty of using games for education. I really hope that the developers can find a way to give some other overlooked conflicts the Valiant Hearts treatment.\n\nAs promised, that's fun, emotion, and education in one game shaped package. Usually when making recommendations there are caveats like, "probably best for fans of genre X" or "Feel free to pass this up if you don't enjoy Y" but Valiant Hearts has no such caveats. I really feel that there is something here for everyone. Even if you know all the WWI facts already or don't typically enjoy puzzle games (there is a hint system for you folks by the way), simply being reminded that wars are fought by humans, on both sides, is something we all could benefit from.","June 8, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is exactly what I expected it to be and even more. Its an adventure story, told in a heart warming way. The reality of war is harsh and cruel! everybody looses when countries can't get along and kill each other.\n\nI loved that these were WWI Stories!! SO tired of WWII, heard those stories hundreds of times. It was so refreshing to see so much love, dedication, and comittment put into the game.\n\nThe music is absolutely brilliant, a gorgouse piano piece with a violin floating behind it enchanted me in the title screen.\n\nThe extra parts that I was not expecting were the extreme detail to historical accuracy, real life photos of soldiers, the equipment (urine soaked rags as gas masks), and real letters home that are woven in the story.\n\nI absolutely recomend this game without any hesitation. I have played through the entire 1st chapter and it looks like ther are 3 more to go!","June 26, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedpop/recommended/260230/","speedpop","Dr. Pyser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedpop/","557 products in account","(N.B. 5 hours played)\n\nA beautiful adventure game with enchanting music and characters who may move you to tears. Despite the doom & gloom outlook surrounding the game's setting, Valiant Hearts stands head and shoulders above perceived conceptions to deliver a mesmerizing moment of brilliance complete with scenarios of joy, sadness, and complete empathy.\n\nIt is one thing to create an entertaining product about World War I and tell a story -- it is another to tell that story while dismissing the overall whitewashing of general World War I history taught in schools and to be able to provide facts and lessons through a valuable medium such as videogames. As a fan of our written history, I would not only like to thank Ubisoft Montpellier for sticking to what I was most concerned about i.e. telling a story about World War I without blemishing it... I feel it is also noteworthy enough to celebrate what the development team have crafted by going above and beyond what I had initially hoped. Mentions and depictions of foreign countries fighting the war effort (Canada, India, Tunisia - represent!), including heart-wrenching personal letters from both sides of the conflict illustrating that no matter our lineage or culture we are all human.\n\nOn the centenary "celebration" of one of the greatest infamous events in our history -- one in which we still feel the aftershocks today -- I feel overjoyed to experience something like this in an entertainment medium form that I've spent immersed and loved dearly for almost three decades of my life. And yet it is World War I. There are portrayals of trench warfare, there are portrayals of troops blindly running over no-man's land in the hope of a few more metres to build more trenches. But this one feels right. We witness the events of World War I through the eyes of four controllable characters (five if we demand to include the medical dog) and through all of these events we see many parts of the Great War. The launch of machine guns as a defensive mechanism, the introduction of gas warfare, the importance that nurses played upon the battlefield, the harrowing experience of artillery raining down upon people, and the debut of three weapons which were defining moments in both theatres of World War II - the tank, the aeroplane, and the flamethrower.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the puzzles themselves are not troubling due to common sense, and veterans of adventure games may find them trivial, yet the biggest stickler of all adventure games is whether the puzzles themselves make any sense to what is happening to the character in the universe. Thankfully Valiant Hearts avoids this quagmire. Controls are simple and neat both with M&KB interface alongside controller of choice. So far there have not been any issues regarding playability and it has that Ubisoft Montpellier polish to it. My only downfall is the fact that, despite the characters speaking their own form of mumbled speech within the game that is easy to understand (French characters saying "merci" while American character says "thanks") - it's a little disheartening to hear Emile, a major French character, speak in an English accent during story sequences at the beginning of a chapter. Perhaps a harmless contra, but one that grinds my teeth in little ways. This game also modestly steals the "greatest title screen music" from Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XIII respectively at the same time.\n\nDon't let the 2D animated quality of the graphics fool you. This game is full of grim, yet majestic, atmosphere. The mere fact that Ubisoft Montpellier managed to capture the real-life concept that death is everywhere and these people struggled through an immense scale of adversity in order to live through over 4 years of hell should be enough to reconsider and think about what the "lost generation" went through.\n\nHighly recommended.","June 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The atmosphere is probably the reason why. The way the visuals mix with the music just puts a smile on my face. The story is a simple, if not cliche, but I am definitely ok with it. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. I have never been one for puzzle games, but so far nothing has been so difficult that I could not get past it. Some might say that it is a little too easy but I am not playing this game for difficulty. While playing the game you will get notifications during certain points where the game will pretty much give you history lessons on the first world war. Some will probably complain because its a lot of reading that kind of takes you out of the game experience. You could skip reading these but I think that in the long run you would be missing out on the full story.\n\nSome people are complaining about Uplay and I can almost understand why. I would say do not let this impact your decision to buy this game. You'd be missing out. Uplay is only 50mb or so and it pretty light feeling as far as game launchers go. Also steam overlay still works with the game and it still tracks your time in the game.\n\nI'm only a couple of hours in but can already tell that this game is a gem. It won't be for everyone but I definitely would recommend it to my friends:)","June 27, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Homage really.\n\nYou play as multiple characters that are narratively connected but some of the time not directly involved in the war. The cartoonish style seems off putting for such a serious subject. However in practice the emotional attachment is that much more surprising and effective due to its first glance appearances.\n\nThis is adventure/puzzle game first and foremost. You won't really be doing any shooting or combo breakers. Something I found rather immersive was the grabbing and then pushing, pulling or rotating things around. Levers, switches, boxes and carts etc. It felt like you were more responsible and had to take more deliberate action to complete the task. With that being said I had a real problem with the healing mini game that is mostly used in the Anna sections. Its a simple rhythm game with a bandage that will get progressively more or less bloody based on your performance. Its not a bad mini-game but compared to the to the other puzzles and deliberate action taking place. It just seemed like a placeholder. And as a result not nearly as satisfying to solve.\n\nAdditionally, the game is well paced. From the somewhat leisurely if not extremely depressing POW camp sections, to saving people from mustard gas under fire to leading the charge into an impenetrable mounted gun on a hill.\n\nThis was a pretty huge departure from the kind of games Ubisoft typically makes. And I believe it payed off.\n\nTurns out, as if you needed a reminder. War is not so great.","March 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Although I do agree "that which does not kill us makes us stronger," I fear I may have lost just a tiny bit of the remnants of my soul in this process.\n\nI downloaded the game and clicked "play" like all of my other games through steam, but I was unable to log in to the Uplay service.  It told me to try again later, so I did, dutifully obeying my digital master....for 45 minutes until my account was banned for too many retries.\n\nUndeterred, I followed the next instructions, and I called Ubisoft support.  The nice gentlemen there informed me that Uplay installed via Steam does not work, so we went through the process of uninstalling Uplay and installing it from their website.  He helpfully entered my date of birth since he said that sometimes missing information can cause the service to not work properly (?).  I hope to receive a small token of appreciation on my birthday now that they know.  I regret not asking the kind voice on the other end of the phone his birthday so I could reciprocate.\n\nExcited at the prospect of finally playing...whatever the name of this game is, I forget after the baffling selection of hold muzak, I attempted to log in again....aaaaand I was still banned.  "Fear not!" I told myself, "I am already on the phone with Ubisoft support, and this will be rectified quickly!"  "Alas," the voice on the phone said, "we are unable to override the ban.  Please try again in an hour."\n\nAs I sat at my desk, emotionally drained after 90 minutes of "Uplay Failed Login Simulator," I felt I should...nay, I MUST tell this moving story to the rest of the world.  You owe it to yourself to feel the heartache of loss, the visceral pain, and the longing for a simpler time long past that this experience can give you.  I can only hope that you grow in this experience as much as I have, and you can pass the lessons of this great time of suffering on to your children and grandchildren.\n\nGood luck, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\nExperience: 10/10 - It changed my life\nSound: 2/10 - The "phone" portion of the game was only mono...please fix\nGraphics: 9/10 - I swear I could feel the handset in my hand\nAge Rating - PG13...there was no blood, and only a little nudity, but I wouldn't reccomend this level of emotional turmoil to the unprepared and/or uninitiated\n","March 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 146 of 285 people (51%) found this review helpful 137 people found this review funny","51","146","285","137","10"

The thing that separates it from other games like this is that this game is set during the first World War. It follows the adventures of four people and one dog as they fight through the war. It is rich with history, and provides a lot of information about the Great War and the different people that were involved in it. If you love history and puzzle games, this is for you.\n\nThis game is fantastic, but I suffered through a lot of glitches. Changing the keybinds made controlling the digging mechanic mess up, and the only way to fix it was to rebind back to the original controls. Another instance was getting caught in an infinite loop that prevented me from beating a boss. The only fix for this was to change my resolution to something incredibly low (800x600) just to get the boss sequence to work correctly. This game is filled with bugs but the steam community page has threads upon threads of bugs and solutions. The addition of having to use Ubisoft's UPlay system made my game launch a lot slower and it forces you to sign up with UPlay to actually play the game.\n\nThe story is very fascinating, gameplay is pretty solid (took me about 8 hours), music and art are very charming and fitting. I would definitely recommend this game despite its glitches as it is one of the most moving games I've ever played, as it is based on true events of a terrible time in our world's history.","February 10, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Valiant Hearts mixes gameplay, narration, music and visuals with success. It's a little indie masterpiece.\n\n(See the rating at the end of the review)\n\n____________________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is quite simple but not dull. Each character has its own abilities and you switch from one another quite often. The parts with Walt, the dog, offers some co-operation and Anna healing skill is made through mini-games. You  drive cars and tanks at some point. There's also a part of riddles, sometimes not so easy to figure out and some infiltration. The diversity of the gameplay makes its strength.\n\nVISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: The visuals are excellent, all made in 2D they recreate perfectly the atmosphere of the early 20th century. Ypres, Le Chemin des Dames, Paris. Each location has its own "flavour". The music is very powerful, quite reminiscent of the soundtrack of Amelie Poulain sometimes. Very French anyway.\n\nSTORY: If you've ever wondered what was the life of a common soldier in the Great War, I think you will get the first answers here. The story is about four destinies entwined together. Four different people in the horrors of the war and how they get through it, or not... They are German, French, American, Belgian, they fight for different reasons: vengeance, duty, honnor? Most of them are fighting for the one they love. There are many twists in the story and even if the game explores adult themes like death, blind justice, loss and despair, it is in a way surprisingly optimistic: there's humanity even in the most horrific times.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nGameplay        4/6                Visuals, music and atmosphere        6/6                Story        6/6                Length        1/2                -        -                Global Rating        17/20\n\nSome made it, some did not but they all deserve to be remembered.

He is a German citizen located in France during the eruption of WW1, and is in the beginning of the game deported to Germany and conscripted into the German army.\nProfession: unknown\n\nEmile is the step father of Karl, and is unlike Karl, nationally French. He was born on March 12th, 1872.\nEmile faces the same fate as Karl does, but is instead conscripted into France's Military Service.\nProfession: Emile's unique ability is, since his family has a history in the mining business, to dig gravel and make great tunnels that he can advance through and find secret items with.\n\nAnna is a Belgian soon-to-be veterinary, born in Ypres on December 26, 1891, but after a head-on experience with the devastating effects of war, she decides that the human anatomy would be a more fitting profession for her. She becomes a paramedic and later advances to the front to help the ones who are really in need.\nProfession: paramedicine. Anna's special ability is to heal wounded soldiers, which when performed, puts the player in a quick-time event where you have to push the right arrow keys at the right time.\n\nFreddie was born in La Place, Louisiana, on Feberuary 27, 1882.\nHe enlists as an engineer for the French in the beginning of the war in order to get revenge on the Germans who killed his wife, Margaret.\nProfession: muscle man and 'Barbed Wire Snipper'. Yes, Freddie is the only character to invariably walk around with pliers in his... pockets? Well, this gives him the ability to snip entanglements of barbed wire, set up by the opposing army to slow down your progression.\n\nWalt (indirectly playable) is a German shepherd dog trained by the German military to do various task given to him.\nAlthough Walt would probably not be considered a 'playable character' by most people, when he is in your prescence in-game, he will help you solve puzzles, fetch items and distract guards whenever you want him to.\nJust throw an exhortation in his direction and he will comply without hesitation. Such a good dog.\nProfession: distraction, permeation and fetching. When there is a small space that you can't squeeze through, but there's an important item on the other side of it, Walt is the perfect companion for you.\nOn a normal occation, Walt can distract a guard with his charm, making the guard turn his back towards you.\nWhen you have passed the guard, you notice a hole in the wall, and on the other side, there's a stick of dynamite.\nTell Walt to squeeze through and fetch it for you, which he does, so you then can light it on fire and throw it at the guard, resulting in a blow that both takes out the guard, and blows away the door he was guarding.\nAnd the best thing of them all, he would never desert you. :)\n\nThroughout the course of the game, you frequently shift between these four protagonists in order to solve various puzzles, creatively kill German (and sometimes even French) soldiers, dash through early 20th century warfarian terrain with a "panzerwagen" invented by a kiddnaped scientist (Anna's father) held prisoner by German officer Baron von Dorf etc.\n\nThe game features an aesthetically beautiful artwork, collectible items that shows trivia about the item and how it was used during the actual war, facts about different cities' involvation in and management of WW1, personal diaries written by the affected characters in order to get to know them better.\nAnd last but absolutely not least, an immensely touching plot that, even if the coding and programming would be ♥♥♥♥, would most likely carry the game anyway.\n\nWith all that said. Would I recommend the game? Hell yes, I would.\nDon't ask any questions, just buy it already!","December 28, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I was so moved by this game, I felt I should.  Valiant Hearts is a brilliant story about 4 different people in world war I.  All the characters are likeable, and have their own goals and reasons for fighting.  The story is top notch, probably one of the best stories I've even experienced.  The game does well of capturing the feeling of World War I, but without you killing anyone.  The gameplay mostly revolves around puzzles you have to solve, which are challenging, but not incredibly hard to solve.  You feel as if you are genuinely a person, instead of a machine that shoots bullets everywhere.  The ending was so emotional it brought me to tears.

The puzzles, as you progress, will get tedious, but with the help of a loveable canine at your side, the puzzles become more interesting when you have to use him to get them done.\n\nUltimately this game, for the most part is good for the experience. By the end of it, you'll have tears in your eyes, whether they be of joy or sadness is yours to determine.\n\nIf there is one last thing I can send you off with, it's this:\nWe must not forget about the ones who came before us, ignore the ones standing next to us, or hold-back the ones who are willing to come later.\nThank you Ubisoft Montpellier for making such a great expecience.","June 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game, you play as Emile, Karl, Anna and Freddie and discover how their lives have been affected by the war.\n\nEach character has their own interesting story and discovering how the war affects their lives and their friendships as you go along can be quite heartwrenching. Throughout the game, a friendly dog named Walt accompanies these characters on their travels, helping them solve different puzzles in their path and together bear witness to the brutality of The Great War. Seeing the destruction of Europe in this way truly made me feel sad for each character as they struggle desperately to survive. And every twist and turn in the game really keeps you on the edge, making you wonder what other dangers lurk beyond the trenches as you explore the area, and for how long each character's luck will last.\n\nThe lovely cartoonish art style of the characters and the environment around them is quite refreshing and the soundtrack is simply beautiful, as expected from a game powered by UbiArt Framework, one of Ubisoft's in-house game engines.\n\nApart from the creative gameplay, collectibles and fact files are included in each section of the game, where you can read different information about everything from what their soldiers identification tags looked like to the devastating attack strategies that were used during the war.\n\nI am not disappointed with anything about the game itself, but rather the fact that for such a short game of only 4 chapters long, it is a little bit expensive and that in order to even play the game, you would need to create a Uplay account and access it from there. However, these are only minor issues I have with the game.\n\nValiant Hearts is quite an amazing game for gamers who want to sit back and become emersed within a gripping story, accompanied by intense battles and unfortunate losses. It is by far one of my favourite games of this year and it is certainly worth playing.","August 1, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I was so moved by this game, I felt I should.  Valiant Hearts is a brilliant story about 4 different people in world war I.  All the characters are likeable, and have their own goals and reasons for fighting.  The story is top notch, probably one of the best stories I've even experienced.  The game does well of capturing the feeling of World War I, but without you killing anyone.  The gameplay mostly revolves around puzzles you have to solve, which are challenging, but not incredibly hard to solve.  You feel as if you are genuinely a person, instead of a machine that shoots bullets everywhere.  The ending was so emotional it brought me to tears.  Perhaps that's just me, but this game is one of profound emotion.","December 8, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are quite simple and easy, mostly consisting of performing tasks and trading items to progress through the story, though other characters provide different gameplay mechanics into the board (shooting down planes with a tank, anyone?) If you do get stuck over a puzzle, the game does provides helpful hints unlocked over time.\n\nI'm not going to divulge any details on the plot, though I will say - I think this is the first time a game actually made me cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.","June 26, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great sound design, solid gameplay and even okay graphics.\n\nNow for some cons:\nThe graphics... Some options would have been nice. I know that it is designed to lock you in and immerse you, but the lack of really ANY settings partaining to visual fidelity is a bit obnoxious. It looked good at 1080p, but sometimes it left me feeling like I was running out of screen.\n\nQUICK TIME EVENTS! Holy crap people can we drop the damn QTEs already!? The nurse character is nothing but QTEs and although they aren't that challanging, it completely destroys immersion. The game is a button-masher for sure, as there is no mouse control (aside from in menus), but man when a QTE kicks in I just want to kick a puppy.\n\nAnd the pros:\nLOVELY! This game has an amazing aesthetic that is extremely immersive. Although quite a few points in the game do shatter any and all immersion, it won't be long before it pulls you back in. Just suspend your disbelief for a second and it'll get you.\n\nFantastic gameplay. If you're into story driven puzzle platformers you'll enjoy this. The game also features collectables that have actual historic descriptions written in, so you can technically learn a couple things while you're at it.\n\nNow the real question, "Was it fun?"\nAbsolutely it was! My gripes are really just nitpicks. This game is a lot of fun all the way to the end. There was never a moment I felt like putting it down, so I didn't. I think if you need to spend 8 hours you definitely can't go wrong with this game.","June 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You move left or right, climb up or down, whack enemies from behind, throw stuff,  dig, interact with levers and other objects.  I found the puzzles in the game not too difficult, but still rewarding when you solve them.  There are also mini-games where you would usually have to dodge bombs and bullets. Perfect for those who would primarily like to experience the story [and maybe not so good for those who are into super fast-paced action games].  A nice element is how you work with the dog to solve some of the puzzles.\n\nI was quite surprised with how they made the game evoke so much emotions given the art style used and the fact that there weren’t any spoken dialogue.  It’s mostly narration and reading of letters.  When characters talk to each other a bubble would usually pop up with the images of what they are trying to say, or you hear some indistinct babbling.  But it works.  And the music.  Just beautiful.  The melancholic intro music alone gave me so many feels.\n\nI love how we don’t play as any famous war person here.  We are common folk and we see how the war affects their lives.  I am going to see how the game explores this more.  I am excited to find out what happens next, but at the same time I am quite terrified.  I sense tragedy in the future.  I have become quite attached to the characters (including the dog of course!).","July 13, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned, it is an emotional game with a VERY well written story and supurb voice acting. I connected with the characters and even though the puzzles were not meant to be hard they did make you think. I knew from the first few minutes of playtime I would not be able to put it down. I finished it within 24 hours of purchase.\n\nIt displays and hurls you into WWI unlike any other game out there. You play one of 4 characters whoes lives are intertwined by the Great War. This is a gritty, bloody look into the life and times that were the early 20's in Europe during WWI. Don't be fooled by the charming artwork. This reminded me of MAUS all the way until the sad ending and credits rolling.\n\nThis is a deep stroy and begs your attention which Valiant Hearts will get if given half a chance. Don't go into this expecting a shooter or even a puzzle game. This is a story and a very good one at that.

I honestly learned so much of WWI with this game.\n\nIt starts with the war seeming so righteous. Brave men go to war, strong warriors! But as the game goes on, the true face of war reveals itself. Bombing of clorine gas kill thousands and refined weaponry turn Warriors into nearvous wreaks of men that must trudge through mud and their fallen allies to most likely get shot. This artistic decision is so great because WWI was the war to make define wars as not something good and honorable, but something horrible and bad.\n\nBut what sells it is the story. Damn, that story is one of the, if not THE, most moving I've ever witnessed. I cannot spoil that, you'll have to play it for yourself.\n\nI encourage you to buy and play this game.

I really like how it displayed all of the different branches of the war effort. Like the Indian Army and the Canadians during Vimy Ridge. And it didn't colour the Germans as totally evil. The grunts were just guys who had to go to war just like everyone else. There's a section in the game that perfectly illustrates the idea that past the countries and nationalism, these are just people.\n\nThe characters were great, While the characters actually talk to each other, they're all very emotive and can express what they're feeling to each other. There are letters in the game that give us a behind the scenes of what each character is thinking about during certain parts of the war. There's Emile the tired grandfather and father, Karl the desperate husband and father, Freddie a man about revenge, Anna the caring daughter and Walt the faithful and loyal dog. Such great characters that are all tied together through love and longing of family. Love and friendship are such a huge part of this game.\n\nThe story was very depressing but also appropriate given the material. World War 1 was a very bloody war. There are instances of levity during the game where the game has car chases that have classic music playing in the background. Overal I thought Ubisoft Montpellier showed a lot of care and love with the game and the history involved as there's extensive material that you can read up within the game whenever picking up collectables.\n\nThe comic book visuals aping Franco-Belgian art gave me serious Tin Tin and Asterix & Obelix vibes. It's a beautiful game and Ubiart continues to impress.\n\nIf there's one thing I didn't like it's the rhythm game sections in which you're healing injured but they were thankfully only used with Anna.\n\nAnyway I highly recommend everyone play this game. There's nothing really quite like it.","March 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game, you play as Emile, Karl, Anna and Freddie and discover how their lives have been affected by the war.\n\nEach character has their own interesting story and discovering how the war affects their lives and their friendships as you go along can be quite heartwrenching. Throughout the game, a friendly dog named Walt accompanies these characters on their travels, helping them solve different puzzles in their path and together bear witness to the brutality of The Great War. Seeing the destruction of Europe in this way truly made me feel sad for each character as they struggle desperately to survive. And every twist and turn in the game really keeps you on the edge, making you wonder what other dangers lurk beyond the trenches as you explore the area, and for how long each character's luck will last.\n\nThe lovely cartoonish art style of the characters and the environment around them is quite refreshing and the soundtrack is simply beautiful, as expected from a game powered by UbiArt Framework, one of Ubisoft's in-house game engines.\n\nApart from the creative gameplay, collectibles and fact files are included in each section of the game, where you can read different information about everything from what their soldiers identification tags looked like to the devastating attack strategies that were used during the war.\n\nI am not disappointed with anything about the game itself, but rather the fact that for such a short game of only 4 chapters long, it is a little bit expensive and that in order to even play the game, you would need to create a Uplay account and access it from there. However, these are only minor issues I have with the game.\n\nValiant Hearts is quite an amazing game for gamers who want to sit back and become emersed within a gripping story, accompanied by intense battles and unfortunate losses. It is by far one of my favourite games of this year and it is certainly worth playing.","August 1, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most mechanics are introduced by the second chapter (out of four), making the latter half alittle repetitive. However, the real meat of this game lies in the world it paints, a vision into the lives affected by the outbreak of war in 1914. It's an underexplored field few games tread, and Valiant Hearts does a superb job detailing our modern history to people unfamiliar with 'The Great War'.\n\nBoth uplifting and sorrowful, the story (while fairly simple) is an emotional rollercoaster tapping into the morally grey nature of the raging conflict between the Allied Powers and the Second Reich along the western front. Even so, I felt some of the side characters, like Anna the Nurse or Baron Von Antagonist, would have benefited from alittle more expositional depth.\n\nOverall, Valiant Hearts is a faithful and colorful look into the past packaged into a decent game, a special experience for those interested in the most dramatic turning point in Western culture since 1648, and an honest bargin even at full retail $15. This is one game I'm actually hoping has DLC!\n\n*Word of Caution to Parents: While the artstyle may suggest this is kid-friendly, Valiant Hearts' story pulls few punches and does not disguise it's subject matter. I would suggest not letting your children play this until you are comfortable with them watching 'Saving Private Ryan'.

Valiant Hearts mixes gameplay, narration, music and visuals with success. It's a little indie masterpiece.\n\n(See the rating at the end of the review)\n\n____________________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is quite simple but not dull. Each character has its own abilities and you switch from one another quite often. The parts with Walt, the dog, offers some co-operation and Anna healing skill is made through mini-games. You  drive cars and tanks at some point. There's also a part of riddles, sometimes not so easy to figure out and some infiltration. The diversity of the gameplay makes its strength.\n\nVISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: The visuals are excellent, all made in 2D they recreate perfectly the atmosphere of the early 20th century. Ypres, Le Chemin des Dames, Paris. Each location has its own "flavour". The music is very powerful, quite reminiscent of the soundtrack of Amelie Poulain sometimes. Very French anyway.\n\nSTORY: If you've ever wondered what was the life of a common soldier in the Great War, I think you will get the first answers here. The story is about four destinies entwined together. Four different people in the horrors of the war and how they get through it, or not... They are German, French, American, Belgian, they fight for different reasons: vengeance, duty, honnor? Most of them are fighting for the one they love. There are many twists in the story and even if the game explores adult themes like death, blind justice, loss and despair, it is in a way surprisingly optimistic: there's humanity even in the most horrific times.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nGameplay        4/6                Visuals, music and atmosphere        6/6                Story        6/6                Length        1/2                -        -                Global Rating        17/20\n\nSome made it, some did not but they all deserve to be remembered. This game is one of the best tribute to the soldiers of the Great War. And it's definetely a good way to teach those who did not live it, because it must not happen again.

I really like how it displayed all of the different branches of the war effort. Like the Indian Army and the Canadians during Vimy Ridge. And it didn't colour the Germans as totally evil. The grunts were just guys who had to go to war just like everyone else. There's a section in the game that perfectly illustrates the idea that past the countries and nationalism, these are just people.\n\nThe characters were great, While the characters actually talk to each other, they're all very emotive and can express what they're feeling to each other. There are letters in the game that give us a behind the scenes of what each character is thinking about during certain parts of the war. There's Emile the tired grandfather and father, Karl the desperate husband and father, Freddie a man about revenge, Anna the caring daughter and Walt the faithful and loyal dog. Such great characters that are all tied together through love and longing of family. Love and friendship are such a huge part of this game.\n\nThe story was very depressing but also appropriate given the material. World War 1 was a very bloody war. There are instances of levity during the game where the game has car chases that have classic music playing in the background. Overal I thought Ubisoft Montpellier showed a lot of care and love with the game and the history involved as there's extensive material that you can read up within the game whenever picking up collectables.\n\nThe comic book visuals aping Franco-Belgian art gave me serious Tin Tin and Asterix & Obelix vibes. It's a beautiful game and Ubiart continues to impress.\n\nIf there's one thing I didn't like it's the rhythm game sections in which you're healing injured but they were thankfully only used with Anna.\n\nAnyway I highly recommend everyone play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermatt/recommended/260230/","explorermatt","Typhoone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermatt/","248 products in account","Valiant Hearts is more an interactive story than a game. Wrapped in a World War I puzzle-platformer, this story is not a challenge to play through. Puzzles have no complexity and the player is only dealing with one at a time. Challenges primarily involve pickup and deliver quests between elements on the level, block pushing, block pulling, and shape-matching. There are a few platformer-style action sequences reminiscent of Frogger-style gameplay. These same sequences are timed to epic orchestral music, which at least makes them enjoyable if not a frustrating chore put in to progress the game's story.\n\nThere is a meta-game of finding historical items. Every level possesses a half-dozen collectibles that can be found and picked up. They serve no gameplay purpose and are completely optional, but come with facts relating them to the historical setting of the level they are found in. Paired with multi-paragraph articles introducing the historical significance of the different settings of the game's levels, this adds an element to Valiant Hearts that transcends the colorful animated cartoon warfront and grounds it in historical context.\n\nDon't play it for the puzzles, play it for the story and for the beautiful art style. The level backdrops and bullish character art evoke the war setting magnificently and even bring it some enjoyable color which realistically did not exist. Unfortunately, animations are not particularly well-executed and there is one severely lacking artistic element: blood. In a game set in a theme of death and destruction, purposefully not including blood in the game (likely to maintain ratings standards) harms the ability to tell a story as powerful and evocative as Valiant Hearts.\n\nFinally, a sweeping storyline with a twist of historical education around the setting of WWI cannot ignore the subject of death. The characters traverse several death-defying accounts throughout the game's four chapters as the player believes the protagonists are immune to war's ultimate price for the sake of story progression. At times, this is a bit ridiculous, with dozens of animated characters being mowed down by machine gun fire while the player continually respawns to pass the movement-timed trench-death puzzles. Ultimately, the game addresses the topic of death as a part of the finale and it is potentially one of the more controversial moments that will keep this art-piece game out of classrooms. It's hard to tell if it is a well-placed plot-twist element or a final historical morality message written into the narrative, but it works very well.\n\nIn summary, Valiant Hearts is a brilliantly packaged, historically sprinkled interactive fiction. The puzzles are overtly simple and linear, but this is a game you play for the experience rather than the challenge. Going forward, while I believe there are too many World War Two-themed games out there, a Valiant Hearts sequel: WWII would be a worthy cut above the rest. Let's hope it gets made. In the meantime, experience World War One through the moving story Valiant Hearts.","November 20, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

They really got the right balance there. Unfortunately this all comes with the cost of very simple gameplay, that feels more like something they implemented, so the whole thing can be released as a "game". No minus point for me, but if I had to complain about something it must be the characterization of the germans. I was very disappointed to see that there is no deeper thought behind them and all they serve for is the villains. Just because germans are bad and they need no reason to be so. For a game that is trying to be historically correct, to some extend at least, it's just very lazy. Or maybe it's a french-canadian thing, not letting germas be human as well. The only german we can sympathize with is the one who actually left that "evil country" to live in the "great nation" of france. And don't get me wrong, I couldn't care less about my own roots here... I'm a brazilian living in germany, grew up in austria and a big part of my family is jewish with roots in lebanon. So it's really just the portrayal that made me sad... to realize the game I hoped to be so much more, falls into the same bland trap of stereotypes like a Call of Duty or Wolfenstein. Heck, even Wolfenstein differs better... Sorry for the rant.\n\nStill, great game nonetheless and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes storytelling and historical settings. :)","July 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its music, its atmosphere, its  attention to detail makes it fantastic. It is a game that will bring you down to earth after having spent hours and hours yelling at your incapable teammates in other games. This game shows the realities of war.

I really like how it displayed all of the different branches of the war effort. Like the Indian Army and the Canadians during Vimy Ridge. And it didn't colour the Germans as totally evil. The grunts were just guys who had to go to war just like everyone else. There's a section in the game that perfectly illustrates the idea that past the countries and nationalism, these are just people.\n\nThe characters were great, While the characters actually talk to each other, they're all very emotive and can express what they're feeling to each other. There are letters in the game that give us a behind the scenes of what each character is thinking about during certain parts of the war. There's Emile the tired grandfather and father, Karl the desperate husband and father, Freddie a man about revenge, Anna the caring daughter and Walt the faithful and loyal dog. Such great characters that are all tied together through love and longing of family. Love and friendship are such a huge part of this game.\n\nThe story was very depressing but also appropriate given the material. World War 1 was a very bloody war. There are instances of levity during the game where the game has car chases that have classic music playing in the background. Overal I thought Ubisoft Montpellier showed a lot of care and love with the game and the history involved as there's extensive material that you can read up within the game whenever picking up collectables.\n\nThe comic book visuals aping Franco-Belgian art gave me serious Tin Tin and Asterix & Obelix vibes. It's a beautiful game and Ubiart continues to impress.\n\nIf there's one thing I didn't like it's the rhythm game sections in which you're healing injured but they were thankfully only used with Anna.\n\nAnyway I highly recommend everyone play this game. There's nothing really quite like it.","March 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the unique art style, in-game facts about WW1 and its music. You actually feel as if you are a part of this world. Beautiful yet horrific, we are thrown into the Great War as several group of characters. Each with their own ambition and goals, they set out on a journey against all odds.\n\nStyleEvery thing about this game is perfect (no......not you Uplay. You f*cking suck). The art style is cartoony with a bright color palette. This works well when you aren't put in the actual war itself because it captures the beauty of the early 1900's. During war sequences, the palette becomes more dulled and gritty. There isn't a lot of blood and gore but this game doesn't need it. It has already captured the horrors of war.\n\nSoundtrackEasily one of the best this game has to offer. As soon as you boot up the game, you are greeted by a sorrowful melody. It will tug at your heart strings because you know the feels will come. The game features some awesome classic tracks from its era.\n\nGameplayThere is no fighting, shooting, or sillyness of any kind. This game is a straight puzzler (with 2 or 3 car chase sections). Now you don't have to be a genius to figure out how to solve these puzzles. They are quite literally easy and smart. If you do get stuck, the game has a hint system. As a 2-D puzzler the game is deep and engaging. There are at least 100 collectibles to find and a ton of facts behind the Great War. This game will not only tear your heart to shreds, but you will become a lot more educated after the game is over. You'll be a crying genius.\n\nStoryWow.....The story is engaging and it hooks you immediately. The first five minutes everything is fine and dandy until suddenly sh*t hits the fan and quite a lot of it. You first play as Emile who is a French grandfather. He is pulled into the war by force and learns that his son-in-law Karl (who is German) has also been forced to fight in the war. Emile goes out to search for Karl and makes a lot of friends during his journey. Each character you meet has a backstory and a reason why they joined the war. You care a lot about these characters and each one has their quirks.\n\nVerdict10 out of 10. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. Valiant Hearts is a game that only shows the Great War (or any war for that matter) on the surface. It will teach you to appreciate what you have now and what it took to maintain it. You will see the horrors of war unlike any game I have ever seen. But be warned, should you dare buy and play this game, BRING A F*CK TON OF TISSUES!!!","March 23, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saved the best for last, Emile, A man who is drafted into the war and hopes to return to his family. This game's artstyle is what really "draws" me in. The game is a puzzle type of game that some people may not enjoy but I must express this "Play the game!" Although the game is full of puzzles, the game has a hint system to help you if you're stuck! The game is really well made. The story is quite dark and well strung together. The characters are ones that you will love! Play the game to enjoy a fun, yet gritty and dark story of sadness and death. For Example: On one of the missions, you play through a level in Verdun, A battle that lasted 300 days and had 600,000 casualties. Imagine that. Put it into a game. Amazing! I forgot to add this but throughout the game, on every mission you are presented with amazing facts about WW1.

The mechanics are nicely varied, ranging from simple puzzle-solving to guitar-hero style sequences, although the story takes precedence over actual gameplay. There are a few historical inaccuracies that don't fall into the remit of artistic license, mostly to do with continuing the same tired old tropes that the Great War has acquired, although that doesn't detract from the storyline which is stark and depressing.

Is awesome how the story, wich revolves around 4 main characters, catches you in the first place, you take the characters in your heart and adopt them for what they really are, people. People that will live in your memory once you start playing and will stay forever with you until the end an beyond that. A really must play if you want a good story, some challenging puzzles and to enjoy a really well made game. Is worth every buck you put on it.

But having played this game I feel that I owe it to the creators, as it was an absolute pleasure to experience. The game has a really easy puzzle system, but the way in which it was integrated in gameplay created a seamless immersion. Next there is the art style which I fell in love with from the moment I saw the first cinematic, and that doesn't come close to the soundtrack which perfectly guides your mood throughout the game. Finally there is the amazing story line, it is so incredibly heartfelt and the facts they give throughout the game makes it all feel so much more real and personal.\n\nThis game deserves 10/10.","November 7, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We mostly play as a powerful 'invincible' soldier in games. it could be either CoD or Battlefield or CS:GO it doesn't matter but this game shows the real face of the war, the game we choose not to see and it displays the real evil face of war through the ordinary people from both sides of the opponents. While playing the game, it reminded me a German television show named 'Unsere Mutter, Unsere Vater' meaning 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers'. We eager to play the war games as the powerful, unstoppable man but the reality is different. In wars, people die, families, children suffer. All the inheritance of mankind can be destroyed with just one bomb. Valiant Hearts is showing that ugly side that we do not want to see. It is a beautiful game, a emotionally strong game.

Story is beautifully written and the characters, though little dialogue except in letters written between them, are interesting and believable. The game is full of little puzzles with some minor platforming elements. I really enjoyed the puzzles since they are challenging but not to the point that they are frustrating. I really appreciate the fact that the puzzles are not trial and error oriented but actually just require some exploration and logic. I'm not sure how long it took me to finish this game but I played it over several nights so I'd guess about 5-6 hours of content which is pretty good since I bought the game for less than $5. The music is incredible and synched with several parts of the game especially when you are driving the Jeep and dodging enemy attacks!\n\nOverall, I'd rate the game a solid 5/5 stars.

I quite frankly don't know where to begin. I went into it knowing a fair amount of knowledge about the first world war. I knew it was bad, and that good men and women died for very little reason. But this game, it put it into a perspective for me. You follow a few different characters setting out for different reasons into the war to end all wars. Each has a moving and detailed background, each has a personality and a reason to fight. You connect with them in a lot of ways, and the funny thing is that you'll never see their eyes.\n\nI bought this game because I wanted a story. I was moved to tears from the trailer, and I knew I had to have it. I couldn't stop playing it, and so I beat it in a single sitting. I don't regret doing so, but I regret that it had to end. Between the visually stunning world, beautifully well used music and cues, tricky and interesting puzzles, and the sometimes comical action sequences, I simply could not stop.\n\nThat, and though I haven't researched it, I am quite sure this game is historically accurate to a T. Finding artifacts with detailed descriptions throughout the levels or just following the general story line, you learn just what it meant to fight The Great War.","December 7, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the story can get a little predictable at times, it carries weight and emotion with each turn even when you did see it coming. The gameplay is basicly a platformer, solving puzzles and moving from point A to point B in the environment of the French and German lines throughout the Great War. It can get slightly repetative at times, and other times I felt a bit unsure which direction the game wanted me to go. If you're looking for something new and innovative on the gameplay table, this probably won't scratch that itch. The story is the real motivation to keep playing, which it did a very good job at. The game is also riddled with facts and trivia about the first world war, and everything is based at least loosely on real locations and offensives during the war.

The thing that separates it from other games like this is that this game is set during the first World War. It follows the adventures of four people and one dog as they fight through the war. It is rich with history, and provides a lot of information about the Great War and the different people that were involved in it. If you love history and puzzle games, this is for you.\n\nThis game is fantastic, but I suffered through a lot of glitches. Changing the keybinds made controlling the digging mechanic mess up, and the only way to fix it was to rebind back to the original controls. Another instance was getting caught in an infinite loop that prevented me from beating a boss. The only fix for this was to change my resolution to something incredibly low (800x600) just to get the boss sequence to work correctly. This game is filled with bugs but the steam community page has threads upon threads of bugs and solutions. The addition of having to use Ubisoft's UPlay system made my game launch a lot slower and it forces you to sign up with UPlay to actually play the game.\n\nThe story is very fascinating, gameplay is pretty solid (took me about 8 hours), music and art are very charming and fitting. I would definitely recommend this game despite its glitches as it is one of the most moving games I've ever played, as it is based on true events of a terrible time in our world's history.","February 10, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music perfectly captured the somber tone of most of the game, while swelling to cersendos at the most daring moments, while the art was just just cute enough to portray the gruesome nature of the war, while still being beautifully charming. Done by the fine people at UbiArt, same folks who did Rayman Origins and Legends, so expect high quality. Easily one of the strongest suits of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is puzzle based... and bit nonsequitor with the game, to be honest. The Great War is happening around you, and yet you are turning wheels and throwing bottles. I understand the bind of telling a story ABOUT people DURING the war, and trying to stray away form combat, but is a bit odd. There are a a bit of diversity with some other forms of gameplay and they were a nice change of pace, often highlighting a tense moment. Besides that the puzzles are simple and yet clever. You will more often have trouble executing than figuring out the puzzle\n\nStory and chracters are top notch. Despite mostly speaking in Gibberish or short clips of their natuve language, the characters all comminuacate a depth of emotion and feeling. I think that is really sttributed to the art team, once again. The story is truly one of valiant people, and you will be attatched to them and thier struggles and hopes.\n\nFinally, there is actually quite a bit of learning here! I've taken AP European History, and there is still a great deal here I didn't learn in my studies. The collection of War Heirlooms fit nicely into the educational bits, and some of the sweeping historical facts give very nice contecxt to a level or area. I really think this information enhances the gameplay and helps you really geta  feel for what our Valiant Hearts are battling through. The collection aspect of it may add on an extra 1.5 hours, so a brief stroll for 100%. I highly reccomend looking for them and reading up, as it is another strong suit of the game. This is edutainment done right.\n\nThing of note: Double DRM with Steam and Uplay. It is a pain to ahve to go thropugh and can be iffy. experienced issues with being unable to open the game, due to their being an instance of then game alredy running, despite Task Manager revelaing this as untrue.\n\nOverall it's a nice, small heartfelt game. Any history junky should play and enjoy this. Strong aesthetic aspects from a strong animation department with beautiful music and characters are the backbone for a simplisctic puzzler.","June 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me around 6-7 hours to finish the story itself and every second was worth listening and paying attention to the story. The idea of it taking place in WW1 was a brilliant idea as I feel no other time period could have nailed the ride feeling. Of course anyone who has played and beat this game would tell you that the ending was devastatingly saddening as it was also a great way to conclude the adventure. I give the story a 10/10 as it will always remain as a favorite game.\n\nGameplay:\nJust to get this out of the way, my opinion may be a little one sided due to the fact that I have a huge heart for puzzle games. The idea of the story being played out through puzzles that were also intense at times really made me feel likeI needed to keep going and wanted to play more. I mean even the idea of getting hints from the messenger pigeon made me giggle a little and I loved that idea. However I feel as if I had to ask my self many times "What is going on". Like however a minecart managed to land on the tip of a tree branch made me kinda question the game. The idea of actualy war facts and info being included in the game made me really interested as I read all if not most of the info on the collectables that you may find during the game. I give the gameplay a 8.5/10 due to the fact that a lot of the time, whatever was happening should not have happened and did not make sense.\n\nI recommend this game more for people who have patience and a high tolerance for solving puzzles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilgaze/recommended/260230/","evilgaze","Evilgaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilgaze/","4128 products in account","SUMMARY: For those who don't want to read more, Valiant Hearts is simply an awesome as well as moving game and I highly recommend it; you won't regret picking it up.\n\nAs someone who has been fortunate enough to live in a peaceful country, war is something that, thankfully, I've never personally experienced.  As a result, it's hard for me to truly understand the terror and horror of what being in a war actually is.  I've seen the awful photos and videos but that's not like actually being there, fighting for your life or just trying to survive.  That's why I appreciate games like Valiant Hearts that puts a real and human perspective on war and shows just how terrible both sides can be sometimes.\n\nValiant Hearts is an adventure / puzzle game set in Western Europe during World War I.  You play as one of four regular people (or their dog companion) who didn't want war and are simply doing their best to survive it.  The gameplay involves solving 2D puzzles (e.g. collecting required parts, flipping switches, etc.) as well as timing your movement to avoid enemy obstacles and hazards; it's not too difficult in general, even though there can be some challenging parts.\n\nThere's also an educational component to it; the developers of the game partnered up with a group of WWI historians to ensure that the game is as historical accurate as possible.  As a result, there is information on each the big battles and events that occured during the war; in addition, every level has historical objects that the player can collect, each of which has their own descriptions.  While not required, reading this material adds more immersion and ultimately understand of what life what like during that time.\n\nThe graphics are great and the art style is truly unique; all of the graphics are hand-drawn and are unlike any other game I've seen.  There is an incredible attention to detail; obviously, a lot of care and effort went into making the world feel alive.  The backgrounds are frequently dynamic, highlighting that you're just in some small part of the war and that there's action going on elsewhere.\n\nThe music and sound effects in the game are amazing and add further immersion to the game.  They actually use songs and anthems that are appropriate to that time period and place; it made me feel like I had been transported back to time.  It really is a beautiful soundtrack and one that I actually purchased because of how nice it was/\n\nWhile the rest of the game is great, the real appeal of Valiant Hearts is its atmosphere and story; it shows regular people, not super soldiers, who have to deal with the brutality of war.  It makes you invested in these characters and you end up finding that you really do care about them and want them to live through it.  It shows the human side of war and how not everything is black and white.  I'm not going to spoil anything here but I actually did tear up a bit at the end; I'm sure I'm not the only one who did.\n\nSo to make a long story short, Valiant Hearts is an amazing game that I highly recommend that you experience for yourself.","December 28, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Granted its one of the only WWI game I played, but as someone who have played many war base game ranging from FPS to RTS, this easily blow  all of them out of water in terms of story.\n\nStory:\nValiant Hearts follow around Emile, Karl, Freddie, and Anna through the war. You watch as all their stories line up together and they must help one another to survive. The fact that they tell this story with virtually no dialog is amazing. The characters simply grunt and show speech bubbles with a picture in them to get their point across. Even with the this cartoonish way of communication and in the art style, the game nail the style and atmosphere of this time period. Honestly I wish I could speak more about each character story but I don't want to spoil any part of it. Also it was nice to see that they added a historical fact tab so that you could get some real facts on WWI. Always nice when a game include little bits of facts over whatever time period they're covering.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay involve moving one of the control characters throughout a 2D map to find items or tools to help you to complete task or solve a puzzle. The player actions is generally limited to throwing and pulling levers, but there are some characters with special abilities or tools. These special abilities generally have a slightly different play style to give you some uniqueness between each character. Such as Emile being able to dig through certain areas or Anna doing button prompting mini game. Nothing ground breaking, but the puzzles are enough to keep you entertained and can even stump you sometime.\n\nFinal Comments:\nI know WWI is a hard era to make a game for since so much of it was static trench warfare. Most people don't want to play a game where you spend half the game in a trench and the other half running through a kill-zone while you get riddled with machine gun fire and artillery barrage.  But Valiant Hearts use this to it advantage by focus on the individuals force to deal with these horrors. You become attached to these characters, and don't want to see bad things happen to them. This attachment motivate you to keep playing to see how this war will end for them. Also I like how they just don't straight up demonize one side as the "bad guy" but rather show that at the end of the day, it was just a bunch of people fighting to stay alive and get back home.\n\nI would easily trade in many of the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and other war games campaign stories for this one. I found great pleasure in the game and even greater in the story it told.","November 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game really stands out to me because of how much heart it really has and by the end how invested you feel in the characters struggles. It differs from traditional war games by not making the war about fighting a soulless enemy. The game is about helping the people who are being hurt by the war, allied, enemy or civilian. One part the stuck out to me was when you come across a stuck enemy solider in a mine, you help him out and you both work together to escape the mine. On your way out, you get caught by enemy soldiers and he saves your life in turn. The game really is good at putting the point across that you are fighting people who are in the same situation as you but were stuck on the other side of the line when boarders were drawn. The game is satisfying and emotionally engaging and has an adorable loyal dog following you around the whole time. The game and its puzzles are not particularly difficult and usually really easy to figure out but it fits the direction of the game and they are often worked into the story so I don’t fault it for that. I would recommend if you are looking for a short but heartfelt experience.","August 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best thing they released in 2014. It's related to the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 and is filled with historical facts. Despite goofy and cartoony art style (which looks great) it shows the war in a way you wouldn't expect. EVERYONE suffers in war and that it's a gruesome thing that destroys lives of all involved. The gameplay is really fun and I cannot think of a dull moment when playing any of the four characters. The collectibles in each level are fun to look for and contain historical information.  Only thing holding it back a bit is uPlay.

Emile, the french farmer and Karls father-in-law who focuses on solving all sorts of different puzzles with the help of his dog companion Walt. Freddie, the american volunteer who focuses on running forward, dodging mortars and knocking down anything and anyone in front of him with his fists and Anna, the belgian student turned medic who focuces on healing and saving wounded soldiers and civilians.\n\nDespite this game having a rather silly and friendly looking art style, you should not let that fool you since you will be taking cover from machine-gun fire behind the corpses of your fallen comrades, watch adult men shiver in fear and see innocent civilians cry over the loss of their family members. The game goes from gut punch to gut punch to the occasional kick in the heart as you, the player, will have to watch these loveable and colourful characters fight their way through the seven rings of hell without knowing that the more they fight, the more horrible it's going to get.\n\nA true testament to the bravery of every army man who has ever lived, who I feel, does not get the respect they deserve. Doesn't matter if they are american, british, french, japanese, german etc. Any man or woman who can pick up arms and risk their lifes for the safety of their family and country, is a true hero.","June 22, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best thing they released in 2014. It's related to the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 and is filled with historical facts. Despite goofy and cartoony art style (which looks great) it shows the war in a way you wouldn't expect. EVERYONE suffers in war and that it's a gruesome thing that destroys lives of all involved. The gameplay is really fun and I cannot think of a dull moment when playing any of the four characters. The collectibles in each level are fun to look for and contain historical information.

Instead, try to keep track of the journals, itens and "codex" entries: they provide loads of information about the Great War, the European lifestyle and some particularly intriguing and sad stories. Graphics and sound are top notch, providing nice ambience and little, delicate touches like the use of English, French and German in small audio snippets.\n\nOh, and since this is a game about one of the worst moments in Wolrd History, be prepared to cry and be struck by the horrors that took away so many lives.

Emile, the french farmer and Karls father-in-law who focuses on solving all sorts of different puzzles with the help of his dog companion Walt. Freddie, the american volunteer who focuses on running forward, dodging mortars and knocking down anything and anyone in front of him with his fists and Anna, the belgian student turned medic who focuces on healing and saving wounded soldiers and civilians.\n\nDespite this game having a rather silly and friendly looking art style, you should not let that fool you since you will be taking cover from machine-gun fire behind the corpses of your fallen comrades, watch adult men shiver in fear and see innocent civilians cry over the loss of their family members. The game goes from gut punch to gut punch to the occasional kick in the heart as you, the player, will have to watch these loveable and colourful characters fight their way through the seven rings of hell without knowing that the more they fight, the more horrible it's going to get.\n\nA true testament to the bravery of every army man who has ever lived, who I feel, does not get the respect they deserve.

You take the role of several people whose fate got crossed during the First World War and now must survive until the end to go back to their loved ones. It's an amazingly sad story with so many points in which it seems like everything is lost but you somehow manage to keep going. This game proposes multiple challanges that will require you to be think for a while in order to progress.\n\nThing is, this is SUCH a GREAT game that it can't be described with words. And I know it is going to be the shortest of my reviews, but you have to experience it by yourself. You want to know if it is worth your money or not? Belive me, IT IS.\n\n+ Varaiety of challanges which will require you to sit back and think your way forward.\n+ The in-game graphics look like out of a comic. They are very well drown.\n+ Definetely one the best stories I have seen in a while. I know I'm repeating myself, but I was genuinely crying in the final cutscene, and I'm not ashamed of saying that. You've got to see it.\n+ Optional collectibles and some pieces of trivia about the First World War keep banging your head to remember you that this is no fiction. That horrible war happened.\n- The puzzles only have one possible answer and it is not going to take long for you to figure it out.\n- Overall a short game. Took me about three sesions (seven-ish hours) to finish it, and I stopped to search for most of the optional collectibles. It is very easy to blaze your way through puzzles, obstacle courses and boss fights.\n- UPlay. Enough said.\n\nThis game gets a 9 out of 10. It was going to be a 7.5, but then I remembered once again the ending and I decided to go the extra mile.","November 27, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music perfectly captured the somber tone of most of the game, while swelling to cersendos at the most daring moments, while the art was just just cute enough to portray the gruesome nature of the war, while still being beautifully charming. Done by the fine people at UbiArt, same folks who did Rayman Origins and Legends, so expect high quality. Easily one of the strongest suits of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is puzzle based... and bit nonsequitor with the game, to be honest. The Great War is happening around you, and yet you are turning wheels and throwing bottles. I understand the bind of telling a story ABOUT people DURING the war, and trying to stray away form combat, but is a bit odd. There are a a bit of diversity with some other forms of gameplay and they were a nice change of pace, often highlighting a tense moment. Besides that the puzzles are simple and yet clever. You will more often have trouble executing than figuring out the puzzle\n\nStory and chracters are top notch. Despite mostly speaking in Gibberish or short clips of their natuve language, the characters all comminuacate a depth of emotion and feeling. I think that is really sttributed to the art team, once again. The story is truly one of valiant people, and you will be attatched to them and thier struggles and hopes.\n\nFinally, there is actually quite a bit of learning here! I've taken AP European History, and there is still a great deal here I didn't learn in my studies. The collection of War Heirlooms fit nicely into the educational bits, and some of the sweeping historical facts give very nice contecxt to a level or area. I really think this information enhances the gameplay and helps you really geta  feel for what our Valiant Hearts are battling through. The collection aspect of it may add on an extra 1.5 hours, so a brief stroll for 100%. I highly reccomend looking for them and reading up, as it is another strong suit of the game. This is edutainment done right.\n\nThing of note: Double DRM with Steam and Uplay. It is a pain to ahve to go thropugh and can be iffy. experienced issues with being unable to open the game, due to their being an instance of then game alredy running, despite Task Manager revelaing this as untrue.\n\nOverall it's a nice, small heartfelt game. Any history junky should play and enjoy this. Strong aesthetic aspects from a strong animation department with beautiful music and characters are the backbone for a simplisctic puzzler.","June 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We mostly play as a powerful 'invincible' soldier in games. it could be either CoD or Battlefield or CS:GO it doesn't matter but this game shows the real face of the war, the game we choose not to see and it displays the real evil face of war through the ordinary people from both sides of the opponents. While playing the game, it reminded me a German television show named 'Unsere Mutter, Unsere Vater' meaning 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers'. We eager to play the war games as the powerful, unstoppable man but the reality is different. In wars, people die, families, children suffer. All the inheritance of mankind can be destroyed with just one bomb. Valiant Hearts is showing that ugly side that we do not want to see. It is a beautiful game, a emotionally strong game.

It's a simple sidescrolling puzzler with moments of platformer challenges, which by itself might not be a great selling point, but the way it immerses you into the story it's telling is unmatched.  From the detailed background/backdrop pieces that many could overlook, to the running between cover to dodge artillery and machine gun hellfire.  What would normally be just a part of another game is now riveting and intense because you feel for these characters, even the untold number you see around you living out their own hell in the war.  What many FPS war games tried to accomplish, this game here perfected in an unexpected way.  I knew it would be a moving story and historical piece, but looking beyond that, if all the characters were aliens and this was a game set on some planet light years away, I would still be as moved by this game due to the immersiveness that is packed into every detail.

The game really stands out to me because of how much heart it really has and by the end how invested you feel in the characters struggles. It differs from traditional war games by not making the war about fighting a soulless enemy. The game is about helping the people who are being hurt by the war, allied, enemy or civilian. One part the stuck out to me was when you come across a stuck enemy solider in a mine, you help him out and you both work together to escape the mine. On your way out, you get caught by enemy soldiers and he saves your life in turn. The game really is good at putting the point across that you are fighting people who are in the same situation as you but were stuck on the other side of the line when boarders were drawn. The game is satisfying and emotionally engaging and has an adorable loyal dog following you around the whole time. The game and its puzzles are not particularly difficult and usually really easy to figure out but it fits the direction of the game and they are often worked into the story so I don’t fault it for that. I would recommend if you are looking for a short but heartfelt experience.","August 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the human characters share a different story each and see their destinies crossed to overcome the war. The story is excellent. It links with loyalty with real events from the First World War and aligned with the really well made English narrative (it reminds me of historical documentaries), it captures your interest and curiosity to know what's going to happen next. You end up getting a great sympathy towards the main characters and feel greatly involved, and you definitely figure that out in Chapter 3 and 4, the last chapters of the story. Even the way it ends, although I was not expecting such a closure (I'm still shaking, I just finished the game minutes ago but I found Chapter 4 very intense. I even had tears on my eyes at a point!) I do believe it was an honest ending. Lets remember that what happened around a century ago wasn't pink and roses.\n\nThe gameplay consists in a mixture of platforming (although you don't jump in this game), puzzle and historical. You need to explore your surroundings to look for clues in dropped objects, talk to characters, look carefully to the scenario, etc. There's no actual dialogue between the characters, pictograms are used instead inside talk-balloons and they are very efficient to understand what they are trying to tell you. The puzzles are very very clever. I found a lot of variety and not all of them were piece of cake, you really need to explore well your surroundings if you want to continue. They aren't super hard but expect to lose few time thinking a little. Due to the nature of the game (more in particular the fact the characters do not jump) the controls (sharp by the way) aren't very complex and don't require a high dexterity but don't think it is because of that that you will be bored: the game features some interesting real-time events that might require a little more dexterity like avoiding missles, covering yourself and your companions, healing someone, etc. The human characters share a special ability each too: Emile can dig through soil, Freddie can clear up barbed tape paths and Anna can heal people. Being a game based up in historical facts, as soon as you progress diary entries and historical facts are unlocked. The diary entries tell you more about the characters of the game and their thoughts in the course of the story and historical facts tell you about different real facts from the First World War which are pretty educative. These elements help the player to understand more the contexts of the game. As a bonus for explorators/collectors there are more than 100 historical items to collect during gameplay with a description that tells you more about them. Again, it is educative and helps to understand more the context of the game. The objects are discrete enough to be easy to miss them, especially if you own a small display/resolution so make sure you look everywhere!\n\nThe graphics are absolutely gorgeous, just like they were in Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends: both games developed by the same studio and in the same game-engine. Everything is hand-drawn under a high-definition digital format but the cartoony look works really well for the atmosphere of the game. It is not kiddy but at the same time it is not too realistic. The perfect balance. If the game circunstance allows you, please play calmly and appreciate the view. There is too many good detail to ignore. The animations are equally irreprehensible.\n\nThe music and sound are equally excellent. The music is orchestral and marries really well with what's going on in the screen. There is even a small treat for music/rhythm lovers with some ingame-events that require a perfect syncronization with musics like the French Cancan! The sounds are varied and adequated. I would like to congratulate the voice actors in particular both for their work in the English narrative and in the gibberish language of the characters. Despite the human characters talk gibberish I can ensure you that in the highest moments of the story, their voice performance will give you the shivers.\n\nComplaints? To be honest it felt quick but that was probably because I was really immersed in the game. I will have to start it over anyway to collect the items I've missed but without me noticing I played over 10 hours!\n\nSince I heard about this game for the first time in a E3 reveal I was interested in it despite of being a war-themed game. I decided to take the risk and I don't have any regret. Ubisoft Montpellier once more showed the brilliant team it has got in the studio like it already proved to have with the Rayman titles it developed before. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is worth every cent and is 100% recommended to every fan of bidimensional platformers, with diverse puzzles to solve, scenarios to explore and like to hear (and feel) a good story.","August 6, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the human characters share a different story each and see their destinies crossed to overcome the war. The story is excellent. It links with loyalty with real events from the First World War and aligned with the really well made English narrative (it reminds me of historical documentaries), it captures your interest and curiosity to know what's going to happen next. You end up getting a great sympathy towards the main characters and feel greatly involved, and you definitely figure that out in Chapter 3 and 4, the last chapters of the story. Even the way it ends, although I was not expecting such a closure (I'm still shaking, I just finished the game minutes ago but I found Chapter 4 very intense. I even had tears on my eyes at a point!) I do believe it was an honest ending. Lets remember that what happened around a century ago wasn't pink and roses.\n\nThe gameplay consists in a mixture of platforming (although you don't jump in this game), puzzle and historical. You need to explore your surroundings to look for clues in dropped objects, talk to characters, look carefully to the scenario, etc. There's no actual dialogue between the characters, pictograms are used instead inside talk-balloons and they are very efficient to understand what they are trying to tell you. The puzzles are very very clever. I found a lot of variety and not all of them were piece of cake, you really need to explore well your surroundings if you want to continue. They aren't super hard but expect to lose few time thinking a little. Due to the nature of the game (more in particular the fact the characters do not jump) the controls (sharp by the way) aren't very complex and don't require a high dexterity but don't think it is because of that that you will be bored: the game features some interesting real-time events that might require a little more dexterity like avoiding missles, covering yourself and your companions, healing someone, etc. The human characters share a special ability each too: Emile can dig through soil, Freddie can clear up barbed tape paths and Anna can heal people.

The game really stands out to me because of how much heart it really has and by the end how invested you feel in the characters struggles. It differs from traditional war games by not making the war about fighting a soulless enemy. The game is about helping the people who are being hurt by the war, allied, enemy or civilian. One part the stuck out to me was when you come across a stuck enemy solider in a mine, you help him out and you both work together to escape the mine. On your way out, you get caught by enemy soldiers and he saves your life in turn. The game really is good at putting the point across that you are fighting people who are in the same situation as you but were stuck on the other side of the line when boarders were drawn. The game is satisfying and emotionally engaging and has an adorable loyal dog following you around the whole time. The game and its puzzles are not particularly difficult and usually really easy to figure out but it fits the direction of the game and they are often worked into the story so I don’t fault it for that. I would recommend if you are looking for a short but heartfelt experience.","August 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Granted its one of the only WWI game I played, but as someone who have played many war base game ranging from FPS to RTS, this easily blow  all of them out of water in terms of story.\n\nStory:\nValiant Hearts follow around Emile, Karl, Freddie, and Anna through the war. You watch as all their stories line up together and they must help one another to survive. The fact that they tell this story with virtually no dialog is amazing. The characters simply grunt and show speech bubbles with a picture in them to get their point across. Even with the this cartoonish way of communication and in the art style, the game nail the style and atmosphere of this time period. Honestly I wish I could speak more about each character story but I don't want to spoil any part of it. Also it was nice to see that they added a historical fact tab so that you could get some real facts on WWI. Always nice when a game include little bits of facts over whatever time period they're covering.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay involve moving one of the control characters throughout a 2D map to find items or tools to help you to complete task or solve a puzzle. The player actions is generally limited to throwing and pulling levers, but there are some characters with special abilities or tools. These special abilities generally have a slightly different play style to give you some uniqueness between each character. Such as Emile being able to dig through certain areas or Anna doing button prompting mini game. Nothing ground breaking, but the puzzles are enough to keep you entertained and can even stump you sometime.\n\nFinal Comments:\nI know WWI is a hard era to make a game for since so much of it was static trench warfare. Most people don't want to play a game where you spend half the game in a trench and the other half running through a kill-zone while you get riddled with machine gun fire and artillery barrage.  But Valiant Hearts use this to it advantage by focus on the individuals force to deal with these horrors. You become attached to these characters, and don't want to see bad things happen to them. This attachment motivate you to keep playing to see how this war will end for them. Also I like how they just don't straight up demonize one side as the "bad guy" but rather show that at the end of the day, it was just a bunch of people fighting to stay alive and get back home.\n\nI would easily trade in many of the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and other war games campaign stories for this one. I found great pleasure in the game and even greater in the story it told.","November 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would recommend this game, but sadly.. only just. I have to agree with a lot of negative points raised by other reviews as well.\n\nThe feel and the music is awesome, but the puzzles and generally the "logic" of the game are really ruining the experience for me.. I don't want to be nit-picking as I am not a huge fan of this genre, but... Why on earth would you have supposedly quirky and funny puzzles (that are not really hard even in veteran mode) and real out-of-place "paraller universe" inventions (armored car chase anyone?) and factology, when you (quite rightly so) boast about all the cooperation with historians and archives. Also, the story line is interesting but the amount of clichés and overall predictiveness kind of let it down. For example, since the devs already spoiled "some will not" in trailer, you can guess who that will be pretty early in the game..\n\nThese are only my personal let-downs, since I was really looking forward to play this game and it just didn't live up to all the hype and expectation.\n\nBUT:\nThe story can be moving,\nYou can learn some new and interesting facts about WW1 even if you are already interested in the topic.\nIt generally raises the awareness about the horrors of the Great war, which is good and long overdue.\nIt is pretty streamlined and already mentioned fell and music of the game are big plus points.\nUplay for once worked okay (still annoying though)\n\nSo just play it and see for yourself.. :)","March 31, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really appreciate the fact that the puzzles are not trial and error oriented but actually just require some exploration and logic.

It shows WWI in a different way. Not trough violence, but trough human emotions. It focusses on showing the player how it felt like to be trapped in this horrible time. It has a great deal of authenticity as well: not just building and uniforms that they copied from various sources, but other aspects of war as well. These aspects like POW camps, often are forgotten in FPS and Valiant Hearts tries to make up for that. It offers a lot of knowledge on events, places e.c. connected to WWI.\n\nAll in all a great game for those interested in history, especially if you're not too keen on the violence in a lot of history games.","December 18, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jovack/recommended/260230/","jovack","The Counter of Strikes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jovack/","268 products in account","This is a historical fiction game based in World War 1, from the French perspective (made by French develoers). Bias is generally kept to a minimum, and the game seems like it would be a great thing for kids taking Canadian history to play in high school -- the collectables are items from the time and there are even various photographs with associated texts grounding you to what the reality was.\n\nThe art style is quite pretty and the game runs very smoothly. The tone ranges from funny/parody to serious. It has things that are bizarre (and never existed), but generally sticks to the reality.\n\nThis is not an action game like MetalSlug. It is very slowly paced, and more of a point and click adventure where you need to solve puzzles to progress: Go pick up the salami, give the salami to the dog, who will then move, who will then, etc etc .... Or. here are a series of gears, but them together, but first make sure the water is turned the correct way, etc etc. You will also find a dog as a companion who plays a pivotal role as you will direct him to pull levers for you or get to places you cannot reach.\n\nThe game follows a cast of characters over 4 chapters and illustrates some of the battles/scenarios of the war. Without spoiling the game, there are touching moments, one which made me choked up (can't really remember the last game that made me get 'the feels'). The game puts a very human perspective on war and shows how evil and how good humans can be.\n\nThe gameplay can get to feel repetitive (especially parts where you need to heal people as the medic), and the puzzles mostly follow a similar formula. So just be warned in advance, it's not a game I think I'd play more than once, at least not in a long while.\n\nThe game has beautiful music, sometimes in the background (humoresque by dvorak I heard once), sometimes in "driving escape sequences" where they'll coordinate the falling of bombs to the can can, or hungarian dances.\n\nA 'nice' title overall -- got it on sale and I'm happy to have played through it.","May 7, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It of course is a puzzle game but the puzzles never really got very complicated but still feel rewarding when you complete them, but the main reason you should buy this game is for the story, it's based off stories from World War 1 and tells a story of love, loss, vengence, and companionship with 5 main characters (my favorite being the dog Walt) all just trying to survive the horrors of war and maintain their humanity. The story was absolutley amazing and I thought the art style was great. This isn't a game where you kill every enemy you see and feel like the ultimate badass you actually rarely ever have to harm the enemies. The characters become personal to you and you really want the best for them. The game teaches you that war is hell and that we should never forget the ones that have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The game's story is about 6 hours to beat so if you are looking for a great game with great characters, fun and rewarding puzzels and gameplay, great soundtrack, a nice art style, and a fantastic story with tear-jerking moments then I highly recommend Valient Hearts: The Great War. 9/10","July 8, 2014","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very few games these days grab a hold of your emotions and pull you in but this game does so and right from the start. I'm writing this at roughly two hours into the game (at the start of Chapter 2 in fact) and I have to say I'm impressed with what this game is already offering. The characters, stoic and of very few words they may be, are lovable and draw you straight into whats going on from the farmer turned reluctant soldier to the veternarian turned field medic.\n\nHonestly I could go on forever talking about what I've already experienced in this fantastic game so I won't bore you. All I'll say is buy it if you have any interest in it. It's definitely worth the $15 you'll spend.\n\nLike most other reviews I'll warn you this required Uplay to play so make sure you have it downloaded onto your computer (though I'm sure it'll force itself on you anyways).","June 25, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game covers the stories of 4 (from what I've seen, there may be more playable!) characters and a Dog companion across the entire duration of the War itself. Each character has their own identity and jobs that effectively show off the war from their own different perspectives. One minute you'll be charging into battle as Freddie and then tending to the wounded as Ana. It's also worth mentioning the game has a rather large educational part to it as well, as there are items scattered about that you can pick up such as letters and objects commonly used during the war that give you a history lesson about what they were used for.\n\nThe artstyle is very pleasant and pleasing to look at, it's friendly enough to be attractive to every audience and depressing enough to please those looking for an sad emotional trip.\n\nAll in all, buy the thing.

Yes, that first hour got me that excited.\n\nThe cartoon style art is beautiful, the atmosphere is great and the music is amazing.\n\nThe story is a touching one, and it is very well done with the small exception of a cheesy villain. He is a small part of it though, so that minor flaw is easily overlooked. It is mostly told in a silent manner like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons with the exception of a narrator in between sub-chapters.\n\nThe gameplay so far is mostly fairly simple puzzels, a bit of basic combat and old school dodge the objects mechanics timed on the beautiful background music. At first I was sceptical about the gamplay and I thought it would put me off, but luckly this is not the case. It doesn't have groundbraking mechanics though, so don't expect too much from that.\n\nI already know this isn't a game for the average gamer or for the masses, but for the gamer that wants a story experience in a World War 1 setting with amazing art and music.\n\nAre you looking for a platform and/or action game? Look elsewhere, this is not it.\nYou want an adventure game with a story between a father and a daughter and two lovers torn apart by a horrible war?

While overall I thought the games storyline and art style were fantasic, I also was a bit surprised by the gameplay.  I had been expecting a more traditional war game experience and was shocked to find myself solving puzzles throughout the majority of the game and literaly not firing a single bullet or ever even using a gun at all throughout an entire game about WW1! The story itself was good though it had distinctive "PG" vibe to it that felt a bit out of place in all honesty there were many times where it felt like were aimed at a child audience. Not that there's anything wrong with that but it does seem a bit out of place in a game about one of the most violent conflicts in the history of the human race. The gameplay is also clearly meant for an older crowd (I would never have been able to solve most of the some of the more complicated puzzles when I was a kid!) The art style is the real star of the show here though something about the art, music and narration just go together so beautifuly and created a truly unique atmostphere.\n\nAll that aside though if you want a rather light hearted puzzles solving game that will teach you plenty of less gritty historical facts about WW1 as well as having one of the best looking art styles in a game that I have seen in quite awhile. Then this game is for you. I just want people to know what they are buying before they buy it and find out it is completely different  from what they were expecting like I did. Nothing wrong with that as it is good at what it was trying to convey though i still think this game could have benefitted from an even slightly more of a mature tone to match the horror of the setting.","June 27, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From the sudden E3 presentation and being released quickly thereafter, Ubisoft sure didn't have their usual delays as they unfortunately have done with Assassin's Creed series, Far Cry etc. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant surprise, not to mention a cheap on as well!\n\nThe game starts right off with a well-crafted presentation of the charachters shown in the trailer (without giving away too much spoilers) and gives us the player a chance to adjust to their respective charachter development. This results in more or less a emotional roller-coaster, something that is really on of the phenomenal points about this game. It never fails to balance out the time playing as each charachter, never sacrificing anothers charachters story for another, something that is frankly rare to see in Ubisoft games (with exceptions like AC2, AC4 etc.) and games overall. Though this also goes hand-in-hand with HOW the game is presented. One of the reasons for example AC3 was considered a big failure was how it was presented: a well-crafted mess where it seemed like even the developers at Montreal didn't know HOW to present the story, what they wanted the players to experience etc. This is NOT the case with Valiant Hearts. Instead we are given a charming graphic engine (identical to the one in the higly praised Rayman games), a set of brave charachters, each with their own deep personalities and backgrounds, all intertwined masterfully without any form of sacrifice at the expense story-telling. Simply put, there is no confusion, no confusing story-gaps. Just one fluid experience.\n\nThe only "downside" I can possibly think of after playing the game, is the somtimes complicated puzzles that that might be somewhat annoying to figure out, though even then you have your trustworthy war-pidgeon for help. Another one is the classic Uplay-annoyance we're all so familiar with. Fortunetely I didn't bump into any problems like the AC and Splinter Cell games.\n\nAll in all, this game, given its low price is a MUST buy for any war-gamer out there. It might not be the next Call of Duty or MoH: Allied Assault that we all used to play. But it shows an entirely new theather of war: The First world war. Which honestly hasn't been really explained or shown in video-game form. As a history-nerd and an avid war-gamer, this is a great opportunity to throw yourself in the mustard-gas infested foxholes and trenches at the humble price of two Burger King menus in your local downtown.\n\nI'll give this game 5 delicious Sauerkrauten out of 5 possible!","July 2, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a beautiful game with a strong and emotional storyline that stops you for a second and forces you to think. It is a good game that takes you away from all the other bigger games where violence is the meaning of the game. This game is also about violence, but not the violence you create but the violence that the world once wittnessed.

It's rich in story, historically accurate in its design and just fun to play. The puzzles are endearing and the characters voices can range from cute to hilarious.

WW1 needs more games to show the horror of the "War to end all wars" (despite us having a second one) Good job to Ubisoft for that. Their new engine for running such artistic 2D games is something I hope to see developed more and have more games made with it. That being said... that ♥♥♥♥ing Dog.\n\nEvery human being has one sound that will enrage them or anger them. Mine is the sound of whimpering and barking dogs. The dog in this game will not. shut. the. ♥♥♥♥. up. It's Fable 3 levels of agonizing when it will take any chance it gets to point out puzzle solutions by, you guessed it, barking at me and whimpering. I do not need hints, game. I am a grown man and I can take visual hints without a dog trying to help.","June 29, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
