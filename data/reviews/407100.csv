Be prepared to get your backside kicked a few times before you master certain levels (I did!).\n\nA new original concept which I like and recommend.  Can't wait for more installments!","January 4","true","0.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Sometimes you'll need fast ships and mobillity and sometimes you want to turtle up and bring out the big guns.\n\nOh and the whole sea charts in the captain's cabin setup is a really nice touch.\n\nReally liked it.","February 9","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
