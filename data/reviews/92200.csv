"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobbeh_27/recommended/92200/","bobbeh_27","Bobbeh_27","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobbeh_27/","178 products in account","Alright, if you're here, then you probably know what the "bullet hell" subgenre is, or at least its parent genre, shoot 'em ups (from now on referred to as "shmups"), but if not, I'll briefly explain:\n\nShmups are generally defined as any top-down or side-scrolling shooter, such as Galaga, Space Invaders, and many others. Bullet hell games, on the other hand, take this to the EXTREME; some of the screenshots for this game should show you just how many bullets you'll have to deal with. To compensate for this, your character's hit box is extremely small, really only a couple of pixels big, so that this is at all possible.\n\nWith that out of the way, the actual review!\n\nThe presentation:\nGenerally pretty good quality sprite work; I wouldn't say it's anything outstanding, but certainly nothing to scoff at. The menus are a tad bland, but function well, and aren't boring; just simple.\n\nThe story:\nIt's a little hard for me to comment on this one, honestly; the story isn't really well told throughout the game. To give an example of how important the story is, there's an option to disable the pre-level "cutscenes", which are only one screen with text and some pictures anyway. I believe it has something to do with humanity doing something dumb, and that causes some evil person to attack (again? I'm not sure; I haven't played the first game), and you, being part of some millitary group, have to go and face her. Not terrible, but not super deep either. But that's probably not why you're here, is it? You're looking for...\n\nThe gameplay:\nIs fantastic. Before you start the game, you have the choice between two characters, Eryth and Earl, and another once you beat the true final boss (which, I should mention, I have not done). Now, there are two conflicting sources on the amount of characters; one (this very Steam page) says that there are two starting characters, with the unlockable third, while the games official webpage states that there are FIVE characters, along with an unlockable sixth. Neither of these are completely correct. The second character, Earl, is actually a customizable character; you can use one of four presets, or you can mix and match her three selectable abilities. These abilities, of which Eryth has as well (however, Eryth is stuck with one skillset), include your normal shots, "bombs" (which almost never actually includes using a bomb), and "Mana Action", which requires your Mana bar to be filled up; this can be done by killing enemies. The game isn't too long, probably about an hour or less if your good; but that's a pretty tall order. The first time I played through this game (playing as Eryth, Revised (normal) difficulty), it took about two hours of multiple retries to get past these five stages. Despite the difficulty (which is pretty normal for these kinds of games), I had a blast, and felt extremely satisfied once I finally conquered it. Thanks in no small part to...\n\nThe music:\nNow, personally, I loved the music. It's probably one of my favorite game soundtracks, and I'm not exaggerating; I rank this up there with Cave Story, Mega Man X, BlazBlue (the collective series), all of those amazing soundtracks. And the soundtrack actually comes including in the Steam folder for the game once it's installed, so that's a huge plus. However, looking at another review, it said that the musical wasn't all that great. So who knows, I might be in the minority on this one.\n\nOverall:\nHopefully this review didn't end up being too long-winded; I don't exactly have a lot of experience with reviewing. However, I found myself having to hold back on how much I said, because I quite bluntly love this game. It's one of my favorites, and I'm pretty sure the next few days will be spent on getting the achievements. I hope you decide to pick this game up, because it's definitely worth it; I plan on buying the other games in the series at some point soon as well.","November 5, 2014","true","26.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

Well this game is definitely a good one to start with.\n\nThe game has four controls, plus 8-way movement. It's a side scroller, like the Gradius games, but it has no powerups. You use what the character you select has, as well as one of four alternate costumes which change their way of playing.\n\nMusic in this game is what you'd expect from a game from overseas; really good. It's not overbearing, and you can hear everything in the game without the music blocking anything. Plenty of different songs in each level, too.\n\nLevel design goes from Easy to moderate to a bit tough to really tough to "If you are not godlike, quit now" tough. Difficulty ramps up REALLY fast towards the third level, which is only 10~ minutes in. The fifth level is just incredibly brutal, and this isn't even a hard game. Consider it an entry to Bullet Hells, because this is only the tip.\n\nA great game for beginners to learn the fear of Bullet Hell games.

I have really tried to understand this game, but the game refuses to let me know what's going on. No tutorial, no explanation of what's going on, no explanation of the buttons, moves or attacks. Obviously, the basic shooting action is easy enough to grasp, but without understanding how the bombs and special attacks work, you can't really succeed at the game.\n\nShooter fans that are looking for a challenge and are willing to research this game to figure it out may enjoy it. Also, if you don't mind just blindly shooting at things and dying a bunch, you may be able to forgive this game's flaws. For most people, however, I'd recommend passing this one up, unless you can find it for under a dollar.\n\nUPDATE: I've had a few complaints come in, so I'm going to address a few of the points I missed the first time around.\n\nFirst, the manual. Yes, there's a manual, and yes, it teaches you basically everything you need to know about playing the game. No, it's not good enough, and no, it doesn't replace the missing tutorial. Here's the first problem: I didn't have access to the manual when I played the game initially. I was traveling and had no Internet connection, which is a huge problem when the online manual is required reading to enjoy the game. Also, game manuals haven't been required reading for basically any game made since 1990. Most manuals made today only contain basic troubleshooting information for the game, so the manual is not where I would have thought to look for basic gameplay instructions. I mean, seriously, it doesn't take that much effort to put in a basic, working tutorial. Why didn't the developers care enough to include one?\n\nAlso, this game is fairly complex, which is unfortunate because the game is so inelegant. There are lots of little meters and little rules quirks you're just expected to know about. There are plenty of bullet hell shooters that have rich gameplay with a relatively simple set of rules. This is not one of them.\n\nSecond, the controls. If you're playing on a keyboard, the control menu is simply baffling. Not only do you not have the option to freely bind the keys, but the game also doesn't adequately tell you what the current bindings are. Fire is "01"? Which key is that? If you think it's the 1 key, you're wrong. It's the space bar.\n\nThird, the story. Yes, I read the blurb at the start. It makes little sense. It's a giant wave of jargon with almost no meaning, and the inter-level blurbs are similarly void of semantics. It doesn't adequately explain what's going on.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I'm willing to take back a little of what I initially said, since the manual addresses a few of my concerns. That said, as far as bullet hell shooters go, this is still on the lower end of quality.\n\nI still don't recommend this game. This game is very lazily made, and fans of bullet hell shooters deserve better. Thankfully, there are better ones out there, though I'm not aware of any that are currently on Steam (Ikaruga's not on Steam yet).","January 9, 2012","false","1.2"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","20"

You've got your normal shmup fare, attack, special attack, bomb... there's also a neat rapid fire attack that will overheat a certain character's guns if you use and on another it's worthless. The most unique thing in this game is the phase level mechanic. Depending on what difficulty you start on, your phase level will change, with demonic locked in at 11. The higher your phase level, the harder the game is. You can lower your phase level by getting hit or using a bomb, or raise it by beating a boss or using a bomb just as you get hit, also known as counter bombing.\n\nYour hitbox is very small in comparison to your large sprite, which allows bullets to cover most of your body without you getting hit. Personally, I would prefer a larger hitbox or a smaller sprite, but it isn't a big deal. Espcially considering this game's difficulty. It's a pretty difficult game. Do not buy this if you are not prepared to die often. That's really the only reason to stay away, or if you just don't like bullet hell games.
