I did find the game a bit easy, I was playing on normal so maybe hard mode is a challenge. The dungeons are fairly well designed, and there is a fair few sidequests to keep you busy.  It also has a system where you can choose how to respond to different situations, how you respond determines how characters will react to you and the favor of your teammates, the favor of your will become important near the end in an event I won't spoil here. There's also the chance to romance some party members though there dosen't seem to be much to it yet but will likely be expanded on in future installments. Also a word of warning this game ends on a rather big cliffhanger so I hope your willing to wait a few months to see the continuation.","August 5, 2015","true","39.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

This is a step above the previous two, conversations are now influenced by you on top of the morality system from the second game. So far the story has a darker tone than the others and feels better written. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes these types of games, it even has a difficulty setting.","August 3, 2015","true","9.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Passability bugs in the Manor, bugs with objectives (unable to interact with them and complete quests etc.), quest book bugs...just so many EASY that should have been caught in beta.\n-Walls of flavorless text. You can tell the dev has a knack for writing - but there's no flavor to any of the characters - they're all...kind of the same when they talk.\n- TOO MANY RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. Oh my god! I can't stress this one enough. Every few steps you're going to have to trudge through another battle - this is especially irritating when you've already done the area and are forced to head through it again. The Dev needs to take some inspiration from games like Deadly Sin 2 and input a "monster node" system - or something that turns off random encounters.\n-Poorly fleshed out "Quest" book (and so many errors relating to it - I kept getting error windows 1/2 the times I accepted a quest).\n-Poorly balanced battles\n-Side quests - you're forced to trudge through WHOLE AREAS AGAIN to complete some side quests. This is my biggest pet peeve with most RPGMaker games - they need to be respectful of the players time and open up forms of fast travel/teleportation.\n\nAll in all - I can't say I'd recommend.","December 28, 2015","false","6.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","3"

Thus far, I've only been interested in Let's Plays of this type of games, but not into playing them myself. When I saw HoL something triggered and I decided to try this one out. And I couldn't be happier! I am amazed how awesome it is! Got me hooked so much and the ending of the first Episode was Epic! Yes, I am writting this straight after I finished the game. xD No, I haven't played any other RPGmaker games until now and don't have anything to compare it with, but, I think, the fact a noob in this genre, got so blown away, does say something! I hope, at least! With a pure heart, I can easily say, it places among my favorite games of all times already. I'm super excited and looking forward to the next Episodes, as well as for more games from those creators! :)","January 10","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays like an old snes rpg, like Dragon Warrior or something but you can also pick what to say in dialogs. What you pick can change what happens next which is kinda cool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaKaze/recommended/278590/","TeaKaze","Kaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaKaze/","199 products in account","I'm liking this game so far. I've played quite a few RPG Maker games and have dabbled in making my own a little. The first thing that impressed me was the character creation, simple to some perhaps, but I liked it. Credit where its due!\n\n*I have played just over an hour, I may add on to this at a later stage..*\n\nThe world has a lot of flavour to it, while some might find that bland I find it interesting. After playing games like Skyrim and Dragon Age the lore of a world can really draw you in. Dark Gaia did have a lot of history behind this game seeing as it is the third in the Legionwood series but regardless, some of it is well worth the read.\n\n(It has no relation to previous games bar the infrequent references.)\n\nThe talents and techs your character can learn deserve a mention as well, they vary quite a bit and give a lot of choice, which is always, always a good thing.\n\nWhen talking to certain NPCs you are given four options which will dictate how you respond to an NPCs request/comment ranging from 'courageous' to 'serious' to 'casual' to 'snide'. I would do the whole -choose option and load a previous save- just to see the options, wasn't disappointed!\n\nAll in all its a decent game, (bar some rather appauling bugs which hopefully will be patched out at some point heres hoping), as RPG Maker games go it is among the better ones.","January 4","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/no1dead/recommended/278590/","no1dead","Boxxy <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/no1dead/","429 products in account","This game is great, and I'm having a blast playing it. I've played a bunch of RPG Maker games, and honestly I was very impressed with it. In just my first sitting I had played the game for 5hours and I'm probably going to keep playing it.\n\nThis game is very unique, and special. Once you play a lot of lore heavy games, like Witcher 3 and the Tell Tale Games, you can really start to appreciate when games place a new well thought out world infront of you, and Heroes of Legionwood pulls that off very well.\n\nThe character customization impressed me and the whole scale of the combat system with the talents and tech's give you a lot of choice and nothing is just copy and pasted over to make it seem like theres alot of moves, there really is!\n\nWhile talking to other characters in the game it makes it seem like your in a Fallout or Telltale game giving you multiple pathes and adding alot of replayablity to the game, which is another great part of this game.\n\nTo end this up its a pretty good game and something I really wasn't expecting from a RPGMaker game, heres to raising the bar for RPG Maker enthusiasts all over the internet!","April 8","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked having 5 party members unlike typical rpgs. However, the conversation commands are crap. I said confident, not stuckup. And casual, not being a jerk! My character constantly surprises me with the words that spew out of his mouth. Other than that, gameplay is pretty fun.","May 14","true","6.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
