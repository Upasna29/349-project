"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seedvault/recommended/286320/","seedvault","Seed Vault Hermit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seedvault/","721 products in account","Oknytt is a point and click adventure game that takes place in a dark and forbidding world.  It is described by the authors as "a journey through Norse folklore".\n\nTo give some background, Oknytt is not related to the Knytt games by Nicklas Nygren, although both developers are from Sweden. The word 'oknytt' is Swedish for 'goblin' according to Google translate; certainly the game is loaded with troublesome and dangerous creatures.  Additionally, Oknytt is the latest in a series of games developed with the Wintermute Engine for creating graphical adventures.\n\nFor the most part the puzzles in the game are logical.  Like a lot of adventure games there is an inventory system that allows for the combining of held items.  There were a couple times I had to do trial and error combinations to advance but fortunately everything you pick up is used ... eventually.  Point and click adventure veterans will appreciate that this game has no "pixel hunting", but due to the darkness of the graphics it is still possible to overlook things that seem part of the background.  The style of the game is one of the most grim I've ever seen and for that reason I would have liked a gamma adjuster that worked and a colour saturation adjuster as well.\n\nThe most important aspect of Oknytt is a charming story with a satisfying ending.  A single actor narrated the entire game, which works because it is like listening to someone tell a long story while sitting around a campfire. I loved all the creatures that are pulled from Scandanavian folklore and many of them you will recognize by other names.  I can recommend the game for anyone that doesn't mind the slower pace, since "the creature" walks slow.\n\nOn average the game will take 8 hours to finish; for 100% achievement hunters this game is perfect since you'll unlock them all for completing the game.  This isn't to say the game is easy, but with enough thought and patience there will be no need for a walkthrough, just trust your intuition.  Try it out next time it's on sale or in a bundle.","June 11, 2014","true","9.8"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","62","67","0","8"

First off, being of where it was made from then I do have to admit I came into it biased already determined to like it. (My grandfather hails from Sweden.  And parts of the game even contained folklore from a song sung to me as a child.)  However I still gave it a fair and open mind to let myself decide truthfully how I felt about it.  The graphics, for being simple as far as without a large color spectrum that is, were ABSOLUTELY amazing and fantastic!!  The understated colors did not distract in the least in my opinion from game play or the story...they placed them strategically and where they would matter most I felt.   The story line was very developed and complex. (When you get to the end then you will understand, and hopefully agree, why I say this.)  I was in complete surprise at the ending and also quite moved and left with a feeling of "WOW!"...speechless, as it were.  There are so many great things I could say about this game.  I very much liked the feature that when you need to combine items or give them to an NPC then you cannot make a mistake as the game will not let you pursue the wrong scenario.  The most of the puzzles were challenging, but not too much.  You do have an option to have either the voice or to have captions.  However certain small parts did require you to have just voice.  (I am guessing these were the areas that only the Swedish language was available and the Steam profile for the game does state this so it was not a surprise in the least for me.)  There were even a couple of more challenging achievements.  Also, in addition, the price is very reasonable and I would have even paid twice as much...it is that good.  So in closure, I highly reccomend this game to any one looking for unique game play, an original story (it is based on Swedish folklore), point and clicks, or even a calm and quicker game to experience.","June 19, 2015","true","17.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","4"

Like in most point and click adventures, you'll be walking around collecting objects and using those items to interact with the world around you. Where Oknytt deviates is you also have four rune stones at the bottom of the screen that can create fire, earth, wind and water. The fire will do things like light up a house or make the embers of a fire glow. Water will make it rain or a hustomte will drool. They all do something, even if its background stuff like a creature will appear or a dragonfly will buzz by.\n\nThese runes add another layer of complexity, because there are specific orders to them. Rain turns on and off, so do you need to have the rain on or off? Using common sense helps a lot, like you can't light a fire while its raining.\n\nThe game is simple to play, left click to walk somewhere, right click to open your inventory box, then left click to pick out an item and use it wherever. Seeing a foot icon lets you leave a screen once you've walked to it. For the most part, every area is one screen, but others with wide edges to the screen means that there's a larger area to explore.\n\nHovering your mouse over specific objects will show you text as to what they are. These objects are the ones that you can hold your left mouse button to interact with. You can talk, take or have the object described for you. Since I never bothered with the easy to read tutorial, it took me about 45 minutes before I realized to hold down the mouse. Most of the objects can be taken. You can intelligently figure out uses for them, unlike some point and click games, such as fill up a tea kettle at a spring of water. There are still times where you'll be left scratching your head like what exactly does a hustomte want in trade for a bolt of cloth or even to eat?\n\nWhat makes Oknytt unique is the world that you're in. You play as "the small creature," a fat furry little guy that is still much larger than the mice or other mammals in the game. The art style is beautiful in its sort of colorless way, there's a lot of rich detail to each screen with dust partials wafting through the air and haze moving through the forever night sky. Its not all monochromatic though, there are punctuations of color. Dark blue skies, burning red embers in the fire, dark  streams that flow through caves and red eyed gnomes. It all adds to the beauty of the game.\n\nIts not a happy place at all. These are humble settings, yet grandiose in its artistic detail. You'll visit corn fields, traverse humble graveyards with wooden crosses, crawl under the father's house and visit underground locales. While you're alone on your journey you'll meet plenty of well illustrated creatures like giant witches and arms that rise out from the grave.\n\nThe music is very ambient and fitting. There are long, slow string instruments. You'll hear nighttime birds, crawling under the father's house you'll hear the slow creeks of thick floorboards. In a way its all haunting and adds to the foreboding atmosphere.\n\nEverything is voice acted as if someone alone is stilling a story. He'll use different voices for different characters and while its all admirably done, some of the voices are cringe worthy. Its more than some guy with a microphone, he feels like a professional voice actor and it helps lend credibility to the game. Plus, even if its him telling a story of what happened, I'd rather hear it than read through the text. You can click skip to stop the narration or turn it off. There are a few settings for sound, music and voice over. You can even turn off the subtitles. There's a save and load function along with a few extras to chronicle your journey.\n\nIf you're a fan of the point and click genre, you should be able to get into this game. For anyone else like me that doesn't care for the genre as a whole, you won't find anything that will change your mind. Its still a play at your own speed sort of game that when you walk away, it'll still be there when you come back.","October 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/286320/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","There's a certain incomparable magic to being told a story around a fire. Whether it's otherworldly or ordinary, the simple act of someone being there, repeating a narrative that may have been told to them in a similar fashion causes the tale to take on a new sense of substance, holding your attention through every tiny detail as they engross you in the whatever world they seek to create.\n\nIt's an experience that's almost intangible and unrepeatable, leaving a lasting impact that makes you wish to share it with others, most likely changing certain details and words to suit your own version which will then be transfigured and retold by those around you. This is what playing Oknytt feels like. It's an experience brought to life by its own brilliant storyteller, taking on the voices of the bizarre and frightening creatures that inhabit the sinister world you travel through. It's compelling precisely for how it's told than what it says, as though story formed out of Swedish folklore is indeed engaging, without the narrator there to guide you through it the spark would be lost and it would be rather worse off for it.\n\nAs a game, its classical adventure game formula is one of simple discovery and item utilization, though unfortunately one which is incredibly easy to lose your way in as you miss an obscured item or don't consider an abstract combination. It's unfortunate and rather frustratingly obtuse at times, often leaving me to the helping hand of a guide as I simply wished to continue a tale that was otherwise captivating.\n\nFor as convoluted it can at times become, Oknytt is so inherently enrapturing as to be worth exploring for however often you're forced to reach for the helping hand of a walkthrough. I feel personally required to again praise the narrator who for all intents and purposes makes the game what it is, though certainly helped along a good deal with the imaginative, eerie artwork that is strangely curious for how frightening much of it is. It's a game firmly grounded in its own lore, brilliantly imagined and executed, which left me entranced and maybe just a little bit anxious of what might be awaiting me next time I venture into the woods.","November 7, 2014","true","5.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","1"

And with this starts a journey through the night, illuminated by the kindness of said creature.\n\nThe graphics reflect the dark tone of its encounters, with only a few occasional glimpses of colour. The animations resemble paper cuts more than actual animations, which fits the tone of the game quite well.\n\nWhat really sets the mood though is the (english) narrator, a storyteller sitting by a campfire who invites you to listen to his tale. All narration and characters are voiced by him, making it very much resemble a radio play. His pronounciation is slow and accentuated, dragging one perfectly into the darkness of the tale, yet still capturing the optimism of the creature.\n\nThis is a perfect little tale for short days and long nights of winter. Just like its protagonist it seems small and insignificant at first, unfolding inwards to surprise again and again. As stars in the night sky looking small yet offering a light, this game may easily be overlooked.","November 26, 2014","true","9.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

It really caught my attention because of my Swedish nationality and that a lot of these creatures I heard about while growing up. It was very nice to see them implemented in a game that can give an audience outside of Scandinavia some new knowledge.\n\nThe puzzles can be tricky but I have to say fair. You have to explore a little and it is not that straight forward but once it clicks and you learn that you have to try combining and playing around with the runes you'll find that you'll have a much easier time.\n\nThe atmosphere is simply perfect. It is a little dark and moody but yet it has some sort of innocence and wonder to it that is just so hard to nail down.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/recommended/286320/","ddiesonne","NOOB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddiesonne/","1002 products in account","Playing Oknytt can be an enjoyable experience even when using a walkthrough guide right from the very start, as I did. Using such a guide might in fact be recommended, as it helped me avoid the frustration and the tediousness typical to this kind of point-and-click puzzle games. Since there were no more headaches caused by having to find certain items, discover specific combinations, and so on, I could fully focus on the enjoyable parts of the game: the art style, the stories, the exploration (and the discovery of new characters, stories, levels), etc.\n\nI'd say the gameplay isn't exactly Oknytt's strong point, but only unless you're not a fan of solving point-and-click challenges, as some of the item combinations are quite intuitive (unlike other similar games) and it's also got some gameplay originality in the addition of some "elemental runes".\n\nAnyway, I personally enjoyed everything else about this little game, not the gameplay.\n\nIts main theme is truly original, as it's inspired from the Swedish folklore. And not just barely, remotely inspired, but deeply rooted and connected to Swedish folklore, from the very start to the very ending.\n\nThe main story isn't very intricate but the many secondary characters that the main protagonist encounters during its journey are all interesting and unique. The ending was rather abrupt and quite ambiguous for my taste, but not bad enough to cause me any real disappointment.\n\nThe visuals aren't sophisticated, but they're charming. In a very dark tone at all times, the game feels immersive and captivating. The voice acting and the sounds are also top-notch. Even if there's one single voice actor for all characters, that guy is clearly hugely talented and does a great job.\n\nAs for the game's length and value for money, considering its low full price, Oknytt gets another plus in my book.\n\nPros:\n\n- strongly inspired from Swedish folklore, making it original and even a bit educational\n- nice visuals and art styles\n- top notch voice acting and sound effects\n- it's inexpensive, simple, lightweight, neat, and really enjoyable\n\nCons:\n\n- gameplay based on typical point-and-click elements. Without a guide, it may take a lot more hours to complete, not to mention the unavoidable frustration coming along the way.","March 12, 2015","true","6.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The tale told by the invisible narrator is about a small insignificant nameless creature born out of darkness on the darkest of nights much like that night.  This epic journey of self-awareness and discovery turns into a magic strewn and danger filled quest which takes place in a single night full of magic and spirits taken from Swedish forklore.\n\nGameplay: This point and click game is divided into five distinct chapters, two of which are subdivided.  Each chapter is its own unique adventure quest with a build and use inventory,  Inventory items carry over from chapter to chapter, and all items are eventually used and have a purpose, generally logical.  (I note this only because some items found in chapter one are not used until chapter five.)  Look around carefully in each scene for other areas (found at the edges of the screen) and for items and locations to examine.  Nothing is hidden but lack of careful examination makes it easy to miss things.\n\nThe "examine" button is LEFT-CLICK.  (Please read the tutorial for mouse functions.  The way the game plays is a bit different functionally but easy once the player gets used to it.)  On the examination triangle is LORE (a scroll), SPEECH (conversation bubble), and TAKE (a hand).  I suggest clicking on all three.  LORE for the folk history of the spirit or place encountered and eventually for achievement completion.  SPEECH for the story narration, told as only an excellent verbal storyteller can tell it.   TAKE to gather the item.   Some inventory items are added automatically while others are not.  Some inventory items can be combined together to create something new while others are given to the spirits and creatures encountered.\n\nThe game is mostly mono-chrome in color, with dark blues, deep violets and shiny white to off-set this dark night shrouded world.\n\nThere are four elemental magics: earth, water, fire, and wind that the insignificant creatures has control over.  These magics are essential to game play, and certain tasks can not be completed without using the correct magic(s).  I suggest using all the magics on every scene just to see what happens because generally something happens when each elemental magic is used the first time.  (Nice detail to the game play.)\n\nEach chapter (or sub-chapter in two cases) has its own set of tasks to complete and puzzles to solve.  The puzzles have no directions, and the clues to solving them must be sought out and inferred from environmental references or conservational text.  Most are head scratching brain twisters and CANNOT be skipped. (There is at least one excellent guide on Steam if the player gets stuck.)\n\nThere is no going back to previous areas once the game progresses, and there is little backtracking per se in each chapter.  Chapters three and five have sub-chapters.  Chapters one and five(part one) are set up in a circular fashion. Chapters two, three (part two) and four are back and forth travel along the central path which has branch paths off of it where tasks needed to be accomplished are.  Most tasks are logical and the player uses more or less what they think they need.  (Do not forget to combine inventory items.)\n\nIn the final analysis this is a story-rich narrated tale, and the game play takes a back seat to the tale being told.","November 16, 2015","true","11.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Said items are also often a bit too well hidden in the environment, something made worse by the mostly black and white graphics, or can be gathered through interacting with every single object in a scene, something that can get dull quickly. Last but not least some puzzles or items require you to use the four elemental runes at your disposal: sadly this also soon becomes a dull affair as you're basically forced to try each rune in every scene hoping for something to happen.\n\nAll things considered I feel the obtuse and somewhat badly designed puzzles are a bit too much for an adventure game to earn a recommendation as I think only seasoned fans of the genre will find the weird logic behind them easy enough to progress at a steady pace. Still, if you feel you can easily tackle hard puzzles or use a guide then you'll be able to properly enjoy its art and story, making it a decent purchase.","December 29, 2015","false","5.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","3"

But with a fairy tale vibe and dialgoues, creepiness is mitigated and thus not a horror game I assure you. Cute main character known as "the creature" and a small helpless fairy contrast all the dangerous environments and monsters they confront.\n- Decent voice acting.\n\nCONS:\n- Actually the narrator's voice can get on your nerves if heard too much, he voices all other characters in the game and the problem is that the transition between narrating and mimicking characters' speeches can often get confusing, abrupt, and not really well-done.  Later chapters there are slight popping sounds when some of the characters angrily grunt. Quality also goes does down here and there and the pace the way narrator speaks feels uncomfortable and he seems to have some difficulty with breath control.  The voice actor must have had a hard time recording all the dialogues as he is the only person who speaks in the game. This probably will remind you that the game is developed by a small group of folks after all.\n- Game pace; the creature's movement, animation, and pretty much everything is a bit too slow.\n- Relatively long loading and saving time for such a little game.\n\nFinal Remarks:\nThe game is a typical point-and-click adventure genre, but its uniqueness in terms of being artsy alone is a good enough reason to warrant a fun and worthy playthrough.\n\n.

Basic clicking UI is tediously slow and constantly blocks input while waiting the action to complete.\n\nThe idea of narrating the story maybe sounded nice at the development table but no: narrator got so irritating after nth time of "small creature this small creature that" that I almost uninstalled the game. This could have been fixed by substituting "small creature" with simple "it". Well whatever I wouldn't still wanted to listen the narrator. Sound design is good and bad at the same time. Usually there's nice ambient around but once I had to turn off all the sounds in ch4 while doing the turning stone puzzle because there was this constantly crying bird/animal at the background. This combined to infinitely slow UI and even more slowly animations with three tries at a row would've been an impossible task.\n\nThere's a game helper telling what could be the objective right now but it was still difficult to figure out what to do sometimes.

I also recently played Nightmares of the Deep: The Cursed Heart, and I think I prefer Nightmares more if I were to compare the too. It is difficult to weight the two fairly though, as Nightmares has more game mechanics like verying minigames and the skip/hunt function.\n\nOknytt is a darker art, not necessarily grim but moreso noir style (think Don't Starve atmosphere if you're familiar with that). You play a weird little creature with amnesia and have the power of the four elements in the form of stones. For example, in some scenes you can use the fire stone to make a burnt out fire pit come temporarily back to life. While most of the stones in each scene gives a purely aesthetic effect, some puzzles require the use of the stones.\n\nThere is no hint function (but there are two guides available that basically feed you 100% achievement for the game) and the puzzles are not necessarily challenging, however, many of them require you to backtrack and combine items in your inventory.\n\nThe music is decent and the visuals are appropriate for the atmosphere created by the game and storyline, however, I personally find the narrator to be a little annoying. When he narrates the main character, you can hear him switch into a child's voice and something about it annoys me (may not be as big of a deal for you).\n\nPrice-wise, I would say to spend the extra $ to pick up Nightmares if you're really into adventure point-and-clickers. This game is also not that long (5 chapters I believe), so I think grabbing it at a lower price would be most advisable.\n\nIt is a good game though, although some of the puzzle solutions may not be immediately obvious or intuitive.","July 6, 2014","true","2.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The puzzles are well-balanced as well; the game provides you with a good deal of exploring and thinking, searching and guessing, and if you have enough time and patience, you can do without a guide, although it's quite a challenge.\n\nWhat is special about this game is that it's based on Scandinavian folklore, and it'll make you to fall in love with the North, at least in the light of its popular mythology. It's especially close to me as there are a lot of parallels between Russian and Swedish folklore, so the Russian translation actually uses its own specific names for the creatures you meet, not the original ones. (I prefer to play in English, though.)\n\nThe game reminds me of Grimind: a somewhat scary story of some little undead creature searching for its place in the world with what it seems to me a bad ending. However, Grimind is a platform adventure game, so the gameplay differs.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend such a wonderful game, especially considering its price.

All of this, ultimately, is a campfire story, but a beautiful one at that.\nThe puzzles in this game, while not always intuitive, have a certain logic to them that makes sense.

Gameplay is quite standard to the point-and-click genre where you collect objects to interact with your surroundings and overcome puzzles. A nice addition though, is that you're equipped with four elemental runes (earth, water, air, fire) which activate and produce different outcomes depending on the scene. You can also interact with entities in a few different ways, such as touching, observing or talking to the person/object. Although not all interactions are entirely necessary, it can lead to some humerous/extra dialogue and is a nice feature nonetheless.\n\nEnvironments and sounds reinforce your sense of vulnerability and isolation as the little creature; things that keep you immersed in the story and invested in the wellbeing of your character. I believe these aspects are key in turning a standard point and click experience into something more, and Oknytt pulls it off well.\nNarrations are voice acted, delivered in a very... interesting mannerism that I haven't honestly heard before. The narrator also serves as the voice of the small creature, immitating what he might really sound like in all dialogue sequences. People have varied opinions, but I believe voice acting and sounds are some of Oknytt's fundamental strengths and a major part of what makes this game memorable, combined of course with an atmospheric beauty that is unique in its own right.\n\nIf I had to name an issue, it's that a few of the puzzles are a tad disconnected (hard to logically piece together) and your sense of direction can get confused at times. If, however, you take time to clear your head or use a walkthrough (I didn't, but maybe should have at those points), you can probably avoid these minor frustrations. I should stress that the majority of puzzles are fun to resolve, and you’ll enjoy the experience overall.\n\nThere's no time limit to the game, and thus the pacing is up to the player. I took my time to enjoy it and ended up with nine hours clocked, although even then the pleasure of the experience added value.\nOverall, it's worth the money. It's emotional, captivating, and you needn't know a thing about Swedish folklore to enjoy it.","October 20, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You interact with not only the enviroment and items but also have control of the four elements displayed as runes in the bottom. These have varying effects depending on the area and screen you are at and may be vital for making progress. Most interaction is done by clicking and holding the button, releasing it at the desired action: The hand to touch or pick up the target, the speech bubble to talk to it or the paper to have the Narrator talk about it in detail.\n\nThe story follows this small creature trying to help a small alva that has no wings. As things goes, they end up in various locations, and here is where the problem occurs: More than often will you be clicking everywhere and press the runes, trying to figure out how you are meant to progress. In most point and click games, it is often "more obvious and hintful" with say highlights or strong hints in character speech.\n\nBut does that mean this game is bad? It makes it challenging. Although it may not be too fun being too much of a guessing game.\n\nThe visuals of this game is gloomy, but fitting for this setup. The alvas sure stand out with their glow and the white beady eyes most of the monsters have give you that 'staring' feeling.\n\nThe voice acting is satisfying to listen to; it is done quite nicely. The narrator sounds like someone wise yet someone you 'know'. Not some stranger telling you a tale. The small creature has an adorable personality, looking to make friends and help others as it wants to find its purpose and place in the world. Everything else from the hustomte and trolls and other folklorish monsters sound fitting.\n\nIt's worth the investment, despite it being a cryptic cluefest.\nA hidden legend of zelda reference is thrown in too.\n\n\nBut beware the ending.","May 6, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I will update later if things change.\n\nSo far, I am not impressed. I play a lot of adventure games, and this one falls pretty low on my list. I like the story, and I will play through the whole game to see the story line completed, but it seems that in just about every aspect of this game the deveolpers took the easy way out.\n\nThe most obvious easy path they took is that there doesn't seem to be a single object interaction animation. Instead your character just stands there stupidly, the narator says what you did, and the newly altered object appears in your inventory. How lazy.\n\nThe game seems to have a single voice actor, which might add to the "reading a story" aspect of the plot, but comes of as cheap and ruins my immersion. His voice is fine as the narrator, but when he tries to do other characters, it's always the same, cheesy falseto.\n\nMost frustratingly, tasks were not logical and did not give enough prompting. "I need tools" was the prompting for one task but despite having multiple things that pass for tools in my inventory, I made no progress. Finally through trial and error, I realised that he needed something else (no spoilers) not a tool at all!\n\nIn fact nearly half of the progress I made on this chapter was simple trial and error - just click every clickable point with every item from my inventory. No fun at all.\n\nThis was made worse by the fact that there is no "reveal hot spot" button for when you get stuck, so I had to resort to a walkthrough at one point just to learn that there was a hot spot that I didn't know existed.\n\nBut I think the worse part, and the most lazy choice on the part of the developers is that if you use the wrong item with anything, you get the same exact message every time "No that's not how it happened." This tells you nothing about how to proceed. How about "No I think I need something sharper for this job" or literally anything to point you in the right direction. So without that, when you get stuck, trial and error of every single item is your only option - expect no assistance.\n\nSo disappointing from a game with such a good storyline.","January 11","false","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's a lovely, charming, and well-written story, inspired by Swedish folklore. You play as a small, insignificant creature, that meets many strange, magical and creepy beings during a very dark and special night. A warm narrator's voice will guide you through the complicated world of Swedish bestiary.\n\nThe small insignificant creature is very small and very insignificant indeed. It can't run, can't jump, can't fight, doesn't have claws or fangs, or amazing powers. But somehow, in the large scheme of things, the small insignificant creature turns out quite significant.\n\nIt's a short game, took me about 4 hours, I suppose you could do it within 3-5 hours, depending on how many times you get stuck. It's a typical point and click game, with a few puzzles, mostly quite logical and simple. Once in a while you have to use the classic "use everything on everything" move, when the tips are unclear, but in general, using your brain will get you through it. The interesting thing is the "elements" mechanic, where you can use an elemental power to see how it will affect your environment. You might summon an insect to sit on someone's head, rekindle a fireplace, or start rain. You never know until you try.\n\nWhat is extremely outstanding is the artstyle. The story is very sweet, almost like a children's book, with a little innocent creature travelling an unknown world and helping others solve their problems. There's simple morals and a simple lesson to be learnt - even the most insignificant ones, can change a lot. The voice of the creature is just cute, and adorable.. like a children's story character's should be... And then you see the artstyle. It's dark. It's extremely dark, to the point of being malevolent. Most of the Swedish folklore creatures you meet look creepy, strange or even dangerous and scary. It's mostly black and white, with disturbing shiny eyes, and unsettling half-human faces. Each new room you explore is a whole new study on creepiness and hidden fears. It gave me chills a couple of times, and hypnotized me completely.\n\nThe sounds are very delicate, almost unnoticeable, but playing in with the dark, creepy artstyle perfectly.\n\nAs a whole it's a sweet children's story, with a terrifying almost horror-like environment. If you like sweet things, and creepy things alike - like I do, you will enjoy "Oknytt" in all of its splendor.","November 20, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No fault of the developers, merely my fault for not doing my research.\n\nThis game is a point-and-click adventure set in a Norse / Swedish folklore-based setting.  As far as mechanics go there are no failstates, and a small level of pixelhunting.  Some of the puzzles felt a little difficult in riddle and could not be easily brute forced, leading to some frustration.  The game's interface worked well enough, and I didnt encounter any bugs, and ran without much problem on my rig (2.8ghz *6 / HD6850 / 8gb).\n\nThe game's setting is fairly well done, with all environments being presented in a way that nicely emphasizes the night-themed setting.  There is voice acting, but only by a narrator who reads all script and dialogue himself.  This unfortunately means that if you don't like his voice you're kinda stuck for the whole game, and I didn't find myself liking his voice for the main character creature that much.  Because the story is read as a script, you also have to deal with a lot of '...the (NAME) said' and 'the (NAME) (VERB)ed' being read to you, as these actions aren't depicted on screeen due to the drawn-image style of the game.  This kind of draws the scenes out a lot since I read much faster than the narrator speaks, so I often ended up listening to a line or two of character dialogue read before skipping the rest for the next dialogue box.\n\nThe story is sort of adventurous and ultimately not very weighty or cohesive but that also sort of fits into the lore of the game.  A lot of the characters aren't really drawn in an aesthetic I like but that comes with the setting too I suppose.\n\nOverall neither banal nor a masterpiece, about 5 hour length and I didn't feel like my time went to wasted.  If you like point and clicks and interesting settings its certainly worth a go.","July 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The narrator has a nice range of voices he can do and switches between them in quite a charming way.\nI'd pay good money to have the narrator follow me around for a day and comment on everything I do.\n\nDon't try and rush Oknytt, it can be a bit slow-paced at times, just go with it and enjoy the narration.\n\nThe game mechanics are easy to understand. There are items of interest on every screen, when you move your mouse around you'll get a pop-up with a name (shovel, lake, sky, etc), so you know it's something you can interact with.\n\nYou interact with objects/characters by holding down the left-mouse button to get a pop-up menu with three options:\nLore - The narrator has some extra information about the object.\nTalk - The creature you are playing either says something about the object/character or actually starts a conversation.\nTake - You try and take the object.\n\nBasically you just use all three options on everything and everyone. If that doesn't do enough, at the bottom of the screen there are 4 rune stones (Earth, Water, Fire, Air). Clicking on those can make something happen, it all depends on the surroundings you are in. Don't forget to click on all 4 on every screen.\n\nMy progress is to get Lore, then Talk, then try and take something. Click on all 4 runes, if something happens, Lore/Talk/Take again and move to the next screen. Get an additional item? Try and combine it with EVERYTHING in your inventory, doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense at the time.\n\nOn the top left of the screen is a scroll icon, clicking it reveals the objectives that you still have to do for this particular chapter so you don't get completely lost.\n\nAt the top right is your inventory with items you can combine, give to others, or use on objects in the environment. Some puzzles and items you need to combine are a bit far-fetched. I would recommend using a walkthrough when you think you've tried everything. There is no hint system that gradually helps you along and there's no point in annoying yourself. Using a walkthrough at certain times keeps the game fun instead of becoming a bore.\n\nWhen you are not sure what items to combine, or what item to give to a creature and you are just guessing you will hear: "Hmm, No. No, that's not how it happened."\nBe prepared to hear that a lot.","June 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashpotato/recommended/286320/","mashpotato","MashPotato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashpotato/","407 products in account","Oknytt is a lovely point-and-click adventure game in which you play a small creature trying to fine help for his friend, a wingless alva (a fairly-like being). Along the way, the two of you encounter many creatures from Swedish folklore, ranging from the dark and dangerous to the gentle and friendly.\n\nI love fairytales and folklore, and I have to say this game really nailed the feeling of being told a story. Much credit for this goes to the writing and the voicework done by the narrator, but is also due to smaller details in the game design.  For example, instead of the standard adventure response "that won't work" when you try something, the narrator says "no, that's not what happened."  It's a story, and if you try something that makes sense and it doesn't work, it's not that you're wrong, it's simply not what happened.  On the other hand, the game does use fairy tale logic in its puzzle design. To explain: while the puzzles themselves make sense, the reason *why* you're doing them are not always clear.  Like a hero in a fairy tale, just help out the creatures and rest assured that you will be helped out in turn, or at least advance the story.\n\nGameplay is adventure-standard, with cursors to examine, interact, and speak.  Interestingly, if the object cannot be spoken to, the player character instead makes a comment about the object from its point of view, while the examine acts more as an objective description. In addition to the standard controls are runes at the bottom of the screen, which cause the environment to change in some way.  Note that the character does not change the environment with the runes, but rather you're changing the setting around the character.  Both of these design choices add to the feeling of storytelling.\n\nSome miscellany: The art is a little sketchy in places, but it does capture the feeling of old paintings one might find in a book. It's a bit on the dark side, but play in a darkish room (which is fitting anyway) and you'll be alright.  The narrator was great, and changed his voice for the different characters (as all good storytellers should!). The player walks incredibly slowly, but make use of double-clicking to travel between areas and this becomes only a minor quibble.  The game took me about 6 hours to complete, so it's not very long, but not short either.\n\nParents: the game is appropriate for older children (minimal violence, no bad language), but just be aware that some of the creatures from folklore sometimes have darkish characteristics (eg. leading travellers astray, etc.) and some have visual designs that may be frightening to some children.\n\nIf you've read this far, you should know by now whether this game is for you.  I hope it is!","April 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sometimes, it deposits little droplets of genuinely eerie instances that the game presents as pedestrian, but will creep you the hell out. Always set against an oppressive backdrop of sheer gloom, distorted faces with blank white pupils will appear at holes in the wall before chatting to you cheerfully. Farm a few items from a nearby scarecrow and its solitary eye will light up and watch you intensely as you harvest straw from the gaping wound you created in its head...  Okyntt’s not tainted by cliché jump scares, by pop-culture nuances or by a development team trying too hard; it’s a casual application of the darker side of Swedish folklore simply allowed to exits on its own merits. I’m just not convinced it’s really a very good adventure game.\n\nThere are moments in Okyntt that make sense - or, at least, that special kind of sense inventory puzzles start to make after a while. A grumpy household deity lives beneath the creaky floorboards of a farmhouse, ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how someone stole his hat and how he’s hungry. So you make him something to eat and you plop something on his head. The guardian of the farmyard complains how the disrepair of his tools is setting him back – so you find some way to improve his tools. The means are purposefully blurred, but when you have a clear objective in sight, you know you’re working towards something specific. Too many times in Okyntt, you’re going through the motions in the hope that things will start making sense by the end.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12254/pc/okyntt/review.html","April 16, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Along the way you'll run into a wingless alva and you make the promise to help her find her wings. The game plays out like a simple point and click adventure set through five chapters. In each chapter you are given a set list of objectives to complete in order to continue on to the next. With its beautiful animations and wonderful characters the world changes depending on what task you complete, for example in one chapter areas became closed off as i was being surrounded by toadstools. Also on the bottom are four runes which control the four basic elements, these can sometimes provide simple animation fun or be very critical in moving on to the next chapter. The story is well written and although the ending is a little sad at the ame time its a happy ending. Overall Oknytt is definetly one of the best point and click adventure I've played so far.

Voice-acting and graphic are also way over the quality you could possibly expect at Oknytts current price.","April 8, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These environmental interactions, that can be toggled by the user, are based upon the elements of fire, wind, water, and earth. The music is outstanding as is the fitting art style for the game.

This was supposedly a decent adventure, sure, but hardly could I expect it to be any different from most titles in the genre. Boy, was i wrong.\n\nWhereas the game mechanics are the same as pretty much every other title in the  bunch, what really sets this out of the crowd is the setting: Swedish folklore is undoubtably something you don't come across much in games, or even everyday life, and I did enjoy learning a bit abouth its myths and lore, which the game seems to send you in endless waves of small curiosities and oddities you'll quite easily find yourself looking up either on the internet or the game's library.\n\nSome puzzles are a little bit more complicated than others, but you'll rarely find anything that can escape a reasonable amount of thinking (sometimes linear, sometimes lateral) and the average playtime is well in the average. The story itself begins very slowly, and might sound and look rather dull, but give it a few minutes and the tune will change completely.\n\nThe narrator's voice is simply superb, and really adds that little "something" to both immersiveness and charm taht would have you go: "Yeah, you just gotta check this out", as it will lead you hand in hand with this tiny, pathethic little creature, with the warmest, tenderest heart you will encounter in a long while. I won't lie: I shed many a tear as the small creature progressed in its travel towards the ending of the game, and when the game did end... It did leave something behind. I wouldn't go as far as to compare this game to masterpieces of its genre, but it was certaintly an enjoyable, touching and tought provoking gameplay experience.\n\nSumming it up:\n\nGreat story, excellent and immersive narration, peerless voice acting.\nImmersive, interesting and unusual setting.\nTough, but not frustrating.\nA main character you will likely learn to love, over the course of the adventure.\nSolid, albeit a bit outdated, gameplay mechanics.\nIf I were to give this game a mark, it'd be a solid 7.5/10, leaning heavily towards an 8.","September 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys these games on a more casual level. Best of all, there's no way to fail, so no matter how frustrated you get, you know that you'll never have to reload or start over.\n\nThe haunting melodies and art really pack quite a punch, the story is simple but captivating and a bit sad, the elder little creatures who populate the world all have their own selfish personalities, and the unique mechanic of being able to manipulate the elements in each room. Amazingly, everyone is voice acted by one dude, yet they're all easy to tell apart, and everything is narrated. The many item puzzles are certainly challenging, but contained in small areas, so thankfully no sprawling worlds to backtrack through; the few logic puzzles are fairly simple.\n\nThat said, some problems are pretty glaring. The dull color scheme and busy backgrounds really leads to difficulty finding usable objects, so most screens become a game of mouse hunting, while many puzzles (especially early on) make very little logical sense, and can often only be solved by trial and error. Later in the game, they start to make more sense, and the journal gives more hints, too. I only touched a walkthrough once or twice in the second half.\n\nThe voice actor was wonderful for the various characters, but so dull and overly slow for narration. I honestly would have enjoyed the voice acting more if the narration parts of conversations had been skipped, or better yet animated. Lastly, the creature is just so plodding! It's frustrating walking from place to place trying hunches when he barely moves in the first place.\n\nI'd gladly play again for the atmosphere. The devs truly achieved something unique in this little gem, and I'm glad I experienced it.","May 5, 2014","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The "small creature" that you play throughout the game magically comes to life under a tomb in the beginning, then turns into a stone with the dawn.

The creature seems so lost, and so insignificant.\n\nIt's like reliving in one of your childhood's bedtime stories. Definately worth a playthrough.","February 6, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most can be solved with mild brute force. But there are also some of these "move all plates to the correct position" puzzles which are a bit annoying: you only get vague hints about the solutions and there is no easy way to try out your ideas since it always comes with some kind of sliding puzzle mechanism. Especially the last puzzle came as an uncanny combination of vagueness, obscure symbols and sliding puzzle mechanism. Well, that's what walkthroughs are there for. ;)\n- While the narrator did a great job overall, some of the voices he imitates make you cringe.\n\nAs a hint: if you want to interact with an object you have to keep the left mouse button pressed down. For some reason I had difficulties to figure that out.","February 21","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Out of the gate you can tell it is a dark folklore puzzle adventure game.  Too me, it had a Dark Crystal meets Neverending Story blended feel tied to Swedish tales.  If any of that sounds appealing to you, I would say its worth picking up and giving it a play.\n\nTypical puzzle and adventure game play.  Although I found some things to be fairly abstract to perform and looking for a guide to overcome some hurdles.  Not too much of a ramp up into the 'challenges' and stays pretty flat all the way through the game.\n\nPros\n+ Enjoyable story\n+ Artwork is unique and beautiful\n+ Has a "keep playing to finish the story" appeal (hard to find these day)\n+ Fairly inexpensive\n+ Easy steam achievments\n+ Challenging enough without being frustrating\n\nCons\n+ No real connection with characters (the story is nice but nothing jumps out as memorable)\n+ Realatively short gameplay\n+ Lacks a ramp up (do not need to be hand held, but starting game play is like fumbling around in the dark)\n+ Absolutely no replay value\n+ Constant wonder if you are missing something\n+ Click, fail, trial and error continuously\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy adventure-puzzlers and folklore tales then get it on a good sale.  Play it through for the fun story and don't give it a second thought.\n\nIf you need a sense of accomplishment or a completed story will not satisfy you, then I'd recommend moving on.","February 22","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It comes up practically every interaction with a new character. You get a couple of moments of dialog that make you think some beings know more than they're telling and you keep waiting for a payoff - that never comes. Why did the creature crawl out of a grave mound? Who is it? What is it? I got invested in finding out and to have that never come... I get it's not integral to the ending but it felt like it was going to be and felt like it should've been.","January 29","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely a recommended game if you're looking for an adventure-game to pass the time and don't mind the black-and-white.","June 4","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
