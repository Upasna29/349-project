"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098243009/recommended/426690/","76561198098243009","Firehawk","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098243009/","71 products in account","Many years have passed since the first games of the renowned Narcissu series first became known among the fans of the visual novel, and within there the kinetic game genre, quickly establishing itself as one of the better known and well received doujin releases in Western communities. Shortly thereafter, the second one came out which was also freely available to those who were so inclined and wanted to read it, leaving many a fan waiting with bated breath if others will also be offered later on, as were its predecessors. As it turned out it wasn't the last, but sadly it came at a great price.\n\nThe first sign stems from the simple yet powerful fact that despite the title which is at least in name supposed to be the anthology of all Narcissu releases, its producer only included the already free first two games in its core edition, and a never before heard extra chapter. This is because unlike with a real collection of stories, the chapters are split up instead this time on the pretext that people interested in them can choose only which they want to read and pay for only that. It's a little difficult to accept however as it's little more than a thinly disguised attempt at milking a fairly famous game for all it's worth, asking significantly more money for the entire set than actually great visual novels like eden* or planetarian are being sold for. Which gets even more pronounced on the Kickstarter page where the publishers set tiers for those investing in their funding project, requesting insane amounts of money for anything more than a digital copy, which is like a store offering the covers of a book at a modest price then charging ten times more for the pages themselves. In that regard, its publisher is nothing like a proper company which handles visual novels, especially considering the fact that they mostly release already existing ones when they can like they did with Grisaia, and all the other games they have are abysmally low in quality, especially the Sakura series. This alone should be enough of a reason to steer clear of the game presented here.\n\nEven if it wasn't though, there are still plenty not to support a nonexistant anthology, one of the biggest being that the third entry of the series, Die Dritte Welt is not mentioned anywhere on the store page nor on other sites. That leaves the direct sequel to the first games out, replacing it with completely unrelated chapters that try to extend the series in the wrong direction, but contrary to what was expected only destroy what made it so unusual at first by doing so. Not completely unlike how EA killed Westwood and with it ruined the Command and Conquer universe, and arguing that the new content isn't bad in itself unfortunately doesn't counterweigh the damage done to the original games. A shame since if it wasn't for present edition being a collection, there would be much less flaws to find.\n\nSekai Project also flagged this review for no reason but it being critical of the product they made, while I received several verbally abusing comments from Kickstarter supporters that could get one permabanned due to how disgusting they were. I care not for mindless fanboys however as I will ignore all downvotes from them if they can't even try or just don't want to make decent arguments about why there's a disagreement.\n\nTherefore, if you truly appreciate visual novels, then look for quality games from good publishers while read the combined game of Narcissu 1 and 2 if you are still interested in reading them since it's free and has the soundtrack in store if you want to buy it. Avoid this release. Don't buy.","February 4","false","0.3"," 181 of 237 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","181","237","9","23"

If you enjoyed the first two games, then you should definitely get this for the story - it's short (maybe not even an hour long) but gives you that final sense of completion. This version includes some new art: unlike the original two games, the art is detailed, depicts the characters often, and fills more of the screen. It also includes art that is similar to the original games. The new art is well done, but nothing special.\n\nThis also includes 1980, a short story by the author of the Narcissu stories. It's quite short and has the same general theme as Narcissu 1st. If you're a big fan of the series, you'll appreciate it, but it's nothing special on its own, in my opinion.","January 27","true","0.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

As such, it is strongly recommended that you finish Narcissu 2 before starting Himeko’s Epilogue. The epilogue is short as you may expect, with about 1 hour of reading, and it takes Himeko’s story from Narcissu 2 to the very end. That’s not to say that the ending in Narcissu 2 is unfinished. The ending of Narcissu 2 satisfactorily closes the story of Himeko and Setsumi, so reading Himeko’s Epilogue is not strictly necessary to understanding the story.\n\nHimeko’s Epilogue focuses on the friendship between Himeko and Yuka. Without spoiling any events, you could say that Himeko’s Epilogue is a story about two friends supporting each other to get through the difficulties they are facing. Yuka is a minor character in Narcissu 2, and her character develops a little in the short amount of time covered in Himeko’s Epilogue.\n\nThere are two options for going through Himeko’s Epilogue – Normal and Classic Mode. The only difference between the two modes is the artwork used for the background. The artwork in Normal will show character’s faces, whereas Classic will not, and the artwork in Normal is larger.\n\nA note on play order for people who have not read Narcissu 1 and 2\nThe chronological order of the stories is: Narcissu 2 -> Himeko’s Epilogue -> Narcissu 1\n\nSetsumi is a main character in Narcissu 2, and Narcissu 2 is a prequel to her story in Narcissu 1. Narcissu 2 explains some of the actions that Setsumi takes in Narcissu 1, so if you can’t stand seeing characters doing things for seemingly unexplainable reasons then you may like to read Narcissu 1 last. Otherwise, you can read Narcissu 2 after Narcissu 1 and have several moments of “Ah, so that’s why!”","January 27","true","2.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

Here's a review from me of what I've learnt. Hours are still ticking.\n\nLearning to let go of certain things which are not so important while holding on to other things that are dear is truly hard. Whether parts of memories come from the past, present or future, it will all be cherished. Things are leaving one by one.\n\nThere's a low possibility that one can actually let go of these emotional memories in days or weeks. It is just simply too hard.\n\nDear friends, if anyone whom you know is gone forever on a fine day, do help by telling their new selves in the future that they did not have any regrets back then and did whatever they could previously to keep themselves alive.\n\nThank you.\nI'm truly sorry.\n\nYours Faithfully,\nMe.\n\n*Yuka's still babe.

The story, even when you think you know how it goes, will told you exactly what you are expecting and breaks the latter expectation, which makes the story better not to expect anything, which makes you get more experience of the characters. The soundtrack is great as always in the both editions. Art is improved to works better on bigger screen.

We also get to see a more difficult, amusing, and powerful side to Himeko showing that she still has the strength to defend her friend and give her friend courage no matter how bad her health is.

The new chapter is absolutely worth it!

Narcissu 1 & 2 are aviable for free on steam, so if you are interessted in this one, just try them out and you will know if this is something for you.\n\nThe new chapter takes place near the end of Narcissu 2 and is shorter than the previous main storys. The Quality of this piece is just as high as the older parts. Nice drawings (but rare as always), atmospheric music and more than ever a really good and very sad story. It blends in perfectly, you wont notice a difference in storytelling to the other parts. There are some moments where the story will slap you in the face (in a "good" way). Even after, I dont know, several weeks or even months I get tingles down my spine if I think back at the story.\n\nSo as I said, if you liked the previous titles, you will like this as well.
