See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:An old game (by the time I wrote this review) but a great game nonetheless.\n\nAs you might know, this is a Star Wars game based on the Clone Wars era where you are the leader of an elite Clone Commando Unit tasked with some of the most dangerous and most critical missions in service of the Galactic Republic.\n\nPROS:+ Story: -Amazing story that places you not in the eyes of a skillful Jedi or a powerful Sith, but in the boots of Clone Troopers fighting the war. The game delivers in terms of story with its superior voice acting by Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett) as well and the various personalities of your squad mates really adds to the experience.\n\n+ Squad Mechanics: -You cannot Rambo (go solo) this game, mainly because the squad is mandatory, BUT also because the game is brutal as hell (like most old FPS games). Enemies are really hard to kill without your squad's support requiring the players to properly order their squads into position and direct their fire when necessary.\n\n+ Graphically pleasing despite its age: -Released on 2005, this game carries a dated visual design, but pleasing nonetheless. Animation is good and the atmosphere is immersive. (I simply love the HUD in this game)\n\n+ Sound: -One of the greatest OST I have ever heard. (Vode An is the greatest of these OST)\n\n+ Gameplay: -Lengthy campaign without getting boring: There is always action around the corner.\n\nCONS:- Squad AI is a bit limited: -Although the AI, for the most part, is intelligent and is far more useful than some of the other AI partners in modern games, I feel as though a bit more could have been done. They follow command well enough.\n\n- Bugged Graphic setting in terms of Bump Mapping: -Remained unfix to this day. (can be turned off in the options menu though)\n\nAdditional Note:The game is linear (corridor shooting), from start to finish. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING PEOPLE. Not all games need to be open world, specially if the game, such as this one, is trying to properly tell the story in a progressive fashion giving the player a sense of direction and purpose.\n\nCONCLUSION:MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or First Person Shooter fans.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/6000/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","People often complain about the stone-faced, bald and monotomous space marines in videogames; how they're an extremely overused template and stifle the development of round characters. Republic Commando puts an interesting spin on this complaint: It gives you four clones; four space marines. That's where the complaining ends.\n\nRepublic Commando is a squad based shooter set in the Star Wars universe during the Clone Wars. You play Delta 38 "Boss", leader of a highly specialised and extremely elite squad of Clones. You're bred with a great affinity for your clone bretheren. Your squad is as much a part of your arsenal as your special rifles and armour. Repulic Commando translates this premise to gameplay in an absolutely incredible way. You can 'direct' your squad to perform tasks while you hold off the enemy. Or you can work on the objective while you let them hold the line. The surprise in this comes from their intelligence. More often than not, CPU allies are less than helpful. Not the Clone Commandos; they are in a league of their own. They take, and move through cover, hide when the odds are against them, secure the area before helping you instead of running in headlong, and their aim is about as good as your own, so they don't feel considerably overpowered. What also helps is a careful balance of enemies. There are just enough in each room to keep it interesting, but never too many to make it feel like a grindfest.\n\nYour three squadmates (and yourself) are the bread and butter of the game's presentation. 2005 graphics haven't aged so dignified, but the artstyle gets the job done. Everything looks slightly grittier and messier than it does in the films. You'll quickly determine this when you use the melee button a droid for the first time and the grease and battery acid are wiped off your visor with a laser. The helmet display resembles that of Metroid Prime a lot, complete with ambient effects and splatter. But, enough about the visuals, the real fun is in the sound. You, and your brothers engage in a lot comic banter to keep spirits up. You, the boss are the tough as nails leader, voiced by Mr Jango Fett himself. Delta 62 "Scorch" is the squad's demolitions expert and all-round joker. Delta 40 "Fixer" is the straight man and computer specialist. And finally, Delta 07 "Sev", the sniper and gruesome sadist. The dialogue exchange is worth its weight in gold and because the game's pace is tight and condenced, they don't end up looping up. It gives the whole endeavor a lively character that is a nice offset to the gritty visuals.\n\nStill, there are some things you'll have to consider. The game isn't very long; you can tear through it an afternoon. Replaying it wastes some of the surprise moments, but you'll be better at some of the positioning and directions, allowing you to focus on speedrunning for instance. Some gauntlets can also feel extremely cheap at first. Sometimes you'll end up reloading a particular section over and over again because you squad gets wiped within the first 10 seconds. And then there is the ending off course. I'll let you figure that out on your own. I can reccommend this game to anyone who is a Star Wars fan, and to anyone looking for a shooter with exemplary squad AI and gameplay.","February 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 466 of 475 people (98%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","98","466","475","26","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urisx/recommended/6000/","Urisx","Urisx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urisx/","141 products in account","In this game, you play as Commando Delta 38 (Boss/Leader).\nThe game follows the story of three missions throughout Delta Squad's career in the Separatist Crisis.\nFrom fighting alongside wookies to getting your face drilled by a scavenger droid, you lead your squad to complete objectives your normal, mass produced, counterparts could/cannot.\n\nThe game and story is nice, I loved it and maybe you will too. This is from the soldier's perspective as to the usual jedi perspective. The game plays pretty damn smooth on PC. I haven't had any real game-breaking problems. The game is old enough to even play on lower-end laptops. You get to actually order your squad to do things (ex.When you issue the Search and Destroy order, they become aggressive and move ahead even if you're looking around, You can order them to set demolition charges on objectives to progress or you could order them to secure the area and plant the demolition charge yourself. You can even send them to sniper/anti-armor positions as well as turrets.)\n\nIf you lose all your health, you get downed and the game doesn't end until your entire squad is downed. So while you're downed you could either tell them to maintain current orders (ex. search and destroy) or order the closest squad member to revive you. There's also the option to load the last save while you're downed. There's also quicksaves, I hotkeyed mine to F1 and F3 because I can screw things up a lot.\n\nI don't think you can really get through this game without ordering your squad around. You take quite a bit of damage, even on medium difficulty. Just for future reference, don't run infront of your squad while they're firing a sniper or a anti-armor grenade. Bad things happen. . .\n\nAll in all this game was great for it's time and pretty short if you know what you're doing. I just REALLY wish there was a sequal just because of the ending. . .","October 1, 2014","true","26.1"," 384 of 391 people (98%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","98","384","391","21","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975586621/recommended/6000/","76561197975586621","Sadness And Failure","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975586621/","213 products in account","The moment you boot up Republic Commando is the moment your realize this isn't your usual Star Wars games.\n\nPresented in a darker, militaristic tone, you're placed in the shoes of Boss, a freshly manufactured clone, whose the leader of a commando squad of four. The opening epitomizes the message of the game, that you're a soldier and you have to rely on your squad-mates- as a side-note, look up during the short scene on Kimino, that's the attention to detail this game has. The art-style is harsher and the droids have an threating growl to their voices (♥♥♥♥ those whiny voices Lucas went with). It certainly feels unique since it uses its own soundtrack instead of constantly using John Williams pieces as a crutch. Stylistically, the game is beautiful, with a absolutely rocking soundtrack that knows when to throw in those vocals and drum-beats. Graphically, it's a 2005 game and console port, at 60 fps and proper lighting it's better than the original xbox version for sure. However, I believe it's the art-style instead of the textures that carries the visual direction.\n\nThe actual gameplay harkens back to Rainbow Six with how you use your AI partners to clear levels and focus fire. Some of my favorite aspects of the game are the fact that you can 'prep' for battle. You can order a sniper to sit back or have one of your guys bombard the enemy from grenadier nest. Now you can only do this through context sensitive actions, but it's more a feature of the level design that rewards player thought than a "you can only proceed after using a laser-designated airstrike on these helpless sand people".\n\nThe AI is very compentent too. They will require revival, but that's only on the hardest sections of the game. I never felt like they were idiotic, and actually they keep up with you extremely well. It's no F.E.A.R, but for a squad-based shooter, the AI never failed me on the several play-throughs I've had both past and present.\n\nAugmenting this squad is your own weaponry. The standard blaster is honestly a peashooter to me, but you get a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun in a Star-wars game, and it is god-damn awesome. The standard blaster can be switched to both a sniper rifle and an anti-tank grenade launcher, allowing to have a total of four weapons (one weapon you can pick up from an enemy soldier) with three types of grenades. You also have a blade-fist, and like Halo, your melee attack is brutal and effective in close-combat. In total, you have a solution for every problem and ammo is given often enough to use all your tools while given sparingly enough to not go willy-nilly with sniper and rpg shots.\n\nThis game has become one of my favorite Star Wars games mostly because of the characters and story. Your three squad-mates have plenty of memorable quips and though they were stereotypical in their personalities, they give that Star Wars flair that prevents the game from being a super grim-dark slog. I'd never consider them annoying and by the end of the game you really detect how the characters have become more brothers than comrades-at-arms.  Story-wise you get some background information on some of the Clone-war plot-lines from the Prequels. However you never have a moment where it overly masturbates over the prequels' storylines or characters, it plays it straight and the only time you ever see a truly iconic character from Star Wars is once. RC is it's own game and story inside the Star Wars universe and I really admire that. It doesn't need Han Solo or Luke Skywalker to be a Star Wars game. And the aforementioned moment actually comes as a real reward to an honestly disappointing ending. A pat on the back for working through the difficult sections of RC.\n\nHowever I have my misgivings with RC. For one it's short. Not any shorter than an average FPS campaign of today, but at the time it was a very short game. There are only a handful of worlds to go to. Although the finales end with a bang (the Republic Ghostship's final mission has the most badass ending setpiece I've ever seen in a Star Wars game), they aren't extremely varied. You're going to be inside military compounds with only a few examples having open level design (these often have squad-points where you can assign snipers and grenadiers). There will be a few stretches where you have to go down a narrow corridor. Fighting waves of enemies. Ho-humming your way along. It'd be an injustice if I didn't emphasis a 'few' though. Most often the game gives you options and some cool set-piece battles to command through.\n\nThe game can also be back-breakingly hard at points. I like this, but sometimes you'll get super-bullet spongy enemies (the reason why the main blaster feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥) back to back. The super-battle droids are the worst offenders. We're talking fighting up to six of those ♥♥♥♥ers at once, in a bare-knuckled shoot-out. On harder difficulties, this can make the game undeniably frustrating. Which turns those glorious finales into a sweat-inducing curse-ridden rant.\n\nAlso no sequel. When you finish this game, you will agree that it ends at the worst moment. It doesn't feel unfinished due to just how badass the ending finale is. I mean there's a stretch that basically deconstructs the entire premise of the game and makes you realize just how important your squad is. But story-wise, you'll have to read a book to ever see the end of the Republic Commando series. And honestly, the book was 'meh' like most video game books.\n\nThe squad gameplay can be a bit disappointing at times. It's more arcadey than realistic, and sometimes the squadmates are there to just hide how bullet-spongy the enemies are. I'd have liked to be able to always have a guy with his sniper-rifle out rather than them having to setup. I'd also have liked to have the squad mates use grenades more often or engage in melee instead of using those aforementioned blasters. Asking them to switch to shotguns would've been the best damn thing too.\n\nBut every complaint I have with the game ends with a 'however'. The squad gameplay can be meh, however the way the game uses the squad adds extreme weight to the narrative and tone. The story is abrupt, however it has so many moments in the game that have struck with me for a damn decade. The levels aren't varied, however they really give that "behind enemy lines blowing up their ♥♥♥♥" feeling.\n\nFor $10.00, you get a game that I would mention in the same breath as KotOR 1&2 and Jedi Outcast. It's not just a great Star Wars game, it's a game I would recommend to people that know nothing about the universe. It's a game I would play even if I wasn't in the mood for a Star Wars fix. This was a work of passion for the devs, who used Star Wars as a vehicle to tell a story of cooperation and brotherhood more through the gameplay than cutscenes.\n\nEDIT: Some things I forgot to mentioned or worded poorly. For one the AI of the squadmates is competent, but the enemy droids are as dumb as they are in the Prequels. Only the Super Battle Droid or Droideka pose any threat due to their bullet-spongey nature and their constantly attacking AI pattern. An enemy force you encounter later mixes things up, but their use of cover is only so effective and they do have a habit of mixing effective tactics with standing in the open.\n\nAs a whole though, the enemy variety is noteworthy. Each major faction in the Clone Wars (as were present up to episode III) is represented and has units that are both cannon fodder and those that require squad focus fire. The enemy forces are gradually changed out and each world introducing a new faction that is better than the one before. Better armored, armed, and tactical. You'll never meet a force that can truly match your Commandos, but the array or melee and ranged enemies is remarkable for such a short game.\n\nAlso, there is multiplayer in RC. Do I play it? Well, once or twice. It's a deathmatch arena game in the style of older shooters. Make of that what you will.","May 2, 2014","true","10.8"," 344 of 349 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","344","349","0","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/6000/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","Tl'dr version:\nOne of the best Star Wars games out there. To this day, an underrated and often overlooked part of the evolution of squad based shooters; also included is a fantastic soundtrack.\nGreat, (for the most part) A.I, and likeable squad mates make this short, but engaging ride all the sweeter\n\n\nElaborated version:\nI often find that people have a tendency to harp on about SW: Battlefront and KOTOR a little bit too much. They were great games, (especially the latter) but I found them to be deeply flawed games. SW: Republic Commando, while flawed in some ways, manages to pull everything together in a much more satisfying way. This is obviously due to it's genre, and the nature of the mission structure. Not a thing is out of place. This comes at price however; the mission structure is disjointed to say the least, and the story is bare bones. However you'll get the feeling this was deliberate, as just like in real combat, and especially if you're a 'slightly less expendable' clone, you'll not be kept up to the date with the war as a whole. The game will take it tacitly that you know the Star Wars lore already and fling references to the films at you without guilt or trepidation. For a avid SW fan this wont be a problem, I unfortunately found myself lost at some points in the dialogue.\n\nThe mechanics are just as you expect from a Squad shooter; intuitive, tight, and easy to control. The PC version runs great with a M&C set up, but a controller is also possible. It might be necessary to have button mapping software however, as the games age breaks the controls.\nYou squad mates don't need you to hold their hand, and can perform simple tasks without you needing to give the order. However, they will occasionally rush in a 'no win scenario' and be dropped in matter of seconds under a hail of plasma fire. This will happen to you over and over, and their really is no way to stop it happening. This does have the unintended use of keeping aggro off you, while you attend to other matters.\nThe game features the modern invent system of the FPS. That is to say. You're limited to two normal weapons, 1 special weapon, and multiple attachments to your assault rifle, thus giving the weapon variety a much needed boost. There is a weapon for every scenario.\n\nNow, onto the soundtrack. As a avid collector of game Soundtracks, this would have a proud spot on my list. In short; it's fantastic. A mixture of choral, and star wars symphony tropes mixed together to create a chilling, but engaging and epic theme. Definitely worth getting on soundtrack.\n\nFinally, onto the negatives, and they are surprisingly few.\nThe game is no looker, and is really showing it's age as of 2015. However, over a decade on and it's vista's are still rather eye catching, especially the later missions on Kashyyyk.\nAlso, while I said the A.I was great; that was for last decade. Now not so much. Your squad mates will get stuck on geometry and regularly fail to revive you, even if their aren't any enemies in the area.

I despise the prequel trilogy, yet I still found this game to be quite good. It's an FPS where you play as the leader of an elite squad of commandos sent on the toughest of jobs.\n\nYou can position your squad members, each one is supposedly skilled at different tasks, and it's mostly just blasting your way through droids and bugs in caverns, facilities, and space ships. You get the typical weapons--shotguns, pistols, sniper, rifle, etc. mostly in star-wars-style laser blasting form.\n\nIt's about ten hours long, and it's a pretty good campaign with some neat set-pieces. The squad members have some fun personalities and the voice work is solid. Since it's an older game, there are no iron sights, so that might be hard to get used to. The graphics hold up well, although I do believe it lacks widescreen. There are some compatibility issues, so you might need to take a look at the forums if you run into problems.","July 19, 2013","true","11.3"," 105 of 107 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","105","107","0","2"

It's boring, cookie cutter shooter where you just spawn, run forward, kill everything you see and repeat. It might be "fun" for the first 30 minutes but after that you'll probably get bored and move to some other more mechanically interesting title. There are also dramatically less features than in the original two games, it was also announced today that they are going to be releasing a 50€ Season Pass for the game which will provide early access to future content for buyers etc.\n\nNow, business practices like this are terrible for the gaming industry. There is absolutely no way you can defend it without sounding like a sheep. Then again, i probably wouldn't be too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it if they actually released even half of the content that was already introduced in the Battlefront games more than 10 years ago.\n\nSo, getting back to Republic Commando.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JewyLewis/recommended/6000/","JewyLewis","Jewy Lewis and the News","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JewyLewis/","173 products in account","I remember playing this game way back on the original Xbox. It's not through rose-colored glasses that I say this is the greatest squad-based shooter I've ever played.\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere. It's spot on. Any casual Star Wars fan will recognize most of the enemies and locations. The level and character designs are grittier than what you see in the movies, and that fits the tone perfectly. The HUD is one of the best I've ever seen, because YOU SEE THE BORDERS OF YOUR HELMET! Such a simple design choice affects your immersion immensely.\n\nSo everything around you is cool. What about the combat? This game FEELS great. The modular weapons system is genius.  The squad commands are easy to learn but hard to master. The difficulty is pleasantly challenging; don't expect yourself to be repeating tons of levels, but do expect to be constantly searching for health and ammo. The weapons feel rewarding to use, and above all, the squad-based combat is amazing. You FEEL bad-♥♥♥. You FEEL like it's you four protagonists against the world. And you WANT to take 'em all on.\n\nYour three Clone Commando compatriots, Scorch, Fixer, and Sev, are exceptional AI companions (especially for 2005). They are effective in combat, respond to commands instantly, and generally don't make the kind of dumb decisions that make you rage at AI companions. They don't talk much, but you can still feel personality emanating from them.\n\nOn the note of character, the one category where this game falters is story. You know where you are, and you know why. You have objectives. But that's about it. The characters don't change over time. There are no plot twists. There is an instance of tragic loss (I won't spoil it for you), and it hits you hard. But there is room for improvement in that area.\n\nBesides the story, what other improvements could be made? I won't comment on the graphics, because this game is coming up on 10 years old, but I will say they've aged well. The only thing that springs to mind is the level design. Don't get me wrong, the levels are designed fine, but it gives away what's to come. When you see a spot where you can issue a sniping command, you know there's enemies directly ahead. Health and ammo are always located directly behind large groups of enemies. It's textbook old-fashioned level design, but you always know what's coming.\n\nOne final point: because this is an older game, a 1920x1080 aspect ratio is not an option it offers. It's a minor detail, but an important one.\n\nIn conclusion, ten years later, this is still an incredible game. Although the story is never going to be a selling point, everything else about this game is great. It feels like you're taking a first-person trip through the summer action film spectacular that Star Wars never had. I highly recommend it to anyone who puts gameplay ahead of graphics. Amongst the vast troves of LucasArts treasures, this gem certainly shines bright.","December 23, 2014","true","8.7"," 75 of 77 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","75","77","2","0"

But that isn't the point. The point is, you need to work as a team. Sure, I may be a Star Wars fan myself but this doesn't affect my opinion on this fantasic game. To the people who say the graphics make up the game entirely, just do yourself a favour and don't play a single game for the rest of your life. Sure, the graphics in this game aren't up to scratch with today's standards but they sure were back in the good days of 2005. To be honest, I think they're great!\n\nThe gameplay and story line is simply amazing. It brings you back to Geonosis, Kashyyk, an abandoned Republic Cruiser and a few other places. I don't think there is another Commando game out there that is based on Star Wars. But if there is, this has got to be one of the best around. I spent heaps of time playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2 and let me tell you, those are amazing games too. The squad that you play with is also very responsive and helpful (unlike in many other games). They'll do what you tell them to do. No questions asked. Unless they are under heavy fire and it is protocol-wise required to defeat the enemy first (goddammit just revive me already haha). Scorch really does keep the squad alive with his 'jokes', athough he can say it the wrong times.\n\nBut too bad Lucas Arts and Pandemic have left the Star Wars games, they were doing a fantastic job. Anyway, overall this is a fantastic game and I hope it won't be forgotten. If you are looking for a multiplayer, try going to Star Wars Battlefront 2. That is also an amazing game. I'll give it 9.5/10. Buy it already if you haven't!

Sev is the most badass Clone I have ever seen. Scorch is a querky, funny joker. Fixer is a very self centered man. He has basically no personality besides a few funny quotes here and there. This game is very short. It consists of 3 "Chapters". Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor, and Kashyyyk. In all I rate this game 9/10.

This game is frankly one of the greatest Star Wars games out there. Republic Commando puts you in the boots of (you guessed it) a clone commando, with 3 squadmates. You travel to locations like Geonosis, Kashyyyk, and an abandoned Republic ship. This game focuses on squadwork, while you or another squadmate is arming a charge to get into a locked door, the other 3 are stopping the super battle droid shooting at you (which are actually kinda intimidating in this game). This is an older game, but you will still be impressed with the graphics to a degree, and at the not-as-expensive-as-98%-of-all-fps-shooters-out-there price of $10, I believe that this quality game is well worth your money!","May 2, 2014","true","3.0"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","47","50","0","2"

This game puts you into the feet of an elite republic commando squad leader, only by the name of 'Boss: 38' (Voiced by the same person who voiced Jango Fett). He has three other clones in his squad, 'Sev: 07' (The Sniper), 'Fixer: 40' (The Hacker) and last but  deffinitly not least 'Scorch: 62' (The Demolishion, and my favourite clone in the game), who all take place in 'Delta Sqaud'. Campaign is FANTASTIC, AWESOME storyline, with amazing characters. Unfortunatly, multiplayer no longer works, but you can still system link with ur friends and enjoy tring to kill each other.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game, I 100% recomand this game to all of you, AND IT'S ONLY $10.\n\n11/10: BEST GAME EVER (or at least in my opinion) 100% GET THIS GAME, NOW, OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN IN MY RREPUBLIC COMMANDO OUTFIT AND KILL YOU, ok maybe that went to far, but stil, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There are no lightsabers, you don't have the force, you only have Delta Squad. The gunplay is fun, the gameplay is very interesting and challenging, and the AI is actually decent. In Republic Commando your squad of Commandos are not just fodder to absorb fire for you. They are good at killing, they can be deployed into a variety of tactical positions and be given a variety of orders, they get hurt, and they can be taken down. In the event you are taken down, they can actually help you up, which is pretty impressive. Another difference this game has from other Star Wars games is it's decidedly darker tone, as you aren't hanging out in the nicest of places.

The squad AI is still incredibly good by today's standards, the characters are compelling and smartly-written, and the environments and story are original and creative.\n\nBut I cannot openly recommend getting this on Steam without some qualifying statements.\n\nRepublic Commando is an old game. A very old game. And it does not play nicely with newer computers. Problems with bumpmapping in the graphics can result in crashes, and trying to get it to run on a 64-bit Windows OS is a horrific struggle. If you have Windows 7 or 8 64-bit, Republic Commando may need to be sadly relegated to the history books. Hopefully your memories, if you got a chance to play it back in the day. You will likely not get another.\n\nEDIT: Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, it's worked perfectly. I don't know what changed, but I hereby retract the preceding paragraph. In the interests of transparency, I will leave it up, but the compatibility issues probably won't affect you anymore.","September 26, 2014","true","11.8"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NukaColaHound/recommended/6000/","NukaColaHound","nukacolahound","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NukaColaHound/","21 products in account","For coming out in 2005 this game still is a thrill to go back and relive the ultimate Clone Special Ops experience. You will be tasked with dealing with the most elite and discreet Republic operations, and leading a group of 4 (including yourself) elite Clone soldiers called Commandos.\n\nTo begin, the gameplay is really good for a 2005 game. The shooting action gets really intense in the latter part of the game, and you will have to learn how to manage your squads survival as well as your own. Get too caught up in keeping your squad fit, and your own health will fall and you will go unconscious. Focus too much on your own health and equipment, and your squad will be left without orders and ultimately end up dying. This ends up being a gameplay goal for you as you must balance the two in order to have a successful playthrough (unless you want to play on the easiest difficulty). Although this does end up becoming a problem when your squad completely goes against their own common sense and runs out into a crowd of a bunch of droids, guns blazing, and gets shot down within seconds. Your squad also tends to run in front of you as you're throwing a grenade, which is super annoying because it will take down your shields and your health, as well as your squad member's, and you will still have enemies firing at you. I also feel the game is a little bit too difficult as you will find yourself screaming at your monitor on the Normal difficulty setting. Perhaps the developers could have balanced the difficulties by adding a fourth one (easy would still be easy, add a normal, normal would be hard, and hard would be very hard). But still, the game is still enjoyable despite the setbacks of a few gameplay issues. The guns are also nice. Most of them have decent sounds (other ones being laughable), and they have a good difference in purpose and power. The grenades, with the exception of the flash-bang grenade, are all pretty useful. Although none stand out above the other in the department of usefulness as they're all pretty much the same: aim at your enemy and throw. But still, they're a decent touch.\n\nThe presentation is at an average level. With your standard graphics card you can max this game out, and the visuals won't look too bad. The textures are decent, and you won't really see any frame rate drop or texture pop-ins. The game overall has excellent environments that all differ from each other drastically. You'll go from fighting on the sandy and rocky world of Geonosis to the "abandoned" Republic ship in a matter of hours. With the varied environments and average graphics with no presentation technical difficulties, I can confidentially saw this game has above par presentation given its age.\n\nNow, onto the fun part, the content of Star Wars Republic Commando. First off, the story is really good. You are placed in command of Delta Squad, an elite group of Republic Commandos, which essentially are just Clone super soldiers. You will be given a variety of missions ranging from destroying a Droid Factory to helping the leader of the Wookies on Kashyyyk. Along the way you will unlock a few extras, which aren't really anything special, but they're a decent addition. The game is honestly too short. With the edition of another planet this game would have easily felt more complete. But the content that is there is fun and replayable, so it doesn't diminish the game too much. The multiplayer is remotely enjoyable, but will get old quickly. The community is either dead silent or a bunch of snotty veterans who trash talk new players and exploit the more powerful weapons. The maps themselves aren't anything out of the box, and quite bland, which is a shame considering the variety and design of the campaign maps were quite well. You'll most likely end up playing the campaign 1 or 2 times and maybe the multiplayer an hour or two (unless you find the multiplayer really fun, which I doubt most will).\n\nAll in all I can say this game was a very good addition to the Star Wars franchise. Although it is a little short and has some gameplay issues and a below par multiplayer, you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying the amazing campaign and its awesome storytelling, environments, and characters. For the current price of $9.99 you should definitely pick this game up and relive or enjoy for the first time one of the greatest Star Wars gaming experiences you can possibly find.","December 21, 2013","true","13.6"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","4"

It's too dated for me to put more then 10 hours into it.

This means that you order your fellow brother around the various battlefields, keeping them alive- and developing a real connection with them throughout the game. Sev is the tough guy, always making remarks to boost the squad's confidence. You, the designated leader, have inherited Jango Fett's accent and his skills. Scorch, my favorite, is always there to make jokes and lighten the mood. Geonosis, the Assualt ship, and Kashyyyk are all wonderfully crafted and are great to explore if you are interested in them. The gunplay is great and commanding your fellow commandos is almost always flawless. The music is fantastic, some areas using the movies' music, and some areas (and main menu) using a darker score. The enemies are diverse and have their weaknesses. Some enemies are annoying, but most are fun and challenging to battle. You really see why clones are intimidated by Super Battle Droids and Droidekas and Spider Tanks, something that was never felt in Star Wars Battlefront II. Also, it has AWESOME breaching, hacking, and grenade gameplay. You also get a new perspective on various battles in the movies, such as the Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Kashyyyk. I am a huge Episode I-III fan and think this is the second best Star Wars game of all time besides Star Wars Battlefront I/II. I have the first Republic Commando  book ready as well.

Or massive Battlefront-style unit management? Take control of Delta Squad: an elite group of clones who all have their own specialties to bring to the team, and personalities that play well off one another in the amsuing dialouge.\nThe shooting feels pretty good. Enemies die in a lot of visually pleasing and hilarious ways, keeping the good cartoon/serious balance Star Wars is known for. While there's a dissapointing variety of guns, the ones you have suit you very well.\nAs Delta Squad's leader, you take advantage of "squad commands". Split up your three squad members to take up sniper positions, heal themselves, hack consoles, breach doors, blow things up, and a variety of helpful things. All these commands are administered and canceled with suprising ease, and the AI is FANTASTIC at fending for themselves and executing orders.\nAlmost shameful to say that your team AI is better than most cooperative shooter-style games on the market today.\nYou only play through three worlds. While the game isn't longer than eight or so hours, it's one long thrill-ride that is action packed with appropriate breathing room. Nothing's more intense than when you're the last of your squad not incapacitated and there's a pod dispensing Super Battle Droids infront of you.\nThere's multiplayer. It's standard deathmatch and CTF type gamemodes. It's nothing special and nobody really plays it anymore.\n\nTL;DR?\nFANTASTIC shooter, very unique, BLEEDS Star Wars atmosphere, entertaining and likable characterss, and holds up as one of the greatest shooters and Star Wars games today.

Unlike most shooters, such as Battlefield and Child Online Daycare, your weapon isn't the strongest thing you have (in fact, it's kind of weak sometimes) - it's your squad. When presented with seemingly-unstoppable enemies such as droidekas and super battle droids, you'll need every single rifle aimed at the target. You cannot just blitz through the levels, like you can in most games. It requires a lot of skill and coordination, that both add up to make Republic Commando a very challenging game,  but also a really fun one.","January 30, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","14","14","5","0"

This is because:\n1. The combat feels great! running at a group of droids firing away at you with just the right amount of accuracy to be a threat and then dispatching them one by one with your wristblade is one of the best experiences in gaming!\n2. The Team. Your team is made up of 4 people (no spoilers, as you find this all out in the opening) you, the elite Delta 38, the sniper Sev (Delta 07), the hot headed demolitions expert scorch (Delta 62), and the trustworthy commando fixer (Delta 40). Your command over them is relatively limited as you only have 4 options, Search and destroy, Form up, Stay here and Do thing (sniper point, grenade point, breach door, hack, etc) Also if you "die" your squad will carry on fighting until finished and then will revive you with half health (you can order them to revive you sooner but that often puts them in a very vulnerable spot).\n3.The environments, without spoiling the game for you the envoronments range from full on battles with other troopers present to creepy environments with your enemies lurking around every other corner.\n4. The story. The story really attaches you mentally to your squad and by the end you'll be scolding scorch for shooting you in the back rather than cursing the AI, and there are some real moments of accomplishment in the story such as the end of the first "chapter". The ending is awesome too!.\nSo to sum up, GO BUY THIS GAME!","October 29, 2014","true","39.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

I remember playing this game a couple years after it came out, back on my original XBOX. I was just a little kid back then. If you are buying this game now, it's almost certainly for nostalgia, as it most definitely was for me. In this review I'll go over how the graphics/performance, gameplay, and plot hold up over a decade later, and some closing thoughts.\n\nGraphics/Performance While I have heard some complaints of Commando not working on peoples modern rigs, I am running a PC on Windows 10 with no components older than 2012, and I ran this game just fine. I cranked up all the graphical settings, except turning on FSAA as that would cause my game to crash almost immediately. The max resolution of Commando is 1024x768, but you can change it to any res as long as you are willing to tweak one of the games system files. It absolutely makes the game look much sharper, but I found that the game was extremely choppy in 1080p, despite getting 100+ fps, so I stuck with 1024x768. Now on with the overall looks. They are ugly. I really doubt anyone who didn't play this game a long time ago will be able to stomach the graphics because of how spoiled we are today. For me they were definitely an eye sore, but I put up with it because it was hard to criticize something I remember from my childhood. All in all, the visuals and performance are just barely passable as long as you can put up with them for old times’ sake.\n\nGameplay The gameplay of Commando was very varied for its time, but not all that much by today’s standards. You'll find yourself fighting lots of the same enemies, in very tedious battles. You'll have your squad members to back you up and give commands to, but even what they can do for you gets very old and repetitive. Small arms, heavy arms, melee, grenades, turrets, and explosive charges, these are your tools for fighting the onslaught of various droids, Geonosians, Trandoshans, and the odd battleship. It can be tense and tough at times, but can also feel very samey and drawn out. Once again though, the saving grace was my recollection of scenes and actions I had almost completely forgotten, which made the monotonous gameplay with the rare tense moment more than just sufferable.\n\nPlot You are Delta 38, commissioned with your squad members 07 (Sev), 40 (Fixer), and 62 (Scorch) to be a covert and elite clone task force, whose job is to strike swiftly and hard at the republic's foes. You have been born and bred to work together as a team, and are much more skilled than your lowly infantry-ranked cousins. STAR WARS Republic Commando will take you through 3 primary locations (littered with objectives for you and your squad), where you will blast your way through copious enemies. From Geonosis to a republic star ship, and finally the Wookie home planet of Kashyyyk, the experience really is bad ♥♥♥. Especially so when I think of 5-6 year old me making my way through it. There it is again, the nostalgia factor. Very important for playing this game in 2016, onwards.\n\nFinal Thoughts Republic Commando is an 8-9 hour long linear Star Wars tactical-shooter I'd only recommend you play if you have some deep nostalgia for it, or if you are a total Star Wars fanatic. In my case (as you've probably caught on) it was the nostalgia. However, I did find that part of the magic 5 or 6 year old me preserved up to teenage me was misleading, and some of my love for this game has now been worn away. But that's beside the point now, so I'll just rephrase the theme of this review to end it off. I'd suggest anyone with memories of this game in their childhood to take another swing at it, otherwise, steer clear. I'm living proof nostalgia was enough to make this game worth reliving.\n\nPersonal Rating: 8/10","April 3","true","8.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The game is fairly challenging, the AI honestly isn't half-bad, and the overall gameplay is pretty damn good; the music is great, the voice acting is solid, and the game actually looks pretty good for its time. My only real gripes are that the game feels a bit short for the campaign (personal opinion, I just felt that it was a bit shorter than what I expected) and that the ending feels like a bit of a cop-out since it leaves the player feeling as if there's going to be a sequel (which we all know is unfortunately never happening). I'd definitely say something about the multiplayer as well if I could, but since the multiplayer has been rendered non-functional due to GameSpy's shutdown, I'm unfortunately not able to do so.\n\nIn the end, I'd definitely say that this is a game I'd recommend, even without the multiplayer being functional.","January 1","true","13.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

You don't play as a Jedi or a Bounty Hunter or any of the things in between. Instead you get plopped directly into the head of a Clone trooper and thrown onto the battlefields of Episode Two.\n\nAs a clone trooper you don't get much back story or indeed any motivation beyond the occasional communication pop-up on your UI that tells you where to go next. Indeed you were bred for combat and unquestioning loyalty and that's what you do. This rather unique aspect does a lot of alleviate many of the problems that usually plague Star Wars games and makes Republic Commando a rather enjoyable experience.\n\nYou are not just any Clone Trooper however, you are a squad leader and this is where the gameplay of Republic Commando comes into play. With you have 3 additional commandos, each with their own area of expertise. A sniper, a demolitions expert and a hacker. As you go through the missions you will be able to order your team around, into cover, mounting gun positions, or performing specific tasks suited to their specialty through a context sensitive command system. You basically just point at an object and click and one of your squad members takes the appropriate action. This all works surprisingly well and trying to play the game as a lone wolf tends to end badly as the game features some rather impressive AI, both on the part of your teammates and the enemies.\n\nThe game is very pretty and in particular the background deserves notice as there is always something else going on there which often looks every bit as intense as the fight you are distracted from.\n\nThe voice-acting is pretty good for a game but you will quickly realize that the developers took a little shortcut here as the many different voices and accents the clones have makes you wonder just how similar they really are.\n\nStar Wars Republic Commando is an attempt to take the Star Wars franchise into the squad based tactical genre and it comes away from the attempt quite nicely although it is a game that has it's flaws, most notably the campaign is extremely short and ends with a cliffhanger that's never resolved as this is the only game in the franchise. Still all in all it's one of the best Star Wars games out there and one of those that can be held up as a good game in it's own right.","January 1, 2013","true","39.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's a first person shooter, has nothing to do with the elite characters of the movie, instead you are a clone trooper.  The teamwork works great, at least they listen to what you want them to do.  Outside of that, the AI isn't great for either your partners or for the enemies.  There are a variety of enemies, some that are rather tough, and others that just annoy.  The weapons are decent, but nothing spectacularly new.  The storyline is intriguing and connects somewhat well within the Star Wars Universe.  The fun, didn't last through the entire game though as the game gets quite repetitive.  The graphics aren't too interesting to look at these days, and this isn't to say that they aren't good, just that there's no real art design that stands out.  Everything seems bleak and without much detail.\n\nIf you are not a Star Wars fan, this may not tickle your fancy.  However, it's a short game that can easily be beaten in less than 10 hours.

I remember hugging the healing stations because I was worried I'd get killed during the next fight all the time.\n\nYou can play as different specialized Clone Troopers (i.e. Demolitions, Sniper, etc.).\n\nThis is actually one of those games where commanding your own squad is fun. The AI is decent (not perfect, but close enough). You can use turrets from fallen Republic Gunships and mow down enemies with it. All in all, a great game.. multiplayer wasn't that bad too. I had lots of fun dueling 1v1. One day, I was lucky enough to pull a direct headshot by bouncing a Wookie crossbow projectile off the wall on somebody. :D: Been a while, and I can't remember the name of the map, but it was an arena map called "Clone Training".\n\nI give the game a 8.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/recommended/6000/","emnii","emnii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/","1171 products in account","Here's my bottom line opinion on Republic Commando; it's the second-best Star Wars first-person shooter. Just below Dark Forces. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the best game to come out of the prequel trilogy, and doesn't escape the taint of the prequel's legacy. I may even like the ideas behind Republic Commando more than I like the game itself.\n\nHere is what sucks about Republic Commando: the weapons sound weak, and there aren't many different enemies to fight. So what does Republic Commando do right? The intro to the game is great. It details where you and your squad came from, all from the first person perspective. In fact, this game takes a page from Half-Life in that the entire game is played from the first-person perspective. There are a couple of scenes where you are not in control of your character, but they're limited.\n\nThe squad AI is not smart but it's competent. They'll kill enemies, heal themselves, heal you when you drop, take cover, etc. There are certain set pieces that you can order a squadmate to take position at for a specific purpose (like sniping or anti-armor) and they're meant to be used. Your squad dies less when they're in one of these ordered positions. The squad also has fantastic vocal banter. Each member is a personality, and I got attached to them as the game went along.\n\nThough the levels are a little cookie cutter, there are plenty of objectives to them and no lack for fights. I was fighting in corridors, in small courtyards and hangers, on multi-level starship bridges, and in trees. They're not as varied as Dark Forces, but each environment is well made.\n\nAnd now I can get to what stops this from being a great game. They can fix the sound effects and toss in a couple more enemies, but it's harder to change the setting. Republic Commando takes place at the onset of the Clone Wars. It starts on Geonosha even. And though it takes place over a two (three?) year span, it could have gone farther. This was a pre-Episode 3 game and it shows. It feels like a teaser leading up to Episode 3 and, ultimately, suffers for that. It doesn't deserve to be timely movie release fodder. It deserves to be treated like a game that can stand on its own two legs. Something that can be taken out of the context of the prequel release. It doesn't deserve to be lumped in with Episode 1 Racer, Star Wars Starfighter, Bounty Hunter, Obi-Wan, or any other godawful prequel game.\n\nIt doesn't carry the same tone as those games. The developers did their damnedest to give this game a fair chance. They go out of their way to make  you know that you are playing an elite soldier. You're no jedi, and you're not fodder either. You see your share of ally deaths and the Clone War takes its toll. But you're fighting bugs on Geonosha. And battle droids, even if they're way more menacing than they ever were in the prequel movies. They may bleed oil, wear a metallic gray paint job (rather than the orange seen in the movies), and the super battle droids may be some tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but they're still battle droids, which are inherently lame. There's a pitiful tie in with General Grieveous in the form of his bodyguards, which flip and hop around like acrobats, with electric sticks. They're not threatening in the slightest, more annoying than anything, and serve only to give General Grieveous an excuse to make an unwarranted appearance.\n\nWhat I'm getting down to is that in Republic Commando you are playing, in essence, a proto super stormtrooper. I wish the devs would've been allowed to run with that rather than get tied to the time frame that stuck them between the two prequel movies. I hope we can get another Republic Commando game, but I'm not expecting it. This franchise has legs that get cut out from beneath it by the movies it was made to support.","November 25, 2013","true","7.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

The community for it mostly gone but if you REALLY want to get some multiplayer action going, there are small groups like ReiGn that will play and have servers up. I may or may not get one myself. There are plenty of mods for the game as well. I haven't put that much time looking into it but I believe there is one that adds an entire new campaign.\n\nNever played it before? This game is within that top tier of all Star Wars games ever made. Amazing and unique gameplay + story. The chat between your squad as you progress makes it even better. It can be incredibly challenging even now if you turn the diff. all the way up. The squad mechanic also ups the difficiutly a bit as you will need to utilize them correctly if you want to get anywhere.  You are not a God (i.e a Jedi) in this game and it will remind you if you try to lone wolf it.\n\nLike I said the game still looks AMAZING considering how old it is. One thing that makes this stand out in my eyes is that like the story for BF2, this is one is told from the Clone perspetive rather than the overdone Jedi one. All in all yes get this game. Maybe with all the hype coming back to Star Wars with the new movie and BF3 we'll finally get a sequel.","February 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes, I could be fighting the flood and watching them devour people. But for some reason that never made me as nervous as when I was roaming the abandoned Republic ship as Clones got torn limb from limb in the room next to me. Yes, I could be trying to take down a hunters. But a lot of villains in this game provide much more of a challenge.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is the squad. You control your squad and tell them where to go. I'm constantly checking my squad's health and changing their positions. Yes, some current games have squads. You kinda control them, but I don't think as much as in this game.

While there were Star Wars FPS's, this one was more down to Earth and grounded.\n\nThe game features no jedi, and it's less focused on running and gunning. It's gameplay more revolves around manipulating your AI squadmates to accomplish certain roles. Due to the nature of the game's map design this is less annoying then it sounds. Never does the game force you into platforming sections, or introduce puzzles. It is pure unadulterated Star Wars gameplay at it's purest.\n\nIf singleplayer isn't your bag there's also highly entertaining multiplayer.

The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable "mooks" who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate "disposable bad guy." Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them.\n\nThe game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner.\n\nThe presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant "Vode An" punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores. The game will throw in bits of fan-service such as a squad mate quipping "these must be the droids we're looking for" which just make you chuckle even under pressure.\n\nThe AI is decent but will occasionally get stuck behind barriers when rushing to revive you, leading to frustration. The cooperative nature of the campaign makes the lack of online co-op campaign play very glaring. If this game ever gets a sequel, this feature needs to be added first. The campaign only features three planets, and is pretty short. None of the multiplayer maps are very interesting. These are probably due to the game's status as a tie-in for Episode III's film release with crunched development time.\n\nJust get this game. You will not be disappointed. It's not perfect by any means but its extremely minor flaws do little to hamper an amazing experience.

I put countless hours on this years ago back on my original Xbox. This game (in my opinion) still holds up with modern day games. Unfortunately, there are few and far between squad-based games out there like this. The only ones that still carry on this tradition would be Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon for example (Singleplayer at least). Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I. (that seem like that they're just for show, like a hindrance, rather than helping the player take care of hostiles) that stays back 10 feet behind while the player is on the other side of the map, blasting their way through enemy territory.\n\nWe need less games like that, and more of this, if the FPS Genre wants to at least survive in someway. Definitely worth buying, that is, if you like to work as a team. If you can't handle that responsibility, then look somewhere else.\n\nOh and this game actually has a challenge to it. Pretty rare nowadays in the FPS Genre.\n\n9.7/10 Would buy and play again.","May 5, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retrobliss/recommended/6000/","retrobliss","Retro Bliss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retrobliss/","650 products in account","Like a swift kick to the stomach, this game will leave you doubled-over and gasping for breath hours after you finish playing. How many times have I been forced to kill a spider droid on my own with just a pistol because I ran out of ammo and my entire squad is incapacitated, or how often have I encountered a droid dispenser pumping out SBD's only to realize I've already used up all my anti-armor charges? These kinds of situations force to think ahead and plan & execute your strategies quickly. Keeping your squad organized is key. It's a beatiful thing when you give your squadmates commands and then find out that what you've decided for them to do is the perfect strategy. Good ol' Delta 38... he always knows just what to do.\n\nSquad control in the game is easy as pie, and the friendly AI is okay, though at times a bit frustrating. When they're given a command, the squad will go do it no matter what, even if it means doing something dumb like getting killed because they don't think to kill the things in their way first. Enemies are pretty stupid, but you don't need to be smart when you're a Super Battle Droid. The graphics and landscapes are dated but still amazing, from the windy, dusty canyons of Geonosis to the dark and foreboding forests of Kashyyyk. Except for the commando armor, everything is dark and gloomy. Gameplay is also awesome; everything is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat (and sometimes out of it completely). Whether you're desperately trying to hold off an endless stream of enemies as one of your squadmates plants explosives on a droid dispenser while another hacks into a security system while under fire, or you're clearing a path through a group of fat Trandoshan slavers in the maze-like corridors of an assault ship, there's never a dull moment in Republic Commando, and the hard difficulty mode is just right.\n\nThe Squad:\n\nDelta 38, the main character. A tough-as-nails commando, 38 don't take no crap from nobody. Even when under heavy fire, he calmly gives commands like he's ordering food at a McDonald's drive-thru. He's the voice of reason, keeping everybody under control.\n\nDelta 62 (Scorch), the Demolitions expert. Scorch likes explosives. That's all there is to say.\n\nDelta 07 (Sev), is a fierce hunter. His best use is as a sniper, providing amazingly accurate covering fire for his squadmates. His only job is to kill, kill, kill.\n\nDelta 40 (Fixer), is just a good old-fashioned soldier. He's uncomplicated and a great fighter, and always follows orders. Other than that, I'm not quite sure what his deal is... I guess he's the "computer expert," though any commando can slice any console.\n\nEach commando has his own personality. Scorch can be quite humorous at times, and Sev has some pretty disturbing things to say. One thing I don't understand is why do all have different voices? I though they were all the same clones...\n\nTrust me when I saw that even still to this day this game is worth every penny. The only thing I wish is that more games could be like this.","December 21, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The somewhat decent guns that kill large enemies take *FOREVER* to reload and ammo is laughably sparse through out the entire game.  The large enemies are way too common to be anything special.  Holding down the use key to slice terminals and blow up walls can be tiresome, even when you have your allies do it for you.  Your allies are frail little water balloons that you have to constantly revive and have them revive you, so its extremely frustrating.  There is hardly any enemy variety.  PROS: The storyline is interesting, the voice acting is quite good (though the advisor has a weird accent), and it is after all, Star Wars.  This game is hard to recommend so you better like Star Wars & FPS.\n\nTL;DR: If you like FPS & Star Wars and are willing to put up with a lot of problems and frustrating BS, this is worth $1, $2 at most.","August 5, 2011","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You lead your squad of 4 commandos across 3 different campaigns during the era of the clone wars. Each campaign is relatively short (around 2 hours) but feel unique enough to give you a different experience through each one. Atmosphere is great and so is the soundtrack.\n\nUsing your squad effectively is very important to succeed in this game. You can't finish this game by yourself you need to use your AI controled squad. Your squad consists of 3 other commandos that all have different strengths and personalities, which leads to some good interactions and interesting dialogue. The squad commanding is very simple but also one of the most effective ways i've ever seen in any game, even in 2016.\n\nthe game ends on a cliffhanger ending, originally planned to continue the story in a sequel. unfortunatly this game got scrapped so the game ends with a very important part of the story unexplained.\n\nRating 8.5/10.","January 3","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Playing as a clone delta squad commander provides a fresh perspective in the Star Wars universe where you get to use a blaster instead of a light saber. The squad based system is simple and easy to use and the AI actually follows orders well. The small assortment of weapons and attachments isn't impressive, but they get the job done. The game offers an engaging tactical story and traditional Star Wars music. There's no in-game options for wide screen resolution support, but you can manually modify some .ini files to get higher resolutions working. And the graphics look decent at 1920x1080.\n\nAlthough there's nothing great about it, Republic Commando is definitely a polished game that is fun from start to finish--worthy of its 2005 release date.","March 15, 2013","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They are about the size of a toaster, and hover 3 meters above the ground using AntGrav Hover™ technology. Upon seeing a Republic Commando, they will fire a constant beam at them. This beam has a 100% chance of hitting the commando, sometimes even if they are behind a wall. Once this beam is fired, the Commando has approximately 1.3 seconds to destroy the drone, or they will be killed. This is no easy task however, as the drones are small, fly incredibly fast, and have a 75% chance to dodge bullets. Also, they like to hunt in numbers, usually seeing about 3 or 4 of them in a pack. Why the man who designed these drones meant to siphon resources out of disabled ships thought it would be a good idea to make them kill people, I have no idea.","May 10, 2014","true","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I'll just say this: It is old, but it is fun. To be fair, i haven't touched the multiplayer. I Gather it doesn't work without 3rd party servers but I'm not to sure so i'm reviewing this on the single player.\n\nPro's:\n1) Star wars game! usually they are pretty good and this was deinetally one of them. If you enjoy Star Wars games, play this.\n\n2) The music is honorable to the movies. It was nice to be running around with battle music from star wars going in the background, it really supported the feel of the game.\n\n3) It's a different take on the general star wars universe. Your not a Jedi (Pro and Con) which is fun for a change in the Star Wars Games.\n\n4) Wookies!!!\n\n5) The allies in your party are not full ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They actually do damage. You can also tell them to slice, blow up doors e.t.c and although primitive it still works and add's to the gamplay.\n\nCon's:\n\n1) The AI for the enemy is just...can't say anymore than that.\n\n2) It's an older game. There are some moments were you can tell it's aged badly.\n\n**NOTE THIS ONE IS A SPOILER**\n3) The storyline. It's nothing fantastic but i feel that it could of been a little bit better. I like that it's set during the clone war era, i like running around as an elite team, i don't like how the storyline is practically inexistant. And that ending! What kind of ending is that.\n\n4) It is far from a long game. The whole game took me about 5.5 hours to complete.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable and i definetally suggest it for a star wars fan. 7/10","April 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(already a fairly long and fun story, don't worry). I played this game non-stop on the hardest difficulty as soon as I got it and it is honestly perfect in every way. This game, not even kidding in any way, has thebest beginning to any game I've played. The awe that I felt as I saw my character's life begin was simply wonderful and irreplacable, it might just be me but everything about this was just beautiful and unforgettable. Enough of that though (I love this game so f**king much) it's time to go on to your squad. The squad gameplay is amazing and unlike most squad features in most triple A title games nowadays. The basics of what I'm saying are that there's good control over your squad and that without you your squad will likely die and if you're alone you will likey die, only together can you effectively triumph against you enemies both weak and strong. The story itself is fun and effectively gave me a feeling of bonding and love with my team, all of them of distinct personalities and traits that make them unique and lovable, they will even occasionally crack a joke between one another or yell something that makes me laugh or smile. To be completely honest, with how amazing this game is I am very suprised that it isn't as loved or known as star wars battlefront is. I'd much prefer this game over that (despite battlefront being my chidhood and being simply a great game). I really hope that someone eventually comes to finish the series with its canceled sequel otherwise I shall continue to cry at the thought of what could've been.\n\nas a final verdict I rate this work of art a 10/10, it has no real failings other than age and at this point I honestly want to play it all over again. (I don't usually give games this good of ratings, only other game to get that high on my list is portal 2). I cannot reccomend this game more if you like squad gameplay and fps games or if you like murderous-deep voiced badasses, funny-somewhat timid, or that one guy who follows orders and is fairly serious about most subjects because that's what this squad consists of and I love tham all.","May 8","true","76.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So many years later and the game is still awesome. Although the online multiplayer comunity has died since then, the gameplay is still just as fun and the squad A.I. and simple commands are still one of the best I've come across. In adddition I came to really like the squadmates as their own characters with their little banter back and forth. However I do have to point out and easily over looked physics issue, as the "ragdoll bodies" was new back then, sometimes the dead enemy units shake/twitch/jiggle about one the ground for a bit. Personally I think it's funny looking, but it is noticeable and you might see it a few times throughout the game. Other than that, the game is pretty much flawless in terms of squad shooter gameplay and audio  This game deserves a good sequal, but unfortunately probably won't get one.

They're really amazing, you've scorch, sev, and fixer. They all have their specialties, and it's not super noticeable, but they do better than the others in their area. (Scorch- demolitions, fixer-computers/slicing, sev- weapons expert{sniping, anti-armor posts, turrets, etc.}) They listen to your orders, you can set them to do different things. You can have one guy sniping, one guy disabling the droid dispenser and still have the last one fighting head on with you. You can have them on the full offensive, you can have them staying in formation, you can have them moving carefully, ready to blow ammo into anything that moves.\n\nPlus there's the Humour. Really there's some funny jokes in there. Gotta love scorch XD\n\nThere's a really unique weapon setup in the game, you can have 3 guns. There's your standardized pistol (infinite ammo, energy recharge), the standardized rifle (with sniping and explosives attachments), and then you can have a single enemy weapon. That could be anything an enemy drops, like a geonosian beam rifle (pretty much shoots a powerful beam of energy) or a trandoshan shotgun, or even a wookie bowcaster. There's also heavy weapons you can get, like the ACP Heavy Repeater or the Wookie Rocket Launcher. Personally, by the end of the game I really only used the pistol, and the rifle attachments if I really need to.\n\nIt also has a fair ammount of extra fun one time kind of stuff. Most of them come as a surprise, so I don't really wanna spoil it for you.\n\nWhen you play, keep in mind how useful cover can really be. You have an energy shield, which recharges, and a pistol with infinite ammo. If you can find some good cover, you can use those two together and take out just about anything with relative ease.","September 13, 2014","true","58.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The gameplay, weapons, squad mechanics and even the graphics are still appealing even after all this time. The Steam release of Republic Commando is the third time I have bought this game, and I still love to play it now and again.\n\nThe first thing that LucasArts got right with this game is making the Commados feel just as bad-♥♥♥ as the Jedi, while at the same time making them feel like soldiers. This is accomplished simply with the squad commands and context-dependant actions such as sniping and grenade positions. The scripted animations are icing on the cake like tackling droidekas or killing a kamikazi trandoshan with his own knives.\n\nBut while each member of Delta Squad is comprehensively a one-man killing machine, they are not as invincible as a Jedi Knight, you need your squad, and again this really enhances the military feel of the game. Performing door breaches, setting up entrenched positions, and setting up covering fire while you outflank the enemy do a great deal to give Republic Commando a military feel that few modern military shooters can match. Putting you in command of Delta Squad was an awesome idea.\n\nAtmosphere is another area where this game shines. You start out being dropped behing enemy lines onto Geonosis, fighting your way into a Geonosian hive complex, down through a droid foundry and into a trade federation droid control ship. Then comes the genuinely creepy ghost-ship mission where you will be reduced to being hunted, alone by scavenger droids, and finally you will form part of the first wave in the republic's campaign on Kashyyyk, each location feels unique, and the game manages to capture the frenetic pace of a battlefield, the isolation and helplessness of a horror game, and the epic scale of a megaflora jungle.\n\nWhile some games start to feel dated and klunky as technology and design practices roll on, Republic Commando was at least 10 years ahead of its time. Everything about it shines, and the few flaws are minor and easily overlooked. Even when it's not on sale, this game is a bargain at ten bucks, the only negative point I can hold against Republic Commando is that it wasn't long enough and never had a sequel.","December 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You take control of a squad of republic clone troopers each with his own personality (my personal fave is Sev, the cold, silent, deadly sniper on a hunt for blood). The gameplay is short, unfortunately; I think the 14 hours for my playthrough that is listed here is because I either didn't know where to go many times or my file got lost and I had to start over for some reason. At any rate, this game is a must for any hardcore Star Wars fan and perhaps even people who don't care so much about Star Wars and just want some military squad-based action in a science-fiction setting.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is terrific. You fight your way through jungles, heavily-fortified enemy bases, desert-terrain, etc as you carry out your missions. You can choose, in many situations, to go head-on with the enemies or sic your bloodthirsty comrades on them with the press of a button.\n\nThe music and sounds are top-notch as usual in Star Wars games. You will hear the familar firing of laser blasters and roaring of wookies, not to mention the authentic Star Wars music we all know and love from the movies.\n\nCons: Game is short, but by today's standards of 8-10 hours, I would say it fits in nicely. Perhaps the AI is a bit boring with the repeated use of "hide behind rock, pop out and shoot, maybe toss a frag, hide again, repeat", but let's be honest, this is the formula for most games, sadly even today. Oh, almost forgot, if I remember correctly this game has what felt like a moderate cliffhanger at the end. This is a huge con because it leaves the story unfinished I feel. It doesn't take away too much from this great game, but it still sucks. Checking online I see that a sequel was planned and then canceled. However, in 2011 there appeared to be reports that a sequel is still in the works. We will have to wait and see.\n\n9/10","January 12, 2014","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the game, you play as RC-1138, AKA 'Boss', who is the...well...BOSS of an elite clone commando squad known as Delta Squad. You have 3 squadmates: Scorch, the munitions expert, Fixer, the computer slicer, and Sev, the sniper. The 4 of you go on many, many missions across the galaxy and basically destroy everyone in your path.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are surprisingly smooth and it's easy to get the hang of. You know how to aim at things? You're all good. This game is so worth it for the price not only because of how fun it is, but because of the length of the campaign. I think we've all bought a game and had fun with it but were left short-handed because of how small the campaign was. No worrying about that with this game. You get a blaster rifle, a sniper, shotgun, pistol, grenades, and even a grenade launcher to blow your enemies to hell all while your squad mates are bantering with each other...which is probably one of the best parts of the game.\n\nTL;DR Here is a pros and cons list\n\nPROS\n-Good amount of content\n-Smooth mechanics\n-Squad banter\n-Good graphics for its release date\n-No extra BS.

There are three mini campaigns, which you play through sequentially. One on Geonosis, one onboard a Republic cruiser and one on Kashyyyk, all of them clock in at around 2 hours each.\n\nWith that big, primary concern out of the way, do I recommend this game? I sure do.\nBeyond nailing the aesthetic of the Clone Wars (more the one from the films than the tv series) or even Star Wars in general it is a solid single player squad based shooter.\nSingle player and squad based might sound like opposing descriptors, but they're not. The three titular Commandos are your greatest weapon, both in effectiveness and enjoyment. Every Commando can do what you do, at the same rate.\nDo you want to dash in behind the enemy battle droids and take out their dispenser or do you want to send one of your squad mates to do it so you can lay down covering fire? You'll have them hack their way into power generators to reactivate them, but could just as well do that yourself.\nShould they fall you can revive them by running up to them with a defibrillator, or order one of the remaining squad mates to do that. Even if you get shot down yourself your squad mates will, at your orders, run over and put you back on your feet.\n\nOpposing you are the expected Trade Federation droids, the Geonosian bug army and, the only group not plucked directly from the prequel trilogy, Trandoshan mercenaries. These all have their share of easy fodder (the basic federation droids especially are little more than target practice) as well as a variety of overwhelmingly strong enemies.\nIf the game did not work as well as it does then the best strategy would be to have your squad hold its ground out of harm's way, go at it alone and have them come revive you if it doesn't work out, and it's a testament to the excellent work the developers put into making the squad mechanics worthwhile.\n\nOrders are given easily, point at a piece of cover and press the Order button to have a squad mate take cover behind it. Same goes with entering turrets, breaching doors, setting explosives, etc. etc..\nIt's a simple system, but it works well and is easy enough to do in the middle of hectic combat situations, of which there are plenty.\nThe plot doesn't really add anything to existing lore, but it does its job and all of your squad mates have their own distinctive personalities, voices and preferences (though the explosives expert is no faster at placing a charge than his brothers).\n\nAs long as you keep in mind that this is a short game and that it will primarily stay away from the plot of the films then you're in for a great time, and I recommend this title.","May 15, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piccolothedevil/recommended/6000/","piccolothedevil","Feisty little thang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piccolothedevil/","212 products in account","A game ahead of its time\nStar Wars Rebublic Commando is set in the early stages of the Clone Wars. You are a clone commander in charge of Delta Squad, the republics deadliest soldiers. You and your squad are sent behind enemy lines and must fight the droids of CIS (confederacy of independent systems) However, the droids are not the only threat you must face.\n\nA very clever and simple squad based gameplay\n\nWhen I first dove into the game, I was expecting a squad based system which would be confusing, similar to Red Orchestra 2. The system was actually pretty simple. It did not take long to learn the mechanics. You have just a few buttons which you can use to give your squad commands. Commands such as defend this area, follow me, advance (search and destroy), cancel orders. You can also order your men to different highlighted positions like, sniper,anti armor, turrets and grenade. Might sound confusing, but it really isn't. I was surprised of the good physics in this game and the gameplay itself was fun, but only for a couple of hours. The maps and basic gameplay got a bit repetitive and I got bored after a half an hour or so each session. Still, it was fun and entertaining.\n\nShort and loose story\n\nthe story was not as good as I hoped. You get a short prolouge cutscene that tells you about the clone commandos. The story jumps from one place to the next. At first you are at Geonosis and suddenly you are investigating a lost republic war ship. So it is not a direct storyline throughout the game. What I did like was the chatter between your men. It was funny at many occasions and you got more feelings about your men. It also ends with a cliffhanger and since republic commando 2 was cancelled I doubt that there will be a sequel anytime soon. Though, the developers leaked information about how the story would continue, so the ending is still there.\n\nWorth it?\nIt was a game ahead of its time, so I can't complain about anything really, except the story. Other than the story being very loose I would still recommend bying it, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. The music is top notch.\n\n\nNote: Multiplayer does not work anymore, so you will only be able to play singleplayer, still worth it though","May 16","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a game. *note* I have played this game no doubt 500hrs off steam.  There's so much action, drama, and story. Let's see what we got!\nGameplay - This game runs extremely well, given that I kept my old pc machine with windows xp lol. The gun fights are super fun and the melee isn't hard at all. Moving around is easy, and i've had no issues with it, hasn't crashed at all.\nGraphics - Back in the day ( dang i'm getting old ) this was amazing to gaming standards. The realistic blood and gore, bodies jiggled around if you shot them, etc. To todays standards it's not graphically " amazing " but it looks a lot better than some games that came out 5yrs after it.\nOther - The story is pretty interesting. You're a squad of elite commando's trained and bred to be a one man army. You have Scorch (Delta 62) The classic goof off and jokster that loves blowing stuff up. He's made me chuckle more than once and keeps the squad in good spirits. Fixer (Delta 40) is the brains of the team, he can hack anything and is a loyal soldier that follows orders perfectly, and does everything by the book. Sev (Delta 07) well ... Sev is Sev. Tick him off and he will kill you. Seriously, he will. He's the hot headed one that's just misunderstood, and will do anything for his brothers. He's a weapons expert and loves to kill anything that stands in the squads way. The squad AI is just perfect. I look at other stupid AI's in games, and think to myself, " Why can't all AI be as good as my squad?! " They follow your orders perfectly, warn you of enemies, and if you die they will fight tooth and nail to revive you. You really bond with your family. Yes, family. These are your brothers, and you feel close to them ... This story will make you laugh, grit your teeth, and cry. I wholly recommend this game. They just don't make 'em like this anymore ... EA is making Star Wars Imperial Commando 2 - DON'T screw it up EA. Or i'll have your heads on a plate. 10/10 easily.","May 9","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/6000/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Star Wars Republic Commando is a significant deviation from the previous Star Wars games I’ve played (Dark Forces/Jedi Knight) and definitely a more modern take on the franchise. If you thought it was weird how storm/clone troopers fought their enemies in battle lines like Civil War era musket infantry, you’ll appreciate the “special forces” feel of Republic Commando.\n\nThe game starts near the end of the second Star Wars prequel movie “Attack of the Clones” where the massive clone army is landing on the Separatist planet Geonosis. While the Jedi Knights and Grand Army of the Republic (clone troopers) are fighting on the surface, a four man group of clone commandos is performing covert actions in the underground Geonosian tunnels and even infiltrating the CIS command ships parked on the ground. You play Delta 38, the leader of Delta Squad, a team of “enhanced” clones who take on special assignments. It’s hinted in the opening animation that even though most clones are genetically identical, the commandos have some sort of physical superiority. You definitely have better firepower.\n\nRepublic Commando is a first person shooter with heavy squad based gameplay. With a single contextual “use” button, you issue orders to the other three commandos on your team such as door breach, focus target, hack consoles, etc. You can also order team members to use various fighting positions that appear on your hud. This includes sniping positions, grenade positions, and heavy weapon positions. Your computer controlled team has exactly the same weapons that you have, but most of the time they only use the special weapons when assigned to the special positions in the field. There aren’t that many weapons to choose from actually, but there’s plenty of ammo all over the place. This is good because most of the guns can be ineffective depending on who you’re fighting. If everyone has to die right now though, start throwing your grenades.\n\nPros:\n+A lot of teamwork involved in the single player campaign. In the sections where you’re fighting by yourself you will notice just how much harder the game is without your brothers backing you up. Most importantly, you won’t be revived if you get knocked out, which will happen A LOT.\n+The game runs parallel to the movie storylines (though movie characters don’t really show up) so if you’re familiar with the Star Wars prequel movies you’ll have a good idea what’s going on. There are three game campaigns: Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor (a spooky abandoned ship), and Kashyyyk (the Wookie home world). This isn’t Call of Duty where your team is a bunch of people you don’t care about. Your Delta Squad brothers are with you from beginning to end.\n+There’s quite a mix up of enemies to fight and usually you have a bunch of different ways to go about clearing a room. The easiest is usually busting out one of your 4 different types of grenades, but the heavy anti-armor gun is always fun too. You don’t get to control any vehicles like in the Battlefront games, but you can man a few different stationary gun turrets (or order your men to do it).\n\nCons:\n-The difficulty of the game seems to vary wildly, especially when dealing with enemies who use melee weapons. Sometimes they just seem to cut you down in one shot. This isn’t a big deal most of the time because your team members can quickly revive you, but during the second campaign, those scavenger droids are a nightmare. I get the feeling they’re just supposed to be an annoyance, but they can absolutely wreck you.\n-I mentioned before that the weapons seem weak, but they might just be more suited for fighting certain types of enemies.  Your blaster rifle is decent against the weak droids and Geonosians but seems to be terrible against everything else. There are a few different guns that you can pick up from fallen enemies as well, but with the exception of a couple rare ones, they’re not so hot either. Get used to emptying an entire clip to kill one enemy.\n-No co-op multiplayer! A game like this would be amazing if you could go through the game with a team of friends since the computer is already controlling the small team. Unfortunately the multiplayer seems to be restricted to basic PvP.\n\nOverall Republic Commando is probably my favorite Star Wars game (so far). It’s action packed with a strong story and it’s not so old that I’m embarrassed to run it on a modern computer. Definitely give the game a try if you can get your hands on it.\n","March 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I hadn't bought it before simply because i didn't know much about it and was simply going by word of mouth that it was a good game.\n\nThat being said, however, I would definitely pay full price for this game (maybe even $30-$40 for a graphical overhaul version)\n\nthis game, alongside other titans of the star wars series such as battlefront I & II (before DICE) is easily ne of the best games of it's time and will be an iconic standout, at least to me. the fact that this game even runs on my machine is a marvel, considering it's not even rated for windows 7 on a good computer and im runing it on a piece of trash with windows 10, another piece of trash. Many other reviews have mentioned bugs and crashing, this is simply because their V-Sync wasn't implemented well and the resolution needs to be changed through console commands to work properly(albeit they souldn't have to deal with these issues, they are not complex and im sure you can figure it out, if not the forums exist). on the topic of addressing complaints: the AI is a bit dated, but we're talking like Call of Duty MW3/BO2 era AI here, so i'm not really seeing and issue for this game. Literally any other game i've played from this era has left me agast at how one-sided ad flat the AI is and how unable it is to interact with the player and adapt to new requests. The only real issues i had with the AI was the occasional "oh hey imma switch cover i hope no one is throwing a grenade at my back on the way over."\n\nStability wise, the game never once crshed during gameplay and, barring particle effect stress on my APU, I had a constant 50+ FPS. with particle effects however, I did dip into the 20s but nothing below that, and this is on a 1.4 GHz 768 MB quad-core A8 5540M APU from AMD, so i can almost guarantee you will have a better experience than i did.\n\ngameplay wise, the game was excellent for tactical squad-based combat, and instilled mre of a reliance on actual planning than more modern games that use squad based gameplay. the game also has a decent variety of enemy types that will provide added difficulty or a nice peaceful grind, depending on the section of the game you are in.\n\non the topc of enemy variety, it is true that there are not many enemies used within the game itself, but the game does an excellent job of organizing and pacing the enemies you encounter, and also provides plenty of reason for why x group is with y group and why you aren't fighting z group. the enemies also come with a wide variety of classes, ranging from the piddly battle droid to massive spider droids, and so on.\n\non the topic of graphical fidelity, this game i an absolute marvel that they even got it to work on machines with the minimum requirements so well. despite and obvious low poly count, this game provides a wide variety of hi-res textures and strategic use of low-res textures, so as to not highlight them and say "hey look how bad this is" (albeit the last part kinda throws that out the window, you'll have to play and see). This game also introduces physics in an amazing way, however the ragdolls feel a bit floaty (not quite Dark Souls bad, but you get the drift).\n\ni give this game an easy 10/10 for it's era, but for today, not considering the sale price or that I got it free, this game gets an easy 8.5/10, maybe a 9.","May 5","true","14.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A single player squad based shooter that is also very fast paced is a rare find, and the game play is definitely fun.  You get to issue commands to 3 AI teammates who can hold their own quite well.  The banter is also pretty entertaining to listen to. Also, very rarely will you see your companions do stupid things.  We all know games where ai is more a hindrance then a benefit, and this is not one of those by any means.  You could just ignore squad commands most of the time, but telling a member to hole up in a sniper position will make them very much more effective.\n\nIt's a great game, that just happens to take place in the star wars universe.  Which is a very, very good thing if your a fan. If you are a fan of star wars don't even hesitate as this game is well worth your time.  If you don't care much for the franchise the game play is still very much worth a playthrough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdku/recommended/6000/","rdku","Rdku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdku/","164 products in account","This is without a doubt one of the best shooters and one of the best Star Wars games to date.\n\nIt may be almost 9 years old now, but it is still holding up pretty well. It was that much ahead of its time.\n\nThe game's story is not the most epic ever, but it should be enough to keep you interested until the end and it is also one of the more decent stories set in the already exhausted Clone Wars era. The characters are fun and likeable and the dialogue between them is well written.\n\nThe game is designed around one multiplayer component and a single player campaign. Personally I have not played multiplayer enough to give an opinion. The campaign is divided in 3 large chapters set in 3 different locales. Each chapter has multiple levels. The campaign is of moderate lenght. An estimate of about 8-10 hours are usually needed to finish it. One downside is that you cannot play the campaign in Co-op, which would have absolutely rocked. But allas, Co-op was not as widespread in 2005 as it is today.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game really shines. It is centered around you and your squad and the ability to give order to your squad members. The system is very simple but this makes it easy to use and alows the gameplay to remain relatively fast paced and entertaining. You don't have a wide variety of weapons. But you don't really need more weapons. The main focus of the game is for you to use your squad as a weapon. Speaking of the squad, unlike so many shooters, your squad mates are actually useful. If left to fend for themselves they won't take long to engage threats and defend themselves or take the initiative and revive a fallen squad member. When tasked with something they will do it effectively. The system really works well. The command system combined with the squad AI means that while you will have to micro-manage them in tighter situations, you can still also focus on engaging the enemies yourself. Enemies, like the weapons, don't come in a huge variety but they are enough to keep things interesting until the end. They are also not stupid and different enemies employ different tactics based on their strenghts. You're average separatist droid will act rather inneficient just like in the movies but get swarmed by a couple of them, or pair them with a heavy battle droid and the fight will become much harder.\n\nIn terms of sound and graphics the game is doing good even by today's standards. The sound is very well done and with a nice sountrack with both classical Star Wars themes and new ones made specifically for this game. This is a big plus especially since the new tracks are awesome. In terms of graphics, it looked amazing in 2005 but it still looks good today. The good thing is that you can easily edit a .ini file in the game folder to make the gameplay run at whatever resolution you want (1080p included).\n\nAll in all this is a game you really should play even if you are just a casual gamer and must play if you consider yourself a hardcore gamer or a Star Wars fan.","December 4, 2013","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently got it again through steam, and the game is better than i remember it being. In most games where you manage NPCs, they are either unhelpful or impossible to control. This game does not have that problem at all, the rest of your squad is very helpful and would be impossible without them. Also they are very easy to get them to do what you want them to do. I recommend this game to people who like shooters for you can be the biggest factor in completing a mission with your expert aim. I also recommed this game to people who like strategy games because you can miss all of your shots and still beat it on the hardest difficulty. The importance of managing your team is so prevelent that by setting this up right you can win without ever firing a shot. This game has a good balance of the player being able to have a change in the battle, and also not being the key role of a battle. You can change it for good, but the battle won't be lost if you do not meet the "skill level".","April 2, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign is of moderate lenght. An estimate of about 8-10 hours are usually needed to finish it. One downside is that you cannot play the campaign in Co-op, which would have absolutely rocked. But allas, Co-op was not as widespread in 2005 as it is today.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game really shines. It is centered around you and your squad and the ability to give order to your squad members. The system is very simple but this makes it easy to use and alows the gameplay to remain relatively fast paced and entertaining. You don't have a wide variety of weapons. But you don't really need more weapons. The main focus of the game is for you to use your squad as a weapon. Speaking of the squad, unlike so many shooters, your squad mates are actually useful. If left to fend for themselves they won't take long to engage threats and defend themselves or take the initiative and revive a fallen squad member. When tasked with something they will do it effectively. The system really works well. The command system combined with the squad AI means that while you will have to micro-manage them in tighter situations, you can still also focus on engaging the enemies yourself. Enemies, like the weapons, don't come in a huge variety but they are enough to keep things interesting until the end. They are also not stupid and different enemies employ different tactics based on their strenghts. You're average separatist droid will act rather inneficient just like in the movies but get swarmed by a couple of them, or pair them with a heavy battle droid and the fight will become much harder.\n\nIn terms of sound and graphics the game is doing good even by today's standards. The sound is very well done and with a nice sountrack with both classical Star Wars themes and new ones made specifically for this game. This is a big plus especially since the new tracks are awesome. In terms of graphics, it looked amazing in 2005 but it still looks good today. The good thing is that you can easily edit a .ini file in the game folder to make the gameplay run at whatever resolution you want (1080p included).\n\nAll in all this is a game you really should play even if you are just a casual gamer and must play if you consider yourself a hardcore gamer or a Star Wars fan.","December 4, 2013","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently got it again through steam, and the game is better than i remember it being. In most games where you manage NPCs, they are either unhelpful or impossible to control. This game does not have that problem at all, the rest of your squad is very helpful and would be impossible without them. Also they are very easy to get them to do what you want them to do. I recommend this game to people who like shooters for you can be the biggest factor in completing a mission with your expert aim. I also recommed this game to people who like strategy games because you can miss all of your shots and still beat it on the hardest difficulty. The importance of managing your team is so prevelent that by setting this up right you can win without ever firing a shot. This game has a good balance of the player being able to have a change in the battle, and also not being the key role of a battle. You can change it for good, but the battle won't be lost if you do not meet the "skill level".","April 2, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Knights of the Old Rebublic and Battlefront II and while I admit they are very well made games and do somewhat deserve their titles as some of the best the Star Wars series has offered us for some reason Republic Commando went a bit oveshadowed.\n\nRepublic Commando in my honest opinion deserve to be called at the very least a great game with solid mechanics and fun gameplay. The characters are memorable to a good degree, I have my favorites but they're all different and have their moments. The shooting is fun and the weapons are varied enough for me to look foward to the next big push my squad and I have to do. The campaign is fairly weak but each mission is a solid and well built section of the game and I will admit one in particular made me paranoid with the atmosphere. Your enemies are fun and the bigger encounters are very difficult to deal with sometimes which I personally like because it means I need to use my squad to it's potential and figure out how to deal with taking or eliminating the objective. The game also uses a shield and health-bar system like Halo: Combat Evolved which I personaly love in games.\n\nThis game is totally worth looking into if you're looking for a solid shooter with fun encounters, good weapons, enjoyable squad mechanics and a new look into how the Clone wars were fought. Just don't come for the story because you won't be pleased by how engaging it isn't.\n","May 3, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting is superb, and really adds to the immersive gameplay. The different personalities of your squadmates, and their periodic jest at each other really adds up to the feeling of coming together with your squad.\n\nGraphics: While the game was released in 2005, the graphics are really not terrible, and were no big deal while I played. For me (and other people I am sure) graphics don't matter as much as a good story or immersiveness. Still, the graphics are pleasing to the eye, the HUD is nice, and the animations are great.\n\nImmersiveness: It may just be me, but from the beginning to the end I found myself extremely immersed into the game at times. From ordering my squadmates around, strategically placing charges and having them cover me, making sure my mates always had enough health, it went on and on throughout the game, which really impressed me. The enviroment is a big key in this factor, from managing large areas with my squad to cover ground or cautiously stalking in a claustrophobic tunnel, it really determined how immersive the game could be.\n\nSquad Mechanics: This is not a game where you can NOT run into a room and expect to kill everything. You need your squad, and your squad needs you. I found very quickly that bulldozing into the next area without any plan whatsoever soon became a terrible idea. Like most older FPS games, this one is brutal. Enemies are difficult to kill without your squads support fire and strategic placement. Something I found interesting is your squad's reactions to cetain events. I was running through a bug tunnel on Geonosis, and I believe one had snuck up behind me, and all of a sudden I hear, "Sir! behind you!" It was a very cool mechanic that I thought was unique in a way, especially for an older game. (Not saying that old games can't be good in ways that you wouldn't know, it just surprised me.)\n\nSound:  The sound in this game is fantastic, and the soundtrack fits perfectly with the missions.\n\nIn-Between:\n\nSquad A.I: While other people have pointed out that the Squad A.I is, 'limited' I found it to not really be that bad. To be honest, the A.I goes a bit beyond the standard of today's games (looking at you, CoD) as far as squadmates usefullness. While they do take your commands, they will often times do things you could have told them to do on their own accord, such as reviving a squadmate, defending a postion, providing covering fire, and throwing a well-needed grenade here and there. Sure, they sometimes get in the way, but usually they will move, and if you stand in the way, they'll usually ask you to move. Overall I feel the A.I is extremely smart for a game of it's age, and while not fantastic, it certainly meets the modern standards.\n\nCons: Very tiny things such as a few (easy to fix) graphical issues.\n\nSide-Note: This was stated before in another review, but I'd like to restate it and agree, this game is linear from beginning to end. As,"Miyumi Ayase," stated, THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. Some games perform better in a linear setting, and this one especially. It wants to tell a story in a progressive way, with events that all add up to the ending.\n\nConclusion:\nA must own for any Star Wars fan, FPS fan, Sci-Fi fan, basically, just buy it. Now. I convinced you, now buy it.","May 6, 2014","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion it has also aged well.\n\nYou are Delta 38, leader of the 4-man Delta Team who are clone troopers with advanced equipment and medical implants, as well as more personality to help with creative thinking.\nThe gameplay mostly revolves around ordering your squad members into positions, which also tells them what weapons to use. Best of all your squad will actually do what you tell them to, even if it gets them taken out. Makes you wonder how Fallout 4 still can't fix companions standing in doorways!\n\nKnow that the first area (Geonosis) is the least fun, so stick with it. As you progress the game (slowly) gives you more options, as in there will be more positions than you have squad members, so you will have to make quick decisions while under fire. The pacing gets faster as well, both from more dangerous enemies and more heavy weapons available, but also thanks to good storytelling and use of the loud, epic music this game has.\n\nThere are good mods to fix common graphical issues/crashes and allow higher resolutions (I played it in 4K).\n\nUnfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger as it sets up for a sequel that never came.\n\nBut yay, Wookie life-debts for everybody!","November 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this game still holds its own. The graphics are dated but gunplay and gameplay is fun. Some small AI bugs and some funny glitches, I only found ONE game breaking which happened YEARS ago. It was when a Delta got stuck in a pit and refused to do anything. I could continue level, but I reloaded it cause I didnt want him in the hole. I never got to play multi so I dont have opinion on that. I found the game fun in general and I have played through it multiple times. I think this game still holds its own, but it would be REALLY NICE if this game got a sequel. I doubt it will happen, but battle front got one, right? (Even though from what I hear so far its not good). Well, if you stuck with me this far, then I recommend if you havent already, give it a try.","November 17, 2015","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every vibrant blaster bolt feels impactful, the onslaught of A.I. and explosions around every corner feels climatic in scale even in tight quarters. Being it's so dated, it's really not that hard to find a computer that meets up to specs with the game. So you shouldn't find many frame rate drops, clipping, major bugs, or anything that would ruin your immersion. I wouldn't say it's the "best looking" Star Wars game but it's defintely up there.\n\nAs far as I can tell everything ran smoothly until a climax in the second chapter where some 4 turrets, 3 Super Battle Droids, and at least 8 regular droids were all firing missiles and potshotting around the room, meanwhile the environment was shaking and exploding. That's when I felt a minor drop in framerate but that's mostly due to my system specs which are REALLY not up to par.\n\nGameplay: It does indeed get a little repetitive as you progress but nevertheless EVERY firefight is challenging. You're well equipped for war. With a the cliches of pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, and grenade launcher as standard Republic Commando weapons you eventually find shotguns, bowcasters, beam weapons and more. But the thing is, you're always on the brink of running out. With that and maintaining your squad of fellow Republic Commandos by giving them orders such as taking sniping positions, blowing up objectives, and maintaining their health the game is always tense and still is challenging to this day.\nWhich I’d like to clear up and say, commanding your squad is not only vital to even remotely completing the game but is the best thing about it. You’d be retreating from rounding around a corner barking out order after order. “Get ready on your sniper, get yourself some bacta, defend this position”. All one command after another, like clockwork.\n\nThis factor really kicks into high gear the second you have your squad together. There’s a couple solo missions which I’m going flat out say, “you’re going to miss your team”. That mechanic and sort of “security” you feel with them is the core of the game. The second it’s ever taken away either through the story mission itself or if everyone dies, it’s pure trouble in the best way possible. You feel vulnerable (well equipped, yes, but very vulnerable).\n\nThere aren't any vehicles beyond turrets so this isn't to the scale of let's say, Battlefront. The maps are linear but massive to what its worth and there's an appropriate onslaught of enemies to keep fights interesting. There are indeed a couple repetitive moments where you'd rather have a boss fight but instead have to bunker down and mow through a dozen some enemies to blow up their spawning zones. From Geonosis to Kashyyyk to abandoned warships the game has enough variation in map design to also keep you invested.\n\nSound and Music: This is arguably THE best soundtrack I’ve EVER heard of in a Star Wars shooter. It’s not always a rehash of John William’s sweeping scores, but it also includes Mandalorian chants and war songs which make it VERY invigorating.\nIt’s worthy of keeping on your music playing device!\nThe sound is crisp, clear, and full of sheer power. Every explosion feels impactful and every blaster shot feels like it would kill you if you stood in front of it (which some will). From the “thunk” of a grenade launcher to the clanking fall and explosion of droids the game “feels” so close to the Star Wars franchise it’s ridiculous and most of the new weapons have proprietary and unique tones which weren’t featured in the films. So you have a unique mix of sounds, some amazing original scores, and overall a fantastic auditory experience.\n\nStory: It's your typical war story in a video game where you're tasked with several missions that boil down to a climatic conclusion where it would allude  to another conflict. But that's the problem, there's NO direct sequel to this beyond Karen Traviss’ books (which were considered canon back in the day and were a FANTASTIC read).\n\nSo if you want to know about the fate of the team beyond this game, you need to read the books. Nevertheless, you may complain, "why does every clone sound different to one another" but again this is explained in other media. However, the biggest delight (story-wise) is the characterization and personality.\n\nEvery team members has a (albeit cliche) personality. You have the wisecracking demolitionist, the serious brutal sniper, the "by the book" technician and you the leader. However it's the banter when you go between objectives that's memorable, funny, and even looks at a different side of clone troopers that you'd typically don't see in the films.\n\nI will say though it's a shame to have a story that really is asking for a sequel but, it never did or will happen. Which normally, I would slander much like how Rage by iD was going for; however, in this case, given there is other media that reinforces the best qualities of this game, I'm actually very fine with it.\n\nThe voice acting is great with Temuera Morrison embalming your playable character, Andrew Chaikin as "Fixer" (who was Grendel from Wolf Among us), Raphael Sbarge as "Scorch" (who played as Kaidan from Mass Effect), then Jonathan David Cook was "Sev" (who played Earl from StarCraft 2 Wings of Liberty). You have a great cast who execute their characters perfectly.\n\nConcluding thoughts:\nIf you're looking for a great FPS with excellent characterization and want to know more about the culture and philosophy of the more elite troopers, this is the game for you. It's been a pleasure despite only playing through this once.\n\nI'll definitely come back but the only reason why I have yet to go back to it is simply because I play other games beyond what's in my Steam Library. Nevertheless the experience was SO interesting to the point I bought and have read every single Republic Commando book that DelRey offers and to a fault the books expand the game so much that it's more pleasurable.\n\nI don't give out a number rating but rather a "buy immediately, consider buying, do extended research, and don't even bother" sort of scale. I say "consider buying". It's not THE FPS of the century but it's up there with the more memorable ones. I gotta say I remember more character dialogue from this squad of 4 compared to ANY AAA military FPS's that came out in the past 4 years. If you love clones, want to know more about them, and want a challenging FPS with some minor squad commands consider picking this one up. For the price? It was worth every penny!\n\nIf you pick it up, be sure to blast some clankers for me! :)","February 1, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In 2015 it still remains one of the best Star War games ever to be created and im trully sad to admit, i didnt appreciate it in its time of release. Back at the time i felt the game was really hard even on normal and i couldnt get accustomised with the various game mechanics. Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.\n\nIn this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game.\n\nAs with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.\nIn terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.\n\nThe graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.\n\nAll and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!","July 5, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackbaldrik/recommended/6000/","Blackbaldrik","Blackbaldrik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackbaldrik/","405 products in account","I recently picked this game up to see if it was actually as good as I remembered it being. (The love of old games is often just a cloud of nostalgia and vague memories from a time when you didn't have anything better to play)\nHaving just beat the game, I can say beyong all doubt Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of the best Star Wars games ever made.  The graphics are still passable by today's standards, and the controls are quite solid. But where it really shines is the AI.  This is the only single-player game I have ever played that actually managed to feel like it was multiplayer.\nEvery member of your squad is about as important as you are.  You are not some super-human bullet sponge, you need them to push forward, and often, to clean up the mess when you get yourself killed like an idiot. (About 40-50% of the time, ordering an immediate revive is not a good idea. It just puts your squad in range of enemy fire.)\n\nThere are only a few things I didn't like about this game: (#1) There is a mission where they remove your squad.  It sucks. Removing the squad in a squad-based game was not a good idea. (#2) The game ends somewhat abruptly.  It feels like they were intending a sequel that ended up never happening.  And (#3) Very, very rarely, the AI will freak out a little, or the game will think a teammate is dead when they aren't so it won't let you heal them.\n\nOverall, great game. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing it.","May 28, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.

For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI.\n\nThe game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement.\n\nNow, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.\n\nNormally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.\n\nThe story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.\n\n9/10\n","September 11, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(The love of old games is often just a cloud of nostalgia and vague memories from a time when you didn't have anything better to play)\nHaving just beat the game, I can say beyong all doubt Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of the best Star Wars games ever made.  The graphics are still passable by today's standards, and the controls are quite solid. But where it really shines is the AI.  This is the only single-player game I have ever played that actually managed to feel like it was multiplayer.\nEvery member of your squad is about as important as you are.  You are not some super-human bullet sponge, you need them to push forward, and often, to clean up the mess when you get yourself killed like an idiot. (About 40-50% of the time, ordering an immediate revive is not a good idea. It just puts your squad in range of enemy fire.)\n\nThere are only a few things I didn't like about this game: (#1) There is a mission where they remove your squad.  It sucks. Removing the squad in a squad-based game was not a good idea. (#2) The game ends somewhat abruptly.  It feels like they were intending a sequel that ended up never happening.  And (#3) Very, very rarely, the AI will freak out a little, or the game will think a teammate is dead when they aren't so it won't let you heal them.\n\nOverall, great game. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing it.","May 28, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is star wars Republic Commandos. In the introduction you are shown the early years of a clone through quick clips of training introducing your squad. Your excellently written and acted squad is comprised of Fixer, the hacker and technical expert, Sev who is the hunter and sniper of the group who jokes around with Scorch, the demolitions expert who is always telling jokes at the worst of times. You and your squad fight on iconic planets from the movies such as Geonosis and Kashyyyk doing missons such as killing geonosian leaders, blowing up droid factories and saving wookie generals. The game is a first person shooter (obviously) with some strategy elements involved via squad commands such as ordering your troops to move to tactical positions, provide covering fire, attack targeted enemies and seize objectives. Certain actions will play to a commando's strengths like Sev is the best with a sniper and Scorch arms explosives faster and Fixer hacks quicker. This game looks good even though it came out about a decade ago and has really nice level design. The campaign is short lasting about 5-7 hours but it makes you eager for more and the story set up a sequel which we unfortunately never got but i hope that one day we will. All in all i give this game an 8/10, i would have rated if the campaign was slightly longer.","June 28, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In 2015 it still remains one of the best Star War games ever to be created and im trully sad to admit, i didnt appreciate it in its time of release. Back at the time i felt the game was really hard even on normal and i couldnt get accustomised with the various game mechanics. Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.\n\nIn this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game.\n\nAs with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.\nIn terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.\n\nThe graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.\n\nAll and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!","July 5, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game you are 1 of many clones being trained to be Commando's of the Republic on Kamino. Basically the Republic Commandos are the Navy Seals of the Star wars universe. The game takes place during Episode 2: The Clone Wars and is supposed to bridge the gap between Ep2 and Ep3. I always found this game awesome because of the perspective. What I mean by that is that most star wars games always focus on the Jedi or you are this master sith lord or something that gives you an advantage over the others. While in this game it gives you a soldiers perspective of the Clone Wars, which was greatly overlooked during the films. You play as the leader of Delta Squad; a 4 man expertly trained group each with special abilities and skill sets. Sev is the Sniper, Fixer is the hacker, Scorch is the demolitions expert and you... well you are simply the Boss. Although the game emphasizes that each has special ability sets, anyone of your group can do the task you tell them todo. The game is one of the first games that I know of that puts you in control of AI. For example if you see a vantage point you can call out one of the commandos to snipe over there, or if you notice one member is low on health you may send them off to heal. This mechanic brings a variety of ways to play the game but also makes you actually feel like the leader of this squad. Each of the characters in my opinion each have their own personality that doesnt make them dull or boring and makes you want to care for them. The game starts you off on an assassination mission on Geonosis but then leads to other planets like Kashyyyk and broken down space carriers. I personally loved the campaign because you are only a soldier so alot of the time you are just as curious of the mission as they are. The game has great combat with a variety of weapons and a fair difficulty level that you can change at any time. The grittiness that this game brings to the star wars universe is awesome and is defiantly  a must play for any Star Wars fan that can find a original Xbox copy or buys it for $10 off Steam.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis game is a great first person shooter that takes place in the star wars universe and should be played by anyone who enjoys that. Also the game has team deathmatch multiplayer so if you are into that sort of thing you should play now before the servers shut down!\n\n9/10","June 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The multiplayer brings back so many memories. While the official servers are no longer a thing, there are still some third party servers around so look out for them but once you do, you'll no doubt have plenty of fun. Sadly Delta Squad, despite a small cameo in the Clone Wars cartoon, have since been completly forgotten about which is a real shame.

(The love of old games is often just a cloud of nostalgia and vague memories from a time when you didn't have anything better to play)\nHaving just beat the game, I can say beyong all doubt Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of the best Star Wars games ever made.  The graphics are still passable by today's standards, and the controls are quite solid. But where it really shines is the AI.  This is the only single-player game I have ever played that actually managed to feel like it was multiplayer.\nEvery member of your squad is about as important as you are.  You are not some super-human bullet sponge, you need them to push forward, and often, to clean up the mess when you get yourself killed like an idiot. (About 40-50% of the time, ordering an immediate revive is not a good idea. It just puts your squad in range of enemy fire.)\n\nThere are only a few things I didn't like about this game: (#1) There is a mission where they remove your squad.  It sucks. Removing the squad in a squad-based game was not a good idea. (#2) The game ends somewhat abruptly.  It feels like they were intending a sequel that ended up never happening.  And (#3) Very, very rarely, the AI will freak out a little, or the game will think a teammate is dead when they aren't so it won't let you heal them.\n\nOverall, great game. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing it.","May 28, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI.\n\nThe game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement.\n\nNow, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.\n\nNormally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.\n\nThe story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.\n\n9/10\n","September 11, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hell, being able to shoot off the heads of battle droids is worth the entry price. The only other real problem is that it doesn’t last very long, with just the three big missions in as many different locations to complete, and whatever multiplayer capabilities it once had are likely unsupported nowadays. In fact, Steam eerily informed me that I played the game for precisely 9.6 hours, which isn’t too much. Nevertheless, what little time it takes to finish will be chock-full of excitement, and finishing Hard will take some doing, so there’s undoubtedly replay value present. Find it for a fiver on whatever platform takes your fancy and you’ll be entirely happy with your dark, tactics-driven laser-fest.","July 11, 2011","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Your squad members have different personalities. Funny, reckless, and serious. You have to complete campaigns, which can take quite a long time to complete. Your squad members have different abilities, one's good at explosives, one's good at computers, and one's good at sniping. You can assign them to do things. The shooting is like CoD, but the graphics are a bit outdated. I'd recommend this game, it's a good Star Wars FPS  game - possibly one of the best made. 9.5/10","December 31, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game you are 1 of many clones being trained to be Commando's of the Republic on Kamino. Basically the Republic Commandos are the Navy Seals of the Star wars universe. The game takes place during Episode 2: The Clone Wars and is supposed to bridge the gap between Ep2 and Ep3. I always found this game awesome because of the perspective. What I mean by that is that most star wars games always focus on the Jedi or you are this master sith lord or something that gives you an advantage over the others. While in this game it gives you a soldiers perspective of the Clone Wars, which was greatly overlooked during the films. You play as the leader of Delta Squad; a 4 man expertly trained group each with special abilities and skill sets. Sev is the Sniper, Fixer is the hacker, Scorch is the demolitions expert and you... well you are simply the Boss. Although the game emphasizes that each has special ability sets, anyone of your group can do the task you tell them todo. The game is one of the first games that I know of that puts you in control of AI. For example if you see a vantage point you can call out one of the commandos to snipe over there, or if you notice one member is low on health you may send them off to heal. This mechanic brings a variety of ways to play the game but also makes you actually feel like the leader of this squad. Each of the characters in my opinion each have their own personality that doesnt make them dull or boring and makes you want to care for them. The game starts you off on an assassination mission on Geonosis but then leads to other planets like Kashyyyk and broken down space carriers. I personally loved the campaign because you are only a soldier so alot of the time you are just as curious of the mission as they are. The game has great combat with a variety of weapons and a fair difficulty level that you can change at any time. The grittiness that this game brings to the star wars universe is awesome and is defiantly  a must play for any Star Wars fan that can find a original Xbox copy or buys it for $10 off Steam.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis game is a great first person shooter that takes place in the star wars universe and should be played by anyone who enjoys that. Also the game has team deathmatch multiplayer so if you are into that sort of thing you should play now before the servers shut down!\n\n9/10","June 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is my second favorite star wars shooter, barley falling below BattleFront 2. The Story is amazing, the atmosphere makes you feel like a badass, while at the same time feeling so weak and fragile. (Especially when fighting Super Battle Droids) This game is a must with either friends or being alone, as the AI will follow orders and even in today's standards are smart and think well. The HUD idea is great, it gives the look as if you are the clone itself. The graphics hold well, and the combat is spectacular. After playing this, you will have a craving for a sequel, and want to have a higher standard in today's shooter games. 10 out of 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katana999/recommended/6000/","katana999","Roberto Carlos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katana999/","124 products in account","So I first played this game way back on the original XBOX like some odd 8/9 years ago. I was (math is hard) 9 or 10 then, and I thought the game was cool, but it wasn't ground breaking or life fulfilling. So I played it, beat it, and really didn't think about it too much.\n\nTime passed and now I'm 18. I saw this was on sale and I said to myself, "Hey, I totally remember this game from way back when! I've got some spare pre-Christmas dough, so lets give it a go!"\n\nBest 3 bucks I've spent in a while.\n\nPRO   Obviously, amazing price tag. 3 bucks is basically less than a half hour's work at minimum wage.\nSolid core gameplay mechanics. The A.I. is reaaaaly good for this time of development, and squad commands and actions are smooth and natural.\nAtmospheric environments. Cliche, I know, but this game hits it home on the atmosphere. As a commando, you really get a Halo ODST feel to your character (really bada** but not Master Chief-invincible) (BTW I'm not comparing ODST to this game bc I know a lot of people feel strongly about the game but w/e ok back to main points). For example, on a specific mission you go onto a derelict, abandoned Republic destroyer to investigate why it went missing. As you enter the ship, you get overwhelmed with just how big the ship is. Your squad splits up to cover as much ground as possible, so you go alone into your section of the ship. It's got a nice Death Troopers feel to it (GREAT BOOK BTW).\nAMAZING CHARACTERIZATION. So this one is really important to me. I feel like lately I have played waaaaayyy too many games that just throw in characters somewhat relevant to the storyline without actually giving half a crap about establishing who they are, where they come from and how they act. Sev, Fixer, and Scorch (your squadmates) all come from the same clone production facility and program, but they have DISTINCTLY different and memorable personalities. Sev is your deep voiced, hunt-loving, bada** sniper. Fixer is your narcissistic and protocol following technician. Scorch is your curious, optomistic, reckless explosive specialist. Seriously good work put in here. Oh yeah and they don't just tell you who they are at the beginning of the game and then treat them as generic clone troopers the rest. Their character traits and facets stick with you throughout.\nStreamlined HUD and squad commands. They put in basic controls for your squad (Attack formation, defensive formation, defend area, regroup) that just about anyone with a cheese brain can conquer. They also designated certain cover positions to be used for lobbing grenades, sniping, or AT weaponry, which is a nice touch and a boon to locking down an area. Also, your hud is like actually looking through a trooper's helmet. So that's +1 for atmosphere again.\nDiverse yet comprehensive inventory. Your sniper rifle, rocket launcher, and machine gun are all variants of your blaster rifle; it creates a professional feel about your loadout. You also have your handy-dandy blaster pistol, which is a good backup. Lastly, you're kitted with 3 different grenades (Thermal detonator, flashbang, and anti-mech EMPs. You can also pick up alien grenades too.). Added on to your traditional inventory, you can pick up elite weapons from dead enemies if they drop them. The hardest enemies to kill drop the best weapons to use. Dope.\nThere's more I could touch on, but those are the basics. Cons would be a slight lack of content and game-time, lack of multiplayer/other gamemode, and sometimes buggy AI but I'm forgiving on that. All in all a great game. I can appreciate the theatrics and core mechanics of the game now more than I could back then, and by heavens I hope that someone someday comes out with a worthwhile sequel to this.\n\nIf you're a fan of Star Wars, I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this. The storyline covers some aspects the movies don't, and the ending is very satisfying to the total storyline of SW.\n\nIf you're not a huge fan, I still reccomend. This game can be really difficult at times, but it's still a worthwhile FP shooter that should be tried out. If you absolutlely hate it, it's still only just 3 bucks (at least right now).\n\n9.5/10 ayy lmao","December 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(The love of old games is often just a cloud of nostalgia and vague memories from a time when you didn't have anything better to play)\nHaving just beat the game, I can say beyong all doubt Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of the best Star Wars games ever made.  The graphics are still passable by today's standards, and the controls are quite solid. But where it really shines is the AI.  This is the only single-player game I have ever played that actually managed to feel like it was multiplayer.\nEvery member of your squad is about as important as you are.  You are not some super-human bullet sponge, you need them to push forward, and often, to clean up the mess when you get yourself killed like an idiot. (About 40-50% of the time, ordering an immediate revive is not a good idea. It just puts your squad in range of enemy fire.)\n\nThere are only a few things I didn't like about this game: (#1) There is a mission where they remove your squad.  It sucks. Removing the squad in a squad-based game was not a good idea. (#2) The game ends somewhat abruptly.  It feels like they were intending a sequel that ended up never happening.  And (#3) Very, very rarely, the AI will freak out a little, or the game will think a teammate is dead when they aren't so it won't let you heal them.\n\nOverall, great game. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing it.","May 28, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion it has also aged well.\n\nYou are Delta 38, leader of the 4-man Delta Team who are clone troopers with advanced equipment and medical implants, as well as more personality to help with creative thinking.\nThe gameplay mostly revolves around ordering your squad members into positions, which also tells them what weapons to use. Best of all your squad will actually do what you tell them to, even if it gets them taken out. Makes you wonder how Fallout 4 still can't fix companions standing in doorways!\n\nKnow that the first area (Geonosis) is the least fun, so stick with it. As you progress the game (slowly) gives you more options, as in there will be more positions than you have squad members, so you will have to make quick decisions while under fire. The pacing gets faster as well, both from more dangerous enemies and more heavy weapons available, but also thanks to good storytelling and use of the loud, epic music this game has.\n\nThere are good mods to fix common graphical issues/crashes and allow higher resolutions (I played it in 4K).\n\nUnfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger as it sets up for a sequel that never came.\n\nBut yay, Wookie life-debts for everybody!","November 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katana999/recommended/6000/","katana999","Roberto Carlos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katana999/","124 products in account","So I first played this game way back on the original XBOX like some odd 8/9 years ago. I was (math is hard) 9 or 10 then, and I thought the game was cool, but it wasn't ground breaking or life fulfilling. So I played it, beat it, and really didn't think about it too much.\n\nTime passed and now I'm 18. I saw this was on sale and I said to myself, "Hey, I totally remember this game from way back when! I've got some spare pre-Christmas dough, so lets give it a go!"\n\nBest 3 bucks I've spent in a while.\n\nPRO   Obviously, amazing price tag. 3 bucks is basically less than a half hour's work at minimum wage.\nSolid core gameplay mechanics. The A.I. is reaaaaly good for this time of development, and squad commands and actions are smooth and natural.\nAtmospheric environments. Cliche, I know, but this game hits it home on the atmosphere. As a commando, you really get a Halo ODST feel to your character (really bada** but not Master Chief-invincible) (BTW I'm not comparing ODST to this game bc I know a lot of people feel strongly about the game but w/e ok back to main points). For example, on a specific mission you go onto a derelict, abandoned Republic destroyer to investigate why it went missing. As you enter the ship, you get overwhelmed with just how big the ship is. Your squad splits up to cover as much ground as possible, so you go alone into your section of the ship. It's got a nice Death Troopers feel to it (GREAT BOOK BTW).\nAMAZING CHARACTERIZATION. So this one is really important to me. I feel like lately I have played waaaaayyy too many games that just throw in characters somewhat relevant to the storyline without actually giving half a crap about establishing who they are, where they come from and how they act. Sev, Fixer, and Scorch (your squadmates) all come from the same clone production facility and program, but they have DISTINCTLY different and memorable personalities. Sev is your deep voiced, hunt-loving, bada** sniper. Fixer is your narcissistic and protocol following technician. Scorch is your curious, optomistic, reckless explosive specialist. Seriously good work put in here. Oh yeah and they don't just tell you who they are at the beginning of the game and then treat them as generic clone troopers the rest. Their character traits and facets stick with you throughout.\nStreamlined HUD and squad commands. They put in basic controls for your squad (Attack formation, defensive formation, defend area, regroup) that just about anyone with a cheese brain can conquer. They also designated certain cover positions to be used for lobbing grenades, sniping, or AT weaponry, which is a nice touch and a boon to locking down an area. Also, your hud is like actually looking through a trooper's helmet. So that's +1 for atmosphere again.\nDiverse yet comprehensive inventory. Your sniper rifle, rocket launcher, and machine gun are all variants of your blaster rifle; it creates a professional feel about your loadout. You also have your handy-dandy blaster pistol, which is a good backup. Lastly, you're kitted with 3 different grenades (Thermal detonator, flashbang, and anti-mech EMPs. You can also pick up alien grenades too.). Added on to your traditional inventory, you can pick up elite weapons from dead enemies if they drop them. The hardest enemies to kill drop the best weapons to use. Dope.\nThere's more I could touch on, but those are the basics. Cons would be a slight lack of content and game-time, lack of multiplayer/other gamemode, and sometimes buggy AI but I'm forgiving on that. All in all a great game. I can appreciate the theatrics and core mechanics of the game now more than I could back then, and by heavens I hope that someone someday comes out with a worthwhile sequel to this.\n\nIf you're a fan of Star Wars, I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this. The storyline covers some aspects the movies don't, and the ending is very satisfying to the total storyline of SW.\n\nIf you're not a huge fan, I still reccomend. This game can be really difficult at times, but it's still a worthwhile FP shooter that should be tried out. If you absolutlely hate it, it's still only just 3 bucks (at least right now).\n\n9.5/10 ayy lmao","December 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will however state that I absolutely love this game.\nDon't let the few hours clocked on Steam fool you. I only bought it on Steam because it's more convenient than using 2 very worn CDs.\nI've played the campaign at least a dozen times over the years. Sadly, the campaign is short, but in no way does the campaign length negatively impact the absolute quality of this game.\nBest squad-shooter I've ever played. Excellent voice acting. Squadmate lines are witty and charming, and the squad is extremely affable. There is no way you will not like all of them, though it is very likely that you'll have a favourite. Mine is Scorch :)\nAnd you will experience true loneliness when you and your squad split up on several occasions to achieve independent objectives.\n\nAgain, I love this game above all others and I would recommend this game to anyone, anyday and everyday, Star Wars fan or otherwise.\n\nIf you value exellent gameplay, simple yet elegant squad mechanics, amazing voice acting, witty one-liners, affable teammates, dark and immersive atmosphere, brilliant music and everything else that makes an excellent game excellent, you would be severely amiss to let this game go unplayed. And when you're done with it, play it again. And again.\nOne play through hardly does the game justice as it impossible to get take notice of all the gems it offers with just one play through.\n\nInfinity/10.\n\n"Clone Advisor: Delta Squad, clear that promenade!\nScorch: Promenade, sir?\nFixer: Shut it, Six-Two."","November 26, 2015","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crocve/recommended/6000/","crocve","StupidSexyCrocve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crocve/","56 products in account","Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.\n\nI agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.\n\nStill, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.\n\nLike many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars "BattleFront" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF "BATTELFRONT" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.\n\n7.5 out of 10\n","December 30, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Star Wars Republic Commando is an FPS based on the lives of Delta Squad, 4 elite clone commandos who are sent on the most dangerous and imperative missions the republic has to offer.  Each one has his own distinct personality and all 4 of them (you play as squad leader) are pretty likable characters.  Here are the commandos in order:\n\n38 "three-eight" aka "Boss" or "Sir"- the squad leader and the player character. He is fully voiced by Temuera Morrison, the voice actor for Boba and Jango Fett in the films.  38 (said literally "three-eight")  is a no nonsense commander with a head for strategy and a dry sense of humor.  He leads the squad (obviously) and is able to issue orders to the other 3 commandos, for example, he can tell them to set up sniper positions, anti armor, mount turrets, use healing stations, etc.  (btw these are actual game mechanics, issueing orders to your squad is a huge part of the game).  He has all the weapons that the other 3 commandos are capable of wielding but unlike the others he is capable of using special, enemy weapons that can be found off certain foes.\n\n40 "four-oh" aka "Fixer"- Fixer is the tech specialist of the squad and specialises in hacking and computer interfaces, he is very useful for hacking terminals.  While all the commandos have the same skills and abilities, some are better than others at certain things.  For example, Fixer can hack faster than the others, Scorch is more accurate with grenades and can set explosives faster and Sev is a deadeye with a sniper rifle.  Fixer takes his job verrry seriously and doesn't talk about much other than the mission or how to accomplish it, but he does have moments where he loosens up.  Fixer is exceptional at melee combat and dispatches melee using foes with ease.\n\n62 "six-two" aka "Scorch"-  Scorch is the squad demolitionist and explosive expert and his outlook on life relfects that.  He loves danger and has a very positive, optimistic viewpoint on any sitution, using humor to deal with even the most harrowing of missions.  He is the squad funny guy and his upbeat personality is definitely helpful when things look grim.  Scorch's preferred weapon of choice is the anti-armor grenade launcher and grenades themselves.\n\n07 "oh-seven" aka "Sev"-  Sev is the designated marksman and stealth fighter of the squad and revels in war and battle.  He is a deadly sniper and the best shot in the squad (other than the player).  He is probably the most mandalorian out of the squad and by that I mean he lives for war.  62 finds his fervor for killing to be a bit creepy at times but he is a good soldier and a good friend... and a truly terrible enemy.  Sev's weapon of choice is the sniper rifle, which he uses with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nThe game's combat is pretty good and the squad AI is amazing even for today, the commandos feel very human and real.  The game even has multiplayer which I'm not sure if there is anyone on it anymore but it was good in its own way as well.\n\nThe story is pretty good and involving and gets pretty hectic at times which keeps things interesting.\n\nAll in all this is one of the best star wars games out there and I highly reccomend it for any star wars fan.  I know I spent most of this review talking about the characters, but I did so because they are  the game's strongest attribute.","May 29","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is rich in story, has great character build, and actually has a lot of content for a game that is going on 11 years old. I played this game when I was younger on the original Xbox console, and replaying it on my PC was amazing. I love this game and all its glory even to this date. You should definately play the game.\n\nPros:Story rich\nBeautiful character design and art style (even though the graphics are outdated seeing as this game came out in 2005)\nQuite a bit of content\nVoice actors feel natural and make the funny/serious dialogue in the game so much better\nQuite a bit of enemy variety\nLocation varierty\nFunny dialogue\nCons:Slight glitches with character movement ocasinally\nSometimes some of the AI within the game don't target you as quickly as they should\nSometimes Delta Squad doesn't listen to comands (happened twice through my entire 8.5 hours)\nOverall, this game is a ton of fun even today, and the game is worth picking up when on a sale or if you happen to have a spare $10 in your Steam wallet.\n11/10 Seriously, the game is that much fun.\n\nSPOILER BELOW:\nWHY THE HELL DID SEV HAVE TO GET LEFT BEHIND?!

Despite having to jump through numerous hoops in order to get it optimised for a modern operating system, Republic Commando is a surprisingly wonderful game given that it is, in many ways, a rather standard corridor shooter.\n\nWhilst genre-wise it may play as a rather standard FPS shooter, the writing of the characters and the missions gives a much greater depth to the world than it otherwise ought to have. You play the commander of a crack team of Republic commandos, and your teammates all have distinct and consistent personalities, and are autonomous enough to make them seem genuinely intelligent. Yes, you will be giving orders for the most part - and their AI is programmed well enough so as to feel like they're an extension of yourself, as they should - but you won't need to tell them to heal themselves, or attack the bad guys if a threat looms, and should you be overcome and you need help, they will be promptly at your side healing you at the risk of their own lives. And this all helps to develop a genuine bond with your fellow squadmates, particularly as the game is much easier when you have their help, further emphasising the importance of your cumulative strength as a team.\n\nOn top of this, the missions, whilst comprising of many parts, manage to consistently escalate the stakes until by the end of the mission you feel a genuine and frantic rush of adrenaline as you plunge headlong into the final stages of each operation. And it's the little things that make a difference - for example, whereas most games would have an alert announcement indicating that your vessel will self-destruct, in this case they're serious. And it's these little things that actually make you emote as a player, which is what any experience should do, whether it's a book or a movie or a video game.\n\nAnd thus, Republic Commando manages to rise above it's state and hold up quite well as a challenging and compelling experience.\n\nI'd recommend it to Star Wars fans primarily, although I think it has a wider appeal because of the quality of the writing.","February 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is absolutely nothing else in this game that makes RC stand out against other games. It's like the developers just gave up after making it Rainbow Six or any Tom Clancy game.\n\nThat's not to say it's a terrible game...well..actually, come to think of it, it is pretty bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/6000/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","Republic Commando is a tactical first person shooter where you are the leader of a small squad called Delta Squad. The gameplay is much like any other shooter however instead of run and gun the player must order their squadmates to perform different functions such as slice a terminal, set a bomb and get behind cover and use various weapons including sniper, anti-armor and grenade. They will also target one enemy, form up on the player, go to a certain location or search and destroy. On top of that the player has a special weapon called the DC-17 which was interchangeable from assault rifle to sniper rifle to anti-armor launcher. The Player also had a full HUD that made it feel like the player was really in a clone trooper helmet.\n\nOne of the other cooler features is instead of dying you just go down and you can either call a squadmate over to revive you, maintain their orders and kill everything before getting you or just reload a save.  A lot of these features worked perfectly it isn’t like whoever could develop the sequel couldn’t just use all these features all over again. It begs the question where is the sequel if the gameplay mechanics are already there and ready to be used again.\n\nYou are Delta RC-1138 or “Boss,” the leader of Delta squad who has in it RC-1262, “Scorch,” the comedic relief /explosives expert, RC-1140, “Fixer,” the by the book soldier that specializes in slicing and RC-1207, “Sev,” the hunter/sniper. You start out in your birthing tube on Kamino and it shows your training as you age. Eventually your squad meets up for the invasion of Geonosis during the beginning of the clone wars. There Delta Squad is tasked to infiltrate and assassinate Sun Fac, a Geonosian leader. Along with that they have several other objectives that they accomplish including destroying an underground droid factory and retrieving launch codes from a Trade Federation core ship.\nOne year after the invasion of Geonosis Delta Squad is set to investigate their original ship the Prosecutor to find out why it has not responded in several weeks. During this they find out the Trandoshan Slaves and Mercenaries have taken over the ship with the help of the Separatists in order to capture and bring the ship back to a Separatist base. Delta Squad ends up destroying all of the Trandoshans and defends the ship from a Trade Federation Battleship that attacks shortly after.\n\nThe final mission involves Delta Squad being the advance recon team on Kashyyyk and to help the Wookiees to fight back the Trandoshan Slavers and Separatists that have control of the planet. They end up rescuing General Tarfful and run into General Grievous themselves but only end up fighting those IG-100 Magna Guards that carry the Electrostaff. Eventually Delta Squad makes it to where the Separatist Battleship has linked itself the giant citadel tree and they destroy it. They end the game on a cliffhanger as Sev had been captured and the invasion of Kashyyyk by the main republic force had begun which once again begs the question, why not continue the story and have a sequel.\n\nNow the graphics aren’t anything to write home about but they are fairly impressive for when this game was made, 2005, but what really makes this game look impressive is the HUD for the clone troopers and the art assets they created for the game. Lucasarts did not separate themselves from canon too much in that the story of Delta Squad lines up perfectly with that of the actual Star Wars universe and Extended Universe.\nRepublic Commando is actually the first Star Wars game that featured licensed music that included the song “Clones” by the band Ash which sounds awesome. On top of that they included all of the heavy battle music from John Williams you may have heard from any of the other Star Wars movies. The voice acting is also superb as for most of the clone troopers and Delta 38 was voiced by the original actor for Jango Fett, Temuera Morrison which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nOverall this game is actually one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time and is an absolute classic in terms of story and gameplay. With the disbandment of Lucasarts, in order to make a sequel some developer is going to have to get rights to both the Star Wars IP and the Republic Commando IP which could make it quite pricey.\n•	Story  - 4 out of 5\n•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5\n•	Graphics – 4 out of 5\n•	Sound  - 5 out of 5\n•	Fun – 5 out of 5\nPros:\n-	Fun gameplay/squad commanding\n-	Great music and voice acting\n-	Star Wars Universe\nCons:\n-	Can get annoyingly difficult with the lack of ammo at times\n-	Repetitive enemies\nI’m giving a Total score of 90%\n","December 3, 2013","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At the head of your squad, Fixer, Sev, and Scorch, you take part in infiltration, recovery, and recon missions that would make your average Mando Clone end up as a crumbled pile in the corner.\nYou come across said crumbled piles, several times.\n\nYou will face overwhelming forces. You will get outgunned and outnumbered. You'll get rushed. You'll face shields and giant droids. While not necessarily hard, the game isn't exactly easy, either.\n\nKeep in mind, as the game description says, the multiplayer servers are shut down now. This is now a single-player game, but it's still a really good one that has a very strong feeling into what the Clone War was like when Jedi aren't hogging the spotlight.\n\n\n\n(If you wish to see the continuation of the Republic Commando storyline, and what happened to Sev, check out the Star Wars: Republic Commando books by Karen Traviss.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/6000/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","Republic Commando is a tactical first person shooter where you are the leader of a small squad called Delta Squad. The gameplay is much like any other shooter however instead of run and gun the player must order their squadmates to perform different functions such as slice a terminal, set a bomb and get behind cover and use various weapons including sniper, anti-armor and grenade. They will also target one enemy, form up on the player, go to a certain location or search and destroy. On top of that the player has a special weapon called the DC-17 which was interchangeable from assault rifle to sniper rifle to anti-armor launcher. The Player also had a full HUD that made it feel like the player was really in a clone trooper helmet.\n\nOne of the other cooler features is instead of dying you just go down and you can either call a squadmate over to revive you, maintain their orders and kill everything before getting you or just reload a save.  A lot of these features worked perfectly it isn’t like whoever could develop the sequel couldn’t just use all these features all over again. It begs the question where is the sequel if the gameplay mechanics are already there and ready to be used again.\n\nYou are Delta RC-1138 or “Boss,” the leader of Delta squad who has in it RC-1262, “Scorch,” the comedic relief /explosives expert, RC-1140, “Fixer,” the by the book soldier that specializes in slicing and RC-1207, “Sev,” the hunter/sniper. You start out in your birthing tube on Kamino and it shows your training as you age. Eventually your squad meets up for the invasion of Geonosis during the beginning of the clone wars. There Delta Squad is tasked to infiltrate and assassinate Sun Fac, a Geonosian leader. Along with that they have several other objectives that they accomplish including destroying an underground droid factory and retrieving launch codes from a Trade Federation core ship.\nOne year after the invasion of Geonosis Delta Squad is set to investigate their original ship the Prosecutor to find out why it has not responded in several weeks. During this they find out the Trandoshan Slaves and Mercenaries have taken over the ship with the help of the Separatists in order to capture and bring the ship back to a Separatist base. Delta Squad ends up destroying all of the Trandoshans and defends the ship from a Trade Federation Battleship that attacks shortly after.\n\nThe final mission involves Delta Squad being the advance recon team on Kashyyyk and to help the Wookiees to fight back the Trandoshan Slavers and Separatists that have control of the planet. They end up rescuing General Tarfful and run into General Grievous themselves but only end up fighting those IG-100 Magna Guards that carry the Electrostaff. Eventually Delta Squad makes it to where the Separatist Battleship has linked itself the giant citadel tree and they destroy it. They end the game on a cliffhanger as Sev had been captured and the invasion of Kashyyyk by the main republic force had begun which once again begs the question, why not continue the story and have a sequel.\n\nNow the graphics aren’t anything to write home about but they are fairly impressive for when this game was made, 2005, but what really makes this game look impressive is the HUD for the clone troopers and the art assets they created for the game. Lucasarts did not separate themselves from canon too much in that the story of Delta Squad lines up perfectly with that of the actual Star Wars universe and Extended Universe.\nRepublic Commando is actually the first Star Wars game that featured licensed music that included the song “Clones” by the band Ash which sounds awesome. On top of that they included all of the heavy battle music from John Williams you may have heard from any of the other Star Wars movies. The voice acting is also superb as for most of the clone troopers and Delta 38 was voiced by the original actor for Jango Fett, Temuera Morrison which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nOverall this game is actually one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time and is an absolute classic in terms of story and gameplay. With the disbandment of Lucasarts, in order to make a sequel some developer is going to have to get rights to both the Star Wars IP and the Republic Commando IP which could make it quite pricey.\n•	Story  - 4 out of 5\n•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5\n•	Graphics – 4 out of 5\n•	Sound  - 5 out of 5\n•	Fun – 5 out of 5\nPros:\n-	Fun gameplay/squad commanding\n-	Great music and voice acting\n-	Star Wars Universe\nCons:\n-	Can get annoyingly difficult with the lack of ammo at times\n-	Repetitive enemies\nI’m giving a Total score of 90%\n","December 3, 2013","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has you play as a Clone Commando, designated "Delta 38". Your squad (Also named "Delta") are also highly trained clone commandos. The graphics aren't terrible (in fact, I kinda like them) despite the fact that this game is pretty old. It took me a while to get used to the controls, as mouse 3 is Aim, not right click (which is grenade).  Gameplay is VERY solid, and FUN. Its starts out easy, but quickly gets DIFFICULT, even on the normal mode.  And in the beginning, when you dont know how to counter the enemies, it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes to destroy new enemies, such as Super Battle Droids. But that is quickly remedied when you have the tools and experience.  The AI is actually REALLY good, as in, unlike games like Call of Duty, the friendly AI can actually shoot and kill things. This is really helful, especially when there is many or tough enemies. Also, since we're on friendly AI characters, I LOVE THEM. All your fellow Commandos, despite being clones, are very human so far. They have different personalities, and in the short time I knew them, I started caring about my "brothers".  Although there are some Friendly Fire incidents (both me and my squad's fault) I felt like this made them even more "human" (probably due to the ammount of friendly fire that happens in other games like Arma or Insurgency). You can also give your team orders, which I find to be promptly followed and well executed, which has been a huge assist. So in conclusion, I will list what Ive found;\n\n-Solid shooter gameplay\n-Nice, easy, and fun squad based mechanics\n-Many different enemies in the campaign\n-Human like characters (For me anyway)\n-ACTUALLY HELPFUL TEAM AI (very important)\n-Very Very Fun.\n-graphics are still alright (depending on your tolerance to old graphics)\n\nThe few bad things I have found are:\n-Enemies sometimes bug and dont move or shoot\n-Allies sometimes get stuck on a position, making them take a while to execute the order.\n-old graphics","July 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I just wish it was longer.\n\nUnlike most FPSes I've played, where the combat's attempt at a frantic pace just makes it an annoying mess of white noise, Republic Commando's squad-based gameplay forces you constantly calculate battlefield tactics as opposed to just trying not to get shot.\n\nThe game's biggest weakness comes in a few brief segments where you're forced into a tactical situation by yourself, where one stray bullet can drop you; or when you're given a time limit, which in one case resulted in me finishing a level with literally a second or two left on the clock. The intensity of the firefights makes completing your objectives in time an incredible strain.\n\nBesides that, the game is only three missions: Geonosis, a deralict Republic battlecruiser, and Kashyyyk. Thankfully, each of these missions will last you a good three hours a piece, so I wasn't left feeling like I'd played an unfinished game. I was, however, left wanting a lot more. In particular, the notion of this game's encounters playing out organically, with nonlinear level design (and a lot more levels), sounds like the workings of one of the greatest FPSes ever.","January 11, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay was done right, You really do have to instruct your team correctly and expirement with different methods of attack to win this game, run and gun alone will not cut it. the story was all over the place, it had some epic moments but there was alot of bland parts repeatitive tasks. the soundtrack was decent but it sounded like it was trying to hard to rip off halo. And your squad mates were majorly interchangable, they can all do the same tasks and don't have near enough dialogue to make you really feel differently or tell any real difference between them personality wise, but to be fair they are clones. the AI was was average,  most of the enemies just stood still and occasionally changed attacks that they used but ther were some mobile enemies that did chase and follow you, only to get knifed in the face. overall it's a good game, but i suggest playing it in segments/parts, dont play the whole thing at once or your gunna get real burnt out.","February 20, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The multiplayer is solid, with no problems I can think of.

Despite looking a bit aged, it runs well and is still as fun as ever.\n\nYou play as Delta-38 (Boss), as the leader of Delta Squad, consisting of your explosives specialist and joker Delta-62 (Scorch), your levelheaded computer specialist Delta-40 (Fixer) and resident sniper/psychopath Delta-07 (Sev). You travel between three levels: the desert planet Geonosis, the start of the Clone Wars, the RAS Prosecutor, a derelict Republic Assault Ship (Ex Machina y u do dis to me) and Kashyyyk, home of the Wookies.\n\nThe game is particularly notable for its advanced squad AI, which hasn't really been matched since. Your squadmates are easily capable of holding their own for a while, but the perfect balance is struck between the need for player input and AI competence. You also have the ability to command your troops to perform actions such as snipe enemies, hack terminals and man turrets.\n\nIn conclusion, Republic Commando is a must-buy for any Star Wars or FPS fan.\n\n10/10 would use AT-TE again.","February 19, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It felt long because the gameplay felt repetitive and long after awhile. The gameplay is pretty much run and gun. The squad is frustrating at times because they aren't too smart and will stand there at times while people are shooting at them. The graphics are kind of old school. The game is good for Star Wars diehards but for the average FPS gamer its something that gets long to play as the game progresses. I felt myself wanting the game to end really early in the game because of how repetitive it got. The great thing about this game was the soundtrack, it was very well done. The online portion of the game is small but still active. The online portion is the thing to play if you want a fun experience with it. The story of the game was confusing and left you wondering.

To start out, I am a pretty big Star Wars, so even the name of it can make me happy. Anyway, you play as a clone commander in the time between Episode 2 and episode 3, the clone wars. You are in charge of 3 other clone commanders, Fixer: The Hacker, Scorcth: Demolitions expert and Sev: The Brute.\nThis is imo, one of the few Star Wars games that even non Star Wars fans can play and still enjoy. It is something that is not often seen in this Star Wars genre, First Person, tactical shooter. No, you don't play as a god like- dual lightsaber wielding, maniac (looking at you Force Unleashed!) you play as a clone and only a clone. This itself brings something unique to the playing field.\nIt offers a compelling story of Delta Squad, and their rise into infamy. As of now, (May 2, 2015)  this game is TEN YEARS OLD, release date: "March 1, 2005) and while it is obvious from the graphics it is not a "next gen" level game, it still holds up pretty well, and it gives it an almost gritty, gray kind of style.\nOn this Star Wars sale it is 5.00, normally 10.00 and I would HIGHLY recommend this game to just about everyone!","May 2, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

A Star Wars game for a more mature demographic with likable characters with, albeit cliched, personalities.\n\nYou got your rough and tumble borderline serial killer 07 - Sev\n\nYou got the fun and dumb but highly trained demolitionist 62 - Scorch\n\nYou got the bottom feeding, intellegent and downright square 40 - Fixer\n\nThen there's you, the quick thinking leader of Delta Squad - 38 - Boss\n\nThey may have differing personalities and prefernces but at the end of the day each sqaud member is very copy and paste in terms of usefulness and each one gets the job regardless of what they prefer to do which is good, why leave a Commando half cooked?\n\nThe gameplay aspect was astounding. The Ai are intellegent (bar some hiccups) and follow orders very well. You say 'Search and Destory' they'll take point and peek around corners before engaging the enemy.\n\nSay 'Group Up' and, well, they come to you like a Jack Russel that heard a bag open.\n\nGive the order to 'Secure Location' and they actually dig in, taking cover behind objects and not leaving that spot unless you put them on a position but even if one goes the other two stay and keep digging in, its great if you need to heal at a bacta station under heaby fire.\n\nLastly there's the 'Move On' command which ends whatever action the commando's are doing and will either fall back to a secured location if a marker was placed or come back to you.\n\nIn battle you HAVE to be the leader. These guys wont do more than cover and shoot unless you point them towards a turret, sniper location or explosive ordinance spot. There's nothing finer than having all three squad mates on useful points as you go against a small army of droids. There are also non-combat meneuvers like Slicing a terminal, setting a detonator charge or Breaching and Clearing a room. Your surroundings are as much of a weapon as anything though, one part I liked was when I had my squad distract a heavily armoured spider droid while I snuck around the back, sliced a terminal and dropped a crate on its head.\n\nDroids also have this annoying habit of being extremely hard to kill. Maybe the battle droids are easy but Super Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Spider Droids are tough and require you to focus the entire squads fire on one at a time. There are other enemy types but I wont spoil it.\n\nAll in all this is a fun game but with a sadly abrupt ending. It almost felt like they ran out of funding halfway through and ended it at the worst moment possible. I literally felt like someone came into my bedroom and pulled the blug on my PC, that was how abrupt the ending blackout was.\n\nAll in all you can get some 15-16 hours out of it which isn't too bad. It's a good game with solid FPS mechanics and some great voice acting where it counts and despite its abruptness the ending was fairly good and will leave you wanting more.\n\n9/10 solid gameplay with very very few glitches but with an abrupt ending","May 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It felt long because the gameplay felt repetitive and long after awhile. The gameplay is pretty much run and gun. The squad is frustrating at times because they aren't too smart and will stand there at times while people are shooting at them. The graphics are kind of old school. The game is good for Star Wars diehards but for the average FPS gamer its something that gets long to play as the game progresses. I felt myself wanting the game to end really early in the game because of how repetitive it got. The great thing about this game was the soundtrack, it was very well done. The online portion of the game is small but still active. The online portion is the thing to play if you want a fun experience with it. The story of the game was confusing and left you wondering. The really annoying thing about this game was the ammo and guns, if felt like you ran out of ammo too fast. Get it if you love Star Wars, but not if your looking for a good story and gameplay.","November 8, 2011","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's pretty much unplayable, now. Like many others, I've installed a few fixes from other players, but it's still glitchy. The cursor in the menu moves 1/4 of the screen when the mouse moves 1/16th of an inch on the lowest DPI setting. In game, the cursor is much slower, but it's "jumpy" (for lack of a better word) to where the game started giving me a headache after only 5-10 minutes.\n\nSome have said it's modern hardware plaguing the game, but I've played FarCry and a few others from the same or older time period without any of this craziness.\n\nWould I recommend Republic Commando? YES. Fantastic game.\n\nWould I recommend Republic Commando as sold on Steam? NO. Not unless you are willing to really sink time into getting it to work.\n\nBy the way, I had to play the game in windowed mode, because every time I tried full screen, the game crashed. Personally, I'm going to put more time into making it work because I know it's an amazing game, but I would NOT recommend this to just any casual gamer due to the glitches.","May 23","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay is painfully linear and there`s very little tactial depth to it. You can`t give commands to individual soldiers, sniping positions are fixed and cannot be assigned by the player, and door breaching has no additional options (like throwing in grenades or something). Rainbow six - Vegas has actually more depth and tactics than this and that`s saying something :(\n\nThe levels in this game are very restrictive (You follow a hallway with some rooms). Another giant weakness is setting the game within the prequel trilogy, so you`ll be killing a lot of droids in stead of strom troopers/rebels. The main protagonist uses a Codename outbreak style multi purpose rifle which can be adapted to many different weapon types, which is kind of a letdown. The guns in this game seem to be a little underpowered not doing as much damage as You would like them to do. Iwas generally dissatisfied with this title but for a sci-fi action fan, who likes tactical elements and doesn`t hate the SW prequels- it might be good shooter.","March 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A gritty Star Wars FPS playing the role of a Republic Commando taking control of a small squad to complete various tasks in the name of the Republic. This game was quite the blast to play.\n\nFirst off the combat is fun and engaging with various weapons and a few unique ones too. You also have a squad to command and you can order them to various tasks such as arming explosives, taking sniping positions and so forth. The music holy hell isn't it beautiful? Especially at the title screen.\n\nOne of my favourite parts about this game is the amount of detail put into this. You can see your helmet on the wholeway through and when enemy blood splatters on it, it gets wiped away. There are some other cool little things I won't spoil. Not to mention the game looks good in general.\n\nI've played both the PC and Xbox version and I would recommend the PC version. It has better controls overall but the Xbox version is an impressive feat in itself.

From all the Starwars Games, I say this one is a great success I've played all the games. This is my top favorite it's got, okay graphics, and some basic game settings that make it better, but that's not the point it's about the campaign this has a great campaign and a great combat system. I've beaten this game 3 times. Though what is shameful about the game is that the campaign is not that long it's about a 4-6 Hour Campaign. Though at the end.... I would suggest getting this game. It is indeed a Classic!","April 30, 2015","true","51.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is very in-depth and makes you want to really get to know the commandos in your team, each having there own personalities.

The single player puts you in the boots of the leader of Delta Squad, a squad of Clone Commandoes. You can tell your squad waht to do... YES. The Single player is difficult (Like most 6th gen FPS's) and can get FRUSTRATING at times. when you die you dont go back to your last save like most FPS's, when you die, you have to wait till your squad can revive you, you will go back to your last checkpoint if you whole squad dies. you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates, that means when bacta despensers are around, you need to tell your troops to "Stop loafing around, and get some bacta". the campaign is nice and long, unlike Call Of Duty's 4 hour campaign. The weapons are good, you start with a Pistol, that does jack ♥♥♥♥ in terms of damage, then you have the Blaser rifle, that the standard full auto rifle. then there the sniper rifle that is good, i guess. the anti-armor thingy is AWESOME, high damage, can DESTROY groups of enemys. then we have alien guns, the ACP is a trandoshan smg, nothing special, the array gun is this games shotgun. my favorite gun! and the trandoshan minigun and railgun are AMAZING guns as well! 2 wookie guns, bowcaster and the wookie rocket luancher. Now about that ending... UHG... The ending SUCKS. (SPOILERS) so, you destroy a ship, you have to leave behinde delta 08, and yoda says, "The battle has begun" and you say 'Lock and load deltas!".

Wide varity of combat zones that give options to do in every fire fight, sending squad to snipe, use gun placements,anti armour,med stations which you will need and other tactical advantages and objectives. The game does not feel like a normal "Star Wars game" as in it forces you to think tactical and punishes you for not doing so.\nThat all beig said Starwars Republic Comando is a great game for starwars fans young, old and new. It is a 10/10 in my book even years later.","September 9, 2014","true","31.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's split up into 3 arcs and spawned a 4 part book series that's rather enthralling and I highly recommend as much as this game. It's a game that took on a really unique way of doing things that makes it hard for you to 1 man army and your squad is highly effective if given the right orders. It was designed with a controller in mind but forces KB/M which, when gotten used to, can function quite well.\n\nIt's also got a really great music score and memorable characters.","September 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Oh how I was wrong. Republic Commando takes your generic Space Marine-esque Clone Troopers and makes them something special. You play as the leader of a four-man squad of elite troopers known as Delta Squad. As 38, you command 07, 40 and 62 in a Journey through the barren planet of Geonosis to the forests of Kashyyk. What the real highlight of is comes down to your squad of soldiers and how you control them. Your most basic commands use F1 - F4, with "Search and Destroy", "Form up", "Hold This Position" etc. Throughout the maps there are points you can highlight your troops to use. Bacta tanks for healing, sniping positions, grenade positions. You can get them to slice doors or breach them, bomb stuff or do it yourself. The AI of Delta Squad was well ahead of it's time and is still impressive to this day. Each and every member of Delta Squad does one thing better than any other Space Marine in any game though, and that is their personality. Each member of Delta Squad has a distinct and likable personality, 07 being a gruff, maybe insane hunter, 62 being often childish and 40.... well 40 lacks in that department sadly.\n\nThe levels of Republic Commando are intricate and amazingly well designed. The game is extremely challenging and points but ever so rewarding at the same time. You get four base weapons and can pick up a fifth, of which there are a multitude of to use. You have your base Pistol, a clone trooper rifle thingy, a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher thingerjig. Then you can get miniguns, SMG's, energy shotguns etc to fill your Fifth slot, which you can change up at will. The FPS and tactics parts of Republic Commando work together extremely well and create a satisfying and fantastic game.\n\nDo you like FPS? Buy it\nLike tactical games? Buy it\nLike Star Wars? Buy it\n\nRepublic Commando is an absolute masterpiece of a game.","May 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't get enough of this game, the only problem I really have with it is that the Commandos have American accents rather than an english one like a proper clone. Other than that, It's great, really. The gameplay is great, it feels so solid, and the tension you feel while playing makes you feel as if you're actually a clone fighting in an all-out war. The coolest aspect by far about this game is how you can order your teamates to take positions and do actions, making you feel like a powerful general. Also, at no point in the game did it feel wrong or incomplete. The developers put their 100% into it all the way through, which I respect. I wish that there were Star Wars games as great as this one still around, but sadly they kind of fall flat. Hopefully Star Wars: Battlefront 3 will be great!
