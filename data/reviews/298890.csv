IT'S ADVENTURE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe game is set up just like a zelda game. It starts off with you having to go to different temples and collect lots of items to further your progress.I have now played all three Adventure Time games in the series and this one is the best one by far. All the fun of Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd you steal our garbage?!! with the awesome top down view and 8bit characters from Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know! Anyone who plays this whether a long time zelda fan or Adventure Time fan I dont think you will be disappointed and well the price is a bit high in my opinion, if you are a fan of the series its a must have.\nPROS\n-Original actors from the show doing voice overs\n-Zelda clone gameplay with an adventure time theme\n-Lots of Unique items to find and fill your inventory\n-Great with a 360 controller (haven't tried keyboard)\n-Hours of gameplay with an interesting storyline\n-It has a full list of steam achievements and for the first time ever\na set of adventure time trading cards for badges, backgrounds and chat emoticons\n-Runs Great on my Nvidia Shield :D\nCONS\n-No co-op or mp of anykind\n-Price is too high even for an awesome game like this\n-Not very much replay value aside for beating the game numerous\ntimes to unlock different end game achievements","November 18, 2014","true","48.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005400484/recommended/298890/","76561198005400484","DoominaBottle","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005400484/","451 products in account","Quick summary: Reasonable Zelda Clone that while has charm and is faithful to its source material suffers from poor communication and player feedback regarding objectives and puzzles, clunky controls, lack luster pickups/powerups and finally no autosave with a tendancy to crash after cut scenes potentially losing hours of play time.\n6.5/10 Was not worth the Â£30 price tag, current price is aceptable.\n\n\nIn Depth Below:\n\nFirst of all let me say I am a big fan of both Adventure Time and The Legend of Zelda Series and when I saw this game I was rather excited as this seemed like the ideal formula for an adventure time game and if a sequal is released with the issues in this game addressed it could be a real hit.\n\nNow I'll go over the following areas in depth, Story/Theme, Controls/Game Mechanics, Graphics/Sound though it should be noted there may be overlape at times.\n\nStory/Theme\nAdventure Time: The Secret of The Nameless Kingdom strongest point is its loyalty to it source material, the games plot could easily be made into a two or three part episode and be well recieved and its newly introduced characters all have the charm and strangeness one would expect from Adventure Time.\nNearly all the monsters can be recognised from the show (however theres no real reasoning or theme why they are in a location and are often recoloured and resused elsewhere with more hitpoints) and there is no shortage of cameos from major and minor characters, all of which are voiced and have perfectly written in character lines, this been said there is not nearly enough character interaction between them with each only having a handful of lines. Another minor issue is that unless you are very familar with the series many of these cameos will be unrecognisable and having a small character journal which unlocks a paragraph about each character you meet would of been a nice addition.\n\nOutside of cutscenes Finn is the only one who speaks at least in the early periods of the game (I confess I have not completed it due to crashing issues after the second dungeon), these short lines are spoken each time Finn picks up an item or treasure with 4-5 lines of alternative dialogue for each. While these didn't bother me so much as I naturally phased them out I do know players who would be driven crazy by this over the first hour so this is just a warning for those who have little tolerance for such things.\nThis also highlights another issue which is the lack of banter or comments by character to the enviroments or bosses as you go through the game, this feels like a real wasted oppertunity and unfortuately means theres little to distract from the lackluster gameplay that is the core of the game.\n\nWhile there are side quests in the game they are of "Find Item A give to Person A collect item from person A give to Person B" which is typical of top down adventures, the only trouble been the location of these characters are not marked on your map and are often in tedious to travel to locations.\n\nControls/Game Mechanics\n\nAs basic controls go the game is passable, if you have played any of the gameboy Legend of Zelda games you'll feel pretty much at home however in spite of this you'll find traveling and combat becomes a chore.\nFirst of all Finn seems to move slightly too slow which combined with the large amount of travel, exploration and fetch quests in the game begins to grow frustrating, also there are numberous stairs and cave entrances/exits which you need to traverse and unless you are exactly in the centre of them you just walk against them rather than up/down/through them which often leaves you open to been struck if your just passing through an area trying to avoid combat this can be a further problem when moving up or down stairs. Due to this been an animation you cannot attack or stop but this often lead to cheap hits from monsters gathered at the top or bottom, while there seems to be an slight invisible barrier to try and prevent this this doesn't work very well and actually causes issues with any block pushing puzzles that require you to push it near a door.\n\nThese movement issues begin to also affect combat as well with many monsters been able to out pace you in general or with sudden bursts of speed making you get hit (as any monster touching you harms you) or miss a swing often as unlike Link Finn requires to stand still to attack with his sword which again slows down gameplay.\n\nThe sword is your main weapon throughout the game as Finn and has seeming extremely short range but with reasonable power with some monsters dying in a single blow but with some taking up to 4-5 hits by the second dungeon, I say seemingly short range as the hit box for the blade (or in fact anything in the game is rather difficult to judge) combined with a slightly too slow swing animation and the inability to move when attacking means you'll be getting much closer than I suspect you need to and as such take damage more often than you would normally.\nThe sword can not be swung diagonal so if your moving diagonal and need to attack you will swing in the direction closest to the angle you are moving.\n\nEven hitting a monster can actually do more harm than good in most cases as it knocks away and with most monsters possessing range attacks and you'll often get hit just as your moving in to finish them off. The ideal way to avoid this is to obtain the boomerang stand in which like the Legend of Zelda series paralyzes monsters briefly if you hit them (and can be thrown diagonal) and then go in swinging.\nYou also get a ranged attack yourself by the second dungeon but you again need to stand still when using it, its slow to fire, it does less damage than the sword, if you miss you have to wait until it strikes a wall or goes its full screen travel distance before you can fire again which means its only good as a utility item in most cases.\n\nYour main defense other than hopefully moving out the way of the monsters far faster attacks is a shield which bluntly borders on useless, Like the sword it can only be used in the main four directions it is also extremely picky about positioning and will only block attacks that are central on Finn, a few pixels either way and you'll get hit. Its inconsistent about exactly which attacks it will block for example it will block a monster thats running at you with a blade knocking it back but if a monster just walks into you it won't stop them and when using it to push spiky objects you can suddenly slip past its perfect blocking spot and be damaged.\n\nWith these issues combined with the fact that monsters respawn the moment you re-enter an area you'll quickly start trying to avoid unnecessary combat unless you need money, this brings us to the next few points the shops and baggies..\n\nBaggies are small plastic bags and these are essentially glass jars from the Legend of Zelda game but you use them for even more, they are your potion bottle, your bomb bag, your monster catcher, I'm at the second dungeon and I've already found eight items that can go in them, however they are as rare as hell and you'll often need a spare one to get through a dungeons puzzles so as a result all the healing items which you can collect (which are lost if you don't have a free bag btw) or buy you won't be using them even if they weren't stupidly high prices. You see Legend of Zelda has multiple different values of Zenny and Zenny chests littered everywhere Adventure Time you get coins in values of 1 sparsely (3-6 a screen if lucky) on average and chests are rare often giving you trail mix or one of the other healling item components (which you also have to pay to create). To be fair the most expensive thing I have bought was 200 coins but  the combination of low coins, little bag space and high prices means I rarely go near a shop.\n\nOpps I've hit my word count so Graphics/Sound: Music forgetable Graphics pixelated sprites from earlier game.","December 23, 2014","false","4.8"," 54 of 91 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","54","91","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonights/recommended/298890/","neonights","Neo NiGHTS Â®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonights/","175 products in account","It's one of those games where Steam should have a "Yes. With Reservations".\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf ALL these three itens happen, you can grab this game:\n1) Like Zelda;\n2) Like Adventure Time:\n3) Can get this for, AT MOST, $15,00 (I'd say $10,00 is better).\n\nAnd a final hint: SAVE OFTEN! This game has a tendency to randomly crash while entering different locations (and a Loading Screen appears).\n\nNot so TL;DR:\n\nBefore buying this game I'd read some reviews stating how much Zelda like this game is. For me, this was a plus, since I like Zelda. However, what I failed to understand is that this game IS NOT "Zelda like game". It IS a ZELDA game with Adventure Time theme and skins over it!\n\nAll your Zelda stuff is here:\n- Boomerang;\n- Bombs;\n- Ziplock bags that work as the pots;\n- Fairies to replenish your health;\n- Money growing from grass;\n- A 999 limit for your money;\n- Useless shops;\n- Piece of hearts;\n- A shield;\n- A hammer;\n- Upgrades for some of your weapons;\n- Annoying puzzles;\n- Nice bosses (although only three);\n- Same map layout;\n- Death by bad hitbox.\n\nThe only couple of things missing from Zelda are:\n- Bow & Arrow;\n- A way to move faster from place to place (a teleport, a bird, an ocarina etc.).\n\nAnd all the good stuff from Adventure Time is here as well. All the characters (even though just some minor appearences, like to give you a quest or an item), original voices from the show, nice humour.\n\nAs a game, well.... it's like going back to the 90's which isn't bad per se. What IS bad is paying about $30~$35,00 (I don't know actually the price in Dollars since it's not my currency) for a game from the 90's. It could've added some nice improvements on the formula, like adding the possibility to make notes on the World Map so you wouldn't get lost so easily. Because there are a lot of places you have to visit later after you get a certain upgrade, but then you have to remember where it was.\n\nAnother thing that annoys me a bit is the amount of Loading Screens and how long they take. It's a freakin' 2D game (ok, I know the environment is on cell shading)! Why so many loading screens? It would be better if there was ONE big loading and then the whole game would just flow.\nI don't like games where you have to travel a lot going back and forth and then they throw so many loading screens.\n\n\nSo, in the end, I don't regret buying this game because I got it on Holiday Sale for 50%..., I like Zelda and like AT. But if I were expecting something more from the game, then I'd be very deeply disappointed. So you have to be very aware of what you are buying.","January 16, 2015","true","15.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

But it does have it's share of problems. Some of the temple puzzles DO drag out a bit too long and the lack of the ability to actually carry bombs without farming out a certain type of enemy is annoying. But honestly, them basically making a game in the same vein of A Link to the Past is a good move. Adventure Time always strikes me as the kind of show that if they had a game, it would share some of the same themes as Zelda. If they ever make another game of this style and add a bit of polish to it, I think they'd have something pretty dang good.","December 31, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though where games like Ittle dew would be more puzzle focus, this one is more about action and collectibles.\n\nBasically you control Finn, who's been sent by PB to investigate the royal governance shenanigans of the nameless kingdom. But as you arrive, you realise that you have to find back a bunch of princesses by beating dungeons and bad guys.\nYou will quickly be left on an overworld map to explore and will find a lot of minigames hut with some challenges to complete, caves to wander, stuff to collect and merchants to trade with. All of that will be populated with a lot of characters from the show, all having their little catch phrase that will steal a smile from you, as they all have concerns and, eventually, side tasks to offer in their own personnal ways.\nBut worry not, for Jake is here to support you, and will take the role of a Shield or a couple of other 'handy' tools like a grab or a slap to pick up items, hit enemis or interract with switches to unlock parts of certain dungeons.\n\nJust like any other zelda, Finn's progression will be tied to the items and collectibles he will get through the game.\nYou will have a set of hearts to symbolize your lifepoints, that can be upgraded by collecting heart quarters, a sword and an inventory that will soon fill up with a lot of consumable items you can bind to buttons to use during the game.\nSome of them will be like, bombs that can breach through walls, a boomerang to stun enemies and bring items back at you, a grapling of some sort, plastic bags that serve as bottle to keep items you can grab... You have a gauntlet and keys and boss keys, dungeons maps to find, chests, compasses... Well, the usual you expect from a top down Zelda game.\n\nTruth is, while it clearly uses all of the codes from that type of games, some of the mecanics, while not being necessarly fresh like the grab or gauntlet, will be cleverly used in each dungeons and path that you unlock later on. Every key items gained leads to new places you'll be able to access and so on.\nThere's also tint of derision and self awareness in certain aspect of the game, like when you can throw items to a fairy pool to upgrade them and decide to throw Jake. Or the way some npcs will conveniently notice that they are just doing the regular tropes of that kind of games. All in all it gives a nice feeling of things being fun and, sometimes downright silly, just like the early seasons of the show. Though, if you expect some sort of lore building, revelations or plot twist of the actual serie, you won't find anything here for the plot is more a pretext to justify the exploration gameplay.\n\nTechnically, it runs okay on a regular computer (with a few fps drops on a few zones), though it is clearly calibrated to play with a controler. So screw your mouse and keyboard.\nSome of the mecanics works well, you won't be unfairly stuck because some items refuses to work the way it was intended to be, at least. Only exception, i'd say, would be Jake's shield; for i realised that it was kind of hard to use in tense situations and not so much efficient. To be more precise, you have to hold LT to raise it in the direction you are facing, but you can't rotate your character afterward, which makes blocking tough since you have to face the projectiles and raise. A setting like in Zelda 3, where the shield was passive and triggered while facing the right direction, would have worked better.Or like, if you were able to reorientate Finn or just, move slowly when shield is raised so i can have more control over it.\nThe top down camera in 3D background with 2D characters, projectiles and enemies makes certain actions or situations hard to gauge, perform or dodge too. It happens that you get hit by a bullet or an AoE while thinking you were out of range or, like, under an enemy when actually not.\nYou will also encounter a bunch of crashes on the overworld here and there, especially on the north west zones past the second dungeon, for some reasons. So i'd recommand to save your game often.\n\nSo... Is the game worth playing ? Well, if you like the show and top down RPGs, i'd say yes. The lore is pretty well rendered, there is a lot of references to episodes of the serie everywhere, either being items or backgrounds, npcs or quests. A bunch of secrets to find, an item delivery side quest that is comon to every zelda, dungeons are okay and the end is kind of fun, actually.\nEvery npcs you'll encounter will be voice acted by the actual actors from the show (except for Treetrunk, which is really, really sad !). It's well enough written to excuse some unpolished stability here and there. But the core mecanic already made its proof so you won't be badly surprised.\nThough you have to keep in mind that the game is short, like, really short. I spent 10 hours to complete everything, from storyline to hidden items. If you rush it you can probably finish it in only 4 or 5.","June 4","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
