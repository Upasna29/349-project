I liked the graphics but I played it once and won't go back. It's odd because it has a few things going for it but ultimately it's average and forgetable.\nI'm not too well versed in the Pewdiepie world and it's heavily referenced, so all that is lost on me. In fact I would say a lot of it is lost to anyone who's not pewdiepie or one of the other youtubers featured in the game.\nIt's trying too hard with the "bro" stuff and just doesn't really get to be fun at all, funny or remotely compeling.\n\nPoor level designs, very week jumping mechanics and that sliding when you stop wolking make it awkward and sluggish.\nThe voice acting is probably the worse part, I would have left it to text only as it just takes away any legitimacy it would have had as a game.\nIt's probably best suited for mobile phone gaming: simple, not challenging and quite forgetable. Ideal for extended bathroom visits.\nProbably for fans only really, and even then for those who like bland instantly forgetable stuff.\n\nThankfully I got a refund.","December 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 3,212 of 3,925 people (82%) found this review helpful 197 people found this review funny","82","212","3","197","30"

Remember those really weird marketing games that came out like McKids and CoolSpot and that one game about the noid? This is essentially the modern day version of that.\n\nYou play as Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, a Swedish man who, like me, enjoys yelling at children. But unlike me, Felix gets paid to do so. Suddenly, Felix's home is attacked by...Barrels for some reason and apparently all those kids he likes to yell at were kidnapped. Now, Felix is forced to go on an adventure where he meets people I don't know while making jokes I don't understand so he can save kids I don't like while fighting an enemy I don't care about. Also, he has two dogs that I sacrifice for my own gain on a regular basis.\n\nPewDiePie: The legend of the kidney stones is a 2d side scrolling adventure that will take you around 3 hours to finish. The gameplay is as simple as moving forwards and then jumping with two buttons for powerups that aren't very good. At first, I thought the game was kind of fun, but the longer the game went on and the further I got, Felix's slidey and floaty jumping really got on my nerves. It feels unresponsive and clunky once there are more than three things to dodge on screen.\n\nNow, I will admit, I enjoyed myself for a total of twenty minutes. before all of it got on my bad side. This game made me itchy if that made any sense.\n\nI did not finish PewDiePie: The legend of the wasted lunch money, and I have no intention of ever finishing it. I got to the last boss and that was it for me, I had no intention of finding out what happens at the end. I'd ask who this game is for but there are roughly 40 million people subscribed to the Youtube account so I guess that question is already answered for me.\n\nShould you play: PewDiepIe: The legend of the ♥♥♥♥thisgame?\n\nI honestly don't even know how to make this review entertaining, I'm pretty much just rambling and hoping all of this makes sense, I don't know it could be the huffed paint talking.\n\nDon't play this game unless Felix is your surrogate best friend, I got it as a gift from a friend and he is currently clawing at the inside of a coffin desperately gasping for air at the bottom of a lake.\n\nPewdiepie doesn't get a score, no, I'm not doing it, you can't make me. I'm sure this scathing review will hurt Felix plenty, he can cry himself to sleep on his bed made of money.\n\nYou get nothing out of nothing.\n\nI'm going to go stare at a wall and think about Robocop for a few hours.\n\nThe place where I talk about games I actually like: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n","December 11, 2015","false","3.7"," 2,703 of 3,366 people (80%) found this review helpful 898 people found this review funny","80","703","3","898","91"

Fortunately, as you progress through the levels, you unlock new abilities which add some variety. The characters usually only have 1 difference, (gameplay wise) and that's their abilities. Collecting all of the patches was an easy challenge except for a few, so the game is quite easy. (except on pug mode)\n\nGraphicsThe game's graphics are quite appealing and use pixel graphics, simple enough for the game to run well, and the art's good enough for you to distinguish between the characters. It's very colourful and only a few levels had boring designs. (such as the caves)\n\nFinal ThoughtsThe game is quite enjoyable and runs well, with appealing graphics as well. However, the game is quite short with repetitive levels and only harder difficulty modes and co-op options for thosewho want to continue playing the game. Most of the humour is quite childish and will only be enjoyed or understood by pewdiepie fans. The voice acting is quite bad, despite that most of the people in the game have done skits or similar things before.\nThe game gets a 7/10 but with price tag of £5.60 and the story being as short as it is it is hard to recommend.\n\nBuy it when it's on a sale for about 50% less or more, and it's worth getting, just don't buy it if you don't like the guy because then it'll be the biggest cringe-fest on the internet.","December 16, 2015","false","7.3"," 145 of 195 people (74%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","74","145","195","14","4"

For people who only use the keyboard, the controls are HORRIBLE. Controls are definitely the worst part of the game. Arrow keys and WASD are understandable, but ENTER to do stuff?! Yeah, no. You could have used Z for something like that. And having the up arrow bound to jump is just stupid, when you have a giant spacebar right in front of you. Changing the controls would help to have me recommend this game more, but the way the dogs die in slow motion by exploding into little pieces almost makes me sick. Everything else about it is... passable. The voice acting is kinda half-♥♥♥♥♥, but I can see effort going into it. Most of the graphics also look really good, except for a lot of the characters' busts when they talk. Overall, I'd give the game a 4.5/10. I'd recommend to play for a little bit, but I probably couldn't finish the whole game.","December 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 131 of 186 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","131","186","8","1"

But I can't, I refunded the game and everything. I like Pewdiepie as a person (content is a different thing), so I wanted to give this game a good review, especially since a lot of people were just saying negative things on the forums because they just hate pewdiepie and because this game exists. Honestly, the toxic behavior wanted me to like the game more and hate pewdiepie less instead of hating the game and pewdiepie more. Although, I came into the game wanting it to be up to standards, it failed. The game is good if you're just a big pewdiepie fan, which is nothing wrong, people support their favorite content creator all the time. But if you're not a pewdiepie fan, or if you're a big 2D platformer fan, then the game will seem decent at best. The game felt boring as I played it, I felt if it had more "pewdiepie" humor, if the plot was mentioned more, or if the platformer game didn't seem so basic. If felt like a generic platformer with your favorite Youtubers in it for the most part. I can see that the Youtubers and the indie dev team actually tried their best, but I felt like it wasn't good enough to be a great plaformer game or even a pewdiegame. I mean it would've been slightly funny if he said something everytime he got hit by an enemy. Examples would've been "Damn Barells"  or "Damn no-scope". Something that would've shown signs of frustration on his journey to collect the legendary bro-fist. Which is only mentioned occasionally, the rest of the game is just bland level design for a platformer, with the exception of randomness on the screen.\n\nBut yeah, I feel I've been rambling a lot for a while, so how about I just end with a conclusion. You'll might enjoy this game if you're a big pewdiepie fan if you get all the references and have been wanting to play this game for a while. You'll be disappointed if you're a big platformer fan because this game is not very innovative or creative from a level design standpoint. Especially for a $7.99 video game. If you just despise Pewdiepie, stay away from this game, you're not gonna enjoy nor will you be doing a greater good by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a bunch of 12 year pewdiepie fans because you think his work is "poisioning the minds of the youth" or because they got butthurt over someone that hates pewdiepie. Let them have their fun, it's just a phase. This game was the first game I refunded. Honestly, I actually enjoyed watching someone else play the game, than playing the game myself, lol.","January 6","false","1.1"," 69 of 89 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","69","89","4","0"

What "Pewds" neglected to mention is that it was an utterly generic, nonsensical 2D side-scroller where the difficulty setting makes about as much difference as putting up an umbrella to stop a nuclear bomb dropping on your head.\n\nThe gameplay is utterly tedious bordering on being as much fun as pulling teeth through the nasal cavity, the voice acting is Primary School Nativity bad in some places, and the guest stars are there simply to say they are there. But the thing that finally made me stop playing was that I had to quit the game to see which controls were mapped to which keys. REALLY??\n\nIn conclusion, unless you are an utterly rabid fanboy who foams at the mouth at the mere thought of a glimmer of approval from Pewdiepie because you bought the game, I'd say avoid it.","February 12","false","0.9"," 117 of 183 people (64%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","64","117","183","30","0"

A tribute to all the fans of PewDiePie and quite an excellent tribute, meant to satisfy the hunger of the fans. The game is solely for the fans, if you're not a fan of PewDiePie you'll not enjoy the content too much, honestly. I don't like the fact that there are so many haters at the reviews, they shouldn't be so harsh on this just because there's PewDiePie in it and it's not a solid release like they wanted or something. It's something for the fans, after all and should be treated as a fan tribute, not like garbage. It's not anyone's problem that you can't enjoy a game just because you have a certain hatred for one of the YouTubers included into this game. This little rant was just to highlight the bad part of the community. Anyway . . .\n\nFirst Sight\nSome pixel game with PewDiePie and others, what could go wrong?\n\nGameplay\nOnce you launch the game and get into the first level, you're greeted by the star, PewDiePie himself. Furthermore, get assaulted by barrels and then you question yourself.  "Is this a prank of some sort?"  Not really, but its where the fun and slaughter itself begins. Wood planks fly everywhere as you try to rescue the stars in Pewds' fandom, the difficulty increasing as more versions of the barrels start to spawn.\n\nBasically, the whole house's walls are torn apart and you can see holes everywhere like World War III has unleashed upon PewDiePie's house. Once finished, get called by the barrel king and told to join the barrels or get rekt or something. Been confused about it. Furthermore, get chased down by the first boss and battle barrels while jumping from car to car too. Here comes the part where it hits the fan, the difficulty is even more complex and tougher for platformer newbies and pros alike, in my opinion.\n\nI had absolutely no problems with the mechanics or any freezing whatsoever.\n\nBut, difficulty is just to make the game more fun and challenging to think of a really big reward as well, right, riiiight.. ?\nAnswer is, yes.\n\nUpon finishing most levels on the Bro difficulty and the nice amount of achievements really makes it feel satisfying on the rewarding part, which makes it absolutely sweet.\n\nGraphics\nThe pixel environment is really vivid and the absolute eye candy, really, its worth playing the game for the pixel work as well in my opinion. Enjoyed it and gives off a nice charm.\n\nOST & SFX\nThe chiptune tracks really blasted off into my ears with an amazing feeling, not only that but fits into every level. RUSHJET1 did a great job with the soundtrack, and the sound effects are well done as well. The voice acting isn't something to praise, but it does its job, the little bit atleast.\n\nPros'n'Cons\nPros\n\n+Lots of achievements\n+Addicting\n+Challenging\n+Colorful, beautiful surroundings\n\nCons\n\n-On my side, there's absolutely no cons. I'm no PewDiePie fanboy, but aside from the weak voice acting there is no con.\n\nShould you buy it?\nI recommend to buy it when it's on sale and/or if you want to kill your time and add more achievements to your collection.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group","February 22","true","3.4"," 62 of 122 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","62","122","7","6"

The other unintended audience seems to be people who aren't fond of the "memes" in this game, despite probably being people who can't resist sending Lenny faces after each sentence and probably being quite the dank memester themselves.\nI mean, nothing says "I hate PewDiePie" more than buying his game, right?\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a fun and quirky platformer in the spirit of TurboGrafx-16 games; at least, personally I could feel a faint Bonk vibe in this. It's rather short, yeah, but fun and replayable, and the local multiplayer is a nice bonus. The game has a silly story and numerous references to Pewds' videos (which are memes, according to obviously qualified reviewers), accompanied by occasional voice acting just as serious as the plot.\n\nIt's simple and fun, I don't know.

SIKE. more like that was the worst game ive ever played lmao. just proves my point that all of his fans are re_tard 10 year olds that probly get bullied at school. the only thing cool about pewdiepie is his (kinda??) hot gf but shes not even that hot shes like german or somethin but thats besides the point. his dogs are legit r-tarded and all he doess is yell at a camera -_-. markiplier actually is entertainin and isnt just an over reactin nerd boy with 10 year old fans. and he doesnt have a video game that reminds me of my trashcan.  3/10 and im bein nice about the rating it should be trashcan/10 cuz its literally a trashcan.\n\nif u can name 1 good thing about this game pls do cuz id love to prove you wrong. have fun being 10","December 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","10","21","5","0"

After playing the game for a while, I can safely say that PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist is a fairly decent game. It has a very generic, Mega-Man esque look to it, but it has a few powerups that I have not seen before. However, I can say there are some parts that felt awfully forced. There are achievements and badges, two things I will always praise games for, as well as some other characters including, CutiePieMarzia, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, CinnamonToastKen, Cryaotic, and a duck(for whatever reason.) The plot is... strange to say the least. In summary, I recommend that you at least try this game.\n\n7.5/10","May 4","true","15.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/390520/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bm3WYzaqsQ\n\nMany have heard about Pewdiepie and either adore him or dislike him fueled by personal reasoning, whatever the excuse, Pewdiepie is a renowned “Let’s Play” YouTuber with the largest subscriber count to date and now a game to add to the fame. The game lets the player take the role of Pewdiepie, along with other Let’s Players associated with him, to venture through tedious, platforming landscapes to rescue Pewds fans from the grasps of the relentless and evil Barrels. The game plays like a standard platformer adding other intriguing retro style elements similar to Gradius on the NES to make a bit of variety, which keeps the game interesting.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nQuirky Opponents - While playing the game one sudden realization surfaced: this game is in no way meant to be taken seriously, not even the slightest. After all, the title pays homeage to Pewdiepie’s quirky, online behaviour. The levels are littered with an assortment of random enemies, each one harboring their own unique way of harming you. Most enemies are a variation of barrel characters ranging from regular barrels, who just hop ever-so-closely in hopes of inflicting damage, to TNT barrels that simply explode when you come into close proximity to spray you with harmful debris. While you may think about the oddity of such opponents, things get more peculiar as you witness killer whales falling from the sky and mystical unicorns charging at you with their rainbow entrails. Like I said, the enemies get interesting and/or ridiculous, which is amusing a lot of the time.\n\nSkills or Just Difficult- Platforming is a skill that wasn’t ever weaved into my DNA so it all depends on the player and their level of expertise that will determine the punishment of this game. For someone like myself (who lacks basic platforming skills) they might find the easy mode option appropriate for beating the game, while those who do require a challenge to fully prove themselves can do so. The players can choose between easy, medium and hard which are represented by icons referenced from Pewdiepie’s videos. Depending on each difficulty, opponents can inflict more damage and spawn numerously while levels add environmental dangers to keep you on your toes. Although there was trouble with this, it was appreciated that each level of difficulty was  appropriately tedious.\n\n\nIt’s the Personality and Attacks- When you start the game, players are given the option to select between Pewds and Marzia as their controllable protagonist. As you progress further into the game other YouTubers become available for purchase for a set fee. Upon unlocking them, you can then upgrade their health with in-game currency as well as acquire desirable attacks and defences, however, each character has a designated attack that is tailored to their individualistic attributes. It makes it intriguing but doesn’t necessarily give the player the advantage as each character is limited to one attack and defence move at a time.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nStorytelling-  As stated earlier, this game honestly does not merit a serious reaction. The voice acting is respectively performed by the actual YouTubers themselves and unfortunately sounds more awkward than they probably initially planned. Each sentence was often read with such a dull, monotone rhythm and lacked any excitement, making the storytelling lackluster and forgettable. Then again, the story is overly simplistic since all you’re doing is rescuing the viewers from evil Barrels.\n\nControls-  For most platformers, gameplay mechanics aren’t usually in-depth and complicated. Playing each level should be smooth and with quick ease, however, the controls for this game, even though simple, feel deliberate and awkward at times.  In-game, you have the typical jump with an added bonus of an attack and defence ability. Although the title has these added attributes, controlling the character feels sluggish at times. It also doesn’t help that there is only one default speed implemented in the game. It would have been better to have a sprint like in Mario games.\n\nOver Referenced- The game has a substantial amount of references that will be lost on those who aren't familiar with Pewdiepie’s content. A lot of the images and story plot is ridiculously random just to fit in with the references.\n\nConclusion: Pewdiepie: The Legend of the Brofist is definitely a game for fans because they’ll appreciate the many odd jokes referred in the game. The game had an interesting concept of adding attack and defence abilities but overall gameplay felt slow and sluggish.\n\nScore: Wait for a sale\n","February 9","true","2.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Well, to answer that, I don't know. I think PewDiePie for the most part is NOT a bad youtuber so I think that was a key point, but also because of the state of so many other youtuber games. You know, like: Smosh: Food Battle The Game or Tobuscus Adventures The Game. While I haven't played the Tobuscus one which anyways has faded into obscurity, I did play the Smosh one and it could barely be concieved as a game. However, Legend of The Brofist delivers a nostalgic Metroid-vania style game which while overrun with PewDiePie references that are cringe worthy at times, at least it delivers a fun and enjoyable game. It is really good! The attacks and defences are good, collecting the stamps are enjoyable and I got an insentive to beat this game 100% (which I am still working on). But, there are problems. The voice-acting is pretty bad, the references are out of control and pretty much the concept is interchangeable with any youtubers but for an enjoyable game to have fun with (especially if you like platformers) even if you aren't necessarily a PewDiePie fan. I do recommend this game. - 7/10","February 23","true","18.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

There's not much to fault it for other than being short and the over-the-top fan pandering which, as indifferent, I found to generally be off-putting or not make sense (a rock named Jennifer?), but at the same time I commend it for aiming to please and be memorable to its fans rather than something generic. Needless to say if you despise the guy then you'll despise this game.\n\nPros:\n-It has a nice high-res pixel art aesthetic, looking something like an HD GBA game.\n-The music is pretty great. It sounds like it's going for an NES style and comes off as authentic to me.\n-Fully voiced, though you may consider that a con as they're not voice actors by trade.\n-Collectibles and unlockables to give you stuff to do while/after beating the game. The collectibles are put into tricky-to-reach or hidden areas throughout the levels.\n-There are a number of small touches that make it feel like a polished game with care put into it. Picking up hearts when your health is full turns them into coins so they're not a waste. Changing your costume changes the character portrait in cutscenes. Replaying a level with an unlocked character changes things if that character normally appears in the level. There's a level where you get picked up in a helicopter to escape and if you try to enter it from the top or rear, jumping through its blades, you get chopped to bits as Mark screams "Noooooo". It caught me totally off guard and I couldn't even be mad because it was hilarious.\n\nCons:\n-It's short. There are 27 levels total and if you just do a single playthrough and don't worry about collectibles/unlockables or the 7 optional levels then you'll only get a couple hours out of it.\n-Too easy on any difficulty less than "Bro", probably due in part to its mobile origins. Your upgraded HP tops out at 16 hearts and enemies do 1 heart of damage on "Easy" and 2 hearts of damage on "Hard", but the checkpoints in the levels fully replenish you. "Bro" doubles the damage to 4 hearts and removes the checkpoints, providing a good challenge, though I feel there could be a happy medium between "Hard" and "Bro" for those looking for a slight challenge.\n-When you replay a level the intro/outro cutscenes play again, forcing you to skip through dialogue. About half of the levels have some sort of intro/outro.\n-Of all four YouTuber cameos in the game only one of them is really worked into the plot. The others are forced in and only relevant for a single level.","January 21","true","10.1"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","1"

Therefor, this review is going to be mainly focused on why the negative reviews are wrong in my eyes.\n\nThere's people saying that the music was bad, the graphics were bad, etc.... Those reasons all utterly ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with the graphics or soundtrack.\n\nReally, there's only a few real reasons I could think of for hating the game:\n\n1. It's style of humor; It contains various memes and humor that you would probably expect on PewDiePie's channel in the first place. As I said, many people hate PewDiePie's channel AND the style of humor on it, and those people probably wouldn't like the game's humor as they are very similar. Either way, that's a small part of the game and shouldn't detract from the enjoyment you can get out of it.\n\n2. The story; It's extremely bland and boring. The evil barrels have captured all of PewDiePie's fans--yes, every single 40 million of them--and it's up to Pewds and his other YouTube friends to save them!!!!11!!1 Even though the YouTube friends are probably also technically 'fans' of Pewds and should also have been captured by the barrels but NEVER MIND THAT! While I think the story is bad, it's again, a small part of the game that can be easily overlooked.\n\n3. The voice acting; While I have to admit that the voice acting done by the YouTubers isn't the most 'professional', you have to remember that these people are YouTubers, not professional voice actors. It might not be perfect, but it does the job well enough not to be distracting from the actual game or 'story'. A casual gamer isn't really going to care, but like I said, if you go in WANTING to hate it, then you'll probably end up hating it.\n\n4. The length; For the type of game that it is, it is pretty short. You'll probably end up completing it in a couple hours at best.\n\nAll right, so my ending point is this:\n\nI hate to say it but it's not really special, it's just a pixel graphics platformer game with PewDiePie's name on it, and a couple PewDiePie references here and there.\n\nAlso, considering how short it is, I don't think the $7.99 that they make you pay for this game is really fair. I agree with the $4.99 that the iOS version costed much more, and I still really can't understand why they upped the price.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. It's not supposed to be a particularly special game. It's just simple, good for a couple hours of entertainment. The gameplay is good, with level ideas constantly changing and keeping the game fresh and interesting.\n\nIf you're a fan of PewDiePie, you'll very likely enjoy this game. If you hate PewDiePie, you'll probably end up hating this game. Really, it's just a simple game, nothing more, nothing less.","January 10","true","2.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Coins you can use for purchase a different characters, attack and defend skills and health level.\n\nThe control in a game is enough simple, best if you play this with controller.

However for those three hours you get a lot of content.  Multiple characters (of which I mainly used one when I unlocked him),  Different attack and defense abilities which I only used a couple because all the rest just didn't seem that useful.  And of course extra stages that unlock costumes.\n\nThe graphics are nice and mesh well together with the exception of the potrait shots during dialog sections,  they kinda look like crap.  The voice acting in most parts needs a bit of work and feels stilted but for some characters gets better as the game progresses, with the exception of Marzia's who I found annoying, but then again I didn't use her at all because outside of being the player two character for local-coop just didn't bring anything to the table except be annoying whenever she came up.\n\nThis game clearly had a lot of care put into it and there is a whole bunch small details such as the way certain items interact with the environment, character costumes are reflected in the cutscenes and loading screens with one costume for pewdiepie tying a certain scene together making it all the more hilarious as it goes on.\n\nBut I will admit I actually didn't play as the pewsdter as soon I was able to unlock and play as the lper I like more,  I totally skipped Marzia without even bothering to buy her.  The others I touched upon on my stream of the game just to show them off.\nAll said this was a neat little game and you get a whole lot for a mere six dollars.  and believe me I've played far worse games that had this price tag.  I'm looking at you Banzai Pecan.\nAnyhoo I hope this helps with your decision on whether you want to get the game or not.","February 8","true","7.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I mean, maybe there's some lovely tapestry of narrative in it, but if I have to go watch a youtube dude to figure it out, you haven't told a good story. But you don't play this for the story (dear god I hope you don't, anyway). This game is a pretty open love letter to the 16-bit era slathered in a layer of surreality, and it actually plays damn well. Most levels basically spelled out their intent or were based on something I recalled from my younger days, and while I think one or two stages' gimmicks make their lack of checkpointing* irritating, only the rather-lengthy final boss really held me up for more than 15 minutes. It's also got a bunch of difficulty settings in case you find it too simple/challenging, and after you beat the endboss you can play anything you've beaten on Hard on a one-hit kill, no powerup mode, should you be masochistic enough.\n\nI really wish cutscenes were skippable, but aside from that, this was actually real fun to fiddle with for a few nights.\n\n* The game does feature checkpoints. Just not on some levels, which tend to be non-standard.","January 8","true","10.6"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

I had alot of fun playing this game. Just achieved all the Achievements just a few minutes ago. Pug Mode was insanely hard, i would recommend the developers to change it a little because it's just insanely hard but i got it eventually. There is one big issue the Developers should look into is the "Soft lock" at level "Deep in the Mines" When the eye shoots the Rock "Jennifer" the rock can be stuck and won't move. In order to fix this you have to 'Alt+F4' out of the game in able to play again. Hope they will look into this. This happends quite often and i have no idea what it triggers. I did a speedrun aswell which i extremely enjoy and recommend actually. Here is the run if anyone is intrested: http://www.speedrun.com/run/dy481nnm .

I will say that is short but with such a low price I'm not complaining when you can buy a kind of game like this for $14.99.\n\nIn the end, this game has a lot of passion and heart in it and I can see all the hard work that the game designers did.

It's just meaningless hate towards PewDiePie which I don't even understand. I personally wouldn't call myself a PewDiePie fan, but I do watch his stuff ocassionally (his non-gaming stuff mostly) and heard about this and since I freaking love retro platformers I decided to get this. I'm gonna be honest and judge the actual game. Kinda funny though how many complain about PDP's fanbase for immaturity and then buy the game just to give a negative feedback and refund. Because that totally makes you even more immature.\n\nFirst of all, if you think glorifies PDP's "overreacting" and screaming, you'll be disappointed because the game has none of that, in fact, it's far more tame than AVGN' Adventures which I loved but felt like it went over the top with swearing to the point of not being funny at all.\n\nThe game itself is a pretty standard NES-inspired new-retro platformer where you get to jump your way across levels, stomp on enemies, collect coins and use powerups. While it's nowhere near Shovel Knight's level, it's still really good, especially considering it was originally on mobile. Many levels have some twists to them instead of just being going from point A to point B. The graphics are a nice mix of 8 and 16-bit, look pretty nice and the levels are quite varied graphically. The music is amazing. It might be my favorite thing in this game. Kudos to the artist. The only real issue with the game is it's length. It's quite short, but at least it has some replay value and patches to collect for all your completionist needs. It's also pretty dang challenging on the highest and (especially) extra difficulty.\n\nPros:\n+ Nice presentation\n+ Level Variety\n+ Challenging\n+ Other YouTubers are playable\n\nCons:\n- Short\n- Some minor questionable level design bits\n\nClassic Score\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nContent: 6/10\nFun Factor: 8/10\nOVERALL SCORE: 7/10","January 9","true","5.6"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","2","15","2","0"

I'm gonna chalk that up to me not being an avid side-scroller type gamer. Never even played mario. Anyway, it's a really retro feeling game with beautiful artwork, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting from some cool people, and an okay soundtrack that gets old really quick. There's multiple characters, abilities, and difficulty levels, so theoretically it's got a lot of replayability, but again, this type of game just isn't my thing so the most replaying I'm gonna do is to grab some easy achievements. SO MANY ACHIEVEMENTS. Decent game, wether you like pewdiepie or not. Not amazing, but not bad either, and at less than 10 bucks it's not a bad deal.\n\nBrofist.","December 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","19","0","0"

He seems like a nice guy, but his videos simply don't entertain me, so I'll be reviewing this strictly on how good it is as a game.\n\nThe game obviously has a lot of inside jokes that fans of PewDiePie will get more out of than I did. The weakest part of the game was the dialogue. Not to say that it's awful or anything, but it was nothing special, and not too funny.\nHowever, the animations, sprites and gameplay were funny, so it was fine.\n\nThe game is more fun with a friend in co-op, although doesn't make much of a difference. Most of the levels comprise of the basic platformer rules. Jump onto enemies to kill them, although there are some levels that shake things up a bit like a side scrolling plane shooter.\n\nThe gameplay stays fresh by allowing you to purchase new characters and powerups with the money you've earned throughout levels.\n\nOverall, the gameplay doesn't feel incredibly unique or anything. It's simple and mostly sticks to what has worked in most platformers, but it does it all well! It's a pretty fun game.\n\n(Review copy was provided by the devs, but it does not affect my opinion on the game)\nPlease rate the review up if it was useful.","December 10, 2015","true","3.5"," 1,206 of 2,824 people (43%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","43","206","2","72","47"

Personally I would prefer something more than just collecting patches, like getting unlockable customisations for characters.\n\n\nThe creators have decided to take a selection of classic & iconic game features & merged them into this cute side scrolling adventure game.  It's nostalgic, it's a good time waster & for the money it's a great wee game to have in your library.\n\nIn saying that, there's still a lot more potential for the game to grow.  Although my review may seem harsh considering the team worked hard to create what they have & the game was released not too long ago.\nI'm hoping now that they can expand on the game adding extra features - like maybe a time trial, allowing players to earn extra items by competing against thousands of other bros worldwide for the best time.  As I said earlier, more items for you to unlock beside patches.  Perhaps even bringing in new characters in the future.","December 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 10 of 43 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","10","43","2","0"

Before i found this game i was lost in the deep wide web, searching for something... anything. Then i happened my way across this, never have i believed in heaven before in my whole life or even god at that fact. I was in deep crippiling depression before i found this game. I wouldnt leave my room and i play garrys mod watching anime on yuki theater with other fellow neckbeards. I had the mightiest neckbeard of them all and the best wifu pillow. I reeked of BO and my personal hygiene was appalling. When i first opened PewDiePie:Legend of the Brofist its lights shon upon me, the brightest light i had seen in my mothers basement for atleast six whole months. The voice acting is by far the best i have heard in my life, it has the sweet sound of gods angels singing to me, PewDiePie himself is a god. The storyline is the best since bad rats beating it in a landslide. It contains things many people love, Ducks, barrels, The illuminati and PewDiePie himself (EVEN 360 NO SCOPES!) I will cherish the very first time i opened the game and the tears it brought me the first time i finished it. My life has improved greatley, my hygiene is at a all time low, im turning transparent, beginning to learn the japanese alphabet, and Watch even more anime on garrys mod cinemas at three in the morning. Honestly my rating is 10/10 would barrel roll again","December 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 33 people (15%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","15","5","33","4","3"

The gameplay is fairly smooth and the game itself has a fair bit of challenge to it.  The music is also fantastic as are the pixel graphics and the storyline itself.

I have heard of most of these people but I woudn't be lying if I said my introduction to them was through Pewdiepie and I don't really watch their videos.

In my opinion, I can find a way to make it seem fun to last me a week, getting all the funny little collectibles 'n' stuff. But really? Lets look deeper.\n\nThe game starts with Pewdiepie making a youtube video, regular stuff. Then he wonders how many views his last video got. It got 0. He got confused until a barrel broke into his house and said about containing all his fans and going to contain him. Well you got the point. Pewdiepie is on an adventure to save his fans, and it wouldn't be an adventure without helper characters would it? Special guest stars like Cryaotic, CutiePieMarzia, Jacksepticeye and alot more help Pewdiepie. And theres a few little funny things here and there!

Δεν σχεδιάστηκε για να είναι σοβαρό. Στο τομέα όμως του Gameplay καταφέρνει να ακολουθήσει βασικές αρχές σχεδιασμού και να μας καθηλώσει πίσω από την οθόνη. Αρκετά ελκυστικός ήχος, μουσική αλλά και πανέμορφα επίπεδα. Αν μπορείτε να βάλετε στην άκρη όλα όσα μπορεί να σας ενοχλούν από τους πρωταγωνιστές τότε να είστε σίγουροι πως πρόκειται για ένα πολύ προσεγμένο και καλοφτιαγμένο platformer.\n\nΔιαβάστε περισσότερα στο  Alt-tab.gr [alt-tab.gr]","December 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 42 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","4","42","2","0"

Now, first thing, if you don't like PewDiePie, why are you even here? A lot of the dislike for the game seems to come from one of 3 things, 2 of which are reasonable.\n\n1. Bad experience with bugs and glitches. I have yet to encounter any myself, but a player should always be wary of such.\n\n2. Dislike of the quality. Completely understandable. The voice acting is not that great, and the platforming is rather simple. Don't expect Super Mario or Shovel Knight from this gam (not that the others were, or anything). This seems to be a rather simple game specially crafted for fans of Felix and his friends.\n\n3. This is the unreasonable one. Some people seem to have purchased this game with the intention of giving it a negative review because they don't like the man whose name is plastered on the title screen. They feel the need to insult their peers for enjoying PewDIePie's content, as it's not suited to them. If you're one of those people, there is NO NEED to temporarily spend your money, but instead just do it in a comment section or something for virtually free.\n\nThrough my small amount of gameplay so far, I'd say that only if you're a fan of Felix and co. then go right on ahead and buy. If not, maybe take a small dip and see if you'll enjoy it for the simple game that it is. Hey, maybe you'll find a new source of entertainment from the content creators included. Or the duck. You can always like ducks.  And if you hate him for whatever reason, I beg that you spend your time and money doing something more worthwhile, like charity or children. Please?\n\nPersonally, as an on and off fan, I'd recommend buying this during a sale. Thanks for taking the time to read this! Bye!\n\n---Funny, just realized I said first thing, but there was no second thing. I'm totally a professional.","December 13, 2015","true","1.1"," 47 of 156 people (30%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","30","47","156","4","2"

Das Spiel ist schlicht gehalten und macht dennoch eine menge Spaß. Die Level könnten unterschiedlicher und vielseitiger gar nicht sein. Selbst die Idee von Fässern als Gegner habe ich so noch nicht gesehen. Nur teilweise strapaziert das Spiel die Nerven, da auch auf „leicht“ ziemlich viel von einem abverlangt wird, wie zum Beispiel in den Eislevel, in dem alle Plattformen rutschig sind oder der Slender Abklatsch, der einen in der U-Bahn verfolgt.

Being a pewdiepie fan myself since the beginning I understood a lot of the references, and I chuckled. I do agree that the voice acting isn't that great, and it is dissapointing. But, regardless, the gameplay is fun and reminds me of the old school SNES gameplay mixed with the new school. In terms of difficulty, it takes a bit to master the timing, but anyone who's played in my time of NES/SNES will remember the frustration of timed jumps, and being unable to get to the correct platform with stairs. TO be honest, it takes me back, and gives me a sense of nostalgia. I'd recommend picking it up and trying it for yourself. If you don't enjoy it, simply refund it back. I know I have only a few minutes of gameplay so far, but this is just my first impression.\n\nMy personal opinion:\n\nVoice Acting 2/10 - Not great, could use a lot of improvement\nGameplay 8/10 - Nostalgia factor for the 90's kids\nCustomization 5/10 - Pretty cool unlocks for picking up "bro" coins\nControl 5/10 - At times feels slippery, but again, reminds me of the NES/SNES era\n\nA worthy buy, try it out yourself :)","December 13, 2015","true","3.0"," 17 of 108 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","17","108","0","6"

I played all the levels on all types of difficulty and not completed them yet, it makes the game more challenging and almost extends the gameplay of the game.\n\nMy personal opinion:\nIts a classic 2D pixel game combined with some of my favourite youtubers, the co-op works great and the story is not bad.\n\nI dont reccomend the game if you don't like pewdiepie.\nThe haters only got the game so that they can get thier ego boost by getting attention from thier review.

Some of the music is actually 8bit versions of pewdiepies songs that his fans made for him and he posted and this game has alot to do with his bros in many ways (The Bros).\n\nMy final statements is this is a very well done game and i bought it twice now once for mobile and once for PC and the PC port is my favorite and for 7$ its a must buy!!!","December 12, 2015","true","7.2"," 11 of 127 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","11","127","0","0"

The only (very small) thing that bugs me with the game is the fact that I can't customize my controls. The arrows definitely aren't for me. Would it be possible to have an update to change that ?

There are many references to the pewdiepie channel but i feel like they dont really take center stage of the game. All the fun i had in this game was because of the game itself. Decent humor put everywhere throughout the game. Overall a fun little platformer in general!\n\nEDIT: also a little complaint is that i wish i could move diagonally during the plane section. I like this game but pretty much the only reason this game is bashed is because it's from pewdiepie, which i kind of find unfair... also i went to global achievements and found out that only 19% beat the first boss on hard... which is not that far into the game. Which means most of these reviewers most likely just played the game on easy and bashed the game for being easy. no duh!","December 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 44 of 258 people (17%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","17","44","258","5","0"

Yes the game was first released for mobile devices but did it really hurt the desktop version? After a playthrough I can hinestly say: Not at all. This doesn't feel like a port at all.\n\nGraphics: Just look at the pictures. Either u like 8 Bit graphics or u don't.\n\nstory: makes barely any sense but nobody who every watched anything of pewdiepie would ever expect anything else. gladly the dialoge is very short and doesnt matter at all to enjoy the game. If you dont like pewds just mute the game.\n\nGameplay: The probably biggest point of platformers. This game plays out perfectly. The controls are on spot and could hardly be any better. If you fail it for sure ain't the games fault.\n\nDifficulty: No, this is not an easier AVGN clone, this game itself is tough as nails. While easy is actually really easy, later levels are already quite difficult on "hard" difficulty. And beyond hard are still 2 difficultys of whom 1 needs to be unlocked first. "bro" difficulty really aint easy and might prove a challenge even to die hard platformer players. "pug" difficulty is supposed to be insane of what I heard yet.\n\nReplay value: multiple difficultys, lots of unlockables, multiple chars. nothing more to say.\n\ncritic: there are actually only 2 things I didnt like about the game. First is that you actually have to play markiplyer in almost every level at least once because some of the patches are ronly reachable by his double jump.\nsecond: the game could have more useful unlockables. While the patches are certainly better than nothing they dont add too much to the game while the abilitys lack variety and get old quite fast. They work technically but I wish there were more of them to unlock. I wish the game had more skins as well.\n\nOverall: If you like pewdiepie or not is totally up to you but this game is a very good platformer despite its origins. 9/10\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","5.3"," 56 of 314 people (18%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","18","56","314","9","0"

Also certain points in the begining levels Pewdiepie and Marzia sound awkward.\n\nAnyhow Mark is the best voice actor I've heard so far and sounds on point evn if his lines are random as can be... anyway from what I've played I would say this game is 7/10 the story isn't the best and it's heavily influenced by pewdiepies channel content and to people wo are unfamiliar with it, it just seems really random *cough* exploding whales falling from the sky *cough*.

The upgrades, characters etc are also well made. The easy mode is not really as easy as you think, but it's good. There are many cool designed levels, which are chill in my opinion, nothing too ''try hard''.\nThe voice acting is really good, from everyone who's in the game.\n\nTo be honest, I really don't understand why some of the people don't recommend the game, when PewDiePie and others worked so hard on this game for everyone to enjoy, and also for a really good price.\n\nTotally recommend the game if you want to buy it, especially the bros. :P\n\nMy short game play on 4 levels on the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPc58FLiN40","December 10, 2015","true","9.5"," 29 of 223 people (13%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","13","29","223","5","3"

All the reviews that I have seen are awful and saying the game shouldn't be bought. I kind of agree with them as it is an arcade game which costs quite a lot for what it is. Once you've completed the game, (which took me about 3 hours doing all the levels and redoing some to get coins) you are not gonna come back as there is not much else to it. I feel this game is a almost a troll and a way to joke about pewdiepie's habits in a video game.  However, I'm not gonna be too harsh about this as it is a decent game while it lasts. The controls feel really stocky though, so I went out and bought a logitech wireless controller but it still felt like the character movement was not fluid. (That was forty quid wasted). The gameplay in general was okay, though. But the game to me is just a joke and isn't worth playing unless you want to support Felix as a bro. Even I find it tiresome, so I would not recommend this even though it's a cheap price it still is too expensive for what it is. When you've gone through the entire game through its frustration, blood and tears, and smashing the controller on your face, thats the end. Better go out and buy a new one. If you want my opinion, don't buy this, go buy gmod or something else. (great game btw).\n","January 9","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
