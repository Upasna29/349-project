This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.\n+ Very skill-based and competitive. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.\n+ Tolerable community. Most of the time they show sportsmanship and are very fair.\n+ Lots of community created content. Also includes the Steam Workshop.\n+ User friendly track, car and replay editors to create said content.\n+ Great car physics.\n\n- Ubisoft decided it'd be a good idea to split the TM² environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. The result? Less players, less servers. You won't have a problem though until you hit 60k ladderpoints - that's when you have to play on different servers to gain more. And those servers are rather dead.\n- Said car physics tend to mess up sometimes, but that's usually the map builder's fault.\n- 5min cooldown on official races is a bit too long. In fact, why do they even make you wait? You could simply pay with Coppers (the currency) in previous games to try again, however, this doesn't work here. So this makes it really tedious to get good times on official races.\n- The price tag. TMNF was free, while this is $10, even though it's pretty much the same game.\n\nTrackMania² Stadium is an updated version of TMNF, ported to the updated engine with ManiaPlanet. It's great, but I wouldn't recommend picking it up at its full price.\n\n8/10","November 16, 2013","true","67.5"," 360 of 461 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","360","461","0","11"

Surprisingly addictive. I bought this expecting 5 hours max of gameplay. I would drive around in my car a little bit, crash into some wall, then go. Honestly, looking at the name and trailers, I wasn't really expecting a great game. I was so wrong. This game is great. The tracks, the concept, the art, even the music. Everything about this game was done right.  The levels aren't repetative so you won't get lulled into a bored repetitive leveling. No, each level has its own new quirck and obviously a new track. If you are going to buy this, be prepared to start honing your keyboard driving skills because this fast-paced game will require skill. But skill that you won't mind training for because it is such a fun game.","July 2, 2014","true","44.0"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","58","62","0","0"

Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played.","December 22, 2013","true","50.7"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","63","77","0","0"

I have a long history with this game and it will always be in m heart. The developers are cool guys and ive had the honor to meet them on several occations, including their 10 year anniversary at the Ubisoft HQ where we, the invited, played against the developers where we crushed them.\n\nI can't say more about the game itself because I straight up ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Especially the tools. ..and also the gameplay. Trackmania 2 Stadium doesn't do much new other than upgrading the engine, adding a few new block types and upgrading the mediatracker. The single player by Papychampy is probably the best campaing they have made. The gameplay is still the same, (which is good though) but has a constant flow of new maps every day to keep it entertaining. This is the reason why I can still jump into the game and play some maps, 9 years later. Though since the original (and expansion) was free, I have no problem paying for this game.\n\nSadly the game isnt what it used to be, because a lot of the core community players have fallen off the rails. This game was fun because of the community. People made a lot and was very creative. You could join clans just to have fun, which made me play it for at least 6 hrs a day back in 2006.\n\nMy one reccomendation doesnt justify how much this game is to me.\n","January 25, 2015","true","295.2"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","44","48","5","4"

It's like the company asked a bunch of 4th graders to come up with ideas for a racing game, and this is the result. Wall rides, loops, huge jumps, crazy speed. It's awesome.\n\nThat being said, the skill cap is infinitely high. Yes, it's massively fun to go on a server and smash through a bunch of new tracks, crashing all over the place and hitting walls like they owe you money. And it's worth mentioning that since the multiplayer is almost exclusively user-created levels, there are tens of thousands of maps to play. But once you settle in to a server and have learned the maps, then it becomes a wonderfully technical game about shaving off bits of time where you can.\n\nA notable game mechanic, for those unaware, is that in time attack mode (probably the most popular game type, that and Rounds) you can reset to the beginning of the track (or the last checkpoint) at any time. This is a bit of departure from many other racing games. You'll just have a set amount of time (usually 5 to 7 minutes), to get a single best run possible. This makes it so that you never have to waste time finishing a run when you've already messed up, you can just reset and start fresh immediately. Makes for a much more efficient practice regimen, and resulting rate of improvement.\n\nThere are three environments within TrackMania 2 (Stadium, Valley, Canyon), but within each environment is an abundance of variety in itself. Since this review is Stadium, I'll focus on that briefly:\n-Track materials: Pavement, Dirt, Grass, Water\n-Game Modes: Time Attack, Rounds. Probably others, but rarely used. RPG, I suppose.\n-Track Types: FullSpeed (because braking is for losers), Tech (because fullspeed is for neanderthals), Dirt (because you are full of self-loathing), Speedtech (Because you're a well-balanced individual with many friends and a winning smile).\n\nSeriously, the infinite permutations of tracks alone makes this game worth it.\nThe End","July 13, 2014","true","644.6"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?\n\nWell, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.\n\nIf you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nIt's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.\n\nHere's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.","January 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 63 of 89 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","63","89","0","3"

If you are looking for a racing game with crashes and power-ups, this is not for you. TMS has a large surplus of maps with various difficulties. Almost every track involve a very large amount of skill to pull of fast times. TMS has a single-player mode and it's pretty basic. You competing against yourself to get bronze, silver or gold medals. The single-player is here to enhance your ability to do better on courses and to make you even better at the game. The money is well spent when you play multiplayer.\n\nThere are a ton of servers that are up across the world. All ranging from U.S. to Germany to Japan. I was amazed by how the servers ran, even with over 50 people. Obviously, this was needed as this type of game relies on time based racing.\n\nIt's exhilerating to go at a such high speed and making perfect turns as you barely beat the opponent who is ahead of you. You actually feel like you are going extremely fast and it makes the game challenging and pretty addicting at certain times. The graphics in TMS aren't amazing compared to TrackMania Valley, but they get the job done as well as the audio.\nThe controls aren't totally perfect, but they're responsive enough to give you a chance of making some really good times.\n\nI'm not that great at the game, but these last 7 hours have improved me as a player and I can only learn from the professionals around me.\n\nPROS:\n+High Speed Time Trials\n+Great Amount of Tracks\n+Solid Controls\n+Good Community with a large surplus of servers\n+Decent Price\n+Excellent Frame-rate with very rare connection issues\n+Skill Based\n\nCONS:\n-Can get tedious on occasion\n\nWhile I only have one con, that bullet is very important. I rarely find myself playing TMS for more than an hour on any given time which isn't that great of a thing. Although, TMS is a solid game nonetheless.\n\nTRACKMANIA2 STADIUM: 7.0/10","November 26, 2013","true","6.8"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","0"

Valley is the middle ground of the TM games,it feels more like stadium with more traction on the road,but ultra fast like canyon but doesn't offer anything really different apart from being an all round great game,however there are some other things about valley that do stand out and that's in it's level track design,the editor has a little more scope for making day and night time tracks,forrest tracks and underground tracks that can have you driving through mountains,i would say it's the middle ground and having all the of the best features of the two before it you would think it's the best of the bunch but it just isn't ! not a thing wrong with it but it still can't beat stadium.\n\nI would always recommend Stadium as the starting game,it's the cheapest of the three and the core game is there,the other two are just as good but I would say Stadium is the best of the three,with stadium you do not even need to ever play the other two games,the other two are for those who can't get enough of the Trackmania series and it's also good to change out every now and then for something s bit different to race on.\n\nCONS\n\nThe game like soo many others are not without problems,many bugs have already been sorted but I found the Trackmania series in particular to have some very backwards design ideas/flaws,for the most part this game and it's expansions will run 60fps+ on the very high graphical settings,some settings still slow it down like motionblur but thankfully you can turn all details from off,low,med,high,the vsync options are not very well explained as there are six options for vsync as well as triple buffering and first time users won't know the correct/best setup,I will say now that you should use vsync,also use every third frame (not constant frame) and also use triple buffer and this should give you a proper 60fps,water shader detail for medium pc's should be med or low,and motion blur would be recommended as off,there are many other options in the start up menu and you should take the time in setting these up,resolution is very important in this game,i found that lower resolutions are fine but you really miss the graphical details so I would recommend you aim for 1080,full frame rate with vsync options and then turn up other details to see what you can get away with.\n\nOther problems with the game are the lack of support,this game is made by a French company and the forums and users are mostly EU users,there's not as many users from the uk and usa on the forums,that doesn't mean there are not many users from uk and usa playing the game,just means we try to avoid the unhelpful forums as I found I didn't get anywhere when asking for help.\n\nThe game's layout,the way the game works can be quite strange as well,you earn points for scoring high,these points are called Planets ? your planets are displayed in the top bar when you are in the main menu,these Planets are then used to buy online user created content,you earn a little planets each day that you play as well,another thing that seems backward to me is the apparent new menu system that combines everything together (it doesn't actually work) after all the time this game has been out it still is broken but since an update a month ago it is now working outside of steam but the steam version is still unworking,this means that if you own two or more of the trackmania games,you need to exit out the game and start then other one up from steam ( not a big deal really)\n\nOverall this game is amazing,be prepared to spend some time on the game,take your time and mess about in the menus and try to get used to the way the Trackmania system works,playing the game for the first time gave me the feeling of (wtf have I just bought ?) it took me a while to understand the games charm,I was expecting far too much from the game and when I couldn't really GET the concept of the game along with the many problems I faced in trying to find out what Planets are and why my planets would disappear without buying content or sometimes I would buy content and lose my planets but not receive my item,I found it very hard in finding the answers on google or the mania forums,little things like this can really put you off a strange game and concept like this one,but give it a go and you will find it hard not to fall in love with this game,it's a classic reborn and in my opinion one of the best hardcore/arcade racers you can get !\n\n10/10","June 29, 2014","true","390.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

I practice in the French scene because the French dirt scene fits my style of play: fast paced, high slip angle rallying with tons of ridiculously difficult jumps. you have to flip through the servers to find a group of maps and people that fit your style of play, and that takes a couple hundred hours.\n\ni want to say: its worth it. if you take the time to become good at drifting at all speeds (at least 500 hours for me) then you will discover a deep, involving gameplay experience that sucks you in and begs you to take that corner just a little bit faster, to drift harder, to look down the road and wonder, "how fast can i REALLY go?" "can i make the bonus jump this time, or will i settle for the regular jump? i need 200 more KPH!"\n\nthat is why i love this game. i hope you will too.","April 1, 2015","true","244.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","1"

A friend of mine made me buy it years ago (he loves it). I didn't like racing with keyboard, I disliked the casual arcade style, I disliked the very short races.  I found a whole bunch of things to dislike and noted them in order of priority (that list has been lost now, perhaps thrown away inadvertently).\n\n2015 is drawing to an end, and having recently purchased an Oculus DK2: I downloaded the demo of Trackmania Stadium.  I can tell you that Trackmania with Oculus is a whole new experience! The graphics are beautiful in stereoscopic 3d. The visuals are very sharp, beautifully lit and it all looks very real. Not even the slightest hint of judder (running in extended mode 6.0.1. runtime windows 8, Nvidia 680).\n\nI think HMD VR has the unique ability of being able to reveal to you the beauty of a particular game you couldn't fully appreciate without it.\n\nWhen playing games the conventional way through a TV or monitor - you're seeing that game world from a distance (through a small window). With VR you are projected into that world - everything is life size. You tend to notice things and feel immersed to a degree not possible even with the best 4k monitor or large screen TV.\n\nControl-wise it's nice to see Trackmania automatically detect my Saitek X52 Pro so I can use the joystick for racing (I haven't had to configure anything!). Much nicer than key-presses.\n\nRacing in 3rd person with Oculus is mind-blowing (3rd person was also on my dislike list in the past).  You get to see all of the detail in the game and the tracks are jaw-dropping. I find myself looking up at the sky or at the intricate scenery. I would say this is one of the best VR experiences you can have.  In an instant I have converted from someone who didn't like the game (previous versions), to someone who thinks it's stunning and hopes Nadeo convert their entire series to VR. Yes, for every Trackmania game released with VR support: I will buy and recommend to others.\n\nTrackmania is a great example of a game that reveals its true beauty through VR...\n\nNadeo should be very proud of this creation.","October 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

Good for casual racers, good for competitive players... everyone gets what he/she wants.\nOnly downside for me is the fact that the publisher does not at all push this game as an e-sport, while it is still played at most LAN's and e-sport events... and the playerbase is pretty huge for a racing game. The potential is there to be much larger, but unfortunatly Nadeo/ubisoft does not seem interested...\nOther then that, great game, great tournaments, great community.\nI've been playing Trackmania pretty much since it came out, about 10 years ago, and still play its almost every day :)","January 18, 2014","true","576.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It is multiplayer time trials. Everybody is racing at the same time, for the best time. You cannot directly interact with the other cars but you can see them and you are competing with them. Most tracks are only about 30 seconds long and you get about 5 minutes to get the best time possible. All the while you know how well your competitors are doing and see them racing besides you. It is a very intense and fun experience.\n\nTrackmania 2 Stadium is the direct sequel to Trackmania Nations Forever and includes an updated engine with much better graphic, a nicer user interface, better multiplayer, more tracks, and a more active community. It is all about speed and crazy tracks with loops and fast curves.\n\nThe other Trackmania 2 games, Canyon and Valley, feature different environments. Canyon is more on-road racing with wider tracks in a beautiful desert environment. Canyon also includes nicer-looking cars which show damage when you hit things. Valley, which I have not yet played, features more off-road driving. All games have the capabilities to create your own tracks or download pre-made tracks from the Internet.\n\nI recommend starting with Trackmania 2: Stadium as it is the cheapest and most popular environment. Trackmania Nations Forever is free on Steam if you want to try out the original.","July 24, 2013","true","2.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

It gives middle finger to all rules that made by other racing game before, and build its own mechanism. You can imagine this is like a qualification session in F1: the track is yours alone, others are ghost, we all try to score the fastest time and the result get displayed when the racing time is due (around 4-5 minutes), winners get podium and some points to raise level, loser stands behind, and we go to the next track. No parts to unlock, no coin to buy, no secret move, no NOS, everybody got the same engine, same car, same speed.\n\nSo what makes this game stand out?\n\nThere's a lot of wacky track created by a maniac in multiplayer mode. Sometimes it's so absurd that maybe just around 1-2 people able to finish it, the rests are struggling, "Where should I go?! Where should I go?!" There's a lot of fliptable and WTH moments when you accelerate your car very fast and laughing the next second because the track is just disappear into nowhere. Most of the tracks, even absurd, is doable. But it's pretty normal to hear people cursing the track maker because the sensation of getting trolled is high here.\n\nCompetitive racer will get satisfaction from scoring the fastest time, while the more casual racer will get fun and hilarious time from able to defeat those absurd tracks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/232910/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Definitely not the game I thought it was. I knew it was whacky but found out there was a bit of seriousness behind the scenes. Watching the previews I got the sense it would be similar to HotWheels Turbo Racing in which players were able to maneuver the cars in mid-air. This is not the case here; you'll need to time and calculate your speed, angle and take-off.\n\nThe gameplay within this game is pretty rock solid. Although simplistic in nature, the game delivers a solid driving experience. The steering is tight but feels closely to the stiffness of an F1 car. The acceleration feels like you're speeding up and gaining momentum. Complete the former two with outlandish tracks with extremely tight and fun turns makes it almost into a complete game. The career mode in this is a bit odd. It seems as though the game was meant to be played online but can provide just as much fun offline. The only catch here is you're not really racing. You are, but you're not. Most of the career races involve time attacks. There are races which are lapped but for the most part it's time attack. Some gamers may find racing by yourself is a bit of a nuisance, even for single player mode. Again, online there can be multiple people on the track at the same time but in time attack, you'll be racing a ghost. Completing each race challenge results in attaining either a bronze, silver or gold card depending on your performance. The game is good enough that single player does not feel like a grind (in my opinion). Record breaking times are kept for each individual track and gives the player a ghost to play against.\n\nTo maximize time and acceleration, it's best to try and keep straight and avoid jumps. This will be unavoidable as the tracks go from a linear build to some extremely crazy turns and loops. The race starts in a straight line. Then some turns will be thrown in. Next thing you know you're driving sideways then into a loop-to-loop. One thing to note is that when you drive through a loop, it switches to first person view. This may drive some nuts as a quick view switch is sort of unexpected. The tracks themselves can change from concrete, to grass or to gravel/dirt (which significantly effects turning controls). I find for most turns simply letting go of acceleration can work but there are cases where you'll need to specify which brake type to use. The hard brake slide/stop will bring your car quickly to a halt for sharp turns while the hand brake will allow you to maintain speed while sliding. Additionally, being in the air can cause quite some complications. If taking off isn't done right, sometimes the car won't land properly or spin out of control. There is an "air-brake" sort of feature in which you need to hold acceleration but tap the brake button in the air. Doing this tries to halt your movement. If you take a jump poorly, most likely you'll end up with poor results.\n\nWhat isn't advertised is the fact that (I'm assuming all) Trackmania is local co-op. There is an option for local play which can include up to four players. The players are sort of limited in choice regarding game mode. The only mode available is "round" in which the first player across the finish line wins. On top of this, if you do manage to complete all the courses and do get tired of local and multiplayer, the devs have been kind enough to include a solid track editor into the game. Want an entire track full of loops? Go ahead and go nuts. Just be aware that the cars need enough acceleration to make it through certain points! Adding a speed boost can definitely help reduce free-falls.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good for a game with a bit of age. Everything seems to have a nice polish and colors mesh nicely together. Not to mention, the back drop of being in a giant stadium is neat. The only thing that's extremely bothersome for me is not being able to see the nose of the F1 car in first person view. Sounds are generic and are decent. There isn't much to talk about here either than the sounds play/change at the right times (when you change track from concrete to grass) and the engine sounds are decent.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game for what it is, an outlandish track game. It's not exactly a racing game per se, but it will give any racing fan something to play.\n\n\nRATING : 7.1/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nEven for a dated game, the visuals are still nice\n\nThere are a lot of obstacles to go over, under and through\n\nRacing a ghost\n\nLovely view\n\nLook well through the menus for local play\n\nCourse selection screen","April 27","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The car is fast, and most of the tracks are great fun!  I like how most of the races are quick, like under 2 minutes.  One thing I hate about racing games is long multi-lap races that take a long time to re-do if you have to make first place.  This game has a lot of variety in the tracks, and most of them are really fun.  Some of the tracks are lame and don't have any clear direction to go, you have to search around using trial and error.  The menu system UI is very odd and lacking, but not a deal breaker.  The default xbox360 controller layout is very odd, I may customize it to a normal racing game layout later.  Anyways, this is the only one in the series that I have played, and I recommend picking it up on sale sometimes!","January 9, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Let me try and pick a few.\n\nFirst off, this is very much skill-based. Even on the 'silly, luck' tracks (which I'll come to in a moment). Play online, and you'll find pro-level gamers showing almost unbelievable levels of skill and achieving the seemingly impossible. But it's not impossible - this is a very fair game. Any cheating is caught and eliminated pretty quickly. All the cars have the same spec, there is no car-to-car collision to mess up your times. It's (mostly) just you, and a track, and your level of skill that determine how well you do.\n\nNext, the variety. The track creator provided allows an almost limitless tracks, and the community has produced masses of content. This obviously varies enormously in both style and quality, but since you are generally only on any given track for 4-5 minutes, if you don't like one you just wait it out and see if the next is more your kind of thing. And probably, in those 4-5 minutes you'll try it anyway and still get sucked in to try and beat your own times at the very least.\n\n[continued in comments]","March 8, 2015","true","782.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

For those who already have some experience and are looking to up the ante, there are private servers with tons of custom maps that span all difficulty levels.

And occasionally back in multiplayer I'll see some track I know I've beaten, and I'll try it only to find out I've forgotten some of the subtleties of the track and have trouble even finishing.  They are very challenging tracks, and best of all - continuosly new ones are being developed by a community that won't be going away any time soon.\n\nAlso, I only race using the keyboard for steering - so I suck.

That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.\n\nedit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)\n\nPros\n\n-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.\n\n-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a "playlist" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.\n\n-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.\n\n-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.\n\nCons\n\n-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on "Stadium" from Steam, then decide to play "Canyon" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.\n\n-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the "Start Game" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.\n\n-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit "more blue" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)\n\n-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use "multiple profiles" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say "You must connect online to launch the game." I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.\n\n-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.\n\n-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).\n\n-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)\n\n-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to "take" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.\n\n-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.\n\nIf you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.\n\nGet it on sale, avoid it otherwise.","December 31, 2013","false","96.2"," 94 of 185 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","94","185","0","5"

Except it's better.\n\nTrackMania is widely known as being one of the most difficult racing games ever - to beat the different achievements ("medals") on each track, you need to clock some seriously freaking amazing times.  And then there's the so-called "Author Medal" - the medal you can only achieve by beating the best time set by the track's creator.  I've played this game and TM:NF for years and I've only ever earned about three of them, at best.\n\nThe visuals of this game are absolutely stunning, bringing the cars, tracks, and of course the stadium itself, truly to life.\n\nThe amount of content in the game is virtually limitless, from user creations in the Workshop to tracks you can put together yourself.  The map creator gives you literally as much flexibility as the game's creators had, and is super easy to use.\n\nThe multiplayer is a lot of fun too - connecting to servers and racing live with other players, or even having everyone individually clock their own best times, with a time limit to see who can clock the best time the fastest.  It's very easy to set up a server of your own too!\n\nAnd I also like the "Official Time" function - that's something they didn't have before in TM:NF.

TrackMania Stadium is a racing game that anyone can play regardless of skill level and whether you're interested in racing games or not. This game just requires lots and lots of practice as all this game is about is just reactions and learning certain tracks. Different people from all over the globe play this game and their rank is given in respect to their location on the Globe eg. Europe, Oceana etc... This is a non contact racing game meaning that it's not about coming first across the line but more about your time, so what ever server you join will not have any lag which is quite cool actually. If all you care about is skill, reaction times, and all out fun then this is the game you NEED to get.

I picked it up  on a Steam sale for around $2.50 along with Trackmania Canyon for me and a friend because it was so cheap. There's a stripped down single player version: No story, no opponents (Except for the predeterminded time goasts), no collision. Just you and the road.\n\nThe multiplayer is the real reason why you would buy this game, though. The basis of multiplayer is that you have at set amount of time to finish the track and get the fastest time possible, while others are doing the same. There's a "place" in that it's how you match up against other player's fastest times. It has an extensive server list, modding community, and track creators, and they're friendly!! Some actually say hello and strike a conversation when a new person joins. Because the game relies mostly on skill, professional racing teams have been created. I must say, server admins have a very good taste in music.\n\nOn the visual side, it looks very good, and because it's a reletively light game, you'll be running a pretty high FPS most of the time. You can also design your own vehicle skins, either the default car, or something from the Steam community. The modding community can let you race around the track as Sonic if you want.\n\nThe game itself can be pretty hard, to be honest. Many tracks require split second reaction time with very low margin for error. Don't be discouraged if you crash off the track a few times or if the pros get a faster time than you. Happens to the best of us. The more you play a track, the better you naturally get at it.\n\nOverall, try to get it on a Steam sale. You might like it.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","116.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the single-player mode, you get a set amount of tracks split into five groups of skill level, White being the easiest and Black being the most difficult (a bit like the karate belt system) and within those tracks, there is no room (as I know) to download other tracks and play them alone in single-player.\n\nMultiplayer is a whole different story, however. As you get more used to a server and it's map rotation (if there is one) you'll be able to remember the tracks as you play them within the five to ten minute time limit per map, and shave off those precious few tenth's of a second, sometimes even making it come down to the hundreth's of a second, truly making your mark in the track's leaderboard. A bit like Formula 1 in that matter, as it really comes down to the skill of the driver, and the knowledge of the track that you're on.\n\nBut don't let that deter you if you aren't into that track-precision stuff, as there as many other fun-orientated maps which don't focus as much on your time taken, albeit there are less people on those servers.\n\nStory = -/10 (no story)\n\nMultiplayer = 9/10 (amazing community, great maps in general, easy to get along with)\n\nGraphics = 8/10 (when maxed out, the game can and does look stunning)\n\nGraphics Perfomance = 9/10 (runs very smoothly on older pc's and laptops)\n\nControls = 10/10 (personally, I play with a keyboard, but controllers are supported too, and again, how you drive your car really makes the difference)\n\nTotal = 36/40\n\nFinal Comments - Please, if you can, pick up Trackmania² Stadium when you can, or even Canyon or Valley. If you have to wait for a sale, then so be it, but if you can buy it at full price, then please support the developers behind the amazing game(s) that is Trackmania².","January 2, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The game engine is still great and I understand that the developers were reluctant to change too much from the mechanics that made the series great in the first place. The graphics have been slightly improved although not the level of AAA racing games, the gameplay and replayability makes up for the lack of polish and eye-candy found in other games.\n\nThe only gripe that I have is the archaic menus and UI, although not difficult to navigate through by any means, they should overhaul the navigation for the main menu and server browsing, as it is, it looks pretty dated.\n\nRecommended for Trackmania fans, not recommended for those looking for more than just simple racing fun(crazy tracks, time attacks).","January 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This also isn't an enormous evolution over the previous TM games, despite the "2" tacked onto it. There's some more online community stuff in the menus, but I'm not sure of the point of any of it and generally ignore it.\n\nIf you're going to get any TM2, get Stadium, and probably ignore the other two. Stadium's parts tend to be more versatile and there are more community tracks. Stadium was originally a standalone free version of Trackmania United, and then when United Forever rolled around Stadium was the one environment you could play for free, so naturally it had more players and the community glommed onto it more. Nadeo also gave it a more diverse set of parts in Forever than the other environments, and it's been expanded on even further in this game.\n\nThere is a demo and I'd highly recommend checking it out.","February 27","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Put simply, it doesn't offer anything new over its free-to-play predecessor Trackmania Nations.\n\nThere's also the issue that because Nadeo has split the game into three separate versions; Stadium, Canyon and Valley, it has managed to separate the community of players. This has left the multi-player servers somewhat sparsely populated.\n\nIn short, if you you're a Trackmania veteran, you don’t need this. If you're new to Trackmania you can play essentially the same game for free, so go and play Nations and see what all the fuss is about.","November 25, 2013","false","1.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.\n\nAnd then it all comes tumbling down.\n\nHalf the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.\n\nIf this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self.","November 25, 2013","false","4.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","4"

Get a race sim.\nYou want crazy stunts and awesome tracks out of the workshop? Get Distance!\n\nThis game is just not worth your money when there are much better racing games out there.\n\n\nOverall, I would say this game is actually pretty solid. Good physics, decent controlls, nice track editor. But it's multiplayer is quirky and the sheer focus on perfect technical driving is tedious and requires more effort than its worth. It's fun, yes, but it could be more fun.\n\nWhich is why I recommend you look elsewhere for fun racing games. Trackmania was cool when it was one of a kind.

You know several laps of competition with other cars, maybe pushing them out of the track.\n\nInstead this game is about repeatedly racing very short segments until you get them perfect (or just manage to get to the end for the more challenging tracks). As soon as you make a mistake you can reset and restart instantly by just pressing a button. You can do that alone (against your ghost) or on a multiplayer server where you can see the others but there is no interaction with their cars.\n\nIf you're the type of obsessive gamer that loves retrying something hundreds and hundreds of times, then you may enjoy this.

You are then poked and proded to log 50 times before you can get to anything that even says TM2 Stadium. Being that I don't quite care much for social aspects of racing games (infact, i have no interest in them other than to drone offline usually) I of course told it to go away and said log in offline.\n\nSeems simple enough ok, maybe i can get to play the game; TrackMania2 Stadium -> enter -> "Title not available"\n...iight, cool sounds good. So, went to go for good measure try to make an account; Lol no thanks after about the 4th screen, Especially concidering the networking of the game seems to run on peer to peer which is heavily throttled by my isp. So I gave up, and went to look on the forums (always an exciting experience, as i'm sure many know.) Found nothing regarding offline play for the most part, other than some posts in russian that weren't really relevant.\n\nAre my issues with this game easy to get around?\nPossibly, Though I don't quite care to jump through hoops for 2 hours though for something supposed to be relaxing.\nI'll probably end up getting it fixed someday but, For the purpose of relating ease of access to certain things^^^\n\nIs this game a game for people who like an easy offline racing experience?\nNo, wouldn't say so. If you're down with all the multiverse fluff then it could be the game for you but; I'm sure there are plenty out there for who it is not their idea of fun.","December 24, 2013","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I am biased. Against TM2 (Track Mania 2) and towards TMU (Track Mania United). Let me tell you why.\n\nReview of Track Mania 2 : Stadium\nSo, before I begin delving into the depth of deprivation, let me tell you that this is essentially "Track Mania United - Stadium". Except TMU came with 6 other areas, which are essentially "themes", you could play in.\nPrice Comparison:\nTMU - Star Edition --> 29.99€ (seven areas + some small extras)\nTM2 - Stadium       -->  9.99€ (one area)\nTM2 - Stadium + TM2 - Valley + TM2 - Canyon --> 39,99€ (three areas)\nI am a little speechless. And in order to prevent myself from getting a headache, I will treat the rest of the review as if that is not a giant rip off.\n\nA fair reviewer treats games independently. The 6th iteration in a series need not necessarily be worse than the 1st. And I would give TM2 - Stadium the benefit of the doubt, if it weren't for the fact that it is an exact copy of the TMU stadium area. The size of the stadium, the pieces that are used to build the tracks, even the color of the grass if it isn't stuck on a darker shade again for a couple of blocks because screw unified grass colors. That would be silly, right? I could of course just be a giant doof and missed the "Unify grass colors again" button, but I believe there is none. There is but a single set of road pieces that got added from the last iteration of TM.\n\nMaybe I should have expected that, when I bought a TM game with the name "Stadium". But I didn't excpect a company to be as cocky as to sell an area they sold before for another 10 bucks and call it "Track Mania 2". But Nadeo just laughs a "Think again!" in my face.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nTrack Mania is about driving on courses built with an open level editor. It is about driving a course over and over and over again until you can beat that sweet gold medal time. It's about building your own tracks, and watching your friends drive into walls you placed at inconvenient locations.\nTrack Mania is a racing game with essentially infinite levels, built with the same +100 pieces. It is fun, it is competitive and it is exciting.\n\nFor those of you who don't know the TM Series yet: It's not a game where you can crash into other people. You'll be always driving against their "ghost". TM is about finding that ideal path through a course, not about pushing other people off the track.\n\nThe controls are as simple as you can get. Arrow keys to control your car, backspace to respawn at the last checkpoint. These are rebindable, of course. You can also use a gamepad which allows for precise driving with the analog stick. I personally prefer the keyboard, because the TM tracksusually are about trying to find the ideal path in a course, and analog input is hard to repeat perfectly every time you try again. It seems to me that the game engine and car physics have been tweaked to accomodate analog input more, which makes the cars drift a lot when using digital input i.e. the keyboard. That is more of a problem with the other areas and not so much with stadium, so I will not consider that as a disadvantage for this game.\nThere is no split screen option, as far as I am aware. Local players have to take turns. There never has been a split screen option in any of the TM games. I don't know why, because it is a fun game to play against friends locally; racing games in general are.\n\nTo conclude all of the above: The gameplay is solid. The game executes what it wants to do perfectly.\n\n\nGraphics\n\nPeople say, TM2 has really nice graphics. Be prepared to drop some frames on crowded tracks though if you crank them up to the highest setting. In addition to that arguably small flaw, I had to consult the internet to find a way to change graphics settings in the launcher. Apparently, pressing "Customize" does not allow you to change graphics settings. Setting the preset to "None" does. Again, a small flaw. Overall the games graphics do not have to hide from the big players.\n\nConclusion: Great graphics, small flaws in the execution.\n\n\nSingleplayer vs Multiplayer\n\nI felt like this needed an extra category. While the game has a "singleplayer" campaign and unless you have friends who also play the game, the real fun comes in beating other peoples times. Of course there is no lobby system, since you only every try to beat their time or drive against their "ghost" if you will.\n\nThe single player campaign is slightly flawed in my eyes. Gold Medal now actually means "Gold Medal", even on the first track of the first part of the campaign. There is no increase in difficulty when it comes to the times you have to beat, they will always be tough. There will be an increase of the skill you need to traverse a track though, which in my eyes is just about enough for a racing game single player campaign. Of course there is no story or anything apart from the tracks, but in a game like TM2 I did not miss that.\n\nConclusion: Single player is solid and demanding. Multiplayer in the classic meaning does not exists, but you will be comparing your track time to other peoples time constantly.\n\n\nVerdict\n\nI don't see anything that TMU does not provide. TM2 might not be a bad game, but in my eyes it adds nothing the the TM "Genre" as a whole. If you like the slightly better graphics get TM2 over TMU. For anyone else I recommend buying TMU, especially since you get more bang bang bang bang bang bang bang for buck.","August 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To that respect this one is "good", but stick to the stadium version.\n\nIt focuses on the player (you) skills to ride on the race with no collision between cars. To many this can feel like a gamebreaker but it remains unexpectly fun in all of the different available game mods. I'm talking about time attack, rounds or laps here. It really feels rewarding to finish 1st, or even get close to it. If the competion is that hard, not being relagated to the queue for being the worst player can be a rewarding achievement in itself.\n\nWhile everyting about it feels simple, easy to understand, from the controls to the rules they are also hard to master. You will get better and some rides will feel amazing. I'm not a fan of racing games but this one had me addicted. I don't play all the time but I always enjoy when I race on TM² Stadium. And as some famous anonymous guy said once: "Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted".\n\nIf you are trying to decide if that's a game for you, get it already (TM² Stadium) and give it a try. The production value is well worth the price.","July 6, 2014","true","336.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.\n\nComplimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.\n\nThis review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.\n\nIn the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).","January 1","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Been a long time player of the series since SUNRISE a long time ago-- If you're looking for a very simple game, yet with a high skill cap, this is your game. It's got the arcade like style of a NFS/Ridge Racer game- but is very unforgiving when you mess up your lines.\n\nMy suggestions for servers to play?

To that respect this one is "good", but stick to the stadium version.\n\nIt focuses on the player (you) skills to ride on the race with no collision between cars. To many this can feel like a gamebreaker but it remains unexpectly fun in all of the different available game mods. I'm talking about time attack, rounds or laps here. It really feels rewarding to finish 1st, or even get close to it. If the competion is that hard, not being relagated to the queue for being the worst player can be a rewarding achievement in itself.\n\nWhile everyting about it feels simple, easy to understand, from the controls to the rules they are also hard to master. You will get better and some rides will feel amazing. I'm not a fan of racing games but this one had me addicted. I don't play all the time but I always enjoy when I race on TM² Stadium. And as some famous anonymous guy said once: "Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted".\n\nIf you are trying to decide if that's a game for you, get it already (TM² Stadium) and give it a try. The production value is well worth the price.","July 6, 2014","true","336.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played.","January 16, 2014","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boltlogan/recommended/232910/","boltlogan","Bolt Logan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boltlogan/","1014 products in account","A few pages into this new Doctorow novel, I was reminded of one of his regular narrative strategies--that is, he often begins his novels by creating confusion in the reader's mind. The narrator's voice shifts, the chronology is confusing or just random, the location of the action (or discussion) is unclear, and so on. The characteristics of narrative that give the reader a sense of where and who and what and why are scrambled. It takes a while for the attentive reader to sort them out. This happens at the beginning of Andrew's Brain, but it's not a longterm problem with the novel. As it happens, the reader soon learns that the voice of Andrew is speaking to (or in some cases writing to) his analyst, an unnamed presence who responds with questions (often left unanswered) and occasional comments about Andrew's state of mind, motives, good or bad choices. Andrew tells the analyst about the failure of his first marriage and his panicky effort to have his first (now former) wife take over the care of his infant daughter by his second wife, who is deceased. We learn all this if we read attentively through the first sections of the novel. I would add that there are no spoilers here.\n\nWith reference to spoilers, I have to say that I hesitate to tell much of anything more about the events Andrew narrates to his analyst, other than that he tells the story of how he meets and marries his second wife. Beyond that, it would be unfair to reveal the sequence of events that form the main body of the narrative of this uneven but finally very powerful novel. (I started early thinking it might be a 2 star, as I was exasperated by the triviality of much of Andrew's narrative and the too-clever devices Doctorow was using to mix the chronology and the characters to sustain uncertainty and suspense. But once the latter half of the narrative was under weigh, I was ready for a 3 star and even considered 5 star at some point near the end, but 4 seems reasonable.)\n\nAndrew, by the way, is a "cognitive scientist," and he is talking with a psychoanalyst. Early in their discussions, he comments:\n"Your field is the mind, mine is the brain. Will the two ever meet?" This question underlies much of the speculation that Andrew attempts in his professional research and in his teaching, about which we learn a bit as the novel continues. Andrew is interested in the ways the brain works, how its constitution and structure affect the thought and actions of human beings and other animals, and so forth. Further, Andrew is convinced that he is, in some way, a person who causes disasters--from the trivial, such as breaking a piece of chalk as he is trying to write his name on the chalkboard, to the fatal, as in his conviction that he was in some ways personally and causally responsible for several deaths, as well as some serious accidents. This conviction is based on his observations of his coincidental presence at, or involvement with, the fatal events. But this novel is in no sense a mystery thriller, as I have seen it incorrectly described. It is a drama of perception, precise and distorted, clarified or confused. Andrew is, as we learn early, driven to distraction, possibly to what we would call madness, by the cognitive dissonance that occurs when he realizes his well-intentioned or entirely innocent, or just casual actions result in calamity, usually for others.\n\nDoctorow unleashes some of the most dramatic and traumatizing writing of his career in this novel (yes, I have read all his other novels and some short stories), and that is what must be reserved for the reader to find out. Having said that, why not 5 stars? It would be nice to be able to rank the novel at that level, but the deficiencies of the first third, nearly first half, of the novel are real, and very disappointing. But it is a very good example of a novel that should NOT be treated according to the "rule" that many people cite, that if a novel does not "catch" one in the first paragraph (sometimes the first few pages), then it is not worth continuing. This one may be more annoying than engaging in the first few chapters, but persevere. It's not a long novel, and the rewards kick in soon enough to carry you breathlessly to the end.","January 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

There is little new content to be found - all assets seem to be re-used from the original game, except a few extra shaders have been slapped on.\n\nController support is as half-♥♥♥♥♥ as ever. Navigating menus is a pain on a controller - at some points it will favour whatever your cursor is hovering over even if you're only using a controller to play, and at times it's hard to determine what is actually selected once you navigate to a new menu. Which brings me to another point: the game's UX/UI does not have a single bit of improvement over the original game.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the alternative environments (Canyon, Valley) are separate titles which need to be paid for and launched individually. Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, guys. You're using Steam as a publisher, so why even bother making an in-game portal for switching between a bunch of games I don't even own?\n\nI only paid £2 for this so I'm not too bothered, but since I've seen all it has to offer I have no reason to recommend it to anyone.","July 19, 2014","false","2.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

My favorite and the most popular game mode, time attack, is the best implementation of multiplayer racing I've ever seen. This game is just like Trackmania United but with more players, upgraded graphics, and a nicer interface. There are thousands of maps made by players. Ladder points also put an objective to the game which lets players want to keep playing to rank up. Lots of different map types too, including tech, fullspeed, speed tech, dirt, nascar, etc. You can make this game as competitive as you want -- whether you're after that dedi 1 or just to beat your pb, it's fun for every player. In the beginning, some maps may be hard to finish. You'll be crashing into walls, trying to just finish. That can be fun, but with a bit of practice you can really have fun trying to finish first on a server or beat records. Driving mechanics are wonderful, and the loops and crazy transitions in fullspeed make it a ridiculous arcade style game with endless enjoyment. A great community of people too. Everyone is willing to help you out if you need it and, for example, if you get a good time on a map, people will say "nt" (Nice time). From shredding your time down to the best it can be in the limited time the map runs for, to trying to rank up in your region, Trackmania Stadium (and all the other Trackmania games for that matter) is a wonderful game and worth every penny.","September 28, 2013","true","319.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The single player mode provides a challenge and you will want to keep improving your times to move up the leaderboards, but the game really shines in multiplayer. Races can be tense and very exciting and final results will often be decided on just milliseconds. The tracks and other content produced by Nadeo are good enough, but the many customisation options bring so much more to the game. The level editor in particular is mostly simple to use and there are many good tracks provided by the community that add a lot of variety and will keep you interested in the game for a long time.

It's a BRILLIANT series of racing games, one that spawned a whole new type of racing (sort of, I may be wrong for all I know). Head onto a MTA:SA race server and you will be greeted with tracks that bear resemblance with the TM style.\n\nThe game itself is epic, but you will need practice to get into racing properly. I've had years of practice, both on TM games and other, so it's not that difficult for me, but I see a lot of players who fail at cornering or falling of the "walls" and loops.\n\nThis is a game that will provide hours upon hours of competitive entertainment, there's a MLG style league for it as well. The ESWC was a competition held back in '06 that allowed players to win $10k!\n\nAt the end, the game is solid. You can mod vehicles, create your own tracks, so on. This is a game that will live off it's community. If the community dies, this game wouldn't be as great, because multiplayer is the place to be.\n\nIf you like racing, Speed-Racer style tracks, HotWheels perhaps?, then you'll like this game.\n\nSee you online! :)","September 28, 2014","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a daunting, semi-functional UI, the controls are hard to set up for anything beyond a keyboard, and single-player feels anemic at best. On the other hand, the graphics shine, the infrastructure behind the seamless multiplayer experience is almost unparalleled, and the community capitalizes on that with a near infinite amount of custom tracks.\n\nStadium offers the best "tileset" for any of the TrackMania series, with generous pourings of HotWheels-style loops, corkscrews, and vertical turns. Due to this, it feels absolutely exhilarating to finally ace a full-speed (FS) track, and you'll be more than happy to continue doing it to shave off a precious few milliseconds from your time.\n\nIt's pretty much racing, distilled.","September 29, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might be a bit overpriced because Nations Forver is totally free but if you leave the game like that the game is worth every cent.\n\nYou just get what you want: A basic competitive time attack racing game, with a community building various of tracks (with the simple track editor you can use too!) and a very thrilling ranking system where you have the opportunity to show the word what you can do!","September 24, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Trackmania 2 Stadium has brought back what we all loved! From the crazy tracks, physics and the competition; this racing game is very fun and exciting.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Crazy track designs and fun physics. (More 3-dimensional than most racing games.)\n+ Ranges from highly competitive to very casual. (Pick your poison.)\n+ Custom tracks with the track editor. (Essentially a map editor, but with modular track "blocks".)\n+ International sport. (Everywhere in the world competes.)\n+ Countless tracks to race on.\n+ Simple controls brings everyone into the racing.\n+ Customizable music playlists.\n+ Car painter (Click and drag mouse spraying on 3D object, WOW!)\n\nCons:\n\n- None. Trackmania has been a favorite of mine for years, so it's only fair that I am biased.\n\nEven if you aren't a big racing game fan, give this a shot. It has a lot of excitement and thrill to offer vs. other conventional racing games. As stated, the tracks are mostly more vertical, featuring jumps, loops, suprises, stunts, boosters, etc.\n\n10/10\n","June 20, 2013","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My favorite and the most popular game mode, time attack, is the best implementation of multiplayer racing I've ever seen. This game is just like Trackmania United but with more players, upgraded graphics, and a nicer interface. There are thousands of maps made by players. Ladder points also put an objective to the game which lets players want to keep playing to rank up. Lots of different map types too, including tech, fullspeed, speed tech, dirt, nascar, etc. You can make this game as competitive as you want -- whether you're after that dedi 1 or just to beat your pb, it's fun for every player. In the beginning, some maps may be hard to finish. You'll be crashing into walls, trying to just finish. That can be fun, but with a bit of practice you can really have fun trying to finish first on a server or beat records. Driving mechanics are wonderful, and the loops and crazy transitions in fullspeed make it a ridiculous arcade style game with endless enjoyment. A great community of people too. Everyone is willing to help you out if you need it and, for example, if you get a good time on a map, people will say "nt" (Nice time). From shredding your time down to the best it can be in the limited time the map runs for, to trying to rank up in your region, Trackmania Stadium (and all the other Trackmania games for that matter) is a wonderful game and worth every penny.","September 28, 2013","true","319.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a BRILLIANT series of racing games, one that spawned a whole new type of racing (sort of, I may be wrong for all I know). Head onto a MTA:SA race server and you will be greeted with tracks that bear resemblance with the TM style.\n\nThe game itself is epic, but you will need practice to get into racing properly. I've had years of practice, both on TM games and other, so it's not that difficult for me, but I see a lot of players who fail at cornering or falling of the "walls" and loops.\n\nThis is a game that will provide hours upon hours of competitive entertainment, there's a MLG style league for it as well. The ESWC was a competition held back in '06 that allowed players to win $10k!\n\nAt the end, the game is solid. You can mod vehicles, create your own tracks, so on. This is a game that will live off it's community. If the community dies, this game wouldn't be as great, because multiplayer is the place to be.\n\nIf you like racing, Speed-Racer style tracks, HotWheels perhaps?, then you'll like this game.\n\nSee you online! :)","September 28, 2014","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the time the game was free as the developer was making money off the other Trackmania games.  Trackmania is time trials race style game,  you won't have to worry about colliding with other drivers because you will be to concentrated on just yourself.  It's a fairly simple game to pick up and start but to get the top awards you have to practice and practice to understand the flow of the tracks.\n\nTracks can include simple dirt tracks where you have less grip as contrete tracks, and can come with various loops, rolls, boosts, and free wheeling parts. (Free Wheeling is when you have no engine, just going off of momentum.  Players can design their own tracks and many do.  Most online play is custom tracks where you race off against up to 100 people on a single track.\n\nI find the game addictive to the point where I lose track of time.  I know it's not a Go-kart game but it is still pretty fun and intense.","July 17, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The handling of the car, which is the key to the fun of trackmania games, has returned to more what was like in the earlier games. The ease of control allows you precisely fine the best racing line through the track and keep cutting your time down to get the next medal. Despite this I still feel this does not measure up to earlier games. It is not as long or as varied as the early games and the difficulty means I'm never going to be able to play the final tracks. So I'd recommend getting Trackmania Nations and United first and then if you still fancy some more tracks get this game.","June 29, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something very humorous about spinning through the air at 450 MPH after missing a jump, only to land back on the track, unscathed, and continue as if nothing had happened.\n\nThis game, being the sequel to Nations, has not lost that same exciting feel I enjoyed so much.  The downside to Nations was the wait times between games (being that it was a free game), and to play the full game you had to pay around $45.  This game is much cheaper, and there are no wait times.  The multiplayer is a huge improvment from any other racing game I've ever tried.\n\nSimply put: Try the Demo, or even Nations Forever.

Trackmania is time trials race style game,  you won't have to worry about colliding with other drivers because you will be to concentrated on just yourself.  It's a fairly simple game to pick up and start but to get the top awards you have to practice and practice to understand the flow of the tracks.\n\nTracks can include simple dirt tracks where you have less grip as contrete tracks, and can come with various loops, rolls, boosts, and free wheeling parts. (Free Wheeling is when you have no engine, just going off of momentum.  Players can design their own tracks and many do.  Most online play is custom tracks where you race off against up to 100 people on a single track.\n\nI find the game addictive to the point where I lose track of time.

The single player mode provides a challenge and you will want to keep improving your times to move up the leaderboards, but the game really shines in multiplayer. Races can be tense and very exciting and final results will often be decided on just milliseconds. The tracks and other content produced by Nadeo are good enough, but the many customisation options bring so much more to the game. The level editor in particular is mostly simple to use and there are many good tracks provided by the community that add a lot of variety and will keep you interested in the game for a long time. The other TrackMania games are very good as well, but the track features and excellent car handling that form the Stadium environment make this game come highly recommended.","July 17, 2014","true","494.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

On the other hand, the graphics shine, the infrastructure behind the seamless multiplayer experience is almost unparalleled, and the community capitalizes on that with a near infinite amount of custom tracks.\n\nStadium offers the best "tileset" for any of the TrackMania series, with generous pourings of HotWheels-style loops, corkscrews, and vertical turns. Due to this, it feels absolutely exhilarating to finally ace a full-speed (FS) track, and you'll be more than happy to continue doing it to shave off a precious few milliseconds from your time.\n\nIt's pretty much racing, distilled.","September 29, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something very humorous about spinning through the air at 450 MPH after missing a jump, only to land back on the track, unscathed, and continue as if nothing had happened.\n\nThis game, being the sequel to Nations, has not lost that same exciting feel I enjoyed so much.  The downside to Nations was the wait times between games (being that it was a free game), and to play the full game you had to pay around $45.  This game is much cheaper, and there are no wait times.  The multiplayer is a huge improvment from any other racing game I've ever tried.\n\nSimply put: Try the Demo, or even Nations Forever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axxor/recommended/232910/","axxor","The Muscles From Brussels","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axxor/","91 products in account","Trackmania is known as being one of the most competitve racing games out there, and for good reason. Stadium, like any TM game, has a huge learning curve. While you can definitely hop in and have fun from the start, you won't find yourself competing at the highest level without intense determination and dedication to the game. There are lot's of little details in the game that separates the great from the good. This learning curve might drive some people away from the game, but it is incredibly rewarding when you hop into a server against some of the best drivers as you trade times back and forth, one-upping the other by only a few thousanths of a second.\n\nThere is near infinite replay value here. The game features a massive track editor where the only real limitation is your imagination. Even if you're not into creating maps yourself, there is already an incredible selection made by other players. There are different types of tracks, such as mini, tech, circuit (Nascar), dirt, and speed. Each of them requires their own special skill set to master, and each will challenge your abilities.\n\nI would highly recommend this game, but I must give you fair warning of the steep learning curve associated with a TM title. At first, you will find yourself at the back of the pack wondering how the other guys are putting up the times they are. If you stay with it and make efforts to improve though, the game is incredibly rewarding. The single player maps do not do a good job of preparing you for how competitive the multiplayer is, but they will at least give you a way to improve. The game encourages you to try again and shave another half a second off your time. Websites such as maniaexchange allow you to download user created maps that you can play offline. If you're looking to take this game seriously, I would highly recommend doing so. Practice makes perfect may be cliche, but it was never more true.\n\nThis is an excellent title, one that you will spend endless hours on, but only if you can get past the steep learning curve.","June 4, 2013","true","429.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will do tight turns, stunts and drifts. You will drive at ridiculous speeds, stack, and try again. You will make a tight, high-speed turn, followed by a jump, fly across an enourmous gulf, land, do a loop, and then crash into a finish line. Or miss, but eventually you will succeed.\n\nAnd then there is the extraordinarily powerful (AND easy to use!!) level editor, which has led to large community of excellent user created tracks and multiplayer servers.","November 25, 2013","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fast, it's unforgiving, it has one of the friendliest communities ever and it lives from its mechanics. Nadeo's decision to split up Trackmania 2 into several parts (Stadium, Canyon and Valley) is questionable, but it doesn't really have any impact on the quality itself - in case of cases, wait for Trackmania Turbo, which promises a complete package consisting of several environments once again.\n\nStill, for me, this game is one of the best I have ever played.

After making United, which was a fantastic collection with a huge amount of content across seven environments, how can they make such a significant step back? How can they return to selling piecemeal chunks of their game each with their own near-dead communities? And how can these chunks be essentially the exact same as their previous offerings?

Now that you are a badass, do it again and get a better time - feel like more of a badass!! Repeat forever.\n\nTips: Mute game music and make your own custom song mix. Don't bother with the maps that come with the game (they suck). Only play online on populated servers with good custom maps.

After about a decade of fun, fast paced obstical courses, they return with this game. Fans of Nations Forever will get a kick out of this, since this version of the game is Stadium, which is the most popular venue for TrackMania. Race in Time Trials in Single Player, take to the internet with the Online Modes, play some with your friends in Multiplayer, and also create your own skins and tracks and upload them to the Steam Workshop.\n\nIf you have crappy internet, and you are looking to get a game that can make the most of a bad connection, this game is for you, simply because all the server has to do is broadcast a ghost of your current location on track and your times, and thats it. Even if you are playing on a server that's far from the USA in places like Denmark, Germany, and France, you still hold a stable connection. Recommended for crazy car racing game fans or looking for some online fun.\n8.5/10.","November 27, 2013","true","141.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of an old Stunt Car game I played back on my cousins computer as a middle school aged kid (I'm 33 now).  The track editor is fun as well.  You can really make anything you want and race on it.  Having Workshop support is great, too.  I downloaded a few custom tracks from other users, and had a blast driving through it.\n\n10/10.  One of the best games I've purchased in a while.\n\nMy 3 year old loves watching my play this game, and it's actually a fun "play time" for both of us.  :)  It's one of the only times I get to play games while being a responsible parent.\n\nUPDATE:  I've tacked on a bunch of additional time to this game, and I'm still blown away.  It has gotten to the point where I'm sick of playing, but I can't stop.  I just realized that once you get gold on a track, it let's you play the track again to record an "official" score.  I became the top player in my state on a few tracks at a harder difficulty.  Seeing your name as #1 is quite rewarding.\n\nThe difficulty is another thing....  This game is hard!  Very difficult in the later levels, and you have to get gold on everything to unlock the most challenging courses.  Still working on that...  I gotta admit that the first levels were pretty easy.  But even as easy level becomes a challenge when you need to perfectly manuever every turn in the track to get the gold medal.\n\nAnyway, buy this game if you haven't yet.  It's worth the $10 (or whatever it is).","February 1, 2015","true","54.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of fun you can have playing with friends over LAN or competing to get the best times on the solo campaign or on multiplayer tracks is unparalleled from other racing titles. Due to the fast paced nature and flexible track creatability, there are endless possibilities of what you can come across in this game thanks to the large international community of creators.\n\n9/10\n\nPros/Cons\n\n+ Just as fun, intense and challenging as the oringinal Trackmania game.\n+ The learning curve is easy enough to grasp but leaves room for serious challenges.\n+ Beautiful visuals but not demanding on your PC - one of the best optimised PC games.\n+ The map editor, multiplayer and online community add so much extra content.\n\n- Gamers who aren't all that big on community content will get bored after the basic content.","January 1","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This can be accomplished by simply the server owner ticking a "allow download" box, and giving us a simple "download this track" option.\n\n2. Make the physics engine more forgiving of mistakes committed that happen 9 times out of 10 by complete accident. Give us options to correct our angle midair, point the nose of the car downward so as to prevent bouncing off of the side of the track. The option to turn your car in midair and to correct your positioning midair would prevent SO MUCH frustration and allow the player to make more percise jumps much more easily than if they were flung off of a ramp, with the correct angle expected to be taken before gaining altitude. Excuse me if I didn't have the split-second reaction time needed to correct my angle before flying off of a ramp. It really is not my fault when I cannot correct a mistake that was made by accident.\n\nOverall, the game needs to let us download tracks easier, so we can better learn it in our off time when we are not playing multiplayer where the time limit for learning a track is not nearly long enough 90% of the time. Some of us require hours of constant practice in order to make sure that we are familiarized with a track's layout before we can start aiming for shorter and shorter completion times. Or, even better, have a practice server option so players can judge your track, practice it, and familiarize themselves with it. Secondly, all I want is to be able to correct my angle in midair. That's it. Being able to steer your car in mid air would correct so many mistakes, and would make even the toughest track layouts just a BIT more fair and manageable.\n\nNow, given my gripes so far, there are really only two issues I have with this game, despite them in my opinion, being major flaws. Everything else about this game, from the track editor, the car editor, mod support, and the sheer intensity and adrenaline rush you get when you go full speed is absolutely stunning. All I want is easier track downloads for practice, and midair correction. LITERALLY nothing else needs to be fixed.","April 17","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You wont be disappointed!\n","May 20","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or at least somehting I'll be sinking a lot of time in to. Trackmania is an extremely fast, extremely crazy multiplayer racing game. This ♥♥♥♥ is fun, and nervewreaking and so compeditive. Highly moddable and you can design your own vehicles and download unique ones online. Such a cool game, highly recommend.","June 15, 2013","true","150.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Typical Trackmania game with good visuals, straightforward gameplay and comfortably simplistic controls. It's also cheaper than the other two TM2 games. But keep in mind that you can get the Stadium environment completely for free with TrackMania Nations Forever (except for having to sign up for some mumbo jumbo, which you will unfortunately have to do with TM2:S anyway). This game DOES has a few new features that aren't in TMNF (such as local splitscreen and a whole lot of new track bits in the track builder), but I will leave it up to you to determine if the $9.99 price tag is worth it.","August 21, 2015","true","45.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beating someones time by fractions of a second can be so satisfying. My only complaint is that Canyon and Valley games dont have as many players online but that is probably because Stadium is superior. To me anyway.","May 21","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like paying attention to small details to get the best time of everyone, this is the game for you. No annoying people who push you away, screwing up your time. The community is also great and no "bullying" online.","May 29","true","353.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
