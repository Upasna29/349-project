Windowing to be able to use the mouse is one, while occasional crashes, especially after you took 20 minutes making a character, can be quite annoying.\n\nThe game does hold promise as an idea; I really do love the character creator and the depth you can go with it, though I'm sure it ends up in cookie cutter designs eventually, there would be quite a few winning combinations to be sure. The maze layout randomness is nice, and so is the choice of 1-4 characters and permadeath if you're into that. But I seem to spend more time making characters than playing the Labyrinth, but this might be a personal thing.\n\nI'd say buy at your own risk, it might be right up your alley, or it may fall flat. I'd like to see the game tinkered with some more, personally. But there's a huge amount of promise.","November 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

It has permadeath if you want it, but you can also start a non-permadeath game and save any time. I wish all roguelikes had this option. I'd buy a lot more of them.\n\nThe UI is rather awkward, and the graphics very simple, but it has a ton of skills and even has multiplayer, which can be used to create a party to play by yourself.\n\nMy only real complaint is that hunger and thirst are a little too intrusive.  It feels like every minute or two I need to eat or drink. And on my current game (level 6) I'm completely out of food and "very hungry". This could be a virtual permadeath situation if I can't find food soon.\n\nIt's easily worth the five bucks.\n","November 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","6"

Try it - it is only $5 and well worth the price if you like this type of game.","December 2, 2015","true","50.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Play it on full-screen and you are good-to-go. If you have set it on stretched window use the hotkeys to navigate to the video settings (press alt to see hotkeys in the menu)\n\nYou can also change the settings in the settings.txt in the game folder.

Want to be hand to hand combat only warrior? Sword and shield, or two handed axe? Take your pick. How about a crack shot bow wielder? A sneaky back stabbing assassin? Or a Fire Mage?  Water? Air, Earth, Death, Blood, Acrane, White, Druid, Death, Witch, Warlock, Paladin, Summoner….\nThe variations are vast, and give the game a lot of replay value. And it only cost me £3 :)\n\nThe game play itself does appear to be very basic at first [just walking through narrow corridors until you meet a creature, with no AI to speak of. But the game does open up with new features introduced after the first few levels. And there is surprising depth here.\n\nAnd MULTIPLAYER! Yes, I have not tried this, but I can imagine it being great fun with a friend or two.\n\nI did not notice any bugs or experience any issues with the game at all. Perhaps those have been ironed out by now.\n\nAdmittedly, the graphics and interface are very basic [but functional]. I would love to be able to install some better tile sets, I think the game would really benefit from that. You can install some custom dungeons too. The game has a lot of potential if modders decide to add things.\n\nAll in all, well worth the price.\n","December 3, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It gives the appearence of a game from the early 90s. There's low res pictures with visible jpg artifacts in them and the music is repetitive as heck.\n\nHaving said that the game itself seems like it could be a good one: there's certainly a lot of scope for customizing your character at the start and there's a lot of spells in the game.\n\nIf you wonder why you can only see the square you're in when you start, I think it's dark: you need to cast a spell of light of some kind (there's more than one).\n\nWill write more after having played more.","December 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And make me uncomfortable besides.\n\nThe thing that drew me to this game was the screencap of the equipment/inventory screen. I love stuff like that.
