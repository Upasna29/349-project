The ESC button doesn't even open the options, everything in-game is gem based like it would be in a free to play mobile platform game where you would have to buy more gems to buy cool things and I'm not too thrilled with it +the resolution isn't that great. There is even a clear spelling issue in the gem shop in the game, this would be fine if this was an early access game but this isn't and they're expecting you to spend $2-$3 on this.\n\nThis is the perfect free to play game for your smartphone.\nI recommend you pick this game up for $0.25 (that's 25 cents) or less.\n\nHow did they come up with the pricing for STEAM?\nI'm guessing they got around and threw numbers in a hat and then randomly chose $2.99 for their free to play game.\n\nI would have not recommended this sooner but apparently I don't have enough time in this free to play mobile port.\n"You need to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review for it (1 minutes on record)."\n\nUpdateI did decide to go back and play and my review is still the same, the gameplay is pretty bad for a tower defense game, very simplistic, very few game modifiers besides normal and hard setting / there is a survival mode but again very simplistic, towers are very basic, you have two different speed settings: slow and normal speed, not a lot of content to play through, becomes a boring grind for no real advantage=no STEAM achievements, the upgrade system is about as basic as it gets and doesn't provide enough advancements for towers. This game is very simplistic, cannot stress that enough and wouldn't recommend going out of your way to buy it. Pick it up in a bundle or for very cheap/free. Very basic game in-general and I think the initial trailer for the game illustrates that.\n\nThere is nothing exciting nor unique about this tower defense game.\n\nWould not recommend.","November 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thalatte/recommended/416310/","thalatte","Thalatte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thalatte/","271 products in account","Game Information\nGoblin Defenders: Steel 'n' Wood, is a tower defense strategy game, developed and published by Alawar Entertainment.\n\nFirst glance it looked like it was developed for mobile devices. My guess it was originally made for mobile devices before it was ported.\n\nThere's a second game for this series but unfortunately it's for mobile devices only.\n\nGame Visuals\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is well done even it's simplistic.\n\nThere a couple of complaints about the user interface takes up plenty of space at the lower portion of the screen. The user interface vanishes when a defense tower is dragged onto the field. It reappears when the defense tower has been place.\n\nThere's a option available, dragging and zooming, to view the entire field. This feature is very handy and makes planning a bit easier.\n\nGame Audio\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive.\n\nGameplay\nThere are only two game difficulty modes to choose from which is Normal and Hard.\n\nThere are two game modes to choose from and they're Campaign and Survival. The campagin game mode features five different areas with two levels each. The survival game mode is where the player is being bombarded with waves after waves of enemies.\n\nThe defense towers can be upgraded to its' highest level but it does requires a bit of coins. The highest upgrade level must be purchased from the shop using gems. These upgrades doesn't come cheap after all.\n\nThere are various game achievements but they're only in game. Each of these  achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nMy final thoughts, this tower defense game, fairly easy for those who haven't played these types of game before. But for those who had played tower defense games before won't find it challenging enough. I would recommend this game but not at the full price value.","February 14","true","8.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It´s just the standard TD with few upgrades, few towers, few enemies and few mission. It´s mechanics work fine altough it might feel a bit clunky due to it´s controls.\nIt´s an average game.\n\nThen why am i recommending it?\nI really enjoyed myself in this game. The unlocks are quick to get (which makes this one of the few TD titles on Steam that are no mindless grindfest), it uses what i has (which isn´t that much) very well and it get´s really difficult in the end which most TDs here on Steam fail to do.\nSure it is utterly simplistic but you actually have to use your towers wisely as the enemytypes counter them perfectly. That fact alone let´s it surpass easily 80% of the TDs on Steam.\n\nIt might be an average game but it´s over really quickly which i saw as kind of a positive. I didn´t get bored by it, so if you´ve already played the good TDs here on Steam, you might want to give thisone a try...","November 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

At some point difficulty spikes to hell. A map can take up to 40 minutes and when I lose on 35th wave out of 40 waves, I just don't want to repeat that. Interface icons are too big and overlap with your turrets, so in certain cases they can't be upgraded. The view of the map is a bit too small. You can make a maze with your turrets, but flying enemies will fly over them and can spoil your plan on early waves = repeating a map. Directions for enemies are not clear enough at start = repeating a map. There are too many colours - everythings seems to sting your eyes and it can be hard to focus. There is a nice variety of enemies. Turrets are nice and have levels of upgrades (damage, reach, reload time). There is campaing and survival mode. I guess it's a decent game overall, but it's not my thing overall and one level put me off so much that I won't bother myself with this game anymore. I would give it thumbs sideways, but since it didn't entertain me enough I will give it thumbs down (you should fix it Valve). Not bad, but not good enough to recommend.

I'm ok with mobile ports. I'm not ok with mobile ports that frequently crash and have a few really silly typos like "amd" instead of "and".\n\n\nThe game itself is the most lackluster of tower defense. Better alternatives can be found for free on almost any flash game site out there. Even at under £1 it doesn't feel worth it.","November 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It is often zoomed in and zooming out to see what you are doing can be a bit of a pain.   It is also easy to click on UI elements when you do not intend to.   I almost clicked NO that I didn't recommend it due to how angry the UI and controls would make me.   It isn't a bad game as long as you go in knowing what you are getting into.   I highly recommend the author fix this to run at higher resolutions so the entire play field can be on the screen without scrolling around and clicking on UI elements unintentionally.   On steam and PC you are not limited to tablet and phone resolutions... take advantage of that and this game will be better.","December 20, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
