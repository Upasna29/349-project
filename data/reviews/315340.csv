It brings a new powerful character, visual and musical upgrades and additions, and also a good time in classic sidescrolling sci-fi shooting.

Thats a positive... you now have to find unlocks to unlock your upgrades, thats a second plus... You get a new character thats like a heavy class/tank compared to the original character, and he plays... kinda meh. His special is a shield that uses up energy vs health...\n\nOther changes is that you have infinite bombs/electrical blasts and they are on a CD. Repair kits are also on cooldown and have a 100 resource cost. All can be upgraded.\n\nGraphics: Uh, I don't like what they did with the supporting cast, the characters and bosses look just as great, but what did they do to the women... its like they changed how they wanted them to look and they look awful. The gameplay is still as crisp and looks similar if not better than the original.\n\nControls: Yup, did you hate Ares, you'll hate this... love it... you'll love this... its not changed, and its still as wonky as when I played it the first time, jumping off the ends of ledges... good luck and do it early.\n\nSo that I've writen this game, if you haven't played the original, you may like what you see, if you have... I'd avoid this for awhile, its in a kinda crashy state in which you have to launch the game again nearly every level I think the changes they put forth are positive for the game, but the new levels aren't really impressive, and the new character while plays slightly different, continues to be similar to what you've done before.\n\nVerdict: Pass, and if you want to get a version get the original for now... I might review once they patch all the crashy bugs... but I cannot honestly reccommend as of 10/4/14","October 4, 2014","false","2.7"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","36","51","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/315340/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1580 products in account",""It's kind of like a Mega Man crossed with a run-and-gun game. Not that long and not that hard even on the hardest difficulty unless you're trying for optional things like high ranks, but if it's cheap and the short blurb sounds interesting to you, you'll likely find this an enjoyable game."\n\nThat's what I said about the original A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda. That pretty much holds true for EX, but it seemed somewhat more difficult (or I was just being bad at it) and has been reworked to be a good bit longer, with two extra levels, more cutscenes, and a second character with different abilities who you can choose to play through the game with instead. So, basically it fixed all of my complaints.\n\nGiven that they're the same original asking price, I would obviously recommend picking this one up instead if you don't have either. About all this game is missing is the goofy skins and the Berserker weapon, and skins are just cosmetics and the Berserker weapon was kind of overpowered anyway! If you do have the original, I think it's still worth it given the discount...!","October 5, 2014","true","7.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Extinction Agenda. It's basically the same game, but with extra chapters and some minor tweaks.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, it's a platformer action game, in which you control a robot exploring a space station that has suffered a mysterious accident. There's plenty of enemies to fight in the form of robots working on the station that went rogue due to an unknown contaminant.\n\nThe story remains pretty much the same, although now there's the possibility to play as either Ares or Tarus. Ares retains the story of the first game, with some additions; as for Tarus, he has his own story, although you'll find yourself playing the same levels as with Ares, including several of the cutscenes.\n\nAs far as gameplay changes, the scrap you used to collect in the previous game has been unified under a single type, but the crafting menu is still there. Upgrades to your weapons and abilities need to be found before you can unlock them. Each character has his own weapons and abilities.\n\nMy opinion: if you liked the original, you're going to enjoy this one as well.

Try to spend less than $5 if at all possible.\n\nThis is a game that's clearly had a ton of work put into it, but suffers badly at the hand of poor design decisions. Most significantly, the controls are really really bad, owing mainly to the mouse-aim/keyboard move idea paired with complex key-combinations for executing some techniques that the game chooses to make necessary in so many different places. Having bad controls and then choosing to make the game primarily centered around performing ridiculous mid-air maneuvers every 2 seconds is not really conducive to a good gameplay experience. It just feels cheap and unrewarding. Adding the control pad support should have fixed this, but unfortunately it didn't. You have to use both thumbs to move and shoot, but a lot of the primary functions, like jumping, are on the thumb buttons, so you have to stop shooting to jump or use a special. Additionally, instead of letting the dash direction be controlled by the movement stick, they split it between the L/R bumpers, which is completely unintuitive and, again, just plain bad. It really is a deal-breaker.\n\nThe upgrade system seems like a decent idea until you realize that you not only have to find the upgrade item in the game, but you also have to spend currency on it. The currency is pretty ubiquitous, to the point that it sometimes literally rains from the sky (wtf), but you also spend it to activate your special moves, which is kind of stupid.\n\nThe graphics are very high-quality. They're at or above the level of AAA games of this kind. There is some noisiness, though, that gets in the way of gameplay, such as foreground girders concealing the fact that the ceiling is suddenly lower, and you find out by trying to jump over an enemy attack only to find that you have no clearance.\n\nThe audio is also excellent, with an appropriate high-quality soundtrack accompanied by decent SFX.\n\nIn short, it's a game that's worth playing, but it's not worth spending $10 on. Not even by a long shot.\n\nIf you can get it on sale then $5 is a maximum price. It's not a complete waste, but considering that one man can make a Cave Story in his spare time and release it for free, platformer designers should AT LEAST get together the gumption to make a game that can be controlled smoothly. To make the obvious comparison to MegaMan, the presentation is better than anything the MegaMan series has to offer, but the gameplay is worse than anything the MegaMan series has to offer.","October 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Extinction Agenda EX is a 2.5D side scrolling game that feels like a fun mix between a dual stick shooter and Metroid. So far I am really enjoying this game. So far playing it on medium it has had its share of difficulty combined with enjoyable boss battles.\nHere is a video of early game play.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYImDmnkVjo&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe game really is in the vein of metroid in the whole being in a mechanical suit looking for upgrades thing. Also where the upgrades will unlock new areas that were previously unexplorable. Oddly enough I have recieved a few upgrades and have yet to seen an effect on my person.\n\nThis is not just a run and gun type game either. There are several parts that include tough timing jumps and multiple button pushes. If not you will fall to your death often like myself. I don't know if I like the dieing over and over when the main part of the game is a 2.5D gunner. So far I recommend this game but in a way it is still up in there air and will report back as I get in deeper to the game.\n\nPros\nThe controls feel responsive and right.\nThe artwork is great.\nI don’t have to play with the music turned off.\nThe story so far is actually engaging.\nCharacter ability upgrades keep things fresh.\nCheckpoints are nice kinda forgot about them with all the roguelikes out.\n\nCons\nThings you kill come back once they are off screen kinda annoying.\nThough as nails when it come to timing jumps and not always in a good way.\nTons of upgrades but some seem to do nothing.\nHope I dont have to do a second playthough just to collect the power ups but seems that way.\n\nQuick edit here. There is a talent tree in game where you can upgrade all your moves and weapons armor ect. This is not covered in the tutorial and I found out about it by accedent. This added a lot of depth to the game. This is a great deal at $10 buck and I recommened it highly. You will get more than 10 hours of game play out of it for sure.\n\n\nFor a full indepth review please check out my podcast where I try out cheap games and let you know if they are worth your money or not.","October 3, 2014","true","9.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

I like the presentation of this game that is futuristic sci-fi as well as heavy-rock style bg music in the good mix to make me enjoyed this game a lot.

In addition, the new character "Tarus", adding another style of gameplay that worth trying a rerun through the game. But I haven't complete the game yet, so I can't tell what's more about improvement so well.\n\nWhat's not perfect for me is, I really want see speed of gameplay to be faster but the team did not tweak this in this version.

Second, you now have to find upgrade chips before you are able to build the upgrade. This effectively stops players from getting really overpoowered too early on.

He's more tanky than ARES, and all of his weapons are shorter ranged, but with more area of effect and a slightly different story line.

I haven't completed it yet but i'll give it an update on how the game truely is.\n\nMy problem with this game so far is how fast Ares drops. let me explain it like this, if you do a normal jump, he falls too quickly and in some situations, you'll be asking yourself "why does he fall so quickly"? Not only that but you might get stuck in certain sections of any level.\n\nOverall, this game is great. If you like 2.5D action game like megaman, then you'll like this one.","December 25, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While you'll need to press a separate button, it's certainly more easier to pull off than "bomb jump" used to be.\n\nIt's however worth noting that the bosses have been reworked too, so they will certainly caught veteran-players off-guard during the several initial trial&error-sessions.\n\n\nMostly the same, some improvements, and little bit something new.\nI personally enjoy this update more than I did enjoy the original-version.","October 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I love the difficulty of hardcore mode considering I play EVERY game on the hardest difficulty.  But on that difficulty starting out it reminds me heavily of how the original MegaMan games used to be and I love that.  And going by my avatar you can tell I'm a big fan of the Megaman Series and this game feeds that need i was craving for this type of game.  I wish there was more to this game than 7 levels, but I'm comfortable with how this is,  I recommend this for any one who's a fan  of the MM series and platformers/shooters.","October 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Extincton Agenda EX is a somewhat challenging side-scrolling shooter. The gameplay is great and every weapon and ability you get feels varied and useful. The visuals and music also add to this experience.\n\nThere are two different playable characters, and while their abilities, weapons, and stories differ, the levels are exactly the same. Some sections of the levels are easier for Ares, and more challenging with Tarus, and vice versa. This is especially true with chapter 3, which felt like a massive difficulty spike when playing with Ares, but was more like a natural difficulty progression for Tarus.\n\nI played a small amount of the first A.R.E.S. game (maybe the first 3 chapters) so I cannot tell you if A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX is a vast improvement. The one thing that I did like was the simplification of the materials system. In the first A.R.E.S., there were three separate materials that would be dropped by enemies, which in turn could be used to craft upgrades to weapons as well as consumables like health packs and grenades. This was overhauled to feature just one material which was used to craft weapon and ability upgrades and also to use the new health ability.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to fans of the side-scrolling genre. It is a quick experience, but one worth having if you have $10 to spare.","October 10, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This game, although released in 2011, has learned nothing to the road of 2014 games, where respawning and checkpoints are at least upgraded as opposed to the old days.\n\nNo, this game instead tries to make you enjoy a terrifying experience by letting you die and die and die and you hardly are capable of learning anything new before having to do back route X to get to boss fight again. You end up wasting lots of time for nothing at all, nothing fun, nothing rewarding whatsoever.\n\nThe game's graphics are really top-quality in the genre, and the music is ok although becomes repetitive, just like the gameplay.\n\nI unfortunatly have to thumb down this game, if not just for the fact that's it's a remake and it yet has one of the most frustrating gameplay flaws that none of the developers on the team have learned from the past. Just like we won't learn that war is a terrible thing, some gaming developers will never learn that checkpoints before an important something should, yes indeed, be played RIGHT BEFORE something important, not in front of a lift that wastes everytime 15 seconds if not more, seeing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again.\n\nI would say, if you are really fond of the genre, then buy it, but you'll have to endure a lot of trial-and-error that is simply outdated and not satisfying. If you don't have the remake but the older one, stick with it.","October 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","0"

Read reviews and everything on this game before I bought it this morning. Now every single time I've went to open and play it the damned thing crashes and quits responding. What in the world Steam? I get to the character select screen and it does this. I am really starting to question the actual integrity of Steam, a lot of the games, and the user reviews lately. So far, I don't recomend this game. If it starts to play, instead of freezing up, maybe I'll give it a recomendation but until then I am not going to recomend it and I'm not going to NOT recomend it. Just that so far it crashes directly after the character selection screen. (Changes my thumbs down just now to a thumbs up thanks to the seemingly overnight fix of this game.
