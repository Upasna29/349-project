There's no one set strategy to playing, which makes online play fun and engaging.

Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.\n\nI can't, in good concious, reccomend this game until a massive patch is pushed through.

(Not to mention the bonus of the game + DLC being cheaper than their physical counterparts, and is significantly easier to play with people on the other side of the world!) So, for people who have played the board game before, I think this should be a no-brainer.\n\nHowever, I wrote this review for those who aren't aware of the greatness that is Ticket to Ride and are seeing this from a bystander's point of view. You might be thinking that this is just some boring train game played only by weird people who smell funny, as a diversion from their regular riveting pastime of watching grass grow. However, I can assure you that this is most certainly the opposite of the truth.\n\nTicket to Ride is, in actual fact, quite a tense game that can quite easily take you from absolute confidence in your position to having all your hopes and dreams shattered, as you realise that you didn't take that vital Los Angeles > Las Vegas track yet due to over-confidence, that you had multiple 20+ point routes hinging on! Not to mention the level of back-stabbing and collaboration that can come into play (especially with the Steam overlay making this oh so easy), that can easily create bitter feuds between two rival rail barons, which can last across a series of games.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, classic example of a game that's easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's always a good game to play with friends, strangers or alone with bots, especially as each game tends to only go for 45 minutes at most. (Although you can quite easily find that time has flown, as you wind up having rematch after rematch, without noticing the time passing by!)","April 4, 2014","true","140.5"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

Unlike most other modern board games that are being ported to tablets and Steam, Ticket to Ride (video game) was developed in-house by the same company that publishes the board game, Age of Wonder.\n\nAge of Wonder is a well-respected game company; their board games are polished and attractive, with lots of "fiddly bits", as board gamers call the detailed pieces of the game. Their attention to detail that is displayed in their board games carries over to the video game versions, as well. The sound, the controls, the in-game tutorials... everything about this game sets you up for success.\n\nTicket to Ride is very much a game that is well-suited for a video-game version. There are many things to keep track of - cards and pieces on the board - and it plays much faster with a computer doing all the arranging. A game that takes about 45 minutes to play around a table takes about 10 minutes to play in this online version, and is equally satisfying. The video game version also lends itself better to expansions and DLC versions (alternate rules, really). Expansions that cost $25 for the board game because of production and distribution are just a few bucks here. The video game is a great way to try out the expansions before you buy the board game equivalent.\n\nMy one  complaint is that it is a bit complicated setting up an (optional) online account with their servers to track your online matches, but if you do, you can track your gameplay on Steam, iOS, Android, wherever. This is a very nice feature, if you are an active player.\n\nI recommend Ticket to Ride if you have and enjoy the board game, or if you enjoy board games in general. Not recommended if this isn't your thing ... if you aren't a board gamer, you probably won't like this much.\n","October 25, 2013","true","1.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

It's an incredibly well-balanced game, with fantastic elements of risk and reward that encourage you to change up how you play.\n\nAs for the DLC, I'd reccomend Legendary Asia and 1910 at most.

It used to be awesome. I played it for many hundreds of hours on ipad before getting it here. I played this game once here before the updates, and it was great other than not being able to use my ipad account to play here. It's understandable though, so not a huge deal. Just really didn't like having to start over in karma.\n\nI can't even get into a game to play anymore because nobody wants to play with low karma players. I know how to play, I just don't look like it before I even start to play. This is only an issue NOW because before it didn't matter what your karma was, they couldn't kick you out for it. I get why people would want that feature added, so it's great for those who don't have to start from the beginning.\n\nI tried starting my own game. The new game making system was just tacked in there, and there are loads of new options which aren't very clearly explained. The UI is horribly messy. On the old system, you could make a game for 5 people and start it before you get that many people with the push of a button if you changed your mind or didn't want to wait for that many people. You can't do that anymore. You just have to wait for the board to fill up with the specific amount, or go back and change the settings and then wait for people to show up again as doing that removes the game you had already created.\n\nI never got the chance to experience what the online game itself was like after the update though as the game forever said it was waiting for new players. There was no button to start the game. I was just left waiting for something to happen. 10 minutes waiting for something to happen when you have your game seats filled is rediculous. I couldn't even tell them what was going on as the chat wasn't working. It's very broken. I don't know if this is just the mac version of the game that experiences these play glitches, but it wasn't very enjoyable.\n\nSo, here's to hoping they fix this once brilliant game.

It's digital version of fun, strategic board game that lets you build your railways between the cities on the map. The goal of the game is to build as many railroads and 'clear' as many tickets as possible by combining train cards of different colors. It is one of those easy to learn, hard to master games which eventually turns out to be the main cause of complete mental breakdowns of its players while they scrape their last cards trying to clean their goals. It's a great board game and the rules are well balanced between luck and strategy, meaning you might be getting a great hands and still get completely destroyed by other players and their tactics.\n\nDigital version of the game is pretty much polished. Lately, I've been encountering this 'authenticating' pop-up which ends with 'server error' message, but you can cancel it and go on playing. TTR offers solo, online, local and 'pass'n'play' options for up to five players, so no matter if you're able to sit down through the game or can spend only a few minutes each day - there's a mod for you.\n\nAdditional maps (boards) and rulesets are available as DLCs and currently you can get complete DLC pack for less than five bucks which is super cheap.\n\nWhere I live, base version of Ticket to Ride board game costs around 35 €. Expansions are either equally bloody expensive or unavailable. If you want to avoid mess and/or don't want to support greedy local stores, be sure to get digital version of Ticket to Ride and enjoy this fine, cross-platform mind boggling lunacy.\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","November 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","4"

The rules are simple enough that anyone can understand them in a few turns: draw colored train cards to save up enough of them to claim routes between cities on the board and make longer connections using multiple routes between destinations to score more points. Turns happen quickly and competition for routes is fierce, making for an exciting experience.\n\nWhile the best way to enjoy the game is to pick up a non-digital copy and invite some friends over to play, sometimes a quick game is preferable (or the thought of spending $50 on a board game sounds a bit risky). That's where the digital version comes into play.\n\nFor this game to not earn a recommendation, Days of Wonder would have had to totally drop the ball. While this isn't a perfect adaptation, the PC port available on Steam is a pretty good one. The game menus are ideal for newcomers, but a little less direct for veteran players. The graphics and sound are appealing, the interface inside the game is intuitive, and online play is a breeze (well, except for the occasional player who takes way too long to take a turn - and sorry if that ends up being me). While I did run into a bug that prevented me from making a valid move once, that is out of dozens of games. Several of the expansions and maps are also available for purchase at a lesser price than the physical versions, making it an ideal way of trying out new ways of playing Ticket to Ride before investing in them.\n\nThe only legitimate knock on this version is the lack of local multiplayer. While the PC might not be the most popular platform for this feature, it is a bit puzzling given that it exists on other platforms, such as the Xbox 360 and iPad.\n\nOverall, Ticket to Ride is a great board game and this is an above-average implementation of it recommended for fans of the game and anyone curious about board games in general.","November 30, 2013","true","10.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Ticket to Ride wants you to stay... forever.\n\nOkay, a little overdramatic.  But I've had this game since the original version, and while the original version had its issues, the new one is just awful.\n\nFirst, I do like the timer idea.  It keeps one person from holding up the game.  It's great... when it works.\n\nWhen it doesn't work, one player accidentally gets disconnected from the game, does not get replaced with a bot, and then forces the entire board to wait as their would-be time slowly ticks down.  Want to leave?  Sure... provided you don't want to reflect negatively on your karma score.  If you want to keep your karma (or, heaven forbid, keep playing), you have to stay there until the bot comes in.  Woe if this happens at the beginning of a game and the timer is set to fifteen minutes.  Hope you have other things you can do.\n\nI have also had the timer count down when it wasn't my turn.  I have twice had one player accidentally get disconnected from the game, causing a massive chain where everyone got kicked out.  Just when I'd gotten some decent tickets, too, dammit.\n\nGraphically, the game will continue to highlight the cities of tickets I didn't keep.  After I complete a route, the board remains darkened.  The time continues to count down while it shows me what routes I finished.  Little stuff that, while not game breaking, is very irritating and shouldn't be happening for a game that's been around this long.\n\nThere is no report bug option in the settings for individual games, nor one I can find to report players while in a game.  Report after the game?  The forum button for Days of Wonder doesn't work.\n\nOh, and the kicker?  Neither does the exit game button.  You are here... forever.  And if you do manage to leave, it sends you a message that you have a turn waiting.  Even if you have clearly finished all of your games.\n\nIf these issues are fixed, I would happily and heartily recommend this game... it's a one of my all-time favorites.

You can multi with friends, strangers or bots (or a mix) and the play time is pretty quick (20 mins or so per game on average).  Picking it up dirt cheap was a bonus but after playing this game I'd have happily paid full price for the base game although I will wait until the dlc's are on discount before I get those.

As a player, you have to build railways between different cities, according to the route tickets that you drew at the start of the game. It's a great game that, at its core, has a lot of replay value thanks to all the different routes you can play and the different maps and other game mechanics it offers. As a bonus, the art is great too, giving you that awesome industrial/steampunkish vibe that goes so well with... well, with the whole train theme.\n\nPros+ It takes less time to set up than the board game and plays pretty fast\n+ You can play solo, with Steam friends, or even just with online strangers\n+ You still get to enjoy the art\n+ It's a fun, strategic game\n+ It's a lot cheaper than the actual board game\n\nCons- Absolutely horrendous AI. I won a game where the AI had a score of -1...\n- It's a buggy and unstable game, especially in multiplayer\n- The UI is messy and it's difficult to find what you need\n- The DLCs are kind of expensive, especially compared to the main game\n- No inclusion of my personal favourite DLC for Europe, 1912\n- The background music and the ambient noises are terrible and tend to ignore the fact that you put them on low volume\n\nI really wanted to recommend this, mainly because I love the actual board game so much. However, this is a buggy and unstable game; even as someone who loves playing solo, the AI is just not smart or strong enough to offer me an actual, somewhat intelligent challenge (instead of juist randomly building railways wherever it can). I only play it for brief periods of time when I'm a little bored or looking to pass the time with something really simple.\n\nSo nope. You're probably better off playing an older Ticket to Ride version, or just setting up the actual board game.","January 26","false","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The best thing about this game is that their is no perfect strategy to win and most of the time it all comes down to the tickets you start with or hope you end up getting.  Much easier to play with other people on PC than it is to pay 50 bucks for one map and have people come over.  The setup is done for you and everyone can play at the convenience of their computer and it isn't too bad finding opponents to play with.  It has a rating system so that is kind of neat to see how you stack against other players.  I think the additional maps are worth the investment since they all play differently, better than paying over 200 bucks for the physical board games.  Not too many fancy features and sometimes the online play can be glitchy but it's a fun game to play with friends when you want to play something but also be able to relax at the same time.

Therefore, Ticket to Ride seemed like a good idea (and it was). I will say that interface-wise, what you see is what you get: it is a true-as-can-be replication of the board game with a little bit of sound. After some initial futzing around, the game client is relatively easy to operate. Joining games can be a little odd, and because the game was designed for mobile devices, clicking can be a bit off at times (CTRL acts as a drag or double click or something). Given these minor bugs, being able to play a board game with friends faraway is a win in my book, even if the controls lag out once in a while. At the end of the day, the game is solid and does what it should. Plus, it has a wistful harmonica melody that will haunt your dreams while adding atmosphere to your game about railroads!\n\nPROS: stays true to it's physical counterpart, online play, no sorting of little plastic trains!\nCONS: wonky controls, more misclicks than I would like","August 11, 2014","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially its a bit like a fast version of Monopoly, with trains, except that instead of building hotels and collecting rents you're using train carriages to claim routes between cities. You start out with a choice of cards depicting routes to aim for. On each turn you can draw two coloured carriages, one loco (which you may use in place of a carriage of any colour), or another route to complete. You cannot discard any route cards - if you don't manage to claim them all, unfinished ones count against you. To claim a route between two cities all the carriages you place must be the same colour as each other, and often need to match a particular colour (or one of two alternatives) shown on the route itself.\n\nThere can be many ways to complete a long-distance route - but other players may be looking to claim segments you require. You can really spoil someone's day by blocking them at an opportune moment.\n\nSingle player mode vs the game's AI is not great (though it does allow you to learn the game at your own pace), but playing online against one or more human competitors can get quite tense and challenging. The game is simple to learn, quick to play, but is well constructed and has an interesting balance of conflicting strategies. Its absorbing entertainment and good value considering that the boxed game costs £40.\n\nThe DLC isn't essential. The base USA game is the most balanced of the boards available, but the alternatives do provide some variety - if you can find other people to play against, which isn't always easy on the non-US boards. If there's a bundled offer to pick up all the DLC's for cheap I'd recommend you go for it, otherwise check out just the main game first.","November 25, 2013","true","193.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's only three types of moves you can make (alright, a couple others in additional maps, but the point is pretty much the same) and yet it's endlessly fun to play. It's a brilliant adaptation of the board game that, for once, does the original justice.\n\nMultiplayer adds great depth and infinite replayability. While the lobby and game set up could use some polishing, it doesn't /need/ it. They work! Plus, you can use the pass-and-play to practice against yourself from as many players as you add to the game. You can play bots. Still so much replayability, just as always the AI will never live up to the fun of playing other people, most likely. I found something oddly dulling about it, even before I tried multiplayer, and I'm usually not a multiplayer person.\n\nThis is one board game you do not want to pass up, and this rendition of it is just as worthwhile, plus cheaper and easier to get a game going!\n\n","April 7, 2014","true","28.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had fun playing against AI and against humans, and there's tons of replay value. This game will definitely be worth it for board game enthusiasts at full price.

It is a casual turn-based strategy game, based upon the board game with the same name, and it is one of the best adaptations thus far.\n\nGame play: is just about identical to the board game. You have two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo  such as black or pink, and destination cards which feature two city destinations, like Los Angeles and New York. Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them.\n\nEach of the players are also dealt six train cards and with that, the game begins. Each player takes turns in either drawing two face down cards from the top of the deck, two trains from the lineup (Not including rainbow carts as they account for your two), or place trains on the map and claim routes to your complete your destination cards and gain points. You also lose points for each route you don't complete, same per the board game.\n\n2 to 5 players can face off, either as a single player game vs. the AI or online against human opponents. AI bots can also be added to online games to bolster the number of players.\n\nGraphics: reflects the charming old feel of the board game quite true to form and really brings out the atmosphere of it as a whole. The maps in which you can play on are always really well defined, easy to read, see were you were at and where you were going. I do however feel that your trains and your opponents trains on the map could have been slightly better defined to make them stand out more.\n\nAudio: also holds well to the atmosphere and feel of the game, but after a while the same piano music track grates on your nerves and you tend to find yourself diving into the settings to shut it up and put some of your own music on.\n\nThis is where I delve into the biggest gripes I have with Ticket to Ride...\n\nGripes and Cons: The layout of the menus are appalling. It honestly feels like they have taken a horrible old 90's layout and stuffed it in here. You have annoying and un-skippable voice acting as you go into every single menu and every cardboard cut-out of a character in the menus have something to say, which is the same infuriating audio each time you even so much put your cursor near them. This drove me insane.\n\nAlso, playing online with friends is made to be so obtuse, unclear and can be quite difficult to actually set up a game, because rather than being integrated with the steam interface, is goes through a backwards setup of making a profile on the Days of Wonder page to make your name easier to find, add the other person who has gone through the same process and try to let it ''find friends'' or if by some chance you can locate them yourself, adding them is just as tedious. This may just be me nitpicking, but it was something that bothered me intensely.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Regardless of it's flaws, it is by far the best adaptation of the board game. Whether you have played it physically or not, it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a bit of strategy and board game adaptations.","July 24, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

A recent update saw me click on it to see what it was about. That was two days ago. I am really enjoying this game. It doesn't tale long to pick up the game play although I've got to admit I was still a bit lost after the tutorial game. The game is quite challenging against multiple computer players. I've only tried the solo game as I've yet to play online, I will give this a go once I feel a bit more competent. I've player the Asia, Europe and American maps. I keep coming back to the American map for the qucik games as I found the Asian map confusing with lines disappearing and then being replaced. The Europe map is quite good and more difficult than the American maps with the need for tunnels and ferries.\n\nThe current update has a few issues on the Linux version . Detailed below which I hope get fixed soon and will update this review accordingly.\n\n1)  DLC maps are not recognised. You need to start the game on a windows computer and then they appear in the Linux version.\n2) Steam Achievements are not working at all for me. I can ony get them when playing on a Windows computer. But even on the Windows computer quite often achievements are not being passed to steam. They appear in game but not on steam. A recent example for me was the pressure gauge 200 achievement which didn't show after scoring over 200 points.\n3) Crashes often. The game will quite often simply quit mid-game. This is not as bad as it seems as the game loads quickly and you can carry on from where you left off. Also when quitting a game to go to the main menu the game will sometimes simply quit the game.\n\nOverall the game is a highly enjoyable game and highly recommended despite the few teething problems with this update, which appears to have been quite a large update to the game.\n\n\n","December 6, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like the description says, you can learn how to play in a matter of minutes but it will take a lifetime to master.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to build more train lines than your opponents, this is done by matching the colour of the line with the colour of a train cart. You get different coloured train carts out of a deck of cards.\n\nThe game has a very good built in turtorial video and lessons which explains this all in an easy to understand way. It can look very daunting at first but it soon becomes apparent that it is a very simple idea behind it all.\n\nSadly from my 3 hours playing, I haven't once been able to find a match online against anyone, mainly because I get an ingame error message when ever I try and find or start an online game, so my review is based purely on the single-player aspect, and while I haven't actually won a game of Ticket to Ride, I did enjoy my time playing.\n\nI'm not sure who this game is aimed at, but since there is a physical board game for Ticket to Ride, I'd say only pick this up if you enjoy the board game, but I can't really recommend this game for anyone else, £6,99 is a bit much for this, and £14,99 for the complete pack is utterly silly.","March 2, 2015","false","3.4"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","17","36","3","9"

Instead of completing her route, she blocked all mine and won with that strategy of hers.\n\nIn general, this is a game based on a really good casual board game. It is extremely simple to understand all the rules and even a rookie can win a match in this game.\n\nUsually a player's destination tickets are hidden to other players in the actual board game but if you play the hot seat mode on one computer (I believe it is called Pass and Play), you can be aware of the routes others are trying to make which can slightly decrease the quality and the element of surprise of the game (at the beginning of a game, always block someone who has the Vancouver-Montreal card!)\n\n...what dafuq Steam, no rating?!

Every menu has voice overs describing what options are available.  Often each menu has but two or three options.  Switching maps, more voices overs describing each map, often with horribly caricature ethnic voices.  There is simply no way to turn the voice overs off and has been off putting enough that I've only been able to stomach playing two games.

Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.\n\nFrom this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?","January 16, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it was easy getting into Ticket To Ride, a far simpler and less agressive game that's also much faster and relaxed.  This game is simply fun, and quick enough to play during a break in most cases.\n\nAt the start of the game, you choose up to three destinations (more depending on DLC), and spend your turn either building routes, drawing cards, or choosing new destinations.  The goal is to score the most points in the end by having the most completed destinations, the most trains on the board, and the longest routes.\n\nThere are several DLC packs for the game, and I have several of them.  I especially enjoy the Europe DLC, and these provide alternate ways to play the game.  These include new maps and rule variants for use in the game.

Although it is different than having to fiddle with the trains etc. since it is all there on the screen it was a lot of fun! Passing the tablet every time was a bit of a hassle but we had the same fun blocking each others routers etc. We laughed and had the same competition we would normally have had with the board game. The downside is that you can not see the playing board all the time so it is a bit harder to think ahead.\n\nAll in all I loved having this installed on my tablet. It's convenient to take with you compared to the box with the game if you are low on space for a trip. Still I prefer the board game whenever I can with more players or when I do have the space to take the full board game with me. I just love to have this as a backup and for a fast game of (single player) Ticket to Ride.","December 5, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I only play solo, I imagine the game is even better multi-player.\n\nOnly a couple of minor issues. The game isn't as flexible as it should be when playing off-line. You should be able to mix human and AI opponents, for example 2 of each, but you can't. You can only have one human and then the rest AI. Also, as a solo player I'm going for high scores, but the high score table only holds about ten entries and apparently you can't clear it. Worse, there is only one high score table for all the different maps (I've bought all the DLC). So I've stopped playing despite not playing the DLC maps much because I can't seem to get new high scores.","July 6, 2014","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play solo against suprisingly skilled bots or online against friends. The rules are simple and easy to get the hang off. The graphics are functional and simple although the menus are a bit clunky. The random draw of tickets and carriage cards means luck does play a part (especially when you need that last carriage or locomotive to finish a route!) but it means each game is different and the various maps available each provide their own quite different challenges. Fortunately the game keeps track of all the scoring (one of the more difficult tasks in the board game). Make sure you get all of the Maps in the bundle and you will have endless entertainment with a game that is ideal as a time filler in between other tasks or games or perfect for honing skills in-between tabletop sessions!

Nothing much to say really. Based off the board game, rules are pretty simple, and the gameplay itself is fluid and fun. There are...a couple major issues however that may make playing the game a major turn-off for some.\n\nThe Good:\n+Like I said, gameplay. Simple, board game like, timer to keep you going, etc. If you've played the board game, you'll know what to expect.\n+Multiplayer. God, you would wish that this would just be a given, but given the glitches the game has, it's a major plus that it works somewhat properly. So, yea. Nice that it doesn't crash and I can play with my friends.\n+Music/Speech/Sounds. Nothing to call home about, but they're pretty nice.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Oh god, the interface. So bad. So, so bad. For starters, the conductor will not turn off his initial speech after you've gone through the first menu. It'll repeat, every single time. You can turn that annoying factor off somewhere deep, deep in the settings, but until them, prepare to suffer.\n-Doesn't always install correctly. So, I got this off of Humble Bundle and am very glad that we had another place to download it from because the Steam version doesn't always install correctly. And, actually, the HB website version required some fixing as well. My friend had to go through some steps before she could get it to work, but, mine worked fine. So, it's a grab bag.\n-Confusing set-up. The settings aren't really intuitive. So, making a game, changing something, or doing something isn't really easy and doesn't come with a solid explanation. Shame.\n\nOverall:\nIf you get the game to work, its fun. Nothing really fancy, a very lightweight board game port that passes the time and once you get everything all sorted out is quite fun. If you have the glitches however, good luck.","November 25, 2013","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a clean interface and follows the rules exactly and plays quickly. The instructions aren't the best as there is no tutorial but if you know the board game you can jump right in. Unfortunately the AI isn't that smart. They will mainly keep destiantion tickets if they think they can complete them rather than plot out a real strategy. It's basically like playing against a beginner player vs an advanced player in real life. Also how exciting can a board game on the pc be? It gets dull a little quickly, board games are in essence a face to face social experience.

So it was easy getting into Ticket To Ride, a far simpler and less agressive game that's also much faster and relaxed.  This game is simply fun, and quick enough to play during a break in most cases.\n\nAt the start of the game, you choose up to three destinations (more depending on DLC), and spend your turn either building routes, drawing cards, or choosing new destinations.  The goal is to score the most points in the end by having the most completed destinations, the most trains on the board, and the longest routes.\n\nThere are several DLC packs for the game, and I have several of them.  I especially enjoy the Europe DLC, and these provide alternate ways to play the game.  These include new maps and rule variants for use in the game.  These are not essential, but can enhance the game if the classic USA map and rules aren't interesting anymore.\n\nThe Steam version of this game also runs very well on Ubuntu.","December 9, 2013","true","53.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything works how it should, for the most part. The tutorial is fairly well done and a decent way to teach people how to play the game if you're sick of explaining it, and the AI is passable but not great if you just want to play casually by yourself. More importantly, it supports cross-platform multiplayer between the PC, Mac, web, and iPad versions. It does NOT support playing with the Pocket (read: iPhone) version, which for some reason is the only one which allows asynchronous play, which is kind of lame. It also has no hotseat mode. By far the specialest thing about it is that it installs its own private  (probably non-updated) JVM, which is kind of counter to one of the main points of using something like Java in the first place. It's otherwise functional, even if there are a few weird design decisions.","April 28, 2013","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a game, it is well designed, but fairly dependent on random chance e.g. your missions, the colors of trains you get (there should be a rule where you have to brag every time you draw two locomotives). Regardless, it's an entertaining game, but it will most definitely ruin friendships if you play with people you know. The game for PC and Mac have pass-and-play local multiplayer, but it's a little iffy, since your hand of cards is supposed to be hidden.\n\nThe electronic edition is nice, because you don't have to keep track of pieces and points by hand, and you don't have to clean up or set up either. Additionally, you can play with other people online, making getting stressed out by board games even easier. However, I think that half the fun of playing a board game is having a physical copy. With the electronic version, you miss out on nervously fumbling around while placing down cars, accidentally knocking over other people's cars, proclaiming your masculinity by taking a route with eight locomotives, trying to figure out where the hell your cities are, trying to figure out where the hell your friends' cities are, pleading for mercy from your friends, yelling at your friends, getting yelled at by your friends, putting your friends in headlocks for blocking your long mission, and overturning the board in rage.\n\nDon't have any friends? I'd pass on this game then.","December 12, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.\n\nFrom this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?","January 16, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, I did not see an option (possible I missed it) to change gameplay options (ie, give each player more or less trains, set a round limit instead of train limit, etc.) which could have made games more interesting and allowed for variants, although I certainly understand you can't really program an AI to handle all the options.\n\nThe games don't take very long to complete (I usually get 15-20 mins / game offline), a perfect amount of time for a board game, although online play obviously runs longer as people are making decisions, but typically they don't go much longer.\n\nIf you've played the board game you know what it's about, nothing has changed apart from new map variants.

Unfortunately the latest update has not only changed the main controls and the layout of the board, but simply broke the game.\n\nNow it takes about 5 minutes to simply load the game, it just starts with a blank map where you can't do anything and the music and sound effects are blaring. When it finally loads the process of selecting a map is anything but comfortable, where before you could simply switch through the maps, looking at the different layouts with a click, now you have to enter a submenu to rotate through (not a deal breaker on its own, but remember, I've just been exposed to 5 minutes of waiting for things to react at all).\n\nNow within the game itself the board layout has also change, for newcomers probably intuitive enough, for those who have already spent quite a lot of time in the game a nuisance.\n\nAll of the things I've mentioned above are not the reason I can't recommend this game though.\n\nThe reason you should stay away until they patch this game: after you've finished a round the game just hangs with a white screen, no reaction at all, nothing. Couldn't even close it properly and had to kill it through the taskmanager. I'm definitely not willing to spend 5 minutes waiting for the game to load, navigate through submenus to pick a map and then have the game crash after one round.\n\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nAfter finally being able to start the game, I have to admit I almost forgot the trouble it gave me when I first installed it... or well, rather when I installed it for the first 7 times. But only almost. If you have an AMD graphics card be prepared for trouble, this thing is a b* to get to run on new machines.\n\nIt's certainly not a fan of up-to-date graphic drivers, nope, this game shows its age while installing (not while playing, mind you)\n\nIn case anyone is reading this after having tried and failed to install and actually start this game on a windows 7 machine, here is a rather usefull link, just scroll to the end of the page an follow those instructions, all but step 4. DO NOT COPY THE FILE, just leave it where it is and skip ahead to step 5.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/846943418815498457/#p2\nIn case it still won't start, just try running it in compatiblity mode for windows XP, that's what did the trick for me. Now all is fine.\n\nBut back to the game itself.\nIt's fun to play and way too easy to waste an enourmous amount of time with it. The campaigns are fairly short and one little campaign won't cost you days or hours of your life, but if you are like me and can't stop after a loss... or a win, well a short campaign of 10 minutes can turn into 2 hours.\n\nSome of the maps are rather confusing at first (yeah, well, who reads or acutally listens to instructions, right? yep, neither did I), especially since the DLCs seem to have other rules when it comes to train placement. If you're not interested in the DLC anyway (it's hit an miss btw.), than it's rather straighforward. The video on steam pretty much covers all the rules and the gameplay.\n\nWould I recommend this?\nYeah, I guess I still would, but only to those who know how to open a command shell, 'cause if things go wrong, that's pretty much the only way to get to enjoy this game.","March 28, 2015","false","64.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core game itself is an addictive strategy game, and it's definitely worth navigating the quirks of the digital version to play it.","February 6","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WatershedGaming/recommended/108200/","WatershedGaming","Malwynde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WatershedGaming/","75 products in account","This is an updated review.\n\nFirst of all, if you are looking for a quality, multiplayer (over the internet) board game with easy to understand concepts, this is it. It's a game witha great reputation as a traditional board game, but it really does well as a PC game. And incidentally, I also own this title and all the DLC for my iPad as well (and it's even a more perfect fit as an electronic game on that platform).\n\nIt's easy to understand how to play this game and the interface works perfectly as an electronic game.\n\nTicket to Ride relies a lot on skill and critical thinking and some on chance. A more advanced player definitely has the capability to make the game more complex for the opponent.  The single player vs one AI is not very challenging, but that's OK. It's still a fun diversion.\n\nI did have an issue a while back that had me giving this game a thumbs down. It was because my game was broken and nothing I did would fix it (for a while). Support tried to help me, but they were slow between communications, and never came up with an answer. Frankly, I'm not sure how they ever would, considering the weird nature of the issue.\n\nFinally I was able to resolve the issue, by accident.\n\nThe issue was I could not get a single player versus one AI to load the game board so the game would not start. I solved it accidentally by loading up a single player versus TWO AI, then I backed out, tried with one AI, and it loaded. I have repeated this solution several times.  If you are having that issue, might want to give that a try. /shrugs\n\nAnyway, with the issue solved and enjoying many games with my friend - online - and as a single player against AI (once again), I do not regret this purchase, and thereby change my review to a resounding "Yes!"","February 28, 2015","true","88.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voices are horrible, though, and my first step after installing the game is to turn them off.\n\nThe singleplayer games are challenging, especially if you increase the number of computer players, and the variety in playstyles found in the different (DLC) boards are enough to keep you busy for a while.\n\nHot Seat multiplayer is easy enough to set up, and runs about as fast as singleplayer.\n\nThe multiplayer lobby sometimes has a hard time logging you in, even with your login credentials saved, and may at times even kick players offline while they are in a game, replacing them by bots. This costs these players "karma", but it happens fairly infrequently.\n\nOne-on-one multiplayer with a friend goes through the same multiplayer lobby as all the other games, and setting up a successful game with a password lock will not always work.\n\nGame lag is a problem with multiplayer games, no matter the amount of players. At times the game just doesn't recognize you clicked a card, or suddenly thinks you clicked the card stack twice when you only clicked it once, promptly ending your turn.\n\nWhile it has its bugs, it is still an enjoyable game, and a decent digital version of the boardgame. I would recommend buying it if you enjoy playing digital boardgames with, or without, friends.","September 29, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, if i want to build a train between Copenhagen and Stockholm and there is 3 squares with a purple colour you need 3 purple cards to build on it.\n\nTo win you need the most points in the game,\n1  cart=1 point\n2 carts=2 points\n3 carts=4 points\n4 carts=7 points\n5 carts=10 points\n6 carts=15 points.\n\nBut you can also get points by completing routes like Copenhagen to Rome. There's two kinds of routes, short distance (normaly worth 5-10 points) and long distance (worth up to 21 points).\nIn the end you can also get bonus points by either building the longest route, completing the most routes or by doing both.\n\nI've been playing the table version of this game some times and i've found myself very amused by it. Then we were playing it with 4-5 people and it was pretty hard to get to where you wanted without getting blocked by some one else, sometimes the others wanted to block your route just to keep you from completing it and getting those extra points.\nThe same things can happen in the digital version.\n\nThe digital version has alot of different game types,\nSolo with AI's\nLocal (so you can play with other pc's on you'r network\nOnline (so you can play with your friends)\nPass and play (a group can play on the same pc by passing it around)\n\nNote that this just like monopoly can destroy relationships and friendships easy.

I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC.  Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good.  I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues.  But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10).  Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked.  The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say "Play".\n\nThe new interface works good for me (on my 47" TV).  I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam.  But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly.  Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine.  In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI.  The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV.  The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.\n\nI only wish it had controller support.  The mouse works fine and intuitively.  I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version.  It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360).  But it works just fine.  I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .","January 3","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately the latest update has not only changed the main controls and the layout of the board, but simply broke the game.\n\nNow it takes about 5 minutes to simply load the game, it just starts with a blank map where you can't do anything and the music and sound effects are blaring. When it finally loads the process of selecting a map is anything but comfortable, where before you could simply switch through the maps, looking at the different layouts with a click, now you have to enter a submenu to rotate through (not a deal breaker on its own, but remember, I've just been exposed to 5 minutes of waiting for things to react at all).\n\nNow within the game itself the board layout has also change, for newcomers probably intuitive enough, for those who have already spent quite a lot of time in the game a nuisance.\n\nAll of the things I've mentioned above are not the reason I can't recommend this game though.\n\nThe reason you should stay away until they patch this game: after you've finished a round the game just hangs with a white screen, no reaction at all, nothing. Couldn't even close it properly and had to kill it through the taskmanager. I'm definitely not willing to spend 5 minutes waiting for the game to load, navigate through submenus to pick a map and then have the game crash after one round.\n\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nAfter finally being able to start the game, I have to admit I almost forgot the trouble it gave me when I first installed it... or well, rather when I installed it for the first 7 times. But only almost. If you have an AMD graphics card be prepared for trouble, this thing is a b* to get to run on new machines.\n\nIt's certainly not a fan of up-to-date graphic drivers, nope, this game shows its age while installing (not while playing, mind you)\n\nIn case anyone is reading this after having tried and failed to install and actually start this game on a windows 7 machine, here is a rather usefull link, just scroll to the end of the page an follow those instructions, all but step 4. DO NOT COPY THE FILE, just leave it where it is and skip ahead to step 5.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/846943418815498457/#p2\nIn case it still won't start, just try running it in compatiblity mode for windows XP, that's what did the trick for me. Now all is fine.\n\nBut back to the game itself.\nIt's fun to play and way too easy to waste an enourmous amount of time with it. The campaigns are fairly short and one little campaign won't cost you days or hours of your life, but if you are like me and can't stop after a loss... or a win, well a short campaign of 10 minutes can turn into 2 hours.\n\nSome of the maps are rather confusing at first (yeah, well, who reads or acutally listens to instructions, right? yep, neither did I), especially since the DLCs seem to have other rules when it comes to train placement. If you're not interested in the DLC anyway (it's hit an miss btw.), than it's rather straighforward. The video on steam pretty much covers all the rules and the gameplay.\n\nWould I recommend this?\nYeah, I guess I still would, but only to those who know how to open a command shell, 'cause if things go wrong, that's pretty much the only way to get to enjoy this game.","March 28, 2015","false","64.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piisamson/recommended/108200/","piisamson","Piisamson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piisamson/","177 products in account","I'll update my review to reflect the new version:\n\nA lot of negative reviews have been given because of the new version. This is understandable, since they published the 2.0 version too early and too buggy (basically an "Early access" version). However, many of the bugs mentioned in the reviews have since been fixed, and the dev team seems quite active in improving the game and even adding new features. It's still not bug free, but I'm confident it will be in the near future. For those who don't want to wait for it, it's easy to downgrade to the old 1.6 version.\n\nOld review: (still accurate for the most part)\n\nGreat and accurate translation of the board game to PC. And a great game whether or not you have played the board game. It's easy to learn, but hard to master. A big warning though: this is not a single player game. There is the option to play AI players, but those are mostly there for you to get to ropes. Once you understand what the game is about, you will win them every time. So this game is meant to be played against human players, whether those be your friends or fellow unknown gamers. If you create an open game, it will take 1-2 minutes for other players to join in, and then you can start. A game lasts for 10-30 minutes, depending on the number of players and how fast they play, however, it has to be played back-to-back, no saving and preferably no quitting. Ticket to Ride suits both those who want a little casual play every now and then, and those who like competitive gaming.\n\nSome say it's simple, but I say even just the base game is complex. 2, 3, 4 and 5 player games all require different strategies. And apart from strategy, what is most required is adaptation. If your strategy is rigid, you will lose. You have to adapt it every turn.\n\nIn some way, I think this is a game where Chess meets Texas Hold'em. You have to anticipate the other players moves, you have to estimate the odds and you have to bluff and try not to give signs about where you are going. And you get better the more you play, until you reach a plateau. And then you realize something about your playing style, adjust and keep rising in the ranks. The game has a SELO ranking system, much like the one used by competitive Chess players. So you will see how you progress. You will know approximately how good your opponents are, whether or not you actually know them.\n\nThere are two distinguished playing styles. Cutthroat or friendly. Usually players accept that whatever you do, in the scope of the rules, and win, is OK. Some players however don't like blocking and screwing/getting screwed. These players will mark their games with words suchs as Fun, Fair or No blocking. Join these games if you want a friendly game. And don't if you're going to do whatever it takes to win.","August 29, 2015","true","584.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
