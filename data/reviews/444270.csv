Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I received it.\nHypersensitive Bob is a top-down rogue-lite crawler very similar to The Binding of Isaac, yet still very different in many ways. I believe that two comments seen in the trailer and description summarise the game very well. "It's like if Disney did The Binding of Isaac" and “Similar gameplay to that of The Binding of Isaac, yet unique enough to create its identity”\n\nYou take on the role of Bob, an ordinary chap who is allergic to everything. This fellow has taken it upon himself to rid the world of the allergy-inducing evildoers. He travels sky platforms shooting up bees and mushrooms with his modified asthma pipe, collecting vaccines (the currency) along the way. Sounds great, the only problem with this (besides the fact that he is allergic to everything which would then mean he is allergic to vaccines) is that none of this is explained. It essentially throws you into the game without as much as a simple explanation. The story continues to be elusive throughout the game to the point of you not really knowing what's going on.\n\nThe gameplay is -though slow-paced- fun and interesting, with a variety of enemies and many of which evolve into ruthless anaphylaxis-causing troublemakers. Each level you pass through gives you in return the option to choose one of three powerups. This system is done very well with it putting you in the position of trying to prioritise between different aspects vital to your success, and doesn't require you to have your eyes glued to a wiki. This style of gameplay is definitely the area this game is most reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac. The only real inconvenience I encountered was the awkwardness of shooting in a diagonal direction. It requires you to shoot in one of four standard directions, and then whilst holding that key/button down, shoot either up/down to produce the desired shot. (i.e. Shoot left, hold button, shoot up = diagonal shot NW from you.)\n\nVisually, the cartoonish graphics are appealing and very effective. It suits the lighthearted tone of the game and makes it more unique. This is one of the major aspects that sets it apart from The Binding of Isaac.\n\nRegarding music and sounds, the game provides a satisfactory experience.\n\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Fun & interesting gameplay\n✔ Great upgrade system\n✔ Visually pleasant\n✔ Satisfactory music & sounds\n\nCons\n✘ Story/game idea is barely explained\n✘ Awkward controls\n\nConclusion\nHypersensitive Bob is an enjoyable experience which isn't asking for much in its price. It's a simpler, cuter version of The Binding of Isaac except a third of the price. For what it offers, I'd definitely recommend picking it up if you're interested.\n\n7.4/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

Immunity won't develop during the course of gameplay however, so everything that moves is a threat. Unfortunately, this backstory is only available by reading the product description. I'd love to see a short intro sequence with some artwork and text. Instead, you are abruptly dumped into Bob's living room without any intro or explanation.\n\nGraphics are cute, chunky, cartoony and bright, kind of like a more colorful Gunheimm. A good deal of attention has clearly been given to the characters and animations, which are quite detailed. Some levels feature extra little pieces of detail like hidden creatures and the lighthouse's rotating rays casting a warm light over the level.\n\n\nGameplay & Difficulty:\n\nHypersensitive Bob is easy to pick up instantly and just have some fun with.\n\nBob travels between one tiny arena-like level after another in his rocket. The journey is complete when you beat them all (approximately 20) and there is no saving in between. Mid-level, you will be given the opportunity to purchase 1 of 3 random bonuses, which boost or change your abilities for the duration of the journey. Bonuses range from common types, to rare to epic to legendary. They really help to add variety and make each adventure a bit different.\n\nEnemies are all based around some type of animal or creature e.g bees, skunks, turkeys and snails. Each one has it's own attack pattern that you'll need to learn. Touching an enemy or getting hit by a projectile docks you 1 life. Lose them all and you're back to the start of the whole adventure, unless you've collected enough points (from defeated enemies, loot, treasure chests or rare "vaccine machines") to respawn at the start of the level.\n\nI was surprised at the level of challenge, but I found that pacing yourself and not trying to get too many shots in at once was key. I also found that I progressed much farther when I got lucky with +HP and +damage bonuses popping up between levels.\n\n\nControls:\n\nMovement is in 4 diections and so is shooting. You can fire in one direction while moving in another, but this will slow you down as Bob has to do a little turn before each shot. Keyboard users can press spacebar to fire in the direction they are facing, but that's not as useful. You have to line your shots up and judge the distance too.\n\nThe controls may be a sticking point for some people. Movement is sort of slow (Bob waddles rather than walks) and shooting leaves you stationary for a moment that really leaves you open to getting hit (there is a random bonus that reduces this movement penalty though), so timing your shots and knowing how many times to fire before retreating is crucial.\n\nJudging by the comments in the discussion area, smoothing out the controls seems to be the #1 priority the develoeprs are working on right now.\n\n\nOther Comments/Suggestions:\nThe characters are really likeable and I'd love to see some custscenes and/or artwork to flesh out their personalities a bit more\nThe living room area is really cosy. You'll notice 2 unlockable characters sitting down and more waiting to take up the empty seats. There could be other secrets to this room and I think it'd be great to see souvenirs from your journeys displayed here. Perhaps this is already possible?\nI haven't unlocked any yet, but the masks and accessory items look like a cool way to deck out the already cool characters. Some kind of co-op exploratory mode would be a cool way to show of your customized characters.\n\nI was provided with a copy of this game to give feedback during the beta phase. I decided to post a review here also. The opinions expressed above are my own and were not influenced by anyone else.","March 31","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They throw you into the game kinda like you are thrown into an asthma attack (great joke eh?) and you are left with no instructions. The graphics are cute and nice; you can definitely tell a lot of work was put into them. You are put into this small 'arena' and forced to fight monsters that spawn (they alert you via timer systems (which are actually very helpful)) until you beat the level and then advance to the next one. Each monster drops these orange potions that give you points; these points can be used to buy items in the shop (helps you die less) or can be used to revive. Once you die though it's game over (unless you have enough points to buy a revive of course). This game has approximately 25 levels, which is not a lot. The price seems alright (I would personally prefer it at $3 but let's see where this goes) and the game is definitely worth it if you wanna have a fun time, and like survival games. They introduce a variety of enemies, making each level unique in their own way. Since the game does not have a menu I do not think you can change the difficulty in the game, which may reduce chances of replayability. But if you wish to beat your own score again that is possible. So yes this is a good indie game, an amazing over-the-top one-of-a-kind one no, but still well-made in it's own right.\n\nIf you wanna check out my awesome sauce video on the game you can click that purty link down there ;3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aka6GMZ7HQQ&feature=youtu.be","March 29","true","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

After first opening the game I was a bit suprised that there was no menu. This confused me a bit and made me think the first playthrough was maybe a tutorial or something. The game throws you straight into the action which is kind of nice however on your first run you will most likely not get too far as you try to work out what is going on.\n\nAfter your initial run you will probably have a good idea of how the game works. You purchase upgrades, kill plants/animals to collect vials which allow you to progress to the next level and purchase more upgrades. While it does seem a bit repetitive every run feels different and unique due to the different upgrades and levels you get during that run.  This allows for a lot of replay value that makes the $5 price point seem worth it if your a person that likes to drop hundreds of hours playing games like Binding of Isaac.\n\nWhile I do recommend the game, there are also many things which could be improved to make the starter and the experience overall better for the player. I would like to see more upgrades that modify your weapon instead of locking them behind progression. The upgrades to the weapon are the most interesting upgrades in this game and I think it would be a significant improvement to add some of those early on to show the full potential of the game instead of hiding it behind a progression wall were you have to unlock some of these upgrades. I think It might also be cool to add maybe a little intro or something to give the player a Idea of what the story of the game is without having to look outside of the game. I would also recommend a option to remove the end cutscene as it can get a bit repetitive after your 100th playthrough.\n\nOverall the game isn't perfect. There isn't as much depth as similar games such as Binding of Isaac however for $5 you get a game with a nice music track and cartoony artstyle which you can keep coming back too in your free time. In conclusion I would recommend the game if you interested in a casual rogue-lite however if you are looking for some more hardcore rogue-lite action maybe other games like Binding of Isaac would be more suited to your taste","March 29","true","0.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

He’s allergic to everything!  Trees, flowers, bumblebees… they are all a death trap waiting to happen.  What’s a cute snowman-lookalike to do?  Luckily, Bob is a very rich snowman.  Armed with a modified asthma inhaler, which is now a gun, he takes off in his very own spaceship to explore floating worlds and take on Mother Nature.\n\nSnowman.  Allergy gun. Spaceship.  Sounds pretty cute, right?  It is!  This game has many lighthearted aspects.  The graphics are cartoony and bright.  The enemies are pudgy and adorable.   The whole atmosphere of the game is cheerful and sunny.\n\nAs a casual player of platformers, the controls did give me some trouble.  On a keyboard, the game offers two ways of using your allergy gun – spacebar and arrow keys.  Using WASD to move and spacebar to shoot was the standard way of many games, and the option I was more comfortable with.  The arrow keys turn Bob in the direction of the arrow and fires immediately, kinda like a James Bond spin move.  But moving with my left hand on WASD and shooting the arrow keys with my right hand was a bit too backwards for me.  I kept trying to move with the arrow keys and ended up wasting my ammo (which wasn’t a big deal because it automatically replenishes), or I was slow lining up to a target using WASD then hitting the wrong arrow key and firing in the opposite direction.  But any gamer with more experience than me will have no trouble with the key bindings.\n\nAfter Bob faces off with his allergic symptoms and destroys them, he’s rewarded with orange vials of vaccine. These can be spent on a reward system that’s available between levels.  While Bob is enjoying downtime in his private spaceship (who wouldn’t?), you can spend these vaccines on items to help Bob in the next level.  Increased health, speed boost, ammo…all can be bought to boost Bob’s performance in the next round.  Most of these upgrades are inexpensive, but you can choose to save your vaccine points to revive Bob, in the event of his death, and redo the level instead of restarting the entire game.  This is a more expensive option, but one that definitely comes in handy as you progress through the game.\n\nAt the time of playing, I was unable to unlock Bob’s friends, who are chilling in my hideout in big comfy chairs in front of the fireplace.  But I look forward to seeing what these guys do.  Maybe they’ll give me bonus upgrades?  Maybe I’ll play co-op with them on certain levels?  Maybe they’ll just stay at my house and eat all my food?  Who knows!\n\nOverall, Hypersensitive Bob is a cute indie game.  The lighthearted atmosphere makes this a great casual game for gamers of all ages.\n\nIf you’d like, here is a video of my playthrough of the first few levels:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaYtZ4UDYZc\n","March 29","true","2.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

He isn't letting that get the best of him, oh no, Bob is going to defy his life of isolation and step out into the world, step into his rocket ship and blast off to explore cartoony floating islands...using his modified asthma pipe he must fend off anything that threatens to ruin his day as he collects vaccines from his surroundings...Bob has an odd life...\n\nThe gameplay would be immediately familiar to those who have played the likes of Binding of Isaac but with less of a (excuse the language) f*cked up back story.\n\nThe control scheme Using WASD to move with the directional buttons (or spacebar) used to fire projectiles, the game does boast controller support but my NVIDIA Shield Tablet Controller wouldn't work (I have heard another reviewer state that he uses an Xbox360 controller so it may just be an incompatibility with this particular model).\n\nThere is a handy item system at the end of each level, presenting you with bonuses (or sometimes detriments) to ensure that Bob completes his journey in one piece. The items can be purchased by spending the vaccines that you gather throughout the levels, but be careful, there is a high-cost if you happen to be defeated.\n\nSound design of the game fit well with the style and feel, however there were no ambient sounds, if Bob stopped moving or no monsters were spawning the world fell into an eerily silent state which caused me a couple times when I first launched the game to restart it thinking that sound wasn't working. (EDIT: Ambient sound and music has been added before release)\n\nMonsters and bosses are varied with their own unique abilities or movement patterns which really help keep the game fresh throughout the levels.\n\nOverall the game achieves a replayability factor with it's unique enemies and random item chance and a nice little addition to the Steam library, something I will definitely check back on as more content is added.\n\nAlso did a first impressions video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2g1gHFhhmc","March 29","true","1.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I only had trouble with one boss that seems to have kept spawning enemies when it was not supposed to, giving the fight a tedious and lopsided feel.

Well, I have to say, while there are similarities between the games, this one certainly has created an identity for itself that is completely different from Isaac. I quickly realised that while it may seem bright and cheery on the surface (due to the cute graphics) there is definitely a darker undercurrent to the game.\n\nWhen I first bought this, I played maybe 15mins and hated it. I found moving very difficult and felt like the whole game was lagging somewhat. I tossed it in a corner for a few months until recently I decided to give it another shot. I'm so glad I did.\n\nI honestly don't know why people are complaining about the controls being clunky. Not only are the key bindings essentially the same as that of Isaac but the shooting and movement are fine for base stats seeing as there are actually items that affect these.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to pick up\n- Nice graphics\n- I really like the Idea of using 'vaccine' to purchase items\n- replayability (each playthrough is different)\n- I also really like the vaccine machine and unlocking certain items through levelling it up\n- I like how you can have the same level layout but get different enemies appear either when respawning in the same playthrough or in different playthroughs\n\nWhat it still needs:\n- More enemies\n- More bosses so you don't fight the exact same bosses in every playthrough\n- more levels: if you play it a few times you start to see the same level layouts over and over, more variability in these at each stage of the game would be great.\n- more Items: because who doesn't think a game could use more items?\n- Maybe more characters you can play as?\n\nOverall, I'd give it an 8/10 and would definitely recommend it.","June 3","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
