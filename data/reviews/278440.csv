In the initial levels you are attempting to maintain your Probe's orbit around various celestial bodies, while later you have to hold the orbit in specific areas or crash your probe into specific targets. As you go through the game, it gets more difficult with different obstacles that will throw you for a loop.  A nice plus is that there is a leaderboard to compare your times to other plays to see what is possible and strive to do better.\n\nMy minor complaints of the game would be a more apparent UI and a little more musical variety would be nice.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.","April 16, 2014","true","4.1"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

The simple beauty of the slingshot physics as gravity affects the path of the craft. Well this game takes that concept and runs with it. This title is very much in the spirit of other planetary physics games. Think Bit Generations Orbital, but the core gameplay honed to a razors edge.\n\nThe opening missions challenge you to keep your satellite in the planetary system for a set time. All with one click of the mouse. Before you launch your craft you are given initial visual flight paths guides. At the start, trial and error plays a part. But this won’t help as complexity of the systems ramps up. Like all great gameplay ideas, what at first seems a throwaway casual experience becomes oddly compelling and addictive. The daily challenge adds an extra layer of competition if you manage to battle through all the pre made content.\n\nWell worth a look.","January 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","20","22","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/278440/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","0rbitalis starts off with a simple goal: keep the probe from hitting a star or a planet for a set period of time. Generally, this can be achieved by finding just the right launch conditions to get the missile into a stable orbit. Soon after teaching that basic rule of thumb, it puts out levels in which stability is impossible and the surest course can be one with dangerous fly-bys and slingshot maneuvers, smashing into the surface of a star just moments after the timer runs down.\n\nThat's just the first set of levels. Each set has only about five levels in it, with a progression that goes from introduction to experimentation to display of mastery quickly. Some levels can take a lot of time to complete as a result of their difficulty, but pacing is fast in terms of the number of conceptual tweaks. Long before a single idea feels played out, the next one is ushered in.\n\nThese ideas can sound mundane, like having planets move along fixed paths, or they can sound fantastical, like anti-stars made of antimatter that produce antigravity fields. Either way, they bring something new to puzzle over. Other notable tweaks featured in certain level sets are pulsars whose gravitational pulls are variable over time, multiple star systems, and multiple rockets launching simultaneously from different locations.\n\nOne major gameplay tweak comes with a total shift in goals. In certain levels there is a demarcated zone and the object is to spend a certain amount of time in the zone. Rather than surviving for as long as possible, the goal is to finish as quickly as possible. Instead of searching for a smooth orbit, the ideal solution often involves a high-power shot meant to break free and end once it has achieved its purpose.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the more relaxed feel of the "survive as long as possible" levels. Since player interaction ends at the moment of the launch, there is a fair amount of downtime when the player isn't strictly doing anything other than watching the probe and predicting its path.\n\nThat aspect in itself is almost a zen experience. With a mellow atmospheric music backing and a film grain filter over the simple geometric shapes, it's easy to be lulled into an almost catatonic state. I sat around just watching one orbit for about five minutes and it felt like it was only about thirty seconds.\n\nThe visual effects work toward this as well. The subtle glow of space debris is calming, but the most striking effect is the trail following the probe. It fades slowly, so a long run over an interesting path creates an image reminiscent of those produced by a Spirograph. 0rbitalis has built-in screenshot functionality (in addition to Steam's), presumably because a good shot can result in some beautiful minimalist art.\n\nOn the surface, 0rbitalis is a competent puzzle game with a simple central mechanic. It explores many facets with modifications and additions to that mechanic, and each new idea changes up gameplay enough that it never feels like its retreading ground. That's how one could describe 0rbitalis, but that doesn't really convey it.\n\nFinding the right groove and reaching a hypnotic state, that's 0rbitalis at its best. Fire a shot, have it smash into an asteroid. Fire another, have it slingshot off into deep space. Fire another, then contemplate the nature of the universe as it bends and loops around for minutes at a time, leaving behind a trail of where it has been.","November 1, 2015","true","101.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/278440/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1503 products in account","0RBITALIS is a very interesting that game that recently came out from Early Access. It is a one-of-a-kind space/gravity physics simulation which I found really enjoyable.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to launch a satellite in a way, that doesn't immediately result in a crash. Every level has a time limit specified and you must reach that time to progress into the next level. You have to deal with gravity fields, anti-gravity fields and bypassing asteroids. The point of the game is very simple to understand, but solving the actual levels can still be a hard challenge for your mind.\n\nPros:    The whole idea is pretty good. You have to launch a satellite into space, considering all of the gravity areas. You might know this concept from Angry Birds Space, if you ever played that game. This satellite must stay in the assigned area for a specified amount of time to successfully complete the level. If you manage to stay in the area for any time longer, your time is recorded and put onto the Leaderboards.\nThis is where we get to the next good thing, integrated Steam Leaderboards. Your time is, as said before, recorded and compared to other players. Above all, you are also presented with a graph that indicates how good are you compared to other players. It looks very nice and really makes the player to try to beat his previous best.\nYou can get a lot of gameplay hours from this game as there are a hundred levels, divided into sectors, and almost 40 achievements.\nYou can also create your own levels with a pretty neat level editor. Those user-made levels can be later posted in the Workshop, where you can, of course, download other players' levels and have even more fun.\nThe graphics are simple, minimalistic and very clear. They set up some kind of a mysterious environment that is, combined with an amazing soundtrack, exceptionally enjoyable.\nThere are also Daily Levels for your daily dose of gaming.\nI have to say that I really like the way they set the price tag on this game. 7,99€/$9.99/£6.99 is really not high and you should really consider supporting the developer for such a low price.\nCons:    Despite low system requirements and minimalistic art style, this game surely needs a pretty strong computer. I had a few minor problems with lagging as the game seems to be pretty graphically intensive. I don't know what is up with that, but it needs some fixing.\nI looked really hard but I couldn't find an options menu. A game needs that, seriously. People with weaker computers cannot adapt their settings and therefore it's really hard for them to play a game.\nI don't like that you have to complete a level to unlock next one. If you get stuck on a level, you are pretty much done with the game until you figure it out. This is not the best thing if you're not in good relations with puzzle games.\nThe final verdict:I really enjoyed the game, as the atmosphere it creates and the idea of the game itself are very well made and executed. You get plenty of levels, daily levels, Workshop integration so 0RBITALIS should get you busy for quite a few hours. Despite a few problems with the game's performance, the gameplay is enjoyable and keeps the player going on or beating his previous records.\nI certainly recommend this game if you are a fan of puzzle games. This is a very unique experience and you should try it as well, as the price is really not high.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/recommended/278440/","retroalarm","Alarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/","2503 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe cunningly-titled 0RBITALIS (sure to be at the top of your games list) is an intriguing puzzle game for those who want something a little different.  Billed as a gravity simulator, the premise is to launch a satellite into orbit for long enough so you can reach the next level.  Sounds simple enough?  Using a mouse, you can select your speed and launch path and you have to use the gravitational pull of stars and other celestial bodies to extend your flight time without leaving the play area or colliding with something.\n\nUsefully, the mouse cursor position of your previous attempt is shown on-screen so you can tweak your next launch.  There are no lives, no time limit until launch so you can take your time: this is advisable.  One joy of this game is that it encourages experimentation - you can see the flight path up to a limited point.  There is no single solution, which encourages you to make several different attempts.  Your times are saved in a leaderboard and there are daily puzzles to play around with.\n\nBecause of the terribly complicated calculations of gravitational gradients and the like, the programmer had to use Adobe AIR in order to set out to do what he has done, so the game can be quite processor intensive.  Fortunately, there are quite a few options to lose some of the background detail and this did the job just fine for my middle-of-the-range PC.\n\nIt could well be time to introduce an addition to Newton's laws of motion: the classical mechanics of this game can be addictive but that is no 'constellation' if you crash and burn.  I speak with gravitas about this possibility.","January 26, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Pretty addictive, great physics, innovative challenges.\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n1. Keep the background music playing while orbiting. No music while watching the particle orbiting feels kind of empty. Maybe the music could also change depending on the action. Example: goes faster as the particle goes faster, or as the time passes; maybe with a special effect when a personal best is reached\n\n2. Put the timer counting somewhere on the screen right after firing. It will be much more thrilling to see the timer going while orbiting than waiting for the round to finish to know the end time\n\n3. If a level has been completed, that the player replays the level to try to have a better time and fails miserably (i.e. before the required time to pass is fulfilled), he shouldn't be treated with a round restart as if he had never passed the level (therefore not seeing the leaderboard and not having the option to go to the next level). He should be brought to the leaderboard so he can go to the next level if he wants as he may have failed now but he beat the level already and therefore has the right to go to the next level if he wants\n\n4. An outer ring that shows where is the limit before the particle is considered lost in space. It would be more thrilling to see the particle getting closer and closer of the ring limit, hoping another particle will have enough attraction to bring it back into the game\n\n5. Of course, achievements. When achievements are implemented, if a player by his previous games has fulfilled one, it should be granted immediately (example: make it #1 on a leaderboard)\n\n6. More levels with specific goals to accomplish, like the last levels where you have to touch lines to make the progress bar move in order to pass the level\n\n7.

Gravity is one of those things. Yes, it keeps you from floating away, and it makes going to the bathroom a whole lot less disturbing, but I'm telling you - it's the force of the devil. Don't agree? Think about it - how many times have you dropped something on your foot, or fallen down stairs? Exactly!

It leads to a lot of try again gameplay that frankly is easier to launch 15 attempts and hope it works then one solid attempt that's thought out: there's just too much variance in the gravity to really pinpoint in it. The custom maps are cool, and I like how the score attack is designed, but in the end it just doesn't have the draw to really make the game stand out for the price that's being asked.\nIf you are a patient gamer and really really want a game to challenge your timing skills, this may be for you, otherwise I can't recommend it.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: https://youtu.be/CzYEenCJwJU\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nInteresting puzzle concept that's fun when you feel like you're in control of what you're doing and that your decisions make a direct impact to your success.\nReasonable variation is present and new mechanics are introduced wisely.\nColors and visuals can work in a simplistic fashion.\nCool that they have steam workshop integrated.\n-:\nTrial and Error gameplay becomes much more reasonable then thinking things out.

The way the physics works out is really captivating and has you crossing your fingers that you have just enough velocity, or that the gravitational pull of certain objects is just strong enough. Plus, there are no right answers. Everything is moving. The puzzles aren't static. Timing is everything.\n\nThe only things that drive me crazy in this current iteration are A) it runs in windowed mode, with the bottom part of the window cut off (if there are options somewhere to fix this, I can't see them), and B) on my laptop at least (haven't installed on my desktop) the menus are really sluggish. The gameplay itself is pretty smooth, oddly enough. Just the menus hold it back. Of course, this game my be at the limit of what my laptop can handle.\n\nAll in all, though, a solid game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redangelx3/recommended/278440/","redangelx3","Redangelx3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redangelx3/","300 products in account","When you're playing around with gravity, something bad is bound to happen, like launching your satellite directly into a star or a planet. This is something the player will be running into a lot in the game 0RBITALIS, a satellite launching simulator with a retro puzzle style. Published by Mastertronic and developed by Alan Zucconi, the game simulates launching satellites into a successful orbit, or making them crash and burn quickly depending on how good you are at the game. Though to say that you're the one entirely in control would be incorrect for you are, in fact, not in complete control of your little probe's own destiny. One thing rules this game, and that is the rules of gravity.\n\n0RBITALIS is not completely scientifically accurate — just stating that at the very beginning of this review before the game is discussed any further. It doesn't diminish the fun that can be had from the game, however, because while it may not be a hundred percent accurate, it does provide an idea of what launching one of these things is like and how hard it is to keep it in orbit. For quite a long time we've been told by NASA how hard it is to launch something into space, how to make sure everything is working perfectly well and how gravity is playing a big role in all of that. Now you have a chance to experience their frustration on a smaller, more cost-efficient scale.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is immersive in its own way, and you will feel like you're in your own little world. It makes it seem like each little sector you go in is its own world and you're just visiting for a time. While it doesn't feel nearly as expansive as it could have, it's techno-ish music and minimalistic graphics will give you a sense that you're no longer on earth.\n\nThere's no story. You're just a tiny red entity launching your probe or satellite, hoping that you will get it in orbit around planets, stars, and other space objects. A certain number of puzzles are based around trial and error, which may be a turn off for those who want a realistic space simulator. However, there are many rich complexities in this game that can be missed by the naked eye, which are not limited to the number of different ways you can get your little red triangle to orbit. There isn't only one solution to every problem that is presented, there are dozens of solutions that are hidden and you can find almost any of them by just testing the 0RBITALIS game mechanics. A lot of it is about testing your theories and seeing how they work out. The gameplay itself uses a small dotted red line coming out from your satellite that shows the path that the thing is going take. If a little red dot shows up, it shows that your little triangle will crash and you'll have to start the level over again. There are no lives in this and there is a helpful feature that shows where all of the other players have died giving you a chance to vaguely get the idea of where not to launch.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","June 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've given it the time, and even lucked into the top 10 on some leaderboards. I can point to achievements showing under 10% of players complete the first 5 levels, and I can point to the leaderboards and achievements that expect you to leave the game AFK for hours, and that would be the review. Look for the original version on Newgrounds if you want to try it first.\n\nHowever, I feel it is important to really explain what the problems are, and what the game does for players. 0rbitalis is a simple game about launching a shape around gravity wells. The store makes it sound like a puzzle game, as if you can control time and your ship. Nope, it's really as simple as finding an angular velocity, deciding when to click, and waiting for your shape to float around for a minimum time. You can't alter course after firing, you have no active abilities, you have no interaction. Gravity calculations shift every moment, so firing at the same target point can have different results if you are a millisecond off. The game ends up as a search for the sweet spot so your satellite survives long enough to proceed. Failure is irritating, and success means staring at the screen 10-25 seconds minimum until you can get to the next level.\n\nThe developer seems to be a nice person, and responds regularly on the forums. Still, it's like developers know that idling-based tasks aren't fun, yet still use them. Getting an hour orbit wasn't really satisfying, mostly as it felt like sheer luck, and the orbit could've randomly collapsed at any moment. The leaderboards are somehow even worse. Most levels rate the longest times highest, but climbing the leaderboards is just a combination of luck and leaving the game idle. Alt-tab will pause the game, and there is no fast-forward button or timer option, so yes, you'll be waiting on this game for a few hours. However, a few leaderboards seem to rank lowest-times at the top, often led by the developer with impossible times.\n\nBeyond the leaderboards, there is no real depth. Levels drag on and quickly feel repetitive, but there are even more Challenge levels if you can't get enough waiting around. Challenge levels are simple to find on the map, but often require returning to the Star map between each level. If somehow you want even more, you can drag and drop some objects to make some basic levels for the Workshop. There IS a lot of content here, but it feels more like fetch quests than fun.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the issues are by design. The developer can't suddenly make the game more strategic, thoughtful, or interactive. Other design choices seem flawed, such as the heavy graphic settings slowing the game. Graphical settings are changed by toggling between 4 details with the Q key. Despite simple graphics, all the extra particles and blur effects slow the game down, even on minimum. Gravity calculations vary with framerate, and different computers will calculate differently according to the developer. Maybe the physics calculations could be improved and sped up if all the extra graphical details could be disabled. I'd rather have fast-forward than pointless rotating lines and frame drops.\n\nI can understand some of the positive reviews, as the developer seems nice and the game worked in Early Access. It still feels incomplete and shallow. It could almost be redeemed as an educational tool on physics, but the barebones objectives and inconsistent physics will teach nothing. As just entertainment, the frustrating gameplay prevents anything from shining. I got the game from a Humble bundle with intent to play it. I cannot really recommend the game, even on sale. Most of my gameplay has been waiting around and wishing for luck. I wish I could enjoy it.","June 26, 2015","false","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

These objectives vary from just staying alive and not crashing for a specific period of time, to flying through specific points on the map (using the gravity of static or moving bodies), to maintaining proximity to specific gravitational bodies.\n\nThe UI of the main menu leaves a bit to be desired, favoring artistic beauty over simplicity/clarity; from what I can infer, the idea is a pseudo-3D look, but in reality it all just looks blurry and out-of-focus.  However, the actual gameplay doesn't suffer from these problems.\n\nAnother drawback of the game is that it is very CPU intensive.  I currently have a Intel G3258 CPU in my computer that I've over-clocked, and any time I even attempt to go over minimum quality settings, my computer starts to noticably chug.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I had a quite enjoyable time.  The mechanics are SPOT-ON and, although it seems the dev missed the mark when it came to the menus, the artistry of the actual gameplay is quite mezmerising at times.  As long as you're not expecting anything genre-defining or ground-breaking (as most levels are pretty much variations-on-a-theme), you should have a pretty good time!","March 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

It is very difficult to find a strategy that will work, and you're not "solving a puzzle" with each level.  Are you going to get lucky so that your object stays within the prescribed area?  It may or may not have a center of gravity or be centered around the center of gravity.  So yes, this is luck.\n\nOne additional gripe I have is about the spelling of the name.  The zero at front guarantees that they are listed first alphabetically in almost all lists.  It does, however, make the game very difficult to find in your games list.

Most of the gameplay consists of trial and error.\n\nI only played the first handful of levels (which should have been showing me the core game mechanics) but all I experienced was randomly clicking on the screen once, waiting, and seeing what happens...usually resulting in repetition. Since you have to keep your ship "in orbit" for a certain amount of time, the amount of waiting time after each click while watching the resulting animation is far too long. The game has a lot in common with the annoying component of Space Badgers.\n\nFor a game that is all about gravity, we aren't even given the most basic information (such as the relative masses of the various planets/stars or their relative distances from one another). The concept is solid, but the game does nothing to actually follow up on it other than a mere visual presentation (which is apparently not graphically optimized, but I have a brand new system so I couldn't tell).\n\nA puzzle game implies some form of logical structure or thinking involved. Perhaps it is the games presentation that is lacking and I simply missed it, but as another reviewer said, this felt like "a glorified screen saver."\n\nPass.","January 8, 2015","false","0.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

Often I found myself going COME ON, at the mere micro second of difference between finishing a level and failing. This to me added a level of 'I can do this" with each level I came across.\n\nThe graphics, forgettable. The sound, nearly none existant. But this isn't one of those type of games.\n\nIts a pure puzzle game based on the common physics of anything you may have learned from watching star trek.\n\nDown to the nitty gritty.\n\nYou guide a..object that uses objects I can assume in space to make it's orbit unblocked for whatever time limit it gives you. You do this by launching whatever this device is (a square) into the level using whateve robjects available to effect gravity and therefore, hopefully, have a good alignment to prevent collisions with the previous mentioned random object/s.\n\nThats really it. And yet it is addictively fun! Found myself flustered yet determined with this game to progress with each level.\n\nThe graphics simple, what u need to get what u want done. But for some reaosn it is a graphics hog, even with my power house I found it hanging.....\n\nSound forgettable....it has sound?\n\nReplaybility...well..it's a puzzle game, so thats determined on your own desire to finish each level....but once finished I can say most likely little desire to come back\n\nConcept...nice niche game fun to pick up and put down....\n\nFun...absolutely.....simple yet elegant....\n\nSo overall...worth your time..it's not a monumental game at all....but in the field of puzzle games its original, inventive, and addictive....if u like puzzle games with a new approach check it out.","October 16, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game consists of small levels containing various types of gravity-altering bodies, and the goal of each level is to launch your little ball of light and have it get somewhere or do something within a certain amount of time (or for as long as possible in some cases). The levels are grouped up in to bunches of 4-5, and each group of levels shares similar mechanics and goals, and entering a new group of levels will introduce you to new mechanics and often change the win-condition of the levels.\n\nThis brings me to my biggest negative: how to win a level is never explained beforehand. And some of the win-conditions are completely opposite (do X for as long as possible vs do X as quickly as possible). Some you can fogure out after of couple failed attempts, but others might make you sit there for 5 minutes as your ball of light orbits around making you think like you're racking up a super high score, only to have it crash and reveal that you were just wasting your time.\n\nThere is some skill to the game. I've gotten better at predicting orbits as I've gone through the levels. However, once the levels get to a certain complexity, you really can't predict or plan out your path with any degree of precision or certainty, and it just becomes a crapshoot. A typical later level looks like this: launch your ball in a direction that looks good, watch it orbit for 10 seconds, going in wildly unpredictable directions (in theory it's completely predictable, but when you have 5+ bodies moving around and pulling your ball in different directions at different rates it's next to impossible to do), restart the level, slightly modify your shot, and do it all again. And depending completely on luck, you might beat that level in 5 tries or 50.\n\nThe scoreboard is a cool feature. It's nice to randomly get an awesome score on a level and see yourself near the top. However, looking at some of the scores, it's hard to argue that it's anything but random. You can't tell me something predicted their 2 minute orbital path before launching.\n\nOverall, this is the type of game I play a level or two of for 10 minutes before going to bed. I would never sit down and make a gaming session of this game, nor do I have any incentive to replay levels over and over to go up on the scoreboard. But as a relaxing, wind-down game, it serves its purpose well. I would say this game was definitely worth the ~$1 I paid for it, and I could see myself getting a couple more hours of play out of it.","June 6, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is an orbital mechanic puzzle game, where you launch your mass around the greater mass, with the slight chance of it hitting a smaller mass, or being slingshot around by it. The objective per level is to figure out where to launch your mass, and have it succesfully orbit around  for at least 5 or so seconds. So the levels can go by quick if you figure it out immediately, but if not, there will be a lot of trial and error, but it can be very forgiving though.

You may find yourself spending a long time attempting to figure out difficult levels. Cons- Can become monotonous as the variety of the puzzles begins to feel less pronounced, however with the introduction of custom levels and an editor this expands the variety and orginality of level strategy.\n\nSound: Pros- The sound effects do plenty to help immerse you into the themery of the game. There is little music to speak of perhaps to this games overall benifit. Cons- for those who expect games to have solid soundtracks, you will not find one here.\n\nGraphics: Pros- The graphics are fairly basic for your average puzzle game however they do a good job creating a solid and immersive theme. Cons- Overall their arent very many assets in this game which can sometimes contribute to the monotonous repetitive feeling the game can provide at times.\n\nFeatures: Pros- The game has a very straightforward set of features, basically your standard puzzle game format. Direct level progression with increasing difficulty. Recent addition of a level editor adds variety to the original game. Cons - For those who enjoy a wider berth with game types such as time attack or challenge modes will not find that here. There are however leaderbordes and statistics for comparison to other players.\n\nSettings and Options: Pros- Has options for basic graphical quality for a wider selection of computers to be able to operate this game. Cons- You wont find much else then very basic resolution and graphical quality settings. There is nothing here for graphical enthusiasts, audiophiles, or tinkerers.\n\nTL;DR: THIS IS AN ABOVE AVERAGE PUZZLE GAME THAT CAN PROVIDE HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT. DOES A VERY GOOD JOB WITH LIMITED ASSETS TO CREATE IMMERSION. IS VERY BASIC IN MOST AREAS BUT HAS A GREAT DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION. THERE IS NOTHING HERE FOR HARDCORE PC GAMERS BUT PLENTY HERE FOR THE CASUAL PUZZLE GAMER.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloofus/recommended/278440/","bloofus","Bloofus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloofus/","60 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a review of Orbitalis.\nGameplay: 3/10\nThe gameplay consists of piloting a shape around other shapes, taking gravity into account as the shapes move around each other. The objective is to not smash your shape into any other shapes. You choose a course, which you cannot change, and your shape follows this course.\nI will say this: it is consistent and accurate. If you get the timing and the course right, you will fly your little shape around for a good amount of time. However, what I've noticed most about this game is how failure feels a lot like FAILURE, and it happens over and over again. It is a puzzle game, but an unforgiving one, and completing levels DID NOT give me any sort of rush. In fact, all I felt was relief that I was done with a level.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nThe graphics here are simplistic, but pleasant. It uses the colors red, white, and black effectively. The one real complaint I would have about the graphics is that sometimes the dot showing WHERE you will crash will wobble about sometime, which looks weird.\n\nPerformance: 4/10\nI do have a low-powered computer (two cores, $100 video card, 2GB RAM), but I still expected something that looked this simple and obviously could not be too resource consuming to be quick. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Hopefully for most people it won't freeze so often.\n\nFeatures: 6/10\nIIt does have leaderboards, a hint system and such, but no multiplayer or achievements, which, honestly, I don't mind too much.\n\nAmbience: 5/10\nThere's not really much of an ambience, but the game doesn't turn you off with music or sounds or such.\n\nReplayability: 6/10\nYou can try to get better times on certain levels, but there's not really much of a point to it. However, this does make the game, essentially, replayable.\n\nSummary: 5.2/10\nI would not reccomend this game to most people. If you like puzzle games and you're not frustrated easily, AND the game is on sale, go ahead and buy it. However, I believe the ordinary player of puzzle games or other genres would quickly grow tired of it.","December 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Why aren't there options to run at a higher resolution?\n\nOrbitalis would be aided by a more precise way of choosing trajectory and power like choosing a trajectory with the mouse and then adjusting it with numbers. Looks like it was designed to be played on your phone and nothing else. Also, there's no way to speed up time. If you fire a good shot you could be sitting there watching it for thirty minutes. That's boring. The game might make some pretty lines but they're not that pretty. If they were bright and crisp it might be better but there's nothing dazzling. The music is pretty generic space tinkling too.\n\nI would have enjoyed seeing this in high resolution and full screen and the ability to zoom and something to see if you do zoom.

Especially if you just need to kill time without really thinking a whole lot!\n","August 17, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your job is to launch a satellite into orbit without it crashing and destroying the whole entire world forever and ever or something like that. It has fairly nice physics however a lot of the game will come down to clicking randomly hoping that your satellite will avoid all danger for a few seconds, which is actually a lot harder and frustrating then one might think...\n\nThe leveling seems a bit weird as it doesn't seem to increase with difficulty the higher level, even within the different worlds. The first level might be really easy, the second one might be really hard and then the next one will be as easy as the first. The worlds, in most cases, introduce different rules and obstacles and thus make sense. I didn't find the levels in any sort of difficulty, then again some of the levels just rely on luck, opposed to strategy, so it's possible I just got lucky in a few levels and therefore thought it was easy.\n\nThe only problem I really have with the game is the inability to switch applications and not have it pause automatically. The game, when windowed is about a third of my monitor (1080p) and therefore is great if I want to multitask, especially as some orbits can last for 30+ minutes (achievements require a 60+ minute orbit!) and is very boring to watch it after a while and therefore, unless you want to stare at the screen for 60 minutes there is no other way to pass time on your PC so you'll be forced to go eat, go outside, go launch a real satellite etc.\nI would admit when you finally get it to launch for a prolonged amount of time it's a satisfying feeling. I managed to place 2nd highest on one of the levels so I'm taking offers from anyone at NASA who want to hire me!\n\nIt also has workshop implementation for user-made levels (and the ability to create your own levels, which I haven't even touched!) and therefore is well worth those several pounds/dollars/euros/bottlecaps it's asking for!\n\nAll in all visuals are simple and it works well, the game is really addictive and you can lose a lot of time playing it. Developer seems really active too, popping into the forums he seems to be answering a lot of queries as well as working on updates, resolving problems wrong. Hopefully the next one will bring better support for multitasking as that's the only thing that bugs me!","June 19, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game does not provide a worthwhile experience.\n\nFirst of all, the game is locked at 30 FPS and does not have a settings menu. You can only swap between preset graphical options with the “q” key. And it doesn’t tell you what settings level you are on- the difference is so minute it’s hard to tell anyways. The real killer is the actual way the game is displayed- the area the gameplay is displayed isn’t in a 16:9 or even 4:3 aspect ratio. While this makes sense in terms of level design, the developers didn’t even bother to put the scoreboard or any additional information on either side of the square game window (this is in full screen). The color scheme is bland and the edges of the playable screen are grey and blurry. It isn’t a pretty game by any means.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, 0RBITALIS is decently entertaining at first, but it gets stale when you have to start guessing and testing for several minutes just to get your orbits right. You’d figure on a desktop game will very little graphical demand they would at least have an option to show a much longer projected path, but you are left with one that approximates around 2-3 seconds into the future. Once you launch the projectile, it is at the mercy of the not-impressive gravity simulation.\n\nI really hoped that I could enjoy this game. But I can't reccomend it. Did I mention it runs on Flash?","December 27, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
