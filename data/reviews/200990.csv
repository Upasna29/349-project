Yes there are only two factions this time around compared to the previous game's four and it's structured in a much more linear fashion, but what the game loses in freedom it gains in complexity of plot and ethical dilemmas. With only two major factions to choose from, neither of which are perfect, the game's universe approaches "The Witcher" levels of moral ambiguity at times. This is a game where goodness is often shown to have a steep price and evil often has justifications which sound strangely good. In a time when gamers are known to petition studios when the ending to a game isn't as upbeat or things don't turn out exactly as they wanted them to (see: fan uproar over "Mass Effect 3"), it's kind of refreshing to play a game so brazen about the fact that even the best of intentions to do good often turn out much less than good.","June 2, 2012","true","61.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

However, I am tiring of the "same song, different tune" story that is going on.\n\nGenerforge 1:\nYou are trapped on an island in bum-hick nowhere with intruders. You have to either join the factions or fend them off. Pick sides, escape, and "win" the game.\n\nGeneforge 2:\nYou are inspecting this bum-hick nowhere shapper area and quickly discover things are not what they seem. Find out that there are different factions. Either join them or fend them off.

Pick a side, escape, and "win."\n\nNow, I know that there is a different plot in the later games since I read ahead. Yet, the same plot is becoming stale.

While the graphics are not quite what most people enjoy these days, the storyline is amazing. The replayability of this game is unparallelled because you can do ANYTHING you want to do. There are repercussions for doing stupid things like killing a main character, but the game will let you do it if you're strong enough. As long as you're strong enough and spend your skill points wisely, you can go to any area of the game you want. It's a game that requires a little strategical thought, and a whole lot of patience.","October 29, 2014","true","55.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/entireties/recommended/200990/","entireties","nepenthe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/entireties/","489 products in account","While Geneforge 3's gameplay is very similar to Geneforge 1 and 2, the variety of the ideological viewpoints present in the game world have been narrowed extremely. Instead of a variety of pro-shaper and pro-servile factions, there are two factions: shapers who enslave serviles, and serviles who are ostensibly fighting for their freedom but are now Actually The Villains.\nThere's no reason to roleplay as a pro-servile shaper - the game doesn't seem to act any differently, other than punishing you by locking off dialogue options with shapers. Expressing opinions in this game doesn't mean a thing - it just matters who you decide to kill. I imagine a pro-servile rebel player character who expresses distrust in the canisters will be treated the same way.\nPro-servile NPCs are now indistinct from the typical Big Bads you get in RPGs, where there's a vague reason why they're doing horrible things, but no reason that justifies it other than maybe "the ends justify the means". They've become indistinct from your typical goblin, skeleton, darkspawn, etc - meaningless beings that exist solely for the player character to come in and destroy with righteous protagonist fury.\n\nThis game suffers from the same problems the last two did, too: the ideology of the factions seems entirely skin deep. You can't, say, probe a servile leader about what I perceived as a ruling class within the servile faction, and you can't ask the head shaper in this game why sympathy for serviles is considered anathema to the ~shaper way~. There is no way to learn more about or even influence a faction's politics - as soon as you get to the second island, you've seen all there is to see, and what you see is what you get - the narrative doesn't do anything interesting with faction politics.\n(This isn't a gripe I have with Geneforge 3 in particular - it's a disappointing thing that, as far as I can tell, is common to many Spiderweb Software games. It's just more noticeable in Geneforge.)\n\nI've never really played Spiderweb Software games for the combat - I enjoy the story, and exploring the big, nuanced worlds. The total simplification of factions and faction politics removes one of the most compelling parts of the Geneforge series, and I hope the later titles in the series bring back the ideologically distinct factionalism that made Geneforge 1 and 2 so great.\nHaving the choice of fighting for the serviles, who want emancipation from slavery but will do so by killing innocent non-shapers with hordes of rogue monsters, or the shapers, who fight against those monsters while mistreating and oppressing serviles just isn't that fun for me. "Choose the side that is the objective lesser evil" does not make a compelling or entertaining narrative for your video game. It just looks like a desperate attempt to make a "morally grey" world. At least, that's just my opinion!","February 11","false","32.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimKnight/recommended/200990/","JimKnight","Dangeresque","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimKnight/","92 products in account","Short description: Baldur's Gate meets Pokemon.\n\nLong description: Geneforge 3 is an amazing strategy RPG made mostly by one man: Kyle Vogel. Kyle makes most of the games for Spiderweb almost single-handedly, with occasional help from other devs. The Geneforge series is probably the best game series Kyle has ever made. Geneforge 3 is my favorite (And one of the few I've played so far) I bought the entire series less than a week ago and I do not regret it one bit. In this game, you play as a special wizard known as a "Shaper". You have the ability to forge monsters using your very mystical essence. You can sink points into specific stats to make one really strong monster, or just have a small batallion of weaker monsters in order to overwhelms your foes. The game is all about strategy, though sometimes rushing forwards without thinking will grant victory.\n\nGeneforge lets you choose from three classes, which are your typical Warrior, Ranger, and Mage classes. The game also boasts an amazing story that will probably take you 40-50 hours to complete. As you can see, I still haven't completed it yet. I'm still on the second island and I'm probably only 25% done the game as this point. Spiderweb makes some massive games and they always have great stories throughout. Geneforge features rather dated graphics and no soundtrack though. Again, that's typical with Spiderweb games. The graphics may be meh, but the gameplay makes up for it. And despite lacking a soundtrack, the game makes up for it with some great ambient sounds whilst exploring.\n\nI highly reccomend getting this game, it's currently only 4 dollars for the entire package. I reccomend starting with this one though, it's one of the less difficult of the 5 and is a good starting point. Summoning monsters and having them fight for you is the real draw of the game and you'll spend hours upon hours trying to master your Shaping skills and create the perfect minions. Just a warning, if you decide to break cannisters in order to attain more powers only break 6. Trust me, you'll thank me later. Enjoy, and if you like Geneforge I recomend trying Spiderweb's newest game, Avernum 2: Crystal Souls.","March 21, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is improvement in lighting and shadowing effects.\nControl: Nice and clear tutorial (a bit longer than the 2 previous games for added dramatic effect), fixed key binding.\nReplayability: Medium\n\n\nSurprise! Another cliche opening: Your school got attacked and you a Loyal Shaper are determinated to get revenge on the culprit... are you not? In the practice is up to the player to get revenge or to become a traitorous, despicable turncoat Rebel. (This review may be somehow a little biased)\nI don't like this game as much as the previous 2 because of the narrative. It feels more coercive, you should become a Rebel, that is the right thing to do. But I didn't feel like it. I'm a good old Shaper, not Rebel scum.\nWhat I like about this game is that it made me angry. Is well written, firmly nested in a deep lore. The player knows everybody's reasons and everybody's actions and most of the time the not so subtle moral undertones will insist that the Shaper ways are Wrong. But are they, really?\n\nThings I learned:\n-Rebels are mass murderers scum.\n-Rebels don't care for civilians.\n-Rebels should be KOS.\n\ncontinued in Geneforge 4 review","November 9, 2015","true","60.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The game is split up into a series of islands, so the story progresses linearly and you're not as likely to skip huge, huge sections while searching for the next piece of progress.  It's a little cookie-cutter, and he doesn't introduce any new enemies or character models that weren't part of the previous games.\n\nThat said, it does do a good job of ensuring there's almost always multiple routes to accomplish most tasks -- there's usually a trap-heavy sneaky route, and a fighting-heavy route, and sometimes there's talkative options that let you bypass things through conversation instead.  Note that this is completely separate from the faction system, which is also fairly full-fledged again.\n\nPlotwise, the things from game 1 and 2 pop up again, causing more trouble in a new place.  The conflict is heating up massively, and for once it doesn't feel like the Shapers are in full control of things.  Towards the end there's some talk of Ur-drakons, though I didn't see one in action.  Maybe in the next game?  The final cutscene was surprisingly satisfying, considering I'd started to get a little fatigued of the clear-every-map / dump loot / clear more map / dump loot cycle, and it's drawn me in enough I might start in on the next game right away.\n\nIf you played the first two and are thinking about continuing the series, you may as well, because it's more of the same.  If you haven't played Geneforge 1 and 2, you could probably play this game first without much difficulty, because there's a different protagonist in each game, and they only hear of eachothers' exploits in the vaguest sense.","December 5, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
