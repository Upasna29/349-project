In Fingered you're give four clues by a crime victim and you have to determine who's guilty of the crime. Whoever you believe is guilty is sent to the electric chair and executed! In case you hadn't guessed, not exactly a family friendly game.\n\n+Great art style which fits the game perfectly\n+It's pretty damn funny, particularly when you look up people on the crime database and it assigns them a crime as well as a punishment\n+Very good criminal variety, in an hour of gameplay I don't think I've seen the same criminal twice\n+Quite a lot of different victims, each with their own unique characteristics\n+As well as written clues from the victim for the criminal's appearance the criminals' names also provide clues sometimes\n+After fingering a criminal the game shows you the front page of the next day's newspaper (including the news of the execution) and they're rather amusing, though they do get repeated\n+A few of the victims require you to finger a criminal in a certain amount of time otherwise a random one is chosen for you adding a nice challenge every so often\n+For an hour or two of entertainment (much more if you want to get all the achievements) it's well worth the small asking price\n+Great sound effects and a good soundtrack both of which fit in with the feel of the game rather well\n\n+/-I found some of the clues to be a little too ambiguous, such as "I'm positive he was light" (either meaning skin tone or body weight) though others may like the added challenge\n\n-No fullscreen and using Alt+Enter causes the game to crash\n-It does begin to feel repetitive quite quickly but considering the price that isn't too bad\n-Sometimes the spotlights don't appear in the right place, it's not game breaking but it is rather frustrating\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing (8.5/10)\n\nWith a great art style, lots of humour and lots of criminal variety, Fingered is not one to pass up on, particularly at such a low price. If you're a fan of Edmund's other games or you're just looking for an amusing time waster then do yourself a favour, get Fingered!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","August 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 273 of 319 people (86%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","86","273","319","20","13"

I think that they don't know how fantastic this game is. There are haters out there who don't know the concept of "marketing" and try to discredit this game just because they are making a "dirty" joke (or maybe not and it's just in our heads).

It's not easy but you will get used to it, look up for guide online if english is not your first language or you don't understand some word you have found.\n\nPlease, don't blame a game just because you are not Sherlock Holmes.

I think its speaks volumes when the biggest positive quality of a game, is the title's ability to make immature people laugh.\n\nHonestly, you don't expect much with a full release price of $2 but I was still a little let down. The gameplay became very repetitive in only 35 minutes played. There isn't much in the way of progression other than learning some of the traits of the people giving you hints, they all use unique words to describe the same characteristics. Characters are randomly generated except for the odd "special" character, picking them will grant an achievement the first time, and if you're lucky a continue because they're seemingly always innocent.  The criminal database never seems to pull up the correct name, its only purpose is to deliver some randomly generated "humor" like "HUMPING BLACK PEOPLE - 100 YEARS IN PRISON" (Thats straight from the first file I pulled up.)\n\n\nIf you're really looking to blow $2 for something thats different by all means, just go in with lowered expectations. Its really on par with a quickly made flash game and has no real depth. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by the value of similarly priced games on steam, but I was hoping for a little more. That all being said, I can justify the price to myself as a tip for Edmund, I'm a really big fan of his other works.

You basically get a bunch of randomly generated faces, and four clues, and have to finger one person (in an accusatory, not sexual way) that fits the witness' description. It's basically a digital, more disturbing version of that old game "Guess Who". Only Con I can note so far is that the game won't fullscreen.\n\nIf you're a fan of Edmund McMilen and can spare $2, buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/384360/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","A lot more fun than I expected!\n\nI heard the echo bouncing off the walls of the Steam community that one of my favourite game developers, Edmund Mcmillen, had released a new game on Steam. Of course, I had to take a gander.\nI knew that Edmund had been working on several things, including The Binding of Isaac Rebirth and Mewgenics (which I can’t wait for!) so I was a little surprised to hear that something completely random (or at least to me) had come out of the woodwork.\n\nLooking at the trailer and the price, I kind of had the impression that this would be a “mini-game” type of thing that I would likely play for five minutes and never touch again. A little, but not entirely, like the little games that were in “The Basement Collection” also by Edmund.\n\nTo my surprise this game was actually more addictive than I thought it would be.\nThe foundation of this game being that you’re given a line-up of suspects and a witness that will give you four hints as to who the criminal is. You have to narrow down the suspects and “point the finger” at which you think is guilty. This results in that suspect being executed and if you’re right, you move onto the next case. The aim of the game assumingly being to get as far as you can without murdering someone innocent.\n\nSeeing as I thought I would barely spend 8 minutes on this game, so far I’m 8 hours in and 88% complete with the game. I have technically “finished” the game, but I’m going to try and 100% it. Most of the achievements being mile stones in how far you get or for executing special characters that come up in the line ups.\n\nThe mechanics of this game is quite easy to figure out after a while and you will really pick up a knack for finding what you are looking for. 8 hours in and I already feel like a pro! (How sad)\n\nEdmund’s usual art style which I know I love is used in this game and that always makes the games he released all the better to me.\n\nAll in all I think it’s a pretty alright game. If I wasn’t such a big Edmund fan I honestly doubt if I would have bought it, but in my opinion it isn’t too bad of a game for the price. It’s something small to sink into when you can’t really be bothered for the big, engrossing and time consuming games.\n\nUPDATE: At 10 hours in I managed to 100% the game. The last two achievements I needed were for beating the game without the automatic second chance you get when failing once, and executing one of the special characters that randomly come up in the line ups. I was expecting the achievement for beating the game without the continue to be a lot more tedious then it was. In honesty, once you learn the characteristics well enough it’s not too bad finishing without fail. However, I think most of those additional hours was spent on me trying to get the special character I needed to appear.\n\nI also decided to read through other reviews for this game, of which a lot that I read seemed to have been negative. Most of the negativity seemed to surround the clues and how “vague” they are. I would just say that you just need to keep in mind that each clue adds or rules out a certain “look” that has been drawn onto the character. Once you figure what things are associated with, you’re fine. It’s also randomly generated, so you can get some pretty ridiculous combinations.\n\n\nTL;DR : It’s more fun than it may seem, weirdly addictive, easy to get used to and a fun time killer. I’d say to try it. It’s cheap, why not?","August 23, 2015","true","10.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","24","31","6","5"

This is no exception, either. Honestly, the team should charge more for this, but lol 1.87$ is funny too (187 is the Los Angeles police code for homicide, I believe).\n\nThis title is best described as a mash-up of Mike Tyson's Punchout and Guess Who (the boardgame). There is a non-random series of witnesses that all have their own quirks. For example, some only tell clues once. Some tell half-truths. Some have a time limit attached. You need to choose from a lineup of semi-random crooks. The appearance and names of the members in the lineup help you use the clues you are given to spot the guilty party. You get one continue.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome artwork from the legendary Edmund\n+Great music from Ridiculon\n+Mathias is back!\n+Addicting gameplay that rewards knowledge - it feels impossible at first, but like an onion skin, you peel layers back and it becomes easier and easier\n+Its way too cheap\n\nCons:\n-The non-random nature most likely limits replayability, but I have not finished the game yet, so who knows what is in store\n-The game has no replay value after you finish it.

That being said, I feel it's unfair for people to point this out as being impossible to notice; as once you do, you will always nail that visual clue down.  I actually find it hard not to make it to day 10+, where the game does start to become difficult.\n\nLooking messy will always have that person having disheveled hair, or a snotty nostril; for example.  Once you get that down, the curveballs are what will usually get you.  A good example is on one of the later days, a character speaks almost in gibberish for the clues.\n\nUnfortunately, Papers Please has done this type of game far better than this in terms of not only visual but textual clues; and as a game as a whole.  It's not a bad game, but considering who made it, (Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy!) it's quite disappointing; even despite its low price tag.","August 25, 2015","false","10.9"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","26","38","2","0"

The only thing that stays the same from game to game is the witnesses themselves, each of which has a personality characteristic that adds flavor to their descriptions; for instance, one's a racist.\n\nOverall the game is really fun and I think it's a great buy for $1.87.

Now that I've fulfilled the bargain I've made with the entity representing the platonic ideal of childish gutter humor, let's talk about Fingered.\n\nEver play that board game, Guess Who?  Of course you have.  Just open up your mental filing cabinet, flip past all the childhood trauma that's made you the lovable misanthropic troglodyte you are today (just me?), and find the spot you put all the things that happened but have had as much impact on your development as a fruit fly's flaccid anatomy brushing past your ear.  Look next to the troll dolls, subsection: gradeschool recess rainouts.  Trust me, that's when you played Guess Who.\n\nIf for some reason, you never played Guess Who and were greatly affected by troll dolls:\n\n1. Please don't message me, you poof-haired freak.\n\n2. You weren't missing much.  Guess Who is a formalized version of 20 questions, where you and an opponent have a gallery of charicatures and you each have to deduce a specific portrait from the lineup by asking yes or no questions of your opponent to narrow down the pool.\n\nAnyway, Fingered is the computer version of that except you're playing against an opponent that is somehow even more unreliable than a five year-old you.\n\nSo why am I still giving Fingered my best Fonzie hands?  Well, the whole game has a grimy surrealism about it, like a drunk hobo telling you about the time he was abducted by aliens.  It's totally unreliable, and near impossible to make out any truth that might be in there, but entertaining all the same.\n\nUnreliability is an important concept to Fingered.  See, the hint-givers in Fingered treat the game as fairly as I treat troll doll aficionados.  Some of their statments will be absolutely true, others only possibly true, some hints can never be repeated, and some are delivered by means of putting the English language through a blender and just passing you whatever tasty looking chitlins the witness gloms onto.\n\nCombine these and other logical peculiarities with the weird art style you'll recognize from The Binding of Isaac and you'll find fingering others is a challenging but pleasurable experience.  (And now my dark pact is complete)\n\nSo why did I almost thumb this one down?\n\nYes, yes I did so almost throw Fingered into the deep, dark hole with the others.  (That's a bonus manual stimulation joke for those of you keeping score at home)\n\nBecause it's a short and very simple game that could've been a flash game?  No.  Those are points in its favor as far as I'm concerned.  It's a good game to play when you need to kill ten minutes.  It's like Minesweeper but visually interesting.  And that's why it gets more cred than a flash game.  That and its macabre humor is enough to keep me smiling so that I feel it's earned its two bucks.  I mean, come on.  You have power of life and death over a bunch of troll-doll looking wierdos dependent upon your mad Guess Who cred.\n\nNo.  What makes me want to thumb this down is how broken and rushed the game feels.  Almost all of the levels can be solved once you figure out what statements apply to which randomly generated portrait features.  However, I've had moments where clearly bald people were the guilty party when given "not bald" as a reliable clue, a thin guilty party with a fat clue, etc.  Likewise, even as exaggerated as it is, the art style fails to communicate some important things.  For instance, it's almost impossible to tell whether a short character is thin or fat because their face and arms completely obscure their body type.\n\nI guess you're supposed to overlook these things as quirks of the random generation.  But it gets my goat every time I have to restart because the game decides its relation to logic is about as firm as a house made of noodles in a boiling rain storm.\n\nAnd I say it feels rushed, not just because of these logical incongruities, but also because it's lacking some very basic features I expect in a paid release.  (For the record, that's not a manual stimulation joke, but it's certainly hanging around the same skeevy hotel room)\n\nThe game only runs windowed in a set resolution, which is some nasty sweaty balls, that is.  Also, I'm always a bit peeved when I have to adjust my Windows volume instead of having an in-game option.\n\nFingered: you will experience brief pleasure as well as some disappointment and shame.  Just like all my first dates.\n\nGoodnight everyone!","August 20, 2015","true","5.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","8","12","9","3"

I really should have done a bit more research into this game, and probably shouldn't have expected anything much from a $2 game.  None the less, I was very dissapointed.\n\nIn Fingered, you play some sort of detective (as well as the judge, jury, and exocutioner in a sense) who's job it is to "Finger" the guilty party out of a lineup of suspects.  You are aided by an eyewitness, who gives you 4 descriptions of the perp.  e.g. "They were definately a lardass" or "I think they looked like me".  That's the whole game.  You choose the guy who looks most like the description.\n\nI feel like what I dislike about this game is the very thing that would make some people like it.  The suspects all look ridiculous, and the descriptions can be hard to understand at times.  Which I suppose is the "joke." Sometimes the witness will describe them as ugly.  They're all ugly.  Sometimes the witness will describe them as cute.  None of them are cute.  I realize that the descriptions are meant to indicate one specific feature of the individual, but it can be frustrating to figure out which.  This is especially true because you lose all progress after 2 wrongful exocutions, and the gameplay isn't anywhere near deep enough to justify much replay.\n\nUltimately, though, if you're convinced you are a member of the niche this game is targeting, whatever.  Go for it.  It's only $2, after all.","August 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

You're a person behind a police line who has to identify (or "finger") suspects based on witness descriptions. The value of their descriptions can vary: Witnesses can be direct, vague, unreliable, prejudiced, pressed for time, dying, and any number of other modifiers to make your job more difficult. Suspect appearances are randomly generated, which only adds to the chaos.\n\nNo two games of Fingered are alike, and every new day presents unique deductive challenges. In this way, Fingered shares similarities with The Binding of Isaac; while Fingered can be beaten in 25 minutes (or less if you're insane), its replayability is very high.\n\nI've gotten over 5 hours of gameplay out of Fingered so far, which is excellent considering the game only costs $1.87.

It's got so much variation, so it stays interesting every playthrough. I thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\nMany others have expressed their dislike of the style of game, they felt the hints were too archaic, the game too repetitive. Those people all have under an hour played..... They didn't even give the game a try. They didn't try to learn how to play the game, instead wanting to be carried through everything. This is meant to be a puzzle, kind of simulation type of game. If a witness comes in and describes a suspect the exact same way as a different witness, then where does human individuality come into play? Fingered plots you in a position where you've gotta identify subjective descriptions, and differentiate between strict, disambiguous opinions and those that make you think about whose family you're about to ruin.\n\nFingered is a solid game! It's not Super Meat Boy, it's not Isaac, it's just Fingered.

Each day (there are 21 in all) you will be presented with a witness to a crime that will give a few clues to the criminal they saw and you have to deduce which of those present in the lineout is the one they mean. At which point you finger them and pull the lever to electrocute them, at which point it will show you the next days newspaper showing whether you go the correct guy.\n\nInitially it seems very difficult, as the descriptions often seem overly vague - for example if you get told the criminal was ugly that seems like it doesn't help at all, as they all seem ugly. As you get the wrong guy over and over you will work out which visual clues match which descriptions however (or you can short circuit the process and use one of the guides which describes what each graphical element of the person tells you about them), and pretty soon you can zip through all the early easy days with simple clues, no time limits and few people in the lineout to the later days where things get more challenging as you try to get that perfect run of 21 sizzling criminals.\n\nThere isn't a huge amount of depth here, but it is a fun little time waster for a while once you get a grasp on the terminology used by the various witnesses.","December 26, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You have a couple of clues to work with. Each suspect has a few attributes that are randomly generated. There's some clicking and some music and noises and stuff. The terms "flash game" and "newgrounds" are probably apt.\n\nInterestingly, I found that this becomes a lot easier the more you play (duh) but it starts to feel like a gut feel - the game moves a lot faster after your first few attempts, and you find yourself easily flying through rounds, looking for the special characters and appreciating the distinctive art style.\n\nHonestly, though, the best reason I have to get this is to support guys like Ed McMillen - they're the reason we can continue to have games that aren't simply re-skins of the previous edition with a $60 price-tag. Ed's games always have a feeling of exploration - usually that comes with a "hey, what's this...ah...yuck" response. That's not a bad thing.\n\nThe price (which is part of the joke as well - apparently it's a police code for homicide) is favourably comparable to a movie ticket...hell, it's cheaper than the parking ticket to watch a movie. And I've spent far more time in Ed's games than I have in the movies in the last few years. Will it pass my "dollar an hour" rule of thumb: probably, yes. Will I probably end up looking at my play time and thinking "ah...time to idle some more Skyrim or GTA...": probably, yes.\n\ntl;dr - Finger that "buy" button","August 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art is hilarious and the music really puts you in the mood to finger.\n-----\nIt's not a difficult game once you get the hang of it. What I mean is that the more you play, the more you realize what each word means. For example, odd could mean not human or furry means hairy. This all depends on who is the witness. After getting the hang of those types of clues and paying attention to the suspect details = easy.\n\nWith each day (or level), the game does get harder, which surprises me! I did not think that it would get much harder. James and Ed did a really good job at making it harder by using different mechanics. It keeps it fresh for new players.\n\nUnfortunately, there is hardly a menu. You can't change the volume and you can't make it full screen. All you can do other than play the game is just type in names to see their mug shot profile.\n\nFor a game less than $5, it is worth it. Entertaining for a short amount of time. REALLY casual. Does not beat any of Ed's other games but does a good job of entertaining me with what it is. If you have some pocket change to spare, I suggest giving it a go. 21 levels of oddity and fun stereotypical jokes.\n-----\nIt's a joke altogether.

The concept is simple: Each day in the game you have a witness (seems to be the same witness for the same day every time) the witness will give you incredibly vague and largely useless clues, such as "He looks like a freak" in a game where almost every character looks like what someone would call a freak, or "He looks like a hippy", which could be useful if I knew what they consider a hippy. Thought it would be folks flashing peace signs, but I was not correct about that. The clues are just not very useful. I get the idea, maybe I am supposed to sit and learn what each witness actually thinks those things look like, but since the gameplay is just reading clues, then choosing someone, I have no interest or motivation to actually put time into thinking about the motivations of the witnesses, if that is what is expected of the player.\n\nThe game is boring, mildly frustrating, and has some very cheap attempts at humor. One of the few games I've ever lost interest in in such a short span of time.

The rules are simple and there is potential for this to be fun, especially when they start throwing twists in later levels such as clues being "opposite" of what is claimed, or time limits.  However, as many other people have noted, the clues are very random and subjective such as the person looking "weird" or "young".  Even in the game it is not clear what is meant by some of these adjectives so it becomes very difficult to play along.  In addition there is only one play mode and all the rounds play in the same order so there is very little reason to keep playing after a few rounds.

I mean, I know that it's supposed to be hard at some point, but it got to a point where I literally had to guess who did it (day 21). If you fail you have to go all the way back, which was not fun and sure felt frustrating.\nThere were also times where I got the same hint twice and I'm sure that wasn't intentional\n\nThe game overall is fun, but gets unfairly hard and is pretty much one of those flash games you can find at newgrounds for free.

It lacks depth. As a detective, you need to "finger" the culprit based on four vague clues from a witness. That's all there is to the gameplay and there's no real satisfaction when correctly solving a case. That may be because the case itself was too easy or that you just happened to make a lucky guess based on the vague clues. Also, some of the clues are worthless (i.e. "He defintately looked ugly"). Well, everyone looks ugly in this artwork.

The witnesses varies, some may talk in opposites, some are timed, some will only give their clues once.\n\nThe clues are unorthodox: What does a "hippie" look like? Or someone who is "messy"? Or a "freak"? There are many details to keep in mind.\n\nOnce you think you found your man, you "finger" him - meaning he gets put in the electric chair. No second chances!\n\nIt is a quirky idea that unfortunately doesn't work for me. It's not really my sense of humour and I was hoping for a gameplay more like "Papers, Please". I played "Fingered" for an hour and after that I was just frustrated. One mistake and you start over from level one. With the same witnesses. Over and over and over...\n\nI think what bothers me is that I have no way of learning from my mistakes. If I electrocute the wrong person, I never get to know what the right choice was. I only get kicked back to the beginning, to try again.\n\n2/10 silly spinner hats","August 19, 2015","false","1.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

I’m not talking about a situation where you have to become Sherlock Holmes and pay close attention to every detail of a person, no the clues are so lackadaisical you can’t possibly figure out who is the perp. Guess Edmund really didn’t care that much to properly program conflicting situations and clothing in the game.\n\n-The art sometimes is so janky you can not possibly tell what you are looking for.\n\npros:\n-If you like the board game Guess Who then you will like this game for about five minutes out of the day.\n\nSure the game is cheap however that does not exclude it from having major flaws and abandonment of options. The game just seem so alien to the Edmund’s charm and quality we’re used to.\n\nThe game get’s repetitive which brings the replay value down monumentally, it is a silly game indeed but not a must have.

This is especially true for people who aren't already fans of McMillen's work.\n\nThere's pretty much nothing to the game but a "start" button and a little computer that you can type character names into. The problem is, there's no way to adjust the volume, the resolution, or anything else. The game just runs in a little window, and crashes if you try to go into fullscreen. You can't back out of the string of missions, the only way out is to close the program or intentionally lose.\n\nYou *can* search for the names of the criminals you execute, but damned if I could remember any of them because they're all messy and randomly-generated. This becomes an issue with the core "gameplay", because even with clear 100% accurate statements, it's hard to tell which of the misshapen figures is considered "chub-chub" and which are considered "monster-face". I know that's the point, but it makes every single "level" feel interchangable. The only difference between days is how likely it is that the clues are actively lying to you. It's not any more difficult to guess who the criminal is when the clues are taken away, because the clues didn't really help in the first place.\n\nThere may be some super-secret meta-game that emerges when you reach the "end", but I wouldn't recommend that someone purchase this game and spend hours repeatedly "fingering" criminals just hoping to find some unspecified secret content squirreled away. I'm fine with *my* purchase, but I'm not going to trump this game up to friends and strangers.","August 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The character designs are too simple and vague, so you'll frequently finding yourself looking at 5 vaguely human-shaped blobs trying to decide which ones would be considered "muscley" and which would be considered "fat". Other times you'll be asked to pick a bald character, and be presented with a line-up of nothing but characters with what could be considered hair.

The art makes it challenging to determine what personal elements each character has - are they ugly, are they hairy, are they messy, are they a freak? It's nigh-impossible to know, even descriptions like "fat" are unclear due to the art style. If that weren't bad enough in a game about determining who is who, some of the clues are too vague so you don't actually know if "he's balding" means he's bald or has some hair (a lot of characters have a little tuft of hair but no stubble around it), things like that come up way too often.

Oh, and it's dirt cheap.\n\nRandomized suspects should make replayability worthwhile but there are some problems with the hints you get every round to identify the miscreant. At the beginning it's easy and fast, but later on the clues are not enough or straight misleading. This may cause frustration, which can not be neglected, even by the dark humorous gameplay.\n\nIf you desperately want an Edmund McMillen game for some spare change, you better get The Basement Collection.","August 24, 2015","false","21.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Still, I'm glad that I don't suffer from the loading screen crash bug that other players experience (although there's a manual workaround). You might wonder why I alt-tab anyways... because the game has NO OPTIONS to change anything. Another big downside deriving from that is the lack of a music on/off switch. This is a big minus to me, because it -being a windowed game- has to be muted in the mixer of Win if you want to listen to music, watch something or play a match of Hearthstone on the side.\nThe gameplay itself has the typical McMillen style we all love so much but lacks of variety. Fingering suspects gets repetitive quickly and if you know the witness characters, finding the guilty is not that hard anymore, so the game has no real challenges.\n\nI will still fire this up from time to time to see if there will be stuff added/fixed, but I doubt it. I hope Mew-Genics won't be that disappointing. The Super Meat Boy/the Binding of Isaac fanboy in me made a mistake, for the next titles I will check let'splays first, which I strongly recommend to everyone.\n\nAn optimistic 5/10","August 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But, the visuals don't look appealing, which I could overlook if that wasn't a major factor of this game. You have to be able to see what the people look like. One victim game a hint saying that the suspect definetly loooked like they had no signs of hair loss. Then the suspect ended up being someone who looks like they have a shaved head. Honestly though I can't tell if they do because the art style is so wonky. To top if off, even most of the hints that are given are hard to interpret. I don't think that's to make the game hard, I think they were trying to give the victims more personality in their dialogue. That just makes the hints harder to understand. For instance one of the hints was saying that the suspect looked ugly. You're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me, right? That's literally every person in the line-up. The only fun part of this game is when you put in the name of someone you know and it gives you a corresponding criminal in the game.\n\nThe game is less than two bucks so if you're still on the fence, you might as well check it out.

Producers had an awesome idea but they didn't create this game like they should. "Fingered" is totally empty: it doesn't contain story or anything like that. You only have to choose guilty man. Idea is cool, right? But someone drew it in bad way.  I mean I like this type of drawing but you can't recognize who is guilty when witness says: "He definietely did not look like my paw". In my opinion the best idea to get through further parts is being lucky and killing right person. Producers wanted to add something new, maybe more interesting than main missions so they gave us a compter using which you can find guilty people after writing their names. It was pretty funny when I typed my name for the first time but faults are repeating pretty quicky so you are basically reading "guilty for praying to reddit" all the time. I don't like this game and you shouldn't buy it, there are plenty better ways to spend those 2 euro. Maybe spend a little bit more money and buy excellent game called "Papers, Please"?","November 29, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fingered has simple gameplay with easy controls and a great deal of visual personality, but will be overstaying its welcome by the time you're a skilled enough detective to actually finish the game.\n\nThe frequent comparison Fingered gets is to Guess Who, and that's certainly apt, but I found that as I chased down all of the achievements it started to also feel a bit like a contemporary roguelite. Similar to how you can luck into a powerful item combination in Binding of Isaac, in Fingered, luck can determine if you have clear and useful clues and visually distinct suspects, or if you're left guessing between similar candidates and hoping for the best. In theory, every set of clues is complete enough to pick out the exact candidate, but the random element is always a factor.\n\nCompleting the game requires a thorough understanding of its visual vocabulary- for example, being able to distinguish between goths, punks, and hipsters, or knowing whether a pair of glasses is smart or just stylish, or when a beard is full enough to count as scruffy. Developing this kind of deep understanding of often arbitrary rules of categorization runs the risk of making the simple, early stages tedious to repeatedly navigate for a chance at the more difficult later stages. The single music track can also be grating on the ears. Between these two factors, the game felt kind of irritating to pursue to 100% completion. (At the same time, 100% completion is accessible enough that I still felt compelled to go for it, so I guess it wasn't SO bad...)\n\nBut Fingered still offers a fairly unique puzzle experience, and enough of a challenge to make an ultimate victory feel rewarding. And it costs less than two shiny american dollars, so it's easy to overlook the lack of bells and whistles (and volume/music options). And if you're a fan of Edmund McMillen's previous games, it's definitely worth a look, even if the gameplay is a big step away from standard fare.","September 15, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fingered has simple gameplay with easy controls and a great deal of visual personality, but will be overstaying its welcome by the time you're a skilled enough detective to actually finish the game.\n\nThe frequent comparison Fingered gets is to Guess Who, and that's certainly apt, but I found that as I chased down all of the achievements it started to also feel a bit like a contemporary roguelite. Similar to how you can luck into a powerful item combination in Binding of Isaac, in Fingered, luck can determine if you have clear and useful clues and visually distinct suspects, or if you're left guessing between similar candidates and hoping for the best. In theory, every set of clues is complete enough to pick out the exact candidate, but the random element is always a factor.\n\nCompleting the game requires a thorough understanding of its visual vocabulary- for example, being able to distinguish between goths, punks, and hipsters, or knowing whether a pair of glasses is smart or just stylish, or when a beard is full enough to count as scruffy. Developing this kind of deep understanding of often arbitrary rules of categorization runs the risk of making the simple, early stages tedious to repeatedly navigate for a chance at the more difficult later stages. The single music track can also be grating on the ears. Between these two factors, the game felt kind of irritating to pursue to 100% completion. (At the same time, 100% completion is accessible enough that I still felt compelled to go for it, so I guess it wasn't SO bad...)\n\nBut Fingered still offers a fairly unique puzzle experience, and enough of a challenge to make an ultimate victory feel rewarding. And it costs less than two shiny american dollars, so it's easy to overlook the lack of bells and whistles (and volume/music options). And if you're a fan of Edmund McMillen's previous games, it's definitely worth a look, even if the gameplay is a big step away from standard fare.","September 15, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used the small balance I have from steam cards, meaning I didn't really pay for this either, even then the price point is quite low.\n\nIf your expectations are a highly replayable extremely polished game, then you will be let down.\n\nSo, what is this game? It's a game full of ridiculous art, and it's a guess who game. You are briefly told about any quirks a witness may have, then given four clues to try and narrow down who comitted the crime. There are 21 levels, and the clues and the culprits are randomly generated. The witness is the same on each round (slightly less replayable because of it). If you are in to the indie scene, you may see some familiar faces as well :). This is all the core gameplay is.\n\nThere is one other piece of the game that is good for a quick laugh. Essentially, you just type in your name (or anyone elses), and it will generate a mug shot, along with some facts about this person. It's mildly entertaining for a few minutes.\n\nIf you're expecting any more than what I described for your money, then you will be let down.

Teaches the player to be observant and how to properly stereotype. Some of the hints or people don't really match up to descriptions but it doesn't hurt the game too much. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to finish the game due to a glitch. As soon as I completed day 14 the screen went dark and I was unable to continue, this has happened twice now and I would like to finish the game however due to this glitch sometimes I can't even get past day 9.\nI would love to rewrite this review once the problem is fixed.","February 1","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitchUniverse/recommended/384360/","RipWitchUniverse","RipWitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipWitchUniverse/","22 products in account",""Fingered" is a really enjoyable game and I find this game interesting with the use of clues each eyewitness provides. Once you get the meaning between certain descriptions (such as "money bags mahoney") it becomes easier but becomes difficult as the clues become unreliable. Be prepared to rethink your decision in later levels when the line becomes longer and you have to rely on clues that are right...sometimes.\n\nI defientely recommend this game, especially for the price.","April 26","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe it's because the Binding of Isaac was such an awesome game, or maybe I just didn't want to realise that this game was made very quickly and has such a low price. Anyhow, I was semi-disapointed. The game itself is only fun for a very short span of time. The best part of the game is in my opinion the artwork and the usual atmosphere of dark humour, brutality and absurdism. Still, even for the price of two euros I only recommended this game to fans and fanatics of McMillen's art.","May 28","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
