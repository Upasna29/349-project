There were not many mini-games.  The scenes are interesting along with the story.  Decent music.  Funky scene transitions remind me of a 70's low budget horror movie.\n\nThis is listed as "part 1" and so the story does not resolve at the end.  It is also a tad shorter than some other HOGs and does not include a bonus chapter or an Unlimited Mode.\n\nEach hidden object scene contains ten secret items (hover your cursor over the start to see what they are).  You do not revisit scenes generally so if you want to find the secret items, you should find them right away.\n\nOverall I liked the game but did find it difficult finding some items--they can be small, and some objects you are supposed to open or move to expose other items do not give a visual clue such as a cursor change.","August 6, 2014","true","5.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

I got it for around less then .25 cents.  I really want to enjoy this game but a lot of things hold it back from being great. One is the resolution issue. You cannot set the resolution to the size of your monitor so everything looks slightly fuzzy. Great.  Its all hidden object play and that is fine by me. However the objects that your looking for are going to be fuzzy looking and they are all mostly super small and hard to see due to the resolution bug. Do not go for the special bonus items they do nothing. They open up the game you already finished. Wow some extra.\n\nThe story and cut scene graphics are fine. The game isnt all bad just not that enjoyable. The hint button recharges farily quickly and thats a good thing. I havent finished the game yet. May post more later when I finish it.\n\nJust finished the game. So many things wrong with this game. Later your in a grave yard. You have to click on blank plots of land to find the object you need not once but 3 to 4 times. No markings that I could have seen. Just random spots on the ground. Great.\n\nThe objects that you need to find in this game are crazy. Here are just a few of the crazy names. Flippo Brunelleschi whoever he is. A gemhorn? What?  Really? It also seemed like they got lazy at the end because a lot of the objects later  on are right next to each other. Also the objects you need to find are super small and there is way to much clutter inside the rooms or areas you need to look thru. The story and sound effects are well done. The hidden object portion  is not well done in my opinion.\n\nAlso the game is very short even for a Hidden Object game. Took me 2 hours to finish.","October 12, 2014","false","1.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Just one hidden-object scene after the other. And they are not good -- there are bugs with not clicking the right pixel even though you pick the right object, and very poor quality control. Too many scenes where you need to pick an object, but there are in fact more than one "gun" or "paper" in the scene. It's not satisfying to guess which one is intended. The UI features a map, but I have no idea why. There is no reason to go back to any scene: you just go through them until the end. And it won't take long.\n\nThe story is mind-numbingly dumb, even for this simplistic genre.\n\nAnd there are bugs. Had to quit the game and restart to avoid weird lighting problems.\n\nTo make things even worse (is that possible!?) it's both short and unfinished. I really hope they don't waste time on creating a sequel.","November 8, 2014","false","9.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/300510/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","This game can easily be called "Bad eyesight simulator." My eyes are hurting after playing this game.\n\nThe graphics are so low quality and blurry, I couldn't make out half of the objects in the scenes. The graphics looks a lot clearer on the screenshots as the image isn't stretched out like in the game. Sometimes I would just click wherever I found to be an obscure area as I couldn't be bothered trying to look for the actual item indicated. I feel not all your clicks registers correctly as I clicked the same object at least 3 times and not until I used to hint button it would actually register.\n\nThere's also a problem that there's no indication whether things can be opened or not. Sometimes you can open drawers or  dig through the ground, sometimes not. As you get punished for clicking too often, you really waste a lot of blind clicks in hope of an area being able to open. Unlike other Hidden Objects games, there's no indication whether an object is hidden from view or not. And since you can't see half of the items anyway, you search blindly for something that is hidden behind something that might not open. Ugh.\n\nSometimes the game feels like it pulls a bad joke on you. You enter a room filled with books and papers scattered all over the place. What are you supposed to find? "Paper." Have fun! Oh, and not just any paper... but the one paper. You can't pick the wrong paper or you get no points. There are many scenes like this, where there's several of one item clearly on the screen and only one of them counts as correct.\n\nThe story was kinda... blah. Once things got somewhat interesting, some character just shows up on your screen and basically says "If you wanna know what really happened, you have to wait for part 2." and that's it. This game felt like a demo for a game, rather than being a full game on its own. And appearently there's supposed to be 3 parts of this story. They should at least have combined part 1-2 into the same game.","December 12, 2014","false","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a pure hidden object game without any real adventure elemets, but the story and flow is pretty fast and it keeps you interested, something which most pure hidden object games don't manage. The hidden object searching isn't all that great, as lots of stuff is hard to recognize, but a hint system help you through that.\n\nBut at under two hours the game is not only far to short, but it also doesn't give you much of a conclusion. It throws a big twist at you and then it just rolls the credits, hinting at a sequel. The game is however three years old at this point and the sequel never got made. So this is all there is.\n\nSo essentially this feels like a demo. Not bad, just pointless when you know the full game won't ever come out.","October 16, 2014","false","1.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Still it can be picked up pretty cheap, so that isn't necessarily\n\nSo it all comes down to the hidden object scenes. Firstly the scenes are reasonably clear and the graphics are good enough, and most of the hidden items are decently placed, so the game is playable enough, but there are a fair amounts of weak links here - there aren't many misnamed objects (the bane of HOG games), but there seemed to be a few with dodgy hit boxes, a fair amount of silly places (pumpkin, stuff silhouetted in the sky, the letter E type stuff). A major negative for me was some of the openable objects, some of which were completely nonobvious that you could interact with them (the mirror for example), where others like pillows would "open" any time you moused over them (but in other scenes pillows were immobile). There are also quite a few places where you are searching for an item that has several matches ("plant" when in a garden setting!), but only one is correct, which isn't great.\n\nIn terms of specific scenes the two screen pannable scene outside the church was an interesting idea, but I found it annoying once most of the items were found as you couldn't even be sure what you were searching for was on screen. Also it and the scene before had an annoying "wind" effect constantly obscuring the view. The UV filter bit was also an interesting variation, although all the animals looked about the same to me.\n\nFinally we have the bonus items - this seemed a bit tacked on and very variable in difficult (marbles, coins, mice were easy, whereas knives, snails and darts were very difficult to find the last few, etc.\n\nOverall then an okay HOG with a few flaws, with nothing exceptional about it good or bad. There are plenty of better options out there in the genre, but it is playable enough especially if you are paying less than a pound for it.","November 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Indeed!\nI have played this game once again in a while, and I have to say, it didn't get any better with the time that is left between those two times I started this game.\n\nIt is one of those HOGs that gave the whole genre a bad reception. And sometimes this bad reception is well earned. The story is cheesy, to say it in the most benevolent way. The HOGs itself are, well not at a contemporary standard, even at the time the game was originally developed. The sound, well another matter that is giving some pain.\n\nOf course, there are games that are worse, but this never is a valid argument for creating and distributing half baked ideas. Furthermore this game can really bore the ... out of you. It is just as entertaining as sitting in a dentists chair with fading anesthesia and expecting the extraction of a tooth. You have to be a masochist to actually enjoy the game.\n\nI won't and can't recomend this game.","April 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

He reveals that he's haunted by her ghost. However, Grendel is killed mysteriously while you were seeing Albea's ghost. You're arrested by the police and escaped custody. It's time to investigate the mystery around Grendel and Albea.\n\nI never completed the game before because of a big problem that I will explain later. However, I wanted to review it, so I replayed it and I can say that the plot is interesting. Them - The Summoning is the first chapter of a more complex story - I didn't check if it was the only game or if there are more. Anyway, there are several twists in the story.\n\nThe gameplay is purely an hidden object game, with an inventory to complete items or to find others. In other words, you will be given a list of items to find. Some of them are hidden in drawers but they're not signaled. And if you want to unlock the extras, you have to find 10 bonus objects. You don't know what they are, in other words, click randomly to find them. And to top that, the items are very very small or sometimes, you're asking yourself if it was really visible. If you play in Standard, you don't have any chance to have an hint. In Easy, at least, after some minutes, it's blinking or being shown. And the HUD is also on hidden objects by moments. You're not really enjoying the hidden objects scenes. The puzzles are just anecdotic.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable, however, the HUD isn't making justice to the them and is completely impersonal. The drawings in the custscenes are also very good. The soundtrack is also good. But it's not really enough. When you see the menu, the old school buttons don't give you any envy.\n\nIn other words, Them - The Summoning isn't that bad. However, I didn't really enjoy the hidden objects scenes. I'm convinced by the story but as it's disserved by many problems... My conclusion is that Them - The Summoning cannot be recommended unless you're an hardcore hidden object gamer.","May 24","false","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It revolves around a single plot idea– a conspiracy thriller with some supernatural elements– but the dialogues are really clumsy, and due to the three-game structure it ends in a cliffhanger that never gets a proper resolution.\n\nThe game itself is a series of photograph-based hidden object scenes, each crammed full of the tiniest object possible, turning it into a never ending series of pixel hunting, where finding anything is more of a question of luck, not skill or sight. The hit detection is also a slightly off sometimes. But on the really positive side, the soundtrack is nice.\n\nI wish Steam had a middle option, because it’s not a terrible game, but since I can’t recommend it at full price to anyone, I have to use the ‘not recommended’ tag on this one.","November 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

(some may argue that is what defines a HOG, but I disagree) The bonus 10 pieces for extra unlocks are funnily enough just to do the same scene again in extras on main menu. The storyline is even more ridiculous and hilarious, but I won't spoil it if you're willing to try this out though I wouldn't recommend this game at full price.","June 5","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
