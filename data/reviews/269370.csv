Controls:\n-The Map interaction really shows that this was made for a touchdevice to begin with, it's a thing to get used to but annoying when you are new to the game.\n- Combat is a just watching the game play itself as you will auto attack instantly and consistently as soon as an enemy is comes close. You have your Manual attacks that is an Uppercut or a Slam (downward) attack but they are weak unless you wait long enough for your auto-attack to build up enough rage (skulls on the top) to make them stronger. This is fine for a touchgame when you have a limited amount of "buttons" to use to not disturbe you visual of the screen for the gameplay but a huge flaw when you have an actual controller to play with. For me this was a really fun draining aspect of the control.\n\nOtherwise the movement is very solid and responsive and you can get a really good flow (wich is needed with combat mechanics mentioned above.\n\nGraphics, sound were all good though.\nStory I can't say much about since I didn't get very far in to the game due to the offputting controls.\n\nIf I had the choice again then I would rather have picked this up on an IOS device rather than getting it here for PC.\nAll the positive feedbacks in this review area fooled me though.\nMaybe I will give this another chance later but not right now.\n\nWether or not this will be helpful to you I can't say. Just be sure to know what you are paying for, the controls are a major thing to consider if seeking a fun little game to play. This is just way to casual for my taste to be played on a PC with a controller.","February 9, 2014","false","2.0"," 163 of 264 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","163","264","3","9"

I must say however that "Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman" looks nice, but plays terribly on PC. Reaper feels like a mobile app and just hasn't been adapted enough for PC to make it an enjoyable experience. I had some trouble navigating through game menus using the Xbox controller support and tended to resort to using my laptop's touch screen for certain commands - I'm not sure what I would have done without that option.\n\nThe problem with Reaper is that it's not just the menus that are mobile oriented; the gameplay through and through feels like a mobile game. The worst offender being that you permanently have auto-attack switched on because you don't have the range of inputs available to you on a mobile device that you have on a PC. This ends up making the fights feel somewhat tedious because you just move about getting your guy to automatically hit enemies while waiting to build up enough "rage skulls"so you can perform special moves where you actually get to press some buttons. The end result is a sloppy feeling combat system where the only attacks you get to time precisely are the special moves, and because these special moves are fueled by the boring auto-attacks interesting combo moves are pretty much non-existent.\n\nOn top of the non-PC-oriented gameplay, the level design is pretty bland. You move to different locations on a map and enter small two-dimensional battle arenas which might have some pitfalls obstacles or spikey traps to fall onto or into, and despite there being some nice art it's all pretty samey.\n\nThe story for Reaper had an intriguing concept of a the protagonist being a sword for hire working for both imperial colonists who burn something called "Fluidium" for their war machines and also working for the native tribes who harness the power of the magic which is released as a byproduct of burning Fluidium. That's about as interesting as it gets because after that you just wander from camp to camp doing anything for money without ever feeling that you should care about the stories of the different groups except to tell them that you should get more money from them.\n\nI wanted to finish this game to see if the story took an interesting direction, but the combat became so mind-numbingly tedious I just had to mark this game as a closed file in my Steam library. I'm sure this game would be one of the better selections available on the mobile market, but it just doesn't cut it for PC.\n\n3/10 would not reap.","March 4, 2015","false","9.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","4"

Once again, it shows. The art is beautiful, but the game runs at 30FPS and has that certain 'slow-mo' feeling sometimes. But it's not intentional, let me say that.\n\nI've played it for a couple of hours now and all you're doing is walk from one point to another, while completing quests and defeating enemies. Quests consist of fetch quests and kill quests. Fetch quests have you run to several places on the map to collect stuff. But it's just clicking on the map. Your character doesn't have to do anything here. The kill quests, of course, let you kill enemies. These enemies range from simple to moderately hard. You'll be using your skills (quests grant you XP and allow you to level up resulting in several skills you can unlock) and the combat system to complete these. The skills usually let you have more health, or do more damage so there's not much variety here, but the combat system is a bit unique.\n\nWalk towards an enemy and you'll be auto-attacking it. Auto-attacking gives you skulls and the more skulls you collect the more damage you can dish out if you decide to manually attack. I wouldn't say it's a deep system, but you have to use a bit of strategy to defeat some of the tougher enemies or if there are a lot of enemies spawning. Unfortunately, it's the only positive thing I have to say about this game.\n\nBecause it's clearly made for phones and the gameplay is just too shallow to be enjoyed on the PC I just can't recommend this game.

The RPG mechanics are wonderful - equips feel unique and useful, and the customization on level-up is very well done. Character design is cute, and the art style overall is quality. It seems to me that this game would have high replay value.\n\nHowever, actual gameplay, the most important part of the game, feels clunky and unresponsive. The autoattack mechanic is inspired, but not executed well. I found myself using unempowered manual attacks for the most part. The worst part of the combat, for me, was that it rarely felt like it was my fault for getting hit. This is hugely important - when you take damage, it should be because you did something wrong (except special circumstances like trading hits), and you should be able to learn from your mistake and avoid it in the future. When I got hit, it rarely felt deserved. Melee attacks from enemies have wonky hitboxes, most notably, and avoiding them feels more like a battle with the game's design  than with the game itself. Dashing feels extremely clunky. The input (double tap a direction) provides too long a window, and I found myself dashing accidentally when I was only trying to adjust my position precisely. This led to frequent dashes off ledges (falling deals 50 damage, half of your base life) and just as often straight into projectile attacks, as dashing does not provide any invulnerability frames. This was really frustrating to deal with, and the rest of the gameplay just couldn't make up for this and other shortcomings.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and there were definitely many well-done aspects, but it failed to provide an enjoyable experience overall due to just a few small, consistent problems.","January 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Billyum/recommended/269370/","Billyum","Orange Wookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Billyum/","330 products in account","Last month Android and iOS users were treated to Reaper – Tale of a Pale Swordsman, a side-scrolling action rpg akin to Rogue Legacy on the PC. Reaper however plays a lot more like a traditional RPG than the aforementioned, forgoing the rouge-like elements of its inspiration.  While it does effectively utilize many rpg elements well, it’s definitely not perfect. However, developers Hexage of Radiant Defense notoriety aren’t kidding themselves and only ask $5 for their PC port. All in all it’s absolutely worth the time and money.\n\nThe core of the title is the combat, a 2d hackfest of the slowest kind. While you would imagine a title like this to warrant flashy moves and twitch gameplay, it has a very slow deliberate pace which can be attributed to its mobile roots. While your movement speed is upgradable as you level up, the game still sports a pacing better suited for a touchscreen than a battlestation. That being said once you get used to the deliberate pacing the game actually tends to open a little.\nWhile we are keeping in mind that this is pretty much a direct port of the mobile title, there were a few gripes we have. First and foremost is the inclusion of an “auto attack”. For a mobile game this feature makes sense, but the fact that it was not made optional for the PC port hurts this title, especially due to the fact that it’s the catalyst of the games combat system. As you walk up to enemies without pressing any button whatsoever your character will be begin chopping away...\n\nRead the full review at Thumbthrone.com.[thumbthrone.com]","February 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/269370/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Don't know how this game has mixed reviews. Mobile game in every sense of the word. In the game, you are this character that goes around this world map doing fetch quests and killing people for tribesman and guards. You load a straight little area and kill everyone on it and thats it. The game never changes. I was doing the same thing from the start to the end. You fight the same 10 different unit types. There are no new abilities, power, weapons, etc. The combat is the worst I've ever seen. You auto attack in true mobile fashion. You also have attacks that use rage, but to build that up you have to auto attack. Which means standing in range of the people that can attack you and trade blows. There is no dodging or blocking. You can use your other attacks without rage but not only do they do little damage, they suddenly don't have knockback or stun for some reason. This means you can't stop the enemies from hitting you right back, since they always do, but you can be stunned by them. So basically you have to stand there and get hurt in order to build up rage to hurt them......because you know, mobile game with sh!t design. The game evolves  by just adding more guys on screen to kill, and having them shoot tons of projectiles, and you dodge it like a bullethell. There are spikes and pits and fire and things that keep you from jumping and landing, and aren't there for any particular reason other than to be annoying. The objects in the background don't even make sense. There will be a tall stone pillar, and if you jump up onto the top of it, instead of standing on it, you do a little bounce off it, same with piles of rocks, because the develops were too lazy to program them differently than the weeds and thorns and everything else you bounce off of. There is no healing. You only get items from visiting the 1 blacksmith from time and time again, but the items don't look different and don't ever change, you always use a sword, and no items make a reasl difference other than a minor stat bonus. You level up and get boring upgrades like increased damage and health. My favorite sign of the amature design is the enemy types on the levels. I supposed to be fighting military guards, but for some reason along with them there were bees fighting me; oh yes I forgot the military employs killer bees to work for them *facepalm*. Or another level I was told to kill this evil bear in his lair, yet I was fighting boars most of the level; oh yes I forgot giant bears enlist the service of boars to guard them.....*facepalm*. They were both clearly done by just throwing random enemies on levels to make them longer.\n\nQuests objective locations are purposefully on the other side of the map, so that you have to run there and back, making the long trek more likely to get attacked along the way, so they can pad the game length even more, a cheap tactic. And unlike any other game with random wilderness encounters, there is no option to run or get away or even die to stop from having to fight the random encounter, because you know, that somehow makes sense. Gold drops from people, but for some odd reason when people die it just goes flying to the sides of the screen so you can barely collect any. But no worries, by the end you will be ignoring gold because you'll have way too much and nothing to spend it on.There is no real story. You got around doing random quests that are incoherent in any sort of plot. You have to help locals and the invading men, for some reason. There are diologue options, but they amount to "ask for more money" or "say no to quest" but even that is poorly done, because you have to say yes in the end to move forward. There is no real progression in the game. I had no idea how far I was along in the game, if I was doing sidequests or main quests. I guess you just do enough generic fetch quests and kill quests and the game finally gives you the boss. It is very long, but in the worst way, because since it's repetitive and boring, and mostly filler, I was wishing for the end badly the whole time. I could maybe see myself playing this as a free game on my phone when I'm bored, in small spurts while im pooping or waiting in line, but as a pc game to sit down and play, there is literally nothing. Every area and enemy is the exact same from start to finish. Oh and random wilderness encounters like Final fantasy, that you are just crossing your fingers against because they just prolong the game. 4/10.","June 3, 2015","false","8.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphaelVehuiah/recommended/269370/","RaphaelVehuiah","RaphaelVehuiah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphaelVehuiah/","594 products in account","This game is a bit of a strange experience for me. I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.\n\nSo it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like "Plot, what Plot?" There basically isn't a plot. I will refer to the character as "The Pale Swordsman", since he has no consistent name or title so far in the game. This may change later, but honestly, the point is relatively moot as the gameplay is so flawed, but I thought I'd mention the story early, since there's little to say. However, enough fluff, time for some crunch.\n\nFirst problem, the auto attack. It does not trigger nearly as much as it should. It feels like the Pale Swordsman is using a prison shank, because you have to get so close you could just about whisper in their ear. Which is strange, seeing as you're effectly using a buster sword, and I'm clearly within range, as I can trigger the uppercut or the slam, and it'll hit, but because of how the rage skulls work, this is not the way you should be playing, as these skills are significantly weaker with no skulls, so you have to rely on the auto hitting, which is less than reliable. This is probably to do with the game being a port from mobiles, but honestly, if you're gonna release a PC version, you should at least make use of the fact they have buttons.\n\nSecond problem, the controls generally. In short, the controls feel strange and imprecise. To elaborate, the game feels like the character is trapped in a world where the air has the consistency of treacle. Everything is very slowed down. More annoying still, I can't seem to stop bouncing off stuff... which wouldn't really be a problem, except that about 70% of things you're able to bounce off do damage. And it is not often that it's apparent this will happen.\nThe thorns on those vines are EXTREMELY subtle. Tangentially, things in the background, like braziers and cauldrons of hot coal should not hurt you in the way they do, especially when they don't hurt ANYTHING besides you.\n\nThough back to the controls point, it's often difficult to even tell when you're going to bounce. Why do I bounce off the normal ground when I'm using the whirling blade jump attack? Even sillier, why do I *sometimes* bounce off the Ground, and even the AIR? If it happened reliably one way or the other, it would be fine, but you can't rely on it. This will be a point later.\nAlso, the Charge attack triggers WAY too easily. Which again, wouldn't necessarily be so bad, since it's the only way to get anywhere in a hurry... but with pits that do 50 damage (in a game where your base health is 100), you end up triggering the charge, when you don't want to. Which at best wastes a Rage Skull, and at worst makes you go down a pit and lose roughly half your HP.\n\nThird and Last major gameplay problem: the Enemies. Basically all of them. You get ridiculous situations where you try (or as previously stated, don't try) to use your charge attack and charge into the back of a charging boar... only for you to be damaged by the ♥♥♥♥ of a retreating boar... Are they wombats? Do they have an armour-plated rear? But then you have the nigh-bullet hell amount of projectiles that are sent around the battlefield... and wouldn't you know it, you have no dodge roll, dash or any kind of reliable defense aside from the jump, which feels you're on the moon... and with the bouncing problem mentioned earlier...\n\nThis got to be ridiculous when I was faced by a helicopter, which shoots seeker missiles... and I had to have an aerial duel with it over a strip of wooden palisade... The unreliability of the Air bouncing I said about? Yeah, anytime I didn't bounce of the air or the helicopter, I ended up falling onto the palisade and taking damage from the palisade, unless I used the charge in midair to save myself. Which of course wasted a Rage Skull, because I can't choose to only use the charge as an evasive dash. Instead, I basically have to use the weak version of the Buzzsaw jump attack to slowly whittle away health. Except when I glitch and cling to the helicopter like Spiderman... then I unleash auto-attack blades of fury, before dying because I can't tell I'm being hit (as it's just shotgunning me with it's smaller weapons).\n\nSo to sum up, nice idea, very flawed execution, tests for storyline came back negative, controls feel strange, when I die I feel cheated. The game doesn't do much to endear itself to me, so even when I try to like it, it just saps my enthusiasm.","February 9, 2014","false","11.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

As i can't simply give this a yes or no is it worth playing. I guess if you looking for a cheap game to while away the hours of your life...then yes it is worth it. But if you like a bit of substance to you time waster games then i say your in the wrong ball park all together find sir...or madam.\n\nIt is a pretty looking game, its art style is very nice and is what drew me to this game in the first place but when we get to the game aspect...well its a little sloppy. If you are using a control pad the two screens that show you whats what is jumbled and makes it a little hard to figure out what to press to do what. As well as the quick tutorial bit seems pointless. At first i though this was going to be a button masher but the joy of button mashing was taken away from me as you simply walk into enemies to kill them.Sure you can jump around like a monkey on crack to get out of the way of the many spamming attacks of the enemy. Or you can spam you very own spinning sword of death move to victory. As i have found be the case of the game.\n\nAs for story? well what story. You are a pale swords man who wakes up in a cave (presumably a grim reaper) and the first few dialogues happens and i lost interest. The story does nothing to keep you with it and is dull. The few times i stopped to try and see where this was going. All i saw was the pale swordsman just sounding like he was shouting at everyone, since all his lines are in caps. An no matter what you say, you just sound like an uncaring ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Though this could be some witty portrayal that death is cold and uncaring and doesn't chose sides.

Jesus Christ. I wouldn't say the game is too hard for me, I just get stressed very easily and this game is by far one of the most insanely frustrating games with some of the most annoying enemies that I have ever seen. After doing entire fights late in the game and getting whittled down to a few health then just barely dying on a red soldier level and having to do the entire 20min fight over again, I've had enough. One of the most frustrating games I have ever played besides Teleglitch. Probably even more frustrating than that game. Everything is fine until you get to a level of tons of red soldiers and then you get to see the game's wild difficulty spikes. It's getting so frustrating and repetitive that it's not funny. The graphics are good and the controls are good but the problem comes from there being a screen full of projectiles and enemies and your guy is just a damage sponge with no armor or block value. You have block value but it only counts towards melee attacks. So late in the game if you don't have the ability that lets you get 1hp per coin picked up, then good luck on a level that spawns in a ton of the floating blue tribal masks, which are one of the most annoying enemies I have ever seen since they float away from you while doing dmg to you. The levels with the red soldiers would take too long to explain why they are so frustrating so just wait and you will see what I mean.\n\nTons of unblockable ways to take dmg, incredibly annoying enemies, and mind bendingly repetitive gameplay. What you do in the tutorial is basically what you will be doing for the rest of the game. The game isn't too hard for me, just too annoying. When a game is this repetitive, having to replay the same very long stage with the same incredibly frustrating enemies gets old real fast. It also feels like playing a Mass Effect game because you will do as much reading as actually playing. If I would have read all of the pointless text in the game up to this point I would probably still be back at level 15 instead of 32. The one really cool point for this game which is really brilliant is that it automatically auto attacks when you are close to an enemy, saving a lot of wear and tear on your thumb. Every button masher should do this. Every single ♥♥♥♥ing one of them.\n\nI got it in a bundle for a dollar and got about 8 hours out of it and that is plenty. So it can be fun for a good while, but I don't need any more because frustration aside, it is just way too repetitive. Probably the most repetitive game I've played in years.","January 18, 2015","false","8.2"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","19","36","3","2"

It's luck based, why? Well fight stages are randomly generated (mainly: travel and dark harvest mode encounters). Also it's very simplified you just go near enemy and your character automatically attacks him, but not like you would normally use sword no no, it's so close that protagonist could hug enemy -.-, there are rage based attacks (rage meter is displayed in skulls) collected by hitting automatically enemies. When you're out of rage skulls it's over for powerful moves, but still can be very useful for some demons spamming from air bullets. Sometimes fight is so intense those air, land monsters/imperial troops/Wilderness  spam so many bullets makes me to wonder if I'm playing casual or a bullet hell game, but easier? ^^\nStory is text based, so just reading, travelling on map from point to point without side missions.\n\nPros:\ncolourful and nice artwork,\nsimple combat system,\nusing xbox360 controller is the most comfortable way to play this game,\nchallenging stages,\n"double agent story" protagonist is working like mercenary for gold for both sides :p,\ndodging bullets, missiles (subjective)\nno broken achievements =)\neasy to pick up and playCons:\nhave problems with locking up my laptop (have password on log in screen win7), this game is locking some keys in keyboard. Had to turn on program keyboard to type manually password,\nIn game music: heard 1 or 2 combat music? After few battles, I decided to mute it and just play music from foobar :P At the end boss I was curious if the song will be different and this game disappointed me, the same combat music :|\nBOUNCING gold, O M G really? I know enemies are exploding when they have been slain but god. Gold acts like caoutchouc ball with gravitation to the nearest pit, end of screen :| it's very annoying when doing loot achievement every gold coin +5, bigger gold ore +25 (you have to collect 300k value of bouncing  s**t\nthis game should be called bounce, or trampoline simulation ^^ everything palisades, camp fire, huts, enemy's head, etc. make character to bounce, some allow you to double jump some not (because of that I have fallen into pits very often), nearly everything can cause damage, that is more deadly than enemy ^^,\nthe same enemies coloured in different colours, so from that depends how will they attack and act,\nspamming opponents: some of them are shooting bullets and then run away as fast as possible and I mean FAST  D:  you can't pursue them with simply running and also another enemy is coming when it happens (eye to eye contact: run away, turned back: enemy runs towards character and spam, repeat it and frustration arise)\nstory should be more complex ***SPOILER ALERT***  after defeating end game boss you go back to the Old Grey Beard house to find out that stormers have badly injured him what caused his death, after slaying those stormers you get ending ("swordsman don't know what to do"). Really? No revenge / killing frenzy? They killed his only friend. It could be done like that [Swordsman is going to kill every one who is connected with imperials and going to assassinate Lord Protector, after defeating all camps, fort, Lord Protector fly to his homeland, swordsman pursues him (new act, enemies, country, combat mechanics etc.) but it would be too long for this game[/spoiler],\nthis game runs in slomo all the time 30 fps, but when someone is joining broadcast the game wakes up and run like 5x times faster, impossible challenge,\nno run in window option,\n\nSome people would say don't buy this game, can't agree with that, if you get it from bundle. Well it's not that great but still playable (for achievement hunters it's must have thing).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraxTheDestroyer/recommended/269370/","DraxTheDestroyer","DoctorSpectrum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraxTheDestroyer/","264 products in account","Pros:\n* The art style isn't bad\n* The small indicator showing the percentage of enemies in the current fight you've defeated is nice\n* The world is relatively original\n\nCons:\n* The story drags like hell and takes forever to get anywhere. After maybe an hour or two a subplot about demons arriving started being hinted, which I'd love to pursue, but instead the game forced me to do fetch quests and assassinations for different groups, most of which blurred together into one.\n* Random encounters are compulsory. Trying to finish a quest and you bumped into enemies? Too bad, fight them before finishing the quest!\n* Environmental hazards are just cruel. Fell down that pit because you misjudged a jump? There goes half your health, unless you bought an upgrade to avoid it! Standing next to some fire? ♥♥♥♥ you, you're taking damage.\n* You can't manually attack enemies unless you build up your rage ("Skulls"). I know the game was originally for tablets and mobile devices, but on a PC there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to manually attack, or at least give us the option to toggle manual attacks on and off\n* Enemies outnumber you by far and it's easy for the game to devolve into being stunlocked until you're dead or bullet hell. Individually the enemies are fine, but the majority of the time if you're facing more than three or four, it's a struggle to cope with them.\n* Airborne enemies constantly fly away from you, making them difficult to fight and frustrating to deal with.\n* The gameplay is essentially the same fight repeated ad nauseum, with the only changes being the enemies you fight. There's somewhere between ten to fifteen unique enemies - most of which are interchangeable - and everything after that is just a palette swap.\n* Fights give you virtually no experience or gold; most of what you get will be through quests.\n* Movement is clunky; you walk very slowly, jump awkwardly and arguably too high, and if you accidentally tap the same direction twice to adjust a fall, odds are you'll waste a skull and do a quick dash to the side, which additionally could be to your detriment.\n* The protagonist's only motivation appears to be getting money, which he has no apparent use for outside of the in-game shops (which 90% of the time won't sell anything worth buying). It could be that this changes towards the end of the game, as I didn't beat it, but if that's the case there's no hint towards it earlier.\n\nTL;DR: On tablets and phones, in short bursts, this could arguably be a fun way to kill time - arguably - but on a PC this game is a bore. It's too long, too slow, and the fights alternate between being tedious and too difficult. Not worth buying or playing.","December 31, 2015","false","6.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","10","21","3","0"

The sole tactics at your disposal are: run into an enemy to deal damage (and receive it), and jump over attacks that would stun you.\n\nJumpin on an enemy forces you to bounce on them, and some enemies cause you damage from this (but you can never deal damage this way). Spiked background elements also damage you, as do those on fire (like torches). In fact, you spend at least 80% of your in-game time in the air, usually uncontrollably bouncing off something. And you'd better hope that the common enemy that's invunerable from one side isn't standing in front of a bouncy background object, because they will be utterly impossible to hit.\n\nThe controls/fight mechanics of this game suggest it is trying to be casual, but between the bullet hell enemies, unavoidable attacks and the background trying to kill you, this is anything but a casual game. Oh, and did I mention that once you enter an encounter you HAVE to complete it to progress? That's right, if the 50+ enemies are too much for you in a fight, you just have to keep doing it over and over until you win (or the fraction of XP you get after death is enough to level you up and you're lucky enough to be given a helpful stat to upgrade to give you a new edge).\n\nIn short: the mechanics are lazy, the difficulty is lazier, and the repetitiveness is through the roof.

This is a slashemup that just goes on and on until you finally give up out of sheer boredom. It didn't have to be this way. There are steps that could've been made to make for an enjoyable game instead of a mind-numbing slog.\n\nStages take too long. The goal of each stage is to kill all of the enemies. As the game progresses the stages take longer. Early on there 10-15 enemies, but the game eventually balloons to 50+ enemies per stage. This gets very old, very fast.\n\nMost of the equipment isn't really beneficial. In true smart-phone fashion, as soon as you upgrade your weapons & armor, the monsters seemingly get buffed to cancel out your strength increase. Armor is especially useless, because I've yet to see it affect the amount of damage I take. Equipment that bolsters the chance of a critical hit or blocking an attack can be useful. However, I'm always wondering if there's a series of calculations going on in the background. Maybe the game figures out my DPS and then changes the difficulty to match.\n\nThe selection at the shops is always random. I guess it's irrelevant anyway due the weird difficulty-balancing, but it's still annoying.\n\nThe mechanics are a mixed-bag. I'm impressed by all of the dodges I can make, even when the screen is flooded with projectiles. However, the combat tends to be annoying. This is mainly due to the fact that almost every attack only hits one enemy at a time. So even if the Swordsman is swinging away at three enemies clumped together, only one of them takes damage.\n\nThe worst aspect of this game is that it just goes on forever. New quests are always popping up and they always require murder. Maybe I'd like to see the Swordsman talk things out. He would speak in ALL CAPS and say something like "I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS! GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY!' and the quest would be solved. There are moments where you can skip a fight or score a little extra cash, but it's nothing really worthwhile or memorable. Also when moving between locations, you're occasionally forced into random battles....how wonderful.\n\nThe first 5 or so minutes of Reaper are kind-of amusing, but this really isn't a game that will sustain your attention for an extended period of time.

Who thought that was a good control scheme? Left analog navigates around your equipped items while the digital pad moves between items in that inventory slot. Meanwhile, right analog navigates around the shops items. L is used to sell items and R is used to buy items. Seriously, was moving with the analog and pressing A not good enough?

Is... I would say that it is broken... More on that later on in the review. I love this games graphics. It got a new kind of thing to it and it is a great game! Now the one thing I do not like about this game is that the games controls and NPC's are not that well done. I am not saying that the graphics on the NPC's are bad but the dmg and the health is too damn high in low level. I know that I onlyplayed it for 0.3 hours and trust me I will play more... but when it comes to the Health and Dmg of the NPC's... It is too high for low lvl. Take the screamers for example... I faced them once... and could not for the sake of me beat them! When there is 4 screamers on you at once... one jumps on you and you are like, ``Hey! I could beat this little creature´´... Short after you realise that you have 3-4 more of those ``little´´ creatures! They deal about 2-8 dmg each and that is alot of you try to beat them all at once. Now it comes to the controls... I love the new idea of a Uppercut and a ``downslash´´ with the W and S but about the A and D buttons when you do that little mini sprint... I think that it is to easy to make one of those, I was trying to run across a long map and when I got there (to the end of the map) I turned around to attack a slime and then turned again (A, D, A) I beaten the whole map or area and when I did that... I fell of the ground into one of the... gaps... or something like that! Now keep the screamers in mind when I type this! I feel like the sword you have a more... AoE (Area of effect damage) to it... I know that I have this ``mid air spinning´´ thing and this when you are in air and then press S to make a air downslash, and they are great but what i feel like that should be better is the W and S attack in general. Because when you attack that screamer and 3-4 more attack you at the same time. They come from mid air and jump ON you and you have no way of defending yourself than using the A and D sprint but if you are in Middle of a W or S attack you can't really perform that. So what I want to happen is that I want the... W and S button to work as a AoE and attack all targets infront of it and not only the target closest or allready targeted to the... the... ``falling backwards when hit´´ thing gets on all the NPC's infront of you instead of just the closest or allready targeted.\n\nWow that was a loooong review! Thank you for reading! I hope I helped alot!\nI recommend this game very much and I will try to keep playing it!","February 8, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"

You can use the commands anyways, but they will do significantly less damage. I got bored very quickly with it, hence my only 0.2 hours in it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/recommended/269370/","snekadid","Snekadid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/","755 products in account","TLDR:This game is bad.\n\nThe level design is terrible, either placing 4 tiny islands of land over pits that do massive damage when you fall in or making the entire stage covered in spikes that only hurt you and then place nothing but flying ranged enemies in the stage that move at the same speed as you do. This leads to you trying to lure enemies to you rather than chasing because you can't close the distance until you run them into the stage wall and then you have to hope they just dont fly up and get stuck in the level ceiling that you can't reach.\n\nDo you like bullet hell games? Then you'll love this! the pictures at the top lie by only showing 2 monsters max on the screen, however the game will constantly squeeze 7 monsters in a small area and force you to slowly try and trick the AI into pulling one by one to you because otherwise the screen becomes a seizure threat as it will be completely covered in projectiles that you just have to soak because other than a passive block statistic you have 0 defensive skills and zero means to get your health back until mid game where you get a VERY limited use health talent that makes you heal when picking up multiple coins.\n\nMonsters are also constantly spawning in. The gauge at the top right corner of the screen shots is how many enemies you've killed. Early on this goes up in 10% chunks, but shortly after it drops to 2-3% per kill, thats 33-50 enemies per battle with no real healing or defensive abilities! And the enemies only get stronger while any power ups you may get are ENTIRELY BASED ON LUCK as the vendors stock changes based on RNG and not your level so you will still see the same low power swords at the end of the game as you saw at the start. Not that I noticed armor doing anything to lower damage. I took the same amount of damage from a enemy with a good chestpeice as i did with the starter one so if armor does anything its ♥♥♥♥ing tiny.\n\nPersonal note, I hate the auto attack system for the same reason I hate it in the Y's series, not only is running into the enemy to do damage unsatisfying, its also a great excuse to cheaply damage a player for no reason. In this game you get locked into the animation until you or the enemy can get far enough away from each other and movement is gimped while auto attacking so you WILL get pounded by attacks you couldn't avoid because the character wouldn't stop attacking and jump which is all the more obvious when you get stuck in mid air autoattacking a flyer and get pounded by projectiles you couldn't avoid. Developers, STOP TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM YOUR PLAYERS!\n\nNot that the controls are very good to begin with, the jumping mechnics are terrible. The double jump is unpredictable at best and sadistic at worse, with the second jumps distance ranging from sky high to character farted in height gained and the reason at any time is impossible to judge as just trying to test I could not get a single duplicate jump height from consectutive jumps without enemy interference. Thats all when you actually get it to jump, as they put in a midair spin attack that to trigger is the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING BUTTON as the jump button, you just have to press it slightly faster than you would to double jump? Needless to say this caused quite a few deaths just because the game would decide I didn't wait long enough to double jump and would send me spinning into a pit, because the spin attack lacks all control outside of moving left and right and you can't end it early, it must spin and bounce you around until it gets it's fill.\n\nThe one decent part of the game is the story. Its pretty interesting and i only played as long as i did because I wanted to see how it went but I just can't stand playing this game anymore. Its a boring, frustrating slog of a game with no balance or skill involved, just massive amounts of patience and luck.","February 2, 2015","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is best played with a Gamepad.\n\nThe combat system is an interesting mix of player input and auto-attack. When you get close to an enemy, your character starts autoattacking which builds rage. You can use rage for powered up player controlled attacks:\n\nDash\nGround Slam\nUppercut\nSpin-Attack (in the air)\n\nYou can use these whenever, though they are much more powerful if used when you have rage. The combat is surprisingly engaging and varied despite only 5 moves. Between evading projectiles, building up rage and judging which attack to use best against your enemies, you have to take care to evade the traps in the combat arenas. And some encounters are quite challenging.\n\nTo give you context for your battles, you will travel on an overworld map, dotted with locations to get quests and shops to buy gear.\n\nQuests give you gold and XP; each level you get to choose from 3 ability cards, which vary from level to level; some improve your attacks, others add new passive abilities, increase health and so on. There is enough difference in those power up cards, to keep you looking forward to the next level up.\n\nGear-wise, you're able to buy swords, helmets, boots, several accessories, belts and gloves. Hope I got everthing. Though I go for raw damage and armor, there seems to be gear specialisation towards criticals, blocking, speed or whichever stats you want to specialise in.\n\nThose light RPG touches are well implemented and make the game engaging enough to keep playing.\n\nI was surprised to find the story so far mildly engaging and well written. Though all quests (as of yet) send you off to kill whatever, the story frame of the many, many tasks is written interestingly enough (warring local tribes, helping the imperial bank scam the tribals and so on), though they nearly always end in battle.\n\nYou are given a good guy, bad guy answer choice, which does not seem to have an impact on the overall story. Though you can preassure your quest-givers into more money or killing them which may or may not yield rewards. It's a nice touch overall, but, as mentioned, the influence of the dialogue choice is limited.\n\nSo overall, I think the package is more than worth buying: Nice art-style, engaging enough combat, polished and entertainingly written.","February 15, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat arenas are all completely  flat, except for occassional pit traps and low walls you need to jump over. All doodads such as fences and barrels on the combat field make your character bounce upward, meaning you spend most combat in the air. The feel is extremely floaty.

Controls are bearable, but come on, this is supposed to be a fighting game, and the fighting is terrible! You have to stand close to enemies to AUTOMATICALLY hit them, risking getting hit... And the character either reacts, or it does not. The only real fighting moves you control are the special moves, which consume the "rage" you build up by standing close to enemies. Jumping does not help either, because there are almost invisible background pieces that will hurt you, like fences, spiky weeds and other stuff. The shopping system is hard to understand, the story is basically moving on the map, while having semi-interesting conversations with characters you don't care about. Collecting money is a pain in the ♥♥♥, as anytime you "open" a chest or kill an enemy that drops coins, the whole money bag just explodes and coins are flying out of the frame, usually right in the middle of a fight. Your character is slow as ♥♥♥♥ and you can't chase the coins either, they are also bouncing all over the place. It's a meaningless grind, the game rewards fighting with more fighting.

It was pretty cohesive, for the beginning of the game at least.  I'd recommend reading  the quests and not just skipping them.\n\nSome reviewers were saying it was fine on android and didn't really need to be ported to PC.  My only response to that is the game really needs a controller, I couldn't imagine trying to play the game using screen controls.  I know there are Android controllers, but more people with PCs probably have a controller.  I can't really argue the fact that it was free on mobile, but $5 full price isn't much for a PC game.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty decent and challenging.  It reminded me a lot of a Flash game I used to play, that's what originally brought me to play the game.\n\nThe artwork was great, I really liked the style and the dimensional backgrounds.\n\nMusic was good as well.  You could tell it was repeating a lot, but I never minded what was playing.  I really liked one of the songs.\n\nTHE BAD:  You have a game with warring factions, but you have no way of siding with any specific faction.  To progress the story, you have to complete quests even if they damage a certain faction that you like.  You are forced into the role of the Reaper, who is a mercenary for hire, even if you don't want to be.\n\nThe random encounters get old quickly, it felt more like a chore to get through the game to see how the story ended up.

Ther were alot of things i really liked about it but the few problems were anything but ignorable.  firt off the jumping physics are waaay to floaty, and once you start slashing an enemy and mid air you have very little control until you just drop right out of the sky. also gold was few and far between, getting enough gold for the achievement is crazy hard (especially since you cant repeat quests) and it had one of the most anticlimatic endings ive seen. So now that those issues are out of the way ill talk about the good. The art is easy on the eyes, not to over the top but not to boring. the game requires very little commitment, you can still make good progress if u only have 20-30 minutes to play here and there. or you can just power through it and mow through armies at a time. the dialougue can be pretty funny at times, and you will make alot of choices in the game during your quests that really make a difference on how the other characters you meet will react with each other, you can also be a hero or just the souless merecenary that only has gold on his mind. also the combat was pretty interesting and ther was lots of wys to go about killing your enemies. so overall i think it was a decent game, but i wouldnt play through a second time. 6.5/10","February 22, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe as a free mobile game for smartphones it is okay for some people, but I played much MUCH better free games while pooping. Controls are bearable, but come on, this is supposed to be a fighting game, and the fighting is terrible! You have to stand close to enemies to AUTOMATICALLY hit them, risking getting hit... And the character either reacts, or it does not. The only real fighting moves you control are the special moves, which consume the "rage" you build up by standing close to enemies. Jumping does not help either, because there are almost invisible background pieces that will hurt you, like fences, spiky weeds and other stuff. The shopping system is hard to understand, the story is basically moving on the map, while having semi-interesting conversations with characters you don't care about. Collecting money is a pain in the ♥♥♥, as anytime you "open" a chest or kill an enemy that drops coins, the whole money bag just explodes and coins are flying out of the frame, usually right in the middle of a fight. Your character is slow as ♥♥♥♥ and you can't chase the coins either, they are also bouncing all over the place. It's a meaningless grind, the game rewards fighting with more fighting.

It was pretty cohesive, for the beginning of the game at least.  I'd recommend reading  the quests and not just skipping them.\n\nSome reviewers were saying it was fine on android and didn't really need to be ported to PC.  My only response to that is the game really needs a controller, I couldn't imagine trying to play the game using screen controls.  I know there are Android controllers, but more people with PCs probably have a controller.  I can't really argue the fact that it was free on mobile, but $5 full price isn't much for a PC game.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty decent and challenging.  It reminded me a lot of a Flash game I used to play, that's what originally brought me to play the game.\n\nThe artwork was great, I really liked the style and the dimensional backgrounds.\n\nMusic was good as well.  You could tell it was repeating a lot, but I never minded what was playing.  I really liked one of the songs.\n\nTHE BAD:  You have a game with warring factions, but you have no way of siding with any specific faction.  To progress the story, you have to complete quests even if they damage a certain faction that you like.  You are forced into the role of the Reaper, who is a mercenary for hire, even if you don't want to be.\n\nThe random encounters get old quickly, it felt more like a chore to get through the game to see how the story ended up.  I enjoyed the story, but it should probably have been a 6 hour game with no random encounters.  There are enough quests in the game to negate the need of random encounters.

The dialogue and pacing of the game itself is alright, although the Reaper's dialogue options are "be a bit of a ♥♥♥♥" and "be a gigantic ♥♥♥♥".\n\nThe combat is... well, you run into things and your guy automatically murders them to the best of his ability. It can be infuriating thanks to background elements such as braziers doing constant, unavoidable damage to you if you stand in front of/next to it, and at the end of the day, combat is really a question of whether you can out-DPS the enemies, since you don't have an active "block" button, many enemies vomit homing projectiles into the air, and the chance to block things may not proc as often as you'd think.\n\nThe semi-random fight layouts can be a bit annoying, too; large pits at either side of the screen and flying enemies generally spells  agonizing torture as you try and entice them over land so you can kill them. Having floaty, slow physics can also get to you.\n\nThis is an alright game if you just wanna go ahead and switch off, but probably not worth full price on any system that isn't the mobile platform it was intended to be on.","January 17, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah! Let's beat the crap out of them! But that's not all! There are also a bunch of really crazy locals who use freaking MAGIC, also both groups have some kind of relationship problem.\nBut that doesn't concern you. You are just a humble mercenary who will work for the one who pay best. No fear, that doesn't make you evil, it only gives you the lulz of beating out the crap on both sides Also you can save some girls!\n\nGameplay / beating the crap out of people:\nThe Control is kept simple and shows great game design. Easy to learn, but difficult to master\nYou will usually find yourself between jumping like a clown, to dodge magic or non magic or unidentifiable projectiles. Also you will use many different ways of beating the crap out of people with your overly huge sword.\n\nThe game if you want to introduce people into the action game genre. It's a powerful 2d-action-RPG game.\nAlso it is superb, for all those who used to play Mario as kids. You will feel the chills of youth again.\nIt will be great!","February 7, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/recommended/269370/","snekadid","Snekadid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/","755 products in account","TLDR:This game is bad.\n\nThe level design is terrible, either placing 4 tiny islands of land over pits that do massive damage when you fall in or making the entire stage covered in spikes that only hurt you and then place nothing but flying ranged enemies in the stage that move at the same speed as you do. This leads to you trying to lure enemies to you rather than chasing because you can't close the distance until you run them into the stage wall and then you have to hope they just dont fly up and get stuck in the level ceiling that you can't reach.\n\nDo you like bullet hell games? Then you'll love this! the pictures at the top lie by only showing 2 monsters max on the screen, however the game will constantly squeeze 7 monsters in a small area and force you to slowly try and trick the AI into pulling one by one to you because otherwise the screen becomes a seizure threat as it will be completely covered in projectiles that you just have to soak because other than a passive block statistic you have 0 defensive skills and zero means to get your health back until mid game where you get a VERY limited use health talent that makes you heal when picking up multiple coins.\n\nMonsters are also constantly spawning in. The gauge at the top right corner of the screen shots is how many enemies you've killed. Early on this goes up in 10% chunks, but shortly after it drops to 2-3% per kill, thats 33-50 enemies per battle with no real healing or defensive abilities! And the enemies only get stronger while any power ups you may get are ENTIRELY BASED ON LUCK as the vendors stock changes based on RNG and not your level so you will still see the same low power swords at the end of the game as you saw at the start. Not that I noticed armor doing anything to lower damage. I took the same amount of damage from a enemy with a good chestpeice as i did with the starter one so if armor does anything its ♥♥♥♥ing tiny.\n\nPersonal note, I hate the auto attack system for the same reason I hate it in the Y's series, not only is running into the enemy to do damage unsatisfying, its also a great excuse to cheaply damage a player for no reason. In this game you get locked into the animation until you or the enemy can get far enough away from each other and movement is gimped while auto attacking so you WILL get pounded by attacks you couldn't avoid because the character wouldn't stop attacking and jump which is all the more obvious when you get stuck in mid air autoattacking a flyer and get pounded by projectiles you couldn't avoid. Developers, STOP TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM YOUR PLAYERS!\n\nNot that the controls are very good to begin with, the jumping mechnics are terrible. The double jump is unpredictable at best and sadistic at worse, with the second jumps distance ranging from sky high to character farted in height gained and the reason at any time is impossible to judge as just trying to test I could not get a single duplicate jump height from consectutive jumps without enemy interference. Thats all when you actually get it to jump, as they put in a midair spin attack that to trigger is the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING BUTTON as the jump button, you just have to press it slightly faster than you would to double jump? Needless to say this caused quite a few deaths just because the game would decide I didn't wait long enough to double jump and would send me spinning into a pit, because the spin attack lacks all control outside of moving left and right and you can't end it early, it must spin and bounce you around until it gets it's fill.\n\nThe one decent part of the game is the story. Its pretty interesting and i only played as long as i did because I wanted to see how it went but I just can't stand playing this game anymore. Its a boring, frustrating slog of a game with no balance or skill involved, just massive amounts of patience and luck.","February 2, 2015","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
