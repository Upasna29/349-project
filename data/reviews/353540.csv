"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuteranopia/recommended/353540/","deuteranopia","deuteranopia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuteranopia/","62 products in account","I'm only about 40 sausages in, and this is already one of the most beautifully designed puzzle games I've ever played. I've noticed that a lot of commenters in the discussion feel like the positive reviews aren't helpful, so instead of just getting all poetic about how awesome this game is, I'm going to try to be a little more concrete.\n\n1. This is a game for puzzle-game lovers. If you're not into puzzle games, it isn't going to thrill you. If you love puzzle games, but aren't super into Sokoban-style games (like me), you are going to end up surprised by how much you love this. It's basically Sokoban-like, but it takes the concept to a whole new level. I will try to be specific:\n\na) The sausage fork is both a tool and a handicap. As a tool, it allows you to push sausages in directions other than straight ahead (and do other things I won't spoil). As a handicap, it constrains how you can situate yourself to push sausages.\n\nb) A sausage itself has two sides, and each push (with exceptions I won't spoil) rolls it to the other side. This creates extra constraints when trying to grill each side only once. Sausages are also two tiles long, which creates extra constraints based on both orientation (vertical or horizontal) and grilling all four parts of the sausage.\n\nThese additions to the basic Sokoban-like mechanic result in a very large design space for difficult and epiphany-producing puzzles. Great puzzle games are about two things: constraints and topography. SSR hits a sweet-spot (or a spicy-spot if that's your preferred sauage type) for a simple system of rules that produces a wealth of complexity.\n\nBut a wealth of complexity doesn't automatically result in a great puzzle game. There also needs to be a great designer who mines that huge space of possibilities for the most devilish ideas and unintuitive twists. And this is what's getting SSR so much critical praise. The levels are designed for maximum epiphany and minimum repetition of tricks. It's a subtle kind of novelty, but every puzzle gives you something new.\n\n2. Can you discover how awesome SSR is within the refund period? Possibly. If you do two or three puzzles on the second island and your mind isn't blown, though, it might just not be your thing. My particular mind was blown pretty early on. I found myself skipping puzzles and then solving them on a background thread as I was driving somewhere. That's a pretty sublime feeling. Another sublime feeling is the sense that a puzzle is simply impossible, follwed by the discovery of a solution. This has happened to me constantly while playing SSR.\n\n3. The art style. I see people calling it "simplistic" and "primitive", which I think misunderstands it a little, because it implies that it's unintentional or the result of inability. My sense is that the game looks the way the person who made it wants it to look. Part of the fun of the game is the campiness. If it were logs or plain cylinders instead of sausages, it wouldn't be as endearing. And if the world and its sausages were rendered more realistically, I don't even know what I'd think. It would probably be creepy. Again, though -- if the art style isn't to your taste, then it will probably detract from the enjoyment for you.\n\n4. The price. I write games myself, so I'm probably biased, but I really like seeing indie games being priced higher than a crappy Domino's pizza. I don't know how many hours it will take me to finish the game, but I've seen people with over 30 hours in it who aren't done yet. A buck an hour doesn't seem like a lot to me, when I often spend twice that rate for a 45-minute TV show. I can understand not wanting to spend that much, but I don't really get why people feel offended by it. It's a market. The seller sets a price and people either buy it or don't. It ends up being either a good decision or a bad one, and that's pretty much that.\n\nSummary: I love puzzle games as much or more than I love sausages, and this is likely to be one of my favorite games of all times. We have entered the Golden Age of puzzle games, friends, so pony up the 22 quid and bask in its greasy, sizzling glory.","April 21","true","22.9"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","49","60","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJDostoevsky/recommended/353540/","DJDostoevsky","DJ Dostoevsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJDostoevsky/","778 products in account","Stephen's Sausage Roll is the latest puzzler from Stephen Lavelle (English Country Tune). It's a"block moving" game and a premium-priced indie. It's also flat-out amazing.\n\nIn SSR, you guide the player around an over-world with nodes representing discreet puzzles. When you land on one, the world drops away into a smaller puzzle area. There you're tasked with sliding and rolling raw sausages around the board in an attempt to grill both sides evenly via the strategically placed hot grill tiles embedded in the ground. Roll a cooked side of the sausage over the grill again and it's burned...game over. Roll it off the level and it's game over. The puzzles are ingenious. The puzzles are challenging. The puzzles are addictive.\n\nSSR sports a raw, minimalist asthetic with vibrant, morphing colors and an abstract soundtrack. It looks rough in stills, but is absolutely charming in motion. Controlling your character is strange, as it doesn't adhere to traditional tank controls as you might imagine. Instead movement is absolutely relative to the direction your pointing in. There's a learning curve, but it comes together and makes sense when you start to understand the finesse needed to "thread the needle" around sausages and environmental obstacles.\n\nAs mentioned, the game is challenging as hell. Even from the start. One nice related feature is the ability to take back moves, one at a time with the Z key. Even after a level fail (rolling sausages into the water / burning sausages) you can execute this option, alleviating frustration when you're stringing together moves to set up a level clear.\n\nI think SSR looks incredible. It absolutely nails the low-fi aesthetic. Nails it to the wall.  All you have to do is look at the Game Over screen to recognize this is all intentional.  Just look at that font! If someone didn't legitimately have the talent to pull off successful visual design, there's no way they'd out themselves by choosing that font style. It takes confidence and deliberate intent to visually create something on the level of Stephen's Sausage Roll.\n\nReviews are saying there's a TON of content on offer here. 30+ hours of evolving mechanics that keep the game fresh with new ideas even late game. Still, a $30 asking price for a game that looks like an itch.io project might be a bridge to far for many. Totally understandable. I opted in after reading some rave reviews coupled with the praise heaped on it from the puzzler dev community itself. Jonathan Blow (Braid / The Witness) described SSR as, "one of the best puzzle games ever made, or one of the best video games ever made”\n\nSo I held my breath and dropped $30 on the game. I'm REALLY glad I did as it's pressing all the right buttons for me. I went to bed thinking about game tactics and solutions. I woke up and got ready for my day thinking about tactics and solutions. And here I sit at work, wishing I were at home executing tactics and solutions.\n\nKind of funny how the best and the brightest of the year can wind up being the games you never knew you wanted. Much like Stardew Valley, I didn't know about Stephen's Sausage Roll until days before release. Yet I can quite comfortably see both placing on my end of year Top 10.\n","April 26","true","17.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I think that the core gameplay mechanics are fun and interesting. The window dressing is fantastic- talking about rolling sausages and grilling them is worth a laugh by itself. The puzzles are simply sublimely designed and make use of every single bit of sausage-rolling complexity the game's ruleset has to offer.\n\nAll of this is a shame because the game is so relentless in its difficulty that it ruins the whole experience. The puzzles start at a pretty good level of challenge- you might not understand all of the rules and strategies quite yet, but the scope of each discrete puzzle is small enough that you quickly figure out strategies and work toward a solution. You'll eventually solve each of the puzzles in the first area and move onto the second, where the puzzles follow a similar formula and scope. All of this is fine until you reach The Great Tower- a Jenga-stacked tower of 8 sausages that represents the game's first difficulty wall. Suddenly, you can no longer solve a puzzle through simple trial and error- you need to develop a plan of experimentation and strategy of attack to even begin to understand the scope of the puzzle.\n\nProvided you do in fact grill all of the sausages that compose The Great Tower, you will find that it isn't simply a one-off "boss fight" of sorts- this is your new sausage grilling reality, as numerous puzzles in the next area follow its newfound scope. And that's basically where I draw the line! I like puzzle games, but the level of difficulty here moves from simple brain-teasers and logic exercises to full-fledged logistic projects in their complexity. It also feels that as the game goes on it loses a bit of its focus- instead of each puzzle tightly focusing on a mechanic, much of the later puzzles require long strings of execution and moves. It no longer gives you that "a-ha" moment without lengthy experimentation. It's simply too much work and effort for anybody but die-hards.\n\nUltimately- although I really do like the game's ideas, I really don't think that I could recommend it to anybody.","April 25","false","5.9"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","36","58","2","6"

I have only positive points to make:\n\n- Very challenging puzzles right from the get-go.\n- There *is* a learning curve - a very well crafted one - it just starts you off high. I'd say the level of difficulty is consistent throughout (given that you are also learning as you go).\n- There are a lot of puzzles.\n- The puzzles are meticulously designed such that they all have very interesting, completely different solutions and you can see how everything was arranged to make that solution and only that solution work.\n- Pretty much every puzzle twists what you know about the mechanics (some will have you proclaiming "This is impossible!" before you *get* it).\n- Every puzzle is super satisfying (to the point I'm shouting YESSSSS after each one).\n- The graphics and audio are very well designed to not get in the way but also add a lot of character.\n- Exploring the overworld is very enjoyable.\n- You truly feel like you've improved as a puzzle solver by the end of it - there's a very definite evolution in the way you think about the puzzles.\n\nThere was almost a point early in the game (maybe 2-3 hours in) where I could have stopped playing, simply because I couldn't see where it was going. If you get past that hurdle, you'll be glad you did.\n\nPerfect for puzzle fans. Couldn't recommend it enough.

This is the best puzzle game. Every individual puzzle is just so damn clever, no two puzzles are alike, and there are SO many puzzles. If you enjoy puzzles, you will like this game.\n\nThe difficulty comes because no two puzzles are solved in the same way. The game's mechanics are the same from the start until the end, involving rolling sausages and walking around, but each puzzle puts you in a scenario where you have to use the same old mechanics in a novel way.\n\nUsually, this is difficult because you didn't understand certain consequences of how the mechanics work. But once you flail around for a while and solve a puzzle, the consequences were clearly logical: how could you not have thought of that? Argh, it was right there.\n\nThis makes the puzzles feel straightforward and more importantly fair, even though solving them may be a struggle. There is no busywork of pushing around boring things that don't matter to the main idea of the puzzle. When you get an idea for how to solve a puzzle, it's quick to see whether it works. When you get the right idea, you KNOW it works, because the puzzles don't have unrelated filler and they're easy to think about. So the problem just becomes having the right idea, which is a LOT of fun if you like puzzles.\n\nI don't think most people are going to complete the first area in the 2-hour refund time. I certainly didn't. That's a shame, because although the first area's puzzles are good for what they are, and are necessary to teach how the game works, they are probably the weakest part of the game. As you learn things about how the game works, the puzzles keep getting better and better until the end. It's an extremely impressive body of work.\n\nThere is also an engaging story, which was pretty surprising! It starts off extremely vague, but later in the game there's more story text between every one or two puzzles. Getting more of the story was a good motivation for solving some more puzzles.\n\nI really liked this game.

Unlike other Sokoban-like puzzle games, I feel like I could solve almost every puzzle I've played so far a second time without having too much trouble, and every puzzle has felt different. The puzzles in this game are about understanding what your options are, and they all feel much more open than other box pushing games. This means that you can't brute force a solution, but it also means that you're more open to experiment with the mechanics (which you'll have to do a lot). After every puzzle I felt like I understood the game better for having solved it, even if only a little bit. I encourage anyone who likes puzzle games, or even those who just enjoy thinking, to try this game.\n\nEDIT: I just beat the game and I feel like I should add a few things, although I promise to keep it spoiler free. Firstly, The ending to the game is very poetic and almost entirely satisfying. To explain it any further would be a disservice to Stephen's work, so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I can say, however, that it was a perfect way to end the game.\n\nSecondly, the amount of thought and planning that must've gone into this game as a whole more than justifies the asking price, and if you count the time I spent think about the puzzles outside of playing the game it come out to about 2 days worth of "play" time. Although I may have gotten stumped a few times I always managed to find a solution with relative ease the next day, usually by considering an entirely different angle to approach the problem from.\n\nAlso, the slow reveal of new mechanics was paced perfectly. One in particular Was so unexpected and mind blowing that I had to undo my moves and watch it happen a second time just to comprehend what had happened. I you thought this game was simple then you are sorely mistaken.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this game is easily the best puzzle game I've ever played in my entire life.

In any of the puzzles, there is not a single thing to distract you from getting to the solution, not necessary the solution, but the knowledge you achieve after solving a puzzle. Every little detail is put in place with great care and has a purpose to it, so much so that you can complete your idea of a solution through finding out what those details mean and where they would play a roll. Many of the levels seem pretty hard or even impossible at first, but the game let's you trust it -- it wouldn't be there, if it were impossible. No new mechanic is added throughout the game, yet the game constantly surprises you with its already rich mechanics, every aspect of which plays some roll somewhere in this game. It drives you to a state where you are forced to doubt everything you trusted, and consider everything you ruled out. There is no hand-holding, the game is filled with as much precious content as possible, every level needs not only one but several moments of epiphany, some of which wouldn't even be needed in that particular level, but are a natural result of the interaction between your mind and the level. It takes your mind so deep in the universe of ideas and possibilities that you forget the simplest of actions once you have the solution. Stephen's Sausage Roll is probably the best puzzle game ever made and it's a treasure full of awe. It doesn't try to deceive you through fancy narrative and graphics, or easy-to-solve levels. It doesn't waste your time, there is no secret mechanic, no secret key or hidden object; everything you need is in front of you. It's as honest and true as a game can be.","May 1","true","30.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I can get how many would be put off by the first few puzzles, but after that initial hurdle (maybe solving some of the 1 sausage puzzles first) you start to gain some confidence and then are on your way to being a sausage grilling champ.\n\nAll the above plus the super charming presentation, and this is already a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles or brain teasers.","April 30","true","8.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is true of Stephen's Sausage Roll, but the true genius comes with exploring its actual *mechanics.* How often does that happen? Generally, mechanics are held back from the player until the game decide "okay, now you can try out the Y button -- it jumps!" SSR doesn't technically hold anything back, but cleverly designs the levels to elegantly introduce its variety of mechanics to you, the player. It's truly a thing of beauty.\n\nJust when you think you'd hit a Dead End, something rises from out of nowhere to blow your mind.

I also didn't yet finish the game, but played a few hours and got through the first set of puzzles.\n\nThis is a game that gives fairly little explanation, seems to intentionally avoid having a tutorial, and has some really clever puzzles. The puzzles start out very hard and get harder. When you first play, you probably won't be able to solve a single one, and most of them will seem like there isn't any possible way that they could be solved. But when you solve one, the pleasure of finally figuring it out will be so great that all the frustration will be worth it.\n\nI understand that there is a lot of trepidation due to the relatively high price. If someone is worried about that, just google 'increpare'. The developer has created and released over 100 games for free, most short and experimental. If someone isn't sure that they want to spend so much money on what is a leap of faith, they could play those first (or exclusively). I particularly recommend his free game "Opera Omnia".","April 18","true","4.6"," 34 of 64 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","34","64","0","1"

Will update upon finishing it. Seems people are reporting an average of 35 to even 60 hour play times if that is of interest though.\n\nSo far it's great, I absolutely love it. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, "Oh wow I can do that?" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, "Oh how was I suppose to think of that?" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged.\n\nBut don't be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. So don't complain when you get stuck within the first 10 minutes of the game. (Of course I also still have much left to do so it's just going to get even more difficult. Though I look forward to it).\n\nI can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well.\n\nThe developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He's mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known titles. But I hope that changes, I hope more and more outlets begin to review/cover this game.\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll deserves it.","April 25","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After nearly two days since release (4/19/16), the store page and reviews really give me nothing other than 1] "play this game its great - trust in increpare", and 2] its worth $30.\n\n2. Being just within the two hour refund limit, I see nothing special.\n\nThe game is not terrible by a long-shot, in fact, its better than The Witness as far as I've played both. The problem is that the price is just nuts - and it's all on the promise that at some point I will be utterly mesmerized and hooked. Unfortunately that feeling is apparently beyond the refund limit for me.  I also firmly believe that games of this nature should probably give me more feels within two hours of playing.\n\nNo hate intended towards the game - but I wouldn't recommend it to friends. With that being said, I don't care to lose $30 on it when refunds are an option.\n\n---\nOnto the review, proper:\n\nEssentially, given very basic mechanics and rule set, you push sausages onto coals in order to cook them. Cook the same spot more than once and its burned, start over. Lose a sausage in the water, start over. Its tricky, but doable (at least first 15 or so sausages in early puzzles). Music is nothing special. Graphics are nice, but also, nothing to win an award or anything.\n\nPros:\n+Controls are decent, and there is controller support.\n+The puzzle mechanic is fine, and is certainly better than something you would find on a free flash site/NewGrounds/etc. (I say this because others have criticized that its in the same ballpark).\n\nMeh:\n=Idea and game mechanic are hardly new.\n=Music is meh.\n=Graphics are nice, if not a tad muddy.\n\nCons:\n-Very pricey. I appreciate that there is a lot of content, though.\n-Not that addictive inwards of the first two hours of play for me.\n\nI think this game would be a total thumb's-up at like 50% of the price, or something. I thought this game was for me, and I was wrong. I also tried watching some LetsPlays before I purchased (at the risk of seeing spoilers), but as others have mentioned - the videos are not that informative because its the personal 'aha' moments that get you coming back for more. I had none of those moments in the nearly two hours I played, and maybe another hour I read and watched LetsPlay videos.\n\nPeace,\n\nFinal edit: My play time rang in around eighty-some minutes. I found that as I was playing, towards the end, I was getting nervous of running over. I realise I had another solid half hour or so, but it was telling that I kept checking. I'll stand by my judgement that I saw enough and made the call to refund before getting too close.","April 19","false","1.4"," 59 of 116 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","59","116","3","8"

They're similar in that both games require you to really think about every single move you make; positioning is key, and movement is weird. I don't expect to be good enough to finish it.\n\nGiven its steep price, I wouldn't recommend it to any but the most hardcore of puzzle game lovers.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970563452/recommended/353540/","76561197970563452","Rico The Saboteur","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970563452/","94 products in account","It is very difficult to write about, Stephen "Increpare" Lavelle latest game: Stephen's Sausage Roll. The first difficulty is that it is a puzzle game and, as such, its core virtues are in its mechanics and in its level design. The second difficulty is that discovering the mechanics is an integral part of the game so keeping things spoiler free without being vague is tough. Let's try though.\n\n\nThe incredible elegance of Stephen's Sausage Roll comes from the fact that from the very start of the game to its very end all the rules of the world are there, but the complexity and richness of the rule set are only unveiled little by little, because new puzzles offer the potential for new situations where new rules are discovered (and are often needed to solve the puzzle). To make an analogy, if you are able to walk on water but are in a desert, you can't know you have this ability. So Increpare would make you start in the desert, then later would put water in a level that would at first feel impossible until you realize you can in fact walk on water.\n\nMy analogy is not very good, because the beauty of this game's design is that, more often than not, it's not the apparition of a new component that allows a new rule to be discovered, it's using new configurations of known elements. Also the abilities and rules you discover do not come out of left field, they make sense and if they might be a little too surprising, levels are carefully designed (with funnels or bread crumbs) to guide you toward their discovery. Something that works with my analogy though is that an alarmingly high number of levels will at first make you believe they are impossible to solve. I can't tell you the number of times I discovered a new level only to mutter (or shout...) "What???? How???"\n\nWhile I am slowly running out of superlatives, it is also important to note the game manages the feat to be both very long and very dense. Those familiar with Increpare's other puzzle games, be it the number of free games on the puzzlescript platform he created or his previous commercial product, English Country Tune (also highly recommended), know his aversion for fluff such as mundane tutorial levels, so these sausages are pure meat from the get go. There is no such thing as a level that does not bring something new to the table in form of an original challenge, so solving any single puzzle is extremely satisfying. Reaching this point is the fruit of a strenuous work of distillation that lasted years with dozens and dozens of levels that got discarded and all the rest going through multiple iterations and fine tuning to be sure that, as often as possible, they provide challenge the whole way through their resolution.\n\nTo give a sense of the scope of the game, I played through the final build in about eighteen hours, while I knew just about all the mechanics and had played most of the levels in an earlier build a year or so ago, so I would expect people new to the game to easily go past the 30 hours mark. It is important to note because, at $29, the price can feel pretty steep for an indie puzzle game, but that's probably less than $1 per hour of pure gameplay and level design meat. Another way to look at it is that it is without a doubt the cheapest masterclass in puzzle design money can buy!\n\nWith this package also comes a thin and strange narrative that works hand in hand with the structure of the game, and an aesthetic which at first seems a bit crude and rudimentary, but really grows on you with its surprising care to details such as weather effects, day/night cycles and a soundscape periodically haunted by some minimalist musical tracks. It should also be mentioned that the control of the character takes a little time getting used to, but pretty quick it becomes apparent as to why it is the way it is. Every move matters.","April 18","true","18.3"," 37 of 79 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","37","79","3","5"

Stephen's Sausage Roll is one of the most carefully designed games I've had the pleasure of playing. It's also one of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever played.\n\nYou begin shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Your only tool is a strange fork and all you can do is move forward, backward, and rotate. You're given very little information, but you'll soon find yourself in one of the game's devious puzzles. Your goal? To roll sausages over to the grill tiles placed on the floor and cook them. That's it. SSR forgoes complex mechanics seen in other puzzle games for simplicity and elegance. You may not see how you can use your limited moveset to accomplish what you want, but there is always a way.\n\nAesthetically, Stephen's Sausage Roll is a succulent treat. Colorful low-fi visuals, soothing accompaniment, a day and night cycle, and an overall tranquil atmosphere. There's also some cryptic story to be uncovered in notes you'll find throughout the island.\n\nNow, as I said before, this game is hard. The puzzle-solving is based on experimentation and your familiarity with the (sometimes hidden) mechanics. Luckily the game is very forgiving in this regard. You're given access to a variety of puzzles at the start of each area and you have unlimited undos available for when you mess up (and this will happen). SSR expects you to learn from its challenges and it's very adept at teaching you new things through the puzzle solutions you discover (sort of like The Witness).\n\nOverall, this game is really something special for puzzle game fans. I admit I haven't made it that far in the game, even with all my hours of play, but I'm excited to see what awaits.

I also made a video to show off the gameplay, which you can see here: https://youtu.be/KbWNYiWCzn4\n\nThe controls take a lot to get used to and feel very cumbersome at first, which isnt a good sign for a puzzle game. However, the difficulty in controls were very well integrated into the (excellent) level design and game mechanics, creating some extremely devious challenges. If you want to sink your teeth into a puzzle game, this will give you a lot more meat than you can chew.\n\nWord of caution though, the base mechanic does revolve around "pushing blocks" (or sausages in this case) and its not too far off from other similar games like Sokoban. Stephen's sausage roll is adding another level of complexity onto a very familiar subgrenre (block pushing puzzle games), making it very challenging, but it is also not really pushing for anything new. And the price point is sort of the sore thumb here in regards to that. From what I can see so far:\n\nIs it a good game? Yes.\nDoes it deserve your money? Absolutely.\nIs it worth 30$? That is entirely up to you, in regards of how much you value challenge in your puzzle games.\n\nI love challenging puzzle games and I am looking forward to biting into this eventually when I have more time for it, but I appreciate new ideas more than I do just challenges, and going back in time, based on what I played so far, I would not recommend myself to buy it at 30$.","April 18","true","0.7"," 27 of 76 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","27","76","0","3"

The mechanic of just pushing, rolling, and navigating the sausage to its grill is intuitive, and surprisingly deep. Recommended!\nPlus, it has sausages, which, as a German, I love very much.","April 18","true","4.1"," 39 of 112 people (35%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","35","39","112","18","0"

What a package!\n\nRight from the word go this game had me in love with it. The opening menu makes me warm and fuzzy each and every time I load it. I sit there and smile, whilst it plays out. Then there's the overworld music. It reminds me of Firelink Shrine in Dark Souls. It's eery, yet safe.\n\nThe gameplay and puzzles are fantastic and will have you pulling your hair out, consuming you when you can't play it, begging you to go back as soon as you can because you think you know the answer.\n\nSSR is like the Dark Souls of puzzle games. It doesn't explain anything to you, it doesn't hold your hand but let's you just go about your thing. Lastly, it gives you a good, old fashioned challenge, which until recently with games like Snakebird and The Witness, were pretty rare.\n\nI'm super impressed and highly recommend SSR. Now go roll some sausages!","April 18","true","4.2"," 10 of 58 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","10","58","2","0"

With the help of a rewind feature and an open world reminiscent of The Witness, what would be a clunky and obtuse sokoban puzzler feels more like a relaxing toy that rewards experimentation and exploration.\n\nIt's almost enough to make me want to see how the sausage is made!","May 2","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
