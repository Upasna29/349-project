The two other characters that you did not choose become AI and help you on your journey. You get to explore Rivendell, Brill, and many more and talk to some of the Fellowship, but your journey is not with them, instead you head north towards the Grey Mountains to fight this game's antagonist, Agandaur.\n\nThe game is fairly short, but there is a lot of replay value. You can play through the story as another character and find secrets that you couldn't with any of the other characters. Once you beat a difficulty, you unlock the next one and you can continue to level and gather further upgrades.\n\nThe scenery is very beautiful but the levels are as linear as ever. Nothing is destructable with the exception of barrels and boxes and a few certain locations where you have to blow through a door.\n\nThe gameplay is decent. It's a basic hack and slash with various ranged attacks depending on the character. As you level up, you can put skills into your talent tree and unlock a few more skills on your action bar. The cooldowns are lengthy enough to keep you hacking and slashing until you get to unleash your abilities again.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the lore or Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I learned a few things I never knew and there are a couple easter eggs.\n\nI got this game for $1 dollar during the bundle and I would NOT recommend you buy this at $19.99. There are a TON of bugs. There is a brightness bug during some of the levels. Side Quests sometimes disapear. Your saves can get deleted.\n\nSome game mechanism are poor as well. The hit box on all the characters are huge. You can shoot an arrow to the left of them and they still get hit. When you want to squeeze past your friend, you get stuck by invisible barriers. The barriers are everywhere as well.\n\nWORST OF ALL...the game is abandoned. The ownership of the game was sold and then the game was abandon. No more patches and no more support.\n\nWait for a sale and see if you can get this cheap.","November 25, 2013","true","30.3"," 291 of 317 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","291","317","0","0"

If you have two friends you often play games with, then you should definitely check this one out. It's best played like that, with this game only benefiting you from playing co-op. Each character has their own secrets which can open up areas that hide loot, and each character has a race skill which can help the other characters out. The combat is very satisfying, because you can pull off some awesome dismemberments and decapitations, and even do Fellowship strikes or kills when all characters are attacking the same enemy.\n\nAt first sight it looks like it offers the typical character selection, being a Mage, a Warrior and a Ranger. But none of these characters HAVE to be played like they usually are. I played as the Ranger, and you would assume he would mainly use his bow in combat. I really only did when there were enemies you could only reach with ranged attacks. The game gave me the option to use two-handed weapons, dual wield two one-handed weapons, or use a one-handed weapon in combination with a shield too. There were plenty of skills which would increase my effectiveness with either of these weapon combinations, as well as skills which would give me new archery abilities or give specific bonuses to me using my race skill.\n\nI feel like this game is a nice combination between an action-based hack-and-slash game, with the looting system of an Action RPG/Dungeon Crawler, and a story and setting which fit right into the LOTR series. I'm not saying the story is interesting enough to make every LOTR fan play this game, but it's also not ruining any part of the lore. It might just be a little more interesting for someone who likes the LOTR story than for someone who doesn't care for it at all.","July 15, 2014","true","26.0"," 137 of 150 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","137","150","0","0"

The game is best played casually a few hours at the time, If you play it that way, and you're a fan, the game will probably keep you entertained all the way through and has a lot going for it when it comes to the story and locations.\n\nIf you're not interested in the Lord of the Rings world, and come just for the action RPG, you'll probably find the game lacking, especially if you put 3-4 or more hours in to the game each go, then the game will probably feel quite repetitive.\n\nThe game tells a story of three heroes (man, dwarf, elf) indirectly helping the fellowship during the LotR story. You run in to quite a few characters from the books/movies, and visit familiar locations as Bree and Rivendell. The locations in this game generally look great, and all the characters has quite a lot to say, so the story builds up well with lots of background information available if you like to listen to conversation.\n\nThe main part of the game has you battling mostly orcs in a third person action RPG style. The combat style doesn't differ much through the game, you can select any of the three characters (but switching between them is only allowed upon clearing a section of the current chapter, or after visiting towns, and is a bit clunky), use a light or heavy attack, ranged attacks and magic/skills. You level up and unlock/improve skills and get better gear/other loot that improve stats, but the gameplay doesn't change that much. You're still hacking/shooting at orcs most of the time.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat, and the levelling/loot was enough to keep me interested all the way through, and combat is fun. Sometimes after getting the enemy HP down enough you get a prompt to use a heavy attack for a limb severing finish that for me never got old. Just as satisfying every time.\n\nThe game has some nice boss battles as well, and every chapter has a few events that mixes things up.\n\nThe game also supports online co op (up to 3 players in total). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try this, but I can image this game can be lots of fun with 1-2 friends.\n\nAs for the glitches: At the final chapter, there was a game breaking glitch, for some reason when navigating the tunnels the game got really choppy and crashed when the frame rate got too low. Apparently a common problem, and the solution was to set the graphics to minimum and get through that section with as little on screen as possible (aiming at the floor while moving helped). When out of the tunnels, restart the game and everything is well again.\n\nUpdate: Apparently the problem is AMD related and another way of fixing it is by installing the 12.6  version of AMD Catalyst, Click for a guide.\n\nI enjoyed the game and will do a "New game+" some day.","December 27, 2014","true","16.7"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","114","120","8","0"

Tolkien but with three characters specifically created for the game as their story runs parallel to the plot of the original books and films, often intersecting at various pivotal points in the saga as they play their part in winning the war against Sauron.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338706253\nThe story on display actually turns out to be a rather good and is very well written and fits quite naturally into the magical world created for the series by Tolkien himself. The game is impeccably voiced with a talented voice cast that do the script and the characters just the right amount of justice. Booting up the game you will have the choice of one of three characters - the dwarf Farin, the ranger Eradan or the mage Andriel - placing you immediately into the believable world that is Middle-earth so expertly brought to life recently by Peter Jackson in his Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The game even ensures that key characters almost resemble their film counterparts so as to tie in with the trilogy. It's a pity that they could not get the voice actors to reprise their roles digitally but I can only imagine getting the likes of Sir Ian, Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchet would have cost a pretty penny, so whilst it does sound a bit odd to have these characters voiced by different actors they do a sterling job nonetheless.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338705270\nWar in the North plays out like any traditional hack n' slash title on the market and offers players the chance to co-op with all three major characters. Playing this in co-op, both myself and my co-op partner found it to be a blast. It's for the most part well made and it looks rather good. Some have complained about imbalances between the three main protagonists (something that doesn't really bother me in the slightest and was certainly only marginally noticeable) and I have heard that the game repeatedly crashes on AMD hardware so be warned about this one if you plan on picking this up. There are also some game crunching bugs on display that sometimes made us have to restart a section because one of us either got locked out an area or were blocked by some invisible wall. Thankfully it was not large swathes of the game we needed to repeat before continuing with the journey.\n\nI had a rather enjoyable time with this release from Snowblind Studios which echo's their previous effort , Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, to perfection. The game is also the perfect length for a game of this nature never outstaying its welcome either by running at a pert 14 hrs before coming to an end. I highly recommend you get some friends in on the action with this one as it can be a lot of fun with the right mates. I found Lord of the Rings: War in the North to be an entertaining diversion and whilst it certainly was never meant to win any awards, what it does - it does admirably well and I found myself actually having a lot of fun with it. Worth picking up and playing by all fans of Lord of the Rings or hack n' slash games in general.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 23, 2014","true","13.6"," 165 of 192 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","165","192","0","5"

A worth side-story? Mh. Let's see.\nIn "LotR: War in the North" you will play as a dwarf, a ranger or an elf. The events play parallel to the main story of LotR, so you will see some known faces. The story is simple: Sauron wants to rule "middle-earth" (as far as we know from the movies/books). One of his leaders Agandúar (?) is stationed in north of "middle-earth" (no sh*t) and you have to stop him. So you play behind the scenes.

This game was designed as a multiplayer experience, so you should play with a friend if you can, if not prepare yourself to constant variations is gameplay as you'll have to change characters more often than not. In the end this was not a setback, as each has a slightly different play style so changing characters (ranger, elf, dwarf) proved to be varied and amusing.\n\nThis game is first and foremost aimed at Lord of the Rings / Tolkien fans. If you count yourself among those, you'll be satisfied. I played this game as I was reading The Silmarillion again which proved to be a good choice as the story is not focused on the main events at the end of the Third Age but on the fight against the forces of Sauron in the north of Middle Earth. Don't expect Bethesda or Bioware levels of lore in this game, just relax, enjoy the story and focus on what this game does best - combat.\n\nThe fights are intense, combos are easy to execute and enemies' limbs fly all over as you chop Orc after Orc.

The combat mechanics work quite well, the game looks and performs reasonably decent for its age, and the option for co-op adds to the reasons why you should try it out. However, its downfall ultimately lays in the boring story and the method in which it progresses you through the game.\n\nEssentially, you are moving a short distance from area (arena) to area, where the game proceeds to shut you into a zone and begins to spawn wave after wave of enemies for you to defeat. Only once you have cleared these waves will the area "unlock" again to allow you to move on. This is used constantly as the games main progression mechanic and quickly becomes dull and tedious. For the first hour or two this can be overlooked, but once you are a few hours into the game and realise it is just more of the same, monotony quickly robs you of any desire to continue playing.\n\nAdd in a few annoying limitations, such a a lack of screen resolutions and "always on" voice chat that cannot be disabled, and it becomes very hard to recommend War in the North, unless you are looking for a mindless hack and slash game to play with two friends.","May 14","false","5.7"," 111 of 146 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","111","146","4","0"

But as it turns out, it was not as bad as everyone says. It's a pretty - albeit shallow, linear and generic -  action game that was a welcome change after the huge open-world of Skyrim.\n\nI think one problem people had with this game is that it was originally advertised as an RPG. This game is anything but; it's a third-person melee fighter in the vein of Hexen or Dark Messiah. Yes, there are some rudimentary RPG elements (quests, stats) but at its core "War In The North" is pure action. Although the graphics aren't jaw-dropping, it does boast a number of spectacular vistas. The characters are generic but appealing nonetheless, and the story likewise.\n\nIt does lack in variety, however; your avatars only have a limited moveset and you'll be fighting off the same handful of monsters throughout the entire game. The levels are more varied, but are incredibly linear and despite some impressive set-pieces nothing you haven't seen before. This definitely limits its re-playability, even with the co-op mode, but as a change of pace from larger games it was still a welcome experience.\n","November 25, 2013","true","17.1"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","70","86","0","0"

Let me say this right away, I haven't had so much fun in a LOTR game since LOTR: Return of the King on the Xbox. War in the North is basicly an Action RPG, it reminded of Dragon Age at some times gameplay wise. You can play with one of 3 characters, Eradan (Man) which is the Ranger class, Farin (Dwarf) which is the Champion class and Andriel (Elf) wich is a Lore Master (mage). When you level up you can upgrade each one of your stats (stamina, will, strengh, dexterity etc.) and you can also level up a skill which is either passive or active and you use it during combat. Storywise the game takes place on the North while the Fellowship make their way to Mordor. The game plays really well ( I did found it easier to play with a 360 controller though), the combat is satisfying yet I felt like it was somewhat simple with a lack of combos and variety to it. You also have an inventory to store your items and your loot, which I don't know if it's random, and you can sell the stuff you don't want at a store or certain "checkpoints" that appear on each level. Two things I really like about LOTR: War in the North is that the game rewards exploration, by gaining access to secret areas and finding extra gear to either sell or equip, the other thing I also liked is the character design and the dialogue system. Basicly the dialogue system works like in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and KOTOR, I don't know if this was made on the Bioware dialogue engine though. Eitherways, either if you're a fan of the LOTR world or not it is certain that this is still a very good game and that you don't need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it, it's satisfying, it's fun and the plot is very engaging, you can't go wrong with this one, play it!","December 15, 2013","true","14.3"," 61 of 73 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","61","73","0","1"

All of the familiar characteristics of the action-RPG genre are here, from shops and loot to blacksmiths that repair weakened or busted weaponry; as well as some combo-based swordplay.War in the North is all about action, and the action starts when you pick one of the three characters.  No, you can’t pick any of the actual LOTR characters.  You’re stuck with these relatively generic goofballs, doing relatively generic things in a generic fantasy world populated by generic quest givers. Several builds exist for each character though, and you can even build the wizard in melee combat and kick ♥♥♥ surprisingly.  Other than her, you’ve got your typical LOTR ranger and warlord archetypes to play as for sword and bow combat. The control scheme doesn’t really lend that well to a keyboard and mouse, so I highly recommend making the investment for a controller if you don’t have one already. With a completely forgettable character lineup and story that only serves to get in the way or set up the next hub/killing field, it’s been a long time since I ran into a hack and slash that I really never feel like loading up again after putting down.The highlight of the game, as every LOTR game should have a great soundtrack and voice acting to back it up, and this delivers. While the actual context of the story is pretty pathetic, the production values are high enough to keep you listening rather than skipping cutscenes.Games graphics are also rather good.

The game takes place in Middle-earth, the same timeline as the fellowship of the ring, except you're not going to be with the fellowship here, not even you're going to join the battle of Helm's Deep or the Siege of Minas Tirith. You have your own battle here in the northern part of Middle-earth. You will be able to explore Rivendell or you may call it Imladris, the town of Bree, Mirkwood and more. You can choose 3 different characters, each from different race, different abilities and different secrets to found throughout the game. Choose Eradan, a human rangers from Dunedain, Andriel, an elf lore-master from Imladris or Farin, a dwarf from Erebor. Any characters you choose, the rest will become your AI companion.\n\nThe game has good and decent gameplay. It's basic hack and slash game but each characters can also use different ranged attack such as crossbow. The story of the game is linear which makes the level also very linear. Items are vary in this game, and items with better quality can be found as the characters level progress and playing more harder difficulty. Once you beat a difficulty, you can continue playing from the start point on the next difficulty level but retaining your characters level and items. You can also play cooperative with your friends here.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: War in the North has good graphics. Each level and stages in the game have great detail on the environment, which makes Rivendell have really beautiful scenery and the enemy castle a very bad place to see. Animation is also good, though sometimes there is a small animation glitch when an orcs dies.\n\nBut I also will tell you that this game has downside too. Unfixed bugs and glitches are common here, you may see a sword thrown up without reason, the AI companion is somewhat foolish too, using ability when their foe is already dead, or sometimes they even will become your problem. The acting is also not that good, even the voice acting too. But this game is still recommended from me.\n\n+ Gameplay\n+ Cooperative\n+ Storyline\n+ Graphics\n+ Replayable\n\n- Bad AI\n- Bugs\n- Glitches\n\nRating 8/10","February 13, 2014","true","32.0"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

Tolkien. This game is a piece of art and it should be treated as much. It's price is more than reasonable for its long story and content and those who were unable to have access to the 4 books, might find this game for informative and interesting than they thought. Though the gameplay itself is not bad, I will give cons to this game because of the following 3 : 1. Very small lvl cap, in other words you cant max out your character ( dont worry you can buy respec item ;) ). 2. sudden difficulty changes, for example there is one sequence where you have to go from agile goblins and orc, to Uruk and Trolls. 3. No actual need for skills, yes you may fall in battle and yes you may get grabbed by that troll, but dont worry, only if the entire team falls before one gets up you may be able to lose, also in addition to that if you fill your pocket and sell whatever you dont want, you can get extremely good equipment, which will turn current, suppossed to be, strong enemies into childs' play.\nAlthough this game is good and if you are a fan of Hobbit or Lord of the  Rings you might find it interesting and even sometimes exciting.

Some people say it gets boring after a while as the whole game is the same (to slice orcs) Which gets true, But i always seem to go back and play it again in a few weeks. The combat is great, and uses a variety of skills (depending if your Man,Elf or Dwarf) to defeat Agandaurs minions. The only other problem i had with this game was it is too short, There are about 8 levels (Including Fornost,Barrow Downs, Ettermoors, Gundabad, Mirkwood, Uglost Lair, Nordinbad and Carn Dum) This roughly takes about 15-25 hours to complete. Of course, you then play it at a harder difficulty afterwards and find new armour,weapons etc. Even though the game is fasirly short I still highly recommend it as it is one of my faviourite games, and is very fun to play.","January 1, 2015","true","45.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I wish I had scrolled down the reviews more to have seen warnings about ATI cards. It started out as a pretty great co-op game, with slightly jaded graphics and not top level game mechanics, but still playable and enjoyable.\n\nThen chapter 2 hit, and it all went to hell in barrow downs. Missing textures, random disconnects and system crashes at various intervals, especially in the middle of hard fights - problems either for you or friends connected to your game. The first few were just a minor annoyance because the game was quite fun but, when it kept happening, my friends and I just had to give up in frustration. It was a sad thing too, because the game is pretty addictive.\n\nThe biggest annoyance for me is how the game's minimum requirements actually state that ATI cards older than those from 2006 will run this game, and how that is basically untrue after the first chapter. I begin wonder if I can get my money back just for that partially false statement.\n\nI don't want to go through the trouble of listing my system specs, but it runs anything recent like DA:I or FC4 on ultra without issues.

Since there aren't any PROs, I'll just go ahead and list the CONs.\n\n- Pointless story which is completely irrelevant to the LOTR movies/books.\n- Terrible gameplay. To sum it up in one word: REPETITIVE. Expect to grind through the same mobs of enemies and reused bosses for the 10 hour length of the game.\n- Awful dialogue and voice acting. Hearing the same cheesy one-liners from the characters over and over again drove me crazy.\n- The graphics for this game are totally outdated; even for a game that was released in 2011. (Playing on ultra settings, I saw no difference between the visuals in this game and the visuals in LOTR: Return of the King on the ♥♥♥♥ing Gamecube.)\n- Bad UI and inventory management. This makes the process of navigating menu's and matchmaking incredibly painful.\n- Poor level design. Each chapter is basically a rinse-and-repeat. (Field, Cave, Building. THIS x INFINITE.)\n\nUnfixed Problems/Bugs/Glitches:\n- InGame mic voice chat. It allows players' mics to constantly be open and there's no way to disable it. (A complete bummer for some people that use external VOIP software such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.)\n- Black screens and game crashes. Expect to replay entire segments of the game because of this. (These issues are even worse for AMD users.)\n- Issues with savedata.\n\nThis game seems nothing more than a cash-grab and is a complete disappointment for true LOTR fans.\nPlease save your money.

The multiplayer lobby is always empty.\n\nI cannot with honest heart recommend this game to even to the most hardcore LoTR fans. Let me explain why:\n\nThis is a console port, one of the worst I have seen yet.\n\nThe UI is awful and there is no way to remove the annoying overlapping key binds from the screen.\nI haven’t seen any game more linear than this. Invisible walls everywhere and i mean EVERYWHERE. You can go only in one direction: forward.\nThe combat is extremely boring and repetitive; you will be doing the same moves over and over again in a course of the entire game. The skills (spells? or powers?) are simply laughable.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game is related to the story. The point when you meet few of the characters from the original movies is cool. Well it is, until you get to hear them speak - the voiceover wasn’t done by the movie actors, but by some random people.\n\nThe graphics are bad even on the highest settings, sometimes the game freezes and/or crashes for no reason. There are too many unfixed bugs like floating dead enemies or enemies stuck in walls.\n\nI say, don’t waste your time and specially money on this game.","November 27, 2014","false","20.0"," 53 of 97 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","53","97","0","1"

You'll be stuck at Barrow's Wight boss fight if you are the joiner and get disconnected from the host after defeating the boss. The host will passed that stage to Rivendell without a problem and be farther ahead. This what happened to me while I was playing Co-op with my cousin. The problem was I could not proceed from there while I went back to single mode. There is a invisible wall that exists during the boss fight that keeps you from running up toward him. The possessed ranger was already dead, but all the sound effects, dialog, and music was going as if I were fighting the boss. It corrupted my saved game.\n\nThe SOLUTION was I joined someone game who was at Chapter 2 The Barrow-downs and proceed from there to Barrow's Wight boss fight and then to Rivendell. I know it will waste your time, but just hopefully the host won't kick you or leave the game. You'll get disconnect from the cutscene for Rivendell. I joined back to the same host as quickly. Then I exit the host while I was at Rivendell and from there on I was at Chapter 3. Other soulution is to start the game all over in a single mode.\n\nThis game is fun, but have glitch, and issues when playing in multiplayer mode. Most of the time you'll get disconnected and saying you lost connection from the host.\n\nBest to play it in single mode.

That being said, that's how much time you're going to spend on a single play-through.  If you're going to do a run with all three characters, and on both normal and heroic difficulties, you're looking at 50 to 60 hours of semi-original gameplay.  Coop is something I'd like to do sometime.  Maybe that'll add another 20 hours.\n\nHave you guys ever played Lord of the Rings: Third Age?  This feels like that game if it were shorter and didn't have turn-based combat.\n\nReally quickly, I'm going to give a run-down of what I definitely do and do not like - spoilers ahead.\n\nI liked the world: The devs of this game did an absolutely outstanding job of creating their world, however stunted it may be in certain areas.  Rivendell and Nordinbad were good examples due to how outstanding the architecture was, but the best area for me was the Barrow-downs.  They NAILED the atmosphere for that area, and looking out at all the outstanding crags and jagged rocks planted in the rolling green hills gave me chills.  Inside Gundabad was epic as well, being able to look across the void and see all these different things going on.\n\nI like the weapon system: There are a bunch of weapons in the game: hand-axes, battleaxes, short swords, long swords, hammers, staffs.  You can dual-wield one-handed weapons after unlocking a specific perk thing.  While I've only played as the Ranger, there was still a great deal that I could toy with.  It seems to be about finding your style, but there's also moving between dual-wielding and broadsword wielding in order to balance damage and speed.  Also, weapons break down after time and need to be repaired by a forger.\n\nSimilarly, I like the equipment system:  Giving yourself the best armor while looking for repairs on what's about to break.\n\nI like how weapons and equipments can be imbued with properties: You know, stuff like ice damage, fire damage, shock damage.  Boosts to strength, stamina, health, power.  Same kind of gimmick from Skyrim, but executed well here.  Some equipment/weapons do not have slots - others have multiple.   Fun figuring out what to trade off - damage or health?\n\nI like the checkpoints: almost every level will have checkpoints where you can sell your loot, buy very basic things like weak armor and potions, and you can return to the last safe area (Bree, Rivendell, Nordinbad).  Good for getting out if you need and dumping inventory.\n\nI'm conflicted on the lore.  I like what it tries to do, especially regarding fallen Dunedain cities and Carn Dum and the dwarves, but it comes off as something that these three characters should not be able to rise up against.  Aragorn wants you to defeat Sauron's right hand man, like no big deal champ thanks for the help?  Oh wow check out these sick dwarves taking out the whole of Mt. Gundabad with this awesome secret weapon?  That's literally Deus ex Machina.\n\nI'm conflicted on the combat.  It's monotonous, but the perk(???) system makes it a bit interesting.  Once again, that's not something I've fully explored, but it breaks the monotony of LMB spam and the RMB coup-de-grace.\n\nThe only real hate I have is for a Mannish faction that follows Agandaur.  The grunts of this Mannish faction are overpowered.  Their swords extend beyond what their model shows, and they attack FAST.  They do not get knocked back.  Don't expect an easy one-up over these guys.  Spam your special attacks and ranged.  Or the devs can fix these guys, whatever.\n\nCan't think of anything else that I really do hate.  As a Tolkien fan who wanted more but knew this wasn't canon at all, I give this a 7/10 because I got it on sale.  Do not get this at full price.\n\n","May 25","true","9.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game.\n\nTHE STORY: We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.\n\nGRAPHICS: Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.\n\nINTERFACE: Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited space and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.\n\nGAMEPLAY: We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there were several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.\n\n- For the Ranger: Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s,  the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree. Conclusion; Eradan was a great ranger.\n- For the Lore-master: Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game.\n- For the Champion: Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL.\n\nALSO FUN;\n- You can use your Eagle friend to do all the heavy work for you.\n- You meet a dragon; Which seems to be very popular amongst gamers.\n- Turrets!\n\nOverall conclusion: 'The Lord of the Rings - War in the North' is a must have if you are a fan of the LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming, with a bit of hack & slash in it. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come) and we didn't get bored with the storyline once, even though all those trolls were a pain. Me and my friend decided that we definitely are going to play this game a few times each year... *Totally not addicted*\n\n\nEnjoy the game!","April 29, 2015","true","42.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It also uses characters-model from the movies...but...it's a totally different story. Kind of. In the south, war breaks between the Dark Lord Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth, as shown in the movies/books. But the game shows a "hidden" story: a fellowship composed of Eradan, a Dunedáin (man), Farin, a dwarf and Andriel, a she-elf. They too, embark in a journey to fight for the north of Middle Earth, at the same time of the LOTR trilogy battles in the south. It's an interesting idea and the plot develops really well. With the presence of beloved characters that will make a LOTR fan smile, a decent villain and some good character development for Beleram, an Eagle that helps in the journey, i liked the story. The ending is also epic and amazing with a challenging boss fight. Talking about boss fights, the game have a lot of them and they're all pretty good. The game is challenging even in the lowest difficult (normal) because of tough enemeis in high quantities. Sometimes is frustrating because of your companions AI when you die in combat, but it's pretty rewarding, as this game is about loot and there is a lot of it. You can choose one of the three characters to play, and all of them have unique skills to upgrade and purchase, that's real nice. Also they have unique abilities and usable weapons, making the variation of playing with each one of them unique. You can even play online, whick makes the game a lot more enjoyable. But while playing offline, the companions AI is pretty bad, and sometimes you die just because they messed up while trying to ressurect you. It's frustrating. The graphics are outdated, and the facial animations are bad, but the scenarios are really awesome. The combat is very cool with all aplicable skills and upgrades, use of potions and weapons, inclding ranged weapons. But it gets too repetitive. The whole game is a bit repetitive, there is no puzzles, just go and kill a thousand enemies, proceed, then do it again. It may have RPG elements, but it's pretty linear besides the fact you can travel to some places, and challenge maps in scenarios from LOTR trilogy. There is dialog system too, which have zero impact on the story and only serves to know more about events/begin side quests. There is some side quests and some of them are decent, but there is only a few. The soundtrack, as expected, is awesome and have some beautiful melodies and epic combat tracks. You can call for Beleram support, which is awesome and helps a lot. The game length is good for an action game and you can replay in higher levels of difficult with the same weapons and equipment (there is armor and other stuff in good quantity). Kind of new game+, adding replay value because you can use other characters. You can swap characters during the campaign by only going back to menu or at certain points, and giving them items mean nothing, they don't use them and you should switch at least one time to up their skills and equip the loot they found because those dumbasses don't do anything alone. The game have some bugs too, as usual.\n\n\n+Replayability\n+Boss Battles\n+Epic ending\n+Decent plot\n+Beautiful scenarios\n+Lots of weapons, armors, skills, upgrades\n+Secrets and loot\n+Good characters\n+Absolutely epic ending sequence and boss fight\n+A few sidequests\n+LOTR Trilogy characters!\n+Lots of enemies types\n+Challenging and cool combat\n+Epic soundtrack\n+Unique characters skills, weapons\n+Challenge maps\n+Co-op\n+Eagle support\n\n-Some bugs\n-Stupid and bad AI\n-Outdated graphics and poor facial animations\n-Very repetitive\n-Horrid UI\n-Dialog does not impact nothing in the story\n-Very linear\n-Sometimes frustrating\n-Boring sometimes\n\n\nA decent Middle-Earth tale with some good inspiration on it, but nothing impressive.\n7,5/10","January 5","true","24.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You get to play as either Eradan the ranger, Andriel the lore-master, or Farin the champion, to thwat the plans of Sauron's commander, Agandaur. While exploring vast landscape from the Shire, to Grey Mountains, and Mirkwood, you get to meet members from the fellowship of the rings, side characters such as Radagast the Brown, and even a mighty dragon. If you've played LOTR: the Third Age, the narrative of this game is fairly similiar.\n\nGameplay: the 3 aspects of a good RPG are present in this game, namely - statpoints, skilltree, and itemization. As there are limited points and inventory space to go around, decisions must be made into how your character is created. While the diversity of types of character is definitely limited, it is enough to keep you entertained for a 20-50hrs long game.\n\nUnlike The Third Age, this game is a action based RPG and each 'encounter' with orcs requires some sort of finesse to defeat them. However, the game is not too hard, and it actually becomes easier as you unlock the heroic, and legendary difficulty levels. On the same note, a major flaw in this game is that the difficulty is based on the character you choose *winks* Farin, rather than the level you are playing on. Also, unlocking the 'legendary' difficutly, requires you to complete the game two times on it's fairly short storyline. This may get boring, although the lure of better items, hitting the maximum level, and uncovering all the secrets/collecting all 50 achievements is enough to keep a player going.\n\nQuests in this game is fairly one dimensional as most of them cannot be missed as long as you diligently explore the maps and talk to the NPCs. More details shoud be added to the  backstory to make this game more vibrant and interesting. 'Secrets' on the other hand requires some time spent exploring and manipulation of the ever annoying 'game save' mechanics, and this may frustrate players unless they find a guide (which there are surprisingly few online).\n\nLastly, this game UI is clearly based on the console version, and some mechanics such as character movement and inventory management, feels clunky and poorly done up. However, this is not a problem after taking some time getting used to it, although, a PC game controller will certainly improve the experience.\n\nAudio/visual: the landscapes and character design are extremely well done for a 2011 game with details such as seeing the weaves in Elrond's shirt, rock patterns in the background, and blood splatter as you chop off the orc's head. While the game's background music and action sounds are vibrant, the voice acting could be better, to add more life to the storyline, and make the hero jouney seems more epic. Together, the atmosphere of the game felt a letdown as the good visuals such as the never ending rain in Bree is not complimented with audio effects to bring about an immersive expierence.\n\nVerdict: Overall, War in the North gets more fun as you progress along the difficulty levels, and your character feels truely powerful on the final difficulty level. However, the clunky mechanics, limited depth to the character's development, quests and backstory limits this game from  being an epic RPG. Also the game design restrict it to around 60hrs of gameplay before it gets repetitive. Thus, this game would be a good buy during steam sales as a form of pasttime, but definitely not a must-have, unless you are a Lord of the Rings fan.\n\nDisclaimer: this review is written based on solo-play only, and I have yet to encounter any bugs with this game.","October 26, 2014","true","59.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Tolkien, yet providing an alternate part of the story. Here you control one of the 3 heroes from the legendary races, Dunedain ( Human ) , Elf and Dwarf.\nTalking about graphics, this game is pretty good considering it's from 2011 and uses the Dark Alliance Engine, which I find extraordinary for a hack-and-slash game like this.\nThis game earns his name as an RPG, having many characters to talk to and having enough side quests to make the story not seem linear.\nAs for battle mechanics, this game does pretty well. Fast paced action and fast responce allows the player to make extraordinary combos. To top it off, there is the "Hero Mode", which activates after a critical hit has been made. This allows the player to inflict massive quantities of damage, provided that he can hit constantly and elude the blows of enemies, most of which you knock you down or stagger you for just enough time for you to lose your combo.\nThe game lacks a bit if it is to be compared to Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with less to barely any combos, which made the first title so enjoyable. Yet the second title compensates with alot of loot, sprinkled with that I believe to be legendary weapons, some even imbued with fire.\nOther factors to keep in mind are multiplayer and replayability. The game seems to have extraordinary capabilities for co-op support, even non-LAN-based, which LotR:RotK lacked, yet I haven't had the opportunity to try it. As for replayability, this game seems to have 3 difficulties : Normal, Hero and Legendary ( pardon me if I am mistaken ), which gives the game excelent replayability, considering that you can combine different classes with your friends to make the perfect team, where each player can choose the character best suited for him.\nIn conclusion I give this game a 9.7/10 because of the lack of the combo system that was present in LotR:RotK, and place it in my top 5 all-time favorite game list.","April 2, 2014","true","34.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can chose between three rolls, a human ranger, a elven mage, or a dwarf warrior, giving you a fair bit of variance between how exactly you kill Orcs and Uruk-hai (and a lot more.)  The maps are quite a great sight seeing experience with a large bit of map interactivity, rarely leaving the feeling of playing the same thing.\n\nThe setting itself is just so perfect for a video game, leaving you to follow your own unique LOTR story while maintaining everything which has already been made.  It truly casts you into the line of your favorite story hero, even during the co-op experience.  Which leads to the games greatest feature - Co-Op.\n\nWar in the North is AMAZING in co-op.  The game was seemingly made for it from the ground up.  If you're looking for a hack and slash co-op game, this might just be the one for you.\n\n\nSimilar games:  Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, Fable 3, Batman series, Darksiders series, Brutal Legend, Witcher 2.","February 1, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It looks good, sounds good, and you get to explore a few really interesting places and meet some fun characters in search of random loot. In a rare stroke of ambition for a Lord of the Rings game, you're also presented with an original story rather than going on the adventures of Frodo & Co. for the umpteenth time. Some parts get more than a little fanfiction-y, and combat isn't as fluid as it needs to be, but even in areas where the game has glaring flaws, you manage to have just enough fun to overlook those shortcomings.","March 25, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What is really cool about this game is it doesn't just retell the story of the fellowship but rather a group of three with a quest equally as important. You do get to see all the characters from the movies at one point but the main focus is on your group. One thing that is rather strange is that everyone you meet is always saying how this story should be written down, but I guess that was to stress the importance of your mission. The combat in this game felt kinda dull, while you had a range of abilities you run into enemies that are just copies of each other but with different skins and greater stats. So once you master how to defeat a troll you shouldn't have a problem again. When you play singleplayer your two companions aren't really helpful for anything but reviving you. They will keep guys occupied but have no finishing capabilites. You find at the end of the mission you did 3/4 of all the damage dealt. Overall this game was a lot of fun. The side quests aren't too interesting but the main questline is where everything comes alive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/customurlforfriends/recommended/32800/","customurlforfriends","Fatal_Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/customurlforfriends/","133 products in account","Played it for almost 100h on different accounts now. The game is quite simple actually, but you can get a lot out of that simplicity.\n\n** Basics\n- Three different characters (Ranger, Dwarf, Elf)\n- Direct movement (WASD/Left Stick), direct aiming (Mouse/Right Stick)\n- Always all three characters in play. Coop or NPCs.\n(Many people have technical probs with coop. You might want to check that out.)\n- Different levels with multiple Zones (Mirkwood part1/2 ...)\nYou enter at one point, exit at another one and destroy everything that moves on your way.\n- Grab the loot! Obviously!\n- Enter different towns between the zones. Sell/Buy/Repair/Get Quests.\n- Unlimited free travel to replay visited locations. (However the many boss mobs are not there\nif you revisit a location.)\n\n** Visuals\n- Not high level for current gen, but it looks decent.\n- Sets and Landscapes are very well designed. Some areas felt like walking through\nthe cover of a classic fantasy book.\n\n** RPG\n- No real character based roleplaying. You can choose between a few conversation alternatives. But you cannot change the NPCs or your characters or the story in any meaningful way. It is about as linear as Diablo.\n- Very small number of town based quest. Almost all quest are about gathering loot during the fights.\n\n** Fighting\n- Hack&Slash + Ranged Shooting. You will be using both and it is quite fun.\n- Dwarf and Ranger use crossbows and bows, Elf uses magic bolts.\n- Some meele weapons are also class character exclusive.\n- Basic combo slashing "AAA", get a note for a critical attack, "B", knockdown/kill.\n- You fight smaller groups along the way and bigger mobs/bosses in arena type areas.\n\n** Skills\n- Specific skill tree for all three characters. Kind of similar but the trees help to enhance\ndifferent playstiles or at least different feel.\n- Each skill matters but might be less usefull depending on your build.\n- Respec token available, so don't worry.\n\n** Leveling\n- Level 40 is max.\n- Level 20 is roughly what you get after a first playthrough.\n- Unlimited playthroughs. Difficulty raises up to 'legendary'.\n- Attribute points are more important for equipment requirements than stat changes.\n\n** Some Notes\n- Don't go for that one ultimate item set. At least not until you approach legendary.\nYou will grow out of items a lot. Use that to have fun and replace them many times.\nUse your elfstones, try different weapons. In the next playthrough you will laugh about the\nstats of the former one.\n- Helpful item boni change over time. In the beginning you want more armor, more health, more coints etc to not die. In the end you want damage multipliers and cooldown reduction to get through those puny orks fast.\n- A single item with x5 coins can remove all your money worries.\n- Rare items are rare! You need quite a few playthroughs to get the 'perfect' equipment.\nYou will be finishing the game with eyes closed by that time.\n- Your item inventory is large. Keep alterantive weapons for different situations.\n- Use mirrors to customize your appearance. Made the characters a lot more likeable to me.\n- Switch between characters if you cannot finish some area (should not be the case) or maybe a quest requires a certain character. *wink*\n- Don't stress yourself over lost items/opportunities etc. You can replay as many times as you like. Just carry on.\n- Special boni carry over from weapons to special moves. A good reason to go for dual wielding.\n\n\n** Suggestions\n- Dwarf is considered the most powerful character. He has a broken overpowered ranged attack\nthat takes the whole challenge out of the game. Spare the dwarf for later, if you are interested in the other characters too. Its hard to fight big mobs and strong bosses with an axe, if you can one-shot them anyway.\n- Ranger is the most 'dull' (and kinda dumb looking) character. But if you want to play a sword and bow fighter, you can have a lot of fun with that guy.\nRanger is a good start for a first playthrough and does not suffer from game ending op attacks.\n- Elf is primarily written as healer/supporter for the other two. You become the nanny for them\nwhen you play the elf. Makes the fights different and more rewarding.\n\n\n\n** Elf tips\n- You are the NPC healer. But as a player you have to look after the other guys.\nThat can be very frustrating when you play with two NPCs for dwarf and ranger.\nMake it your challenge to keep those little dummies alive.\n- When one NPC dies, the other one instantly tries to revive them. Even if they run into a mob and get killed instantly. After that you are the only target left and have the mob all to yourself. And not time to revive your buddies. Annyoing, but also challenging and a great reason to curse those stupid NPCs!!\n- Yes you DO need dexterity for your magic missiles damage. But all characters get high ranged damage without dexterity anyway. Attributes don't effect damage output that much. Focus on meeting item requirements.\n- A very rewarding build is to go for the Elfs AoE attack. A nova/splash attack that can later take out entire mobs of the strongest enemies. No Dex needed. Not much power (mana) upgrade needed.\n- Ranged attacks have a high mana cost and don't profit from casting cost reduction.\n- Elemental attacks and other modifiers take over from melee weapons to AoE attack.\n- Collect the ingredients for potions and USE them. Your inventory will be full with that stuff, so at least drink it.\n- You can build an AoE based Elf that kills almost any enemy with a single splash attack and does rarely need a potion for health/mana at all. VERY rewarding after all the babysitting.\n- There is one boss towards the end that your gf might find very disgusting. ;)\n"She" drops a staff sometimes. Take a good look at that one and think about dual wielding and some quest rewards you might have collected...","February 11","true","34.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It isn't exactly amazing, but it isn't bad at all. The story is pretty good, nothing too exciting however. You don't really get any sort of connection with the characters. You're kinda just an elf, dwarf and a human who are tossed together, it feels. Throughout the game you get to visit places such as Fornost, the Barrow-downs, Rivendell and even Carn Dum, the capitol of the old Angmar empire.\n\nAs far as pros go, the story is alright, and you can tell the devs did put a bit of research into things. There's a few nice name drops here and there as well. The soundtrack is pretty good, and none of the levels are exactly impossible, though in some cases it can get that way pretty easily. Combat is alright, consists mainly of LMB for light attacks and RMB for heavier attacks, or a critical attack when the enemy has a yellow arrow over their head. You also have 3 abilities for melee and 3 for ranged, used with the 1, 2 and 3 buttons. You also have a handy eagle to call with the fourth. Combat isn't exactly amazing however, I'll admit, though it's pretty simple to get the hang of. Isn't slippery or hard to adapt to whatsoever. You and your companions are, in a way, tied in with that of the Fellowship, and several things that occur in the movies happen because of things you did, which is pretty neat.\n\nNow to the cons. This game is pretty well known to have a LOT of bugs. There's a few quests in particular that are very buggy, and you can easily screw yourself over with them. If you're focusing on whether this is canon, I've seen mostly people saying that it is not canon. The achievements aren't very bad at all, either, though the "strength of our alliance" achievement is extremely tedious to get in my experience, and is very buggy as well. There is a lot of issues when it comes to balance. As Farin, the dwarf, unlocking the explosive bolt can do up to 150k damage from what I've seen personally. Which can instant-kill trolls and usually 2-3 shot a boss. Took around 8 shots or so to kill the final boss with it. Now, what I said earlier about the levels sometimes being crazy hard comes down to you. If you run out of health potions, you do NOT have the option to save manually. So, if you go into a level, run out of potions and can't leave (example being a later stage of Nordinbad) you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, and you have to do it on your own. Ended up doing this myself and trying to do it with no health potions, which isn't too easy.\n\nTo 100% complete the game there's a minimum of 3 playthroughs to get the achievement for beating the Legendary mode. This is a little bit of a con as well, in that there isn't really any sense of a challenge. Mobs do a little more damage and take some more as well, but it never really is an issue.\n\nNow, be warned, two levels in particular, the Barrow-downs and Carn Dum are very well known for crashing computers. I run the game flawlessly on ultra settings, but I crash constantly in these spots. I read that it has something to do with AMD drivers or something along the lines, but I don't know much about that. Just be warned that it does have some crashing issues.\n\nIn the end, the game is pretty good, has a good bit of replayability, it isn't boring or stretched thin, and it's pretty well rounded. It does have a lot of bugs and isn't the greatest with balance in the second and third playthroughs, (being in your favour as opposed to being in the enemy's favour) but there isn't really any game breaking issues. The community isn't too lively, though if you really want the one online achievement, you only need to post in the forums of the game that you want help and people flock to it. I believe the game has a built in system that causes open mics constantly, which is EXTREMELY annoying when you're an English speaking man, but get stuck with a very angry spanish child being scolded by his father while a Russian laughs and calls him a ♥♥♥♥♥ for it. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad at all. I personally really like the game, it has a great feeling to it, and it's nice to be able to have a good lotr game. Be warned that the voices of the few fellowship members you meet are not the same as the movies, so don't get too hype thinking they'll make a cameo.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10, only lacking the two points for the crashing issues, lack of a challenge in the later levels, and balance issues that break whatever challenge would have been from the Heroic and Legendary difficulties.\n\n(Probably worth mentioning you have NO interaction with Mordor, Sauron, Isenguard or anything of the such. You have your own quest that you and your companions are going on dealing with the North. Don't go in expecting to see the black gates.)","August 23, 2015","true","43.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

It starts off with you loading up and inviting your friends, while you are using your 3rd party chat server, you have now discovered that voice chat is forced, and there is no way to change any of the settings in game to eliminate it. Not to mention the steam voice option is just terrible in general. After you decide that, hey we will just use keyboard to chat in game, after wasting hours of time trying to fix the voice feature. Trying to join up with friends is awful, you can connect and stay in the lobby and load up the game, but once you are in game, it kicks someone randomly. Why is it that we can play so many games flawlessly and yet this game has such issues? It's because they pushed out a port of this as quick as they could, and then never patched anything, They couldn't even be bothered to put an option for disabling the chat feature.\n\nI'm so disgusted and now i'm out of hard earned money, not to mention my time that I spent trying to troubleshoot this awful game into working. I spent my entire weekend trying to get this game working being optimistic and hopeful. It's not worth it. Just stay away, go get it on whatever console that it was intended for, maybe that version will work better, but I would definitly research that carefully as well.\n\nTL;DR Version: The game is buggy and unplayable, touts a multiplayer style of gameplay that doesn't work, and doesn't allow you to disable or change any microphone settings that are very terrible. Stay away from this game at all costs.","September 21, 2014","false","2.0"," 37 of 70 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","37","70","0","0"

Then why the negative review? Let's see:\nPros:\n-great story ( the action happens in the same time with the fellowship of the ring)\n-you can co-op through the campaign with 2 other friends\n-you have multiple builds for your character with various spells, armours, enchantments etc.\n-a handful of sidequests\n-quite easy to get 100% of the achievements.\n-when you finish a difficulty, you can advance to the next one with all of your gear, coins, and your current level ( Diablo stuff)\n\nCons:\n-well, if you are an AMD graphic card user, good luck playing the game! Since the release of the game (2011) it's almost impossible for you to play the game. I have an HD 8850M which is more than enough for this, but it's so poorly optimised, that you will get stuttering every 2 minutes and the game will crash every 10 minutes.\nFortunatelly I have a 4th generation i7 and I was able to play the game on the integrated graphic card which struggled a little on medium settings, but the game was playable.\n-this game has the most  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice chat I've ever seen since I play multiplayer video games. If you join a lobby with your friends or any random person, the game will activate your microphone all the freaking time! It's almost impossible to stop it. How is it possible for someone to release in 2011 a game in which you can't deactivate the voice chat?\nAfter many tries, I finally managed to get rid of it.\n\nAll-in-all this is a great game, I would say it is very underrated and it is perfect if you don't have much time to spend on, as the campaign can be finished in 8-10 hours, but unfortunatelly, the voice chat and the AMD graphic cards problem have a huge impact on it and I'm really sorry but I can't recommend it.","November 25, 2015","false","26.7"," 53 of 102 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","53","102","5","9"

However, after putting some more time into it, I feel that if you get this game on a heafty discout (as I did), you will definitely feel satisfied after the experience. However, I highly recommend you only buy this game if you either a) plan to play with friends, or b) have a high tolerance for frustrating games (see below).\n\nHere are a few things I think you should be aware of before you purcahse this game:\n\n- The UI is terrible. It is cleary optimized for console/controller use. Even then, it's full of nonsense. Also, be aware of the fact that unless you're using a Microsoft Xbox360 controller, you'll run into problems (I have a Steelseries 3GC, a PDP Afterglow Xbox360 controller, and a MS Xbox360 controller).\n- The AI is stupid. Your AI teammates are of little help, and tend to get in your way. If you play as the Loremaster, you'll spend a fair amount of time trying to heal them. If you play as one of the other two classes, you'll find you're doing most of the work yourself and reviving your AI teammates often.\n- The interface is terrible. The Keymapping makes little sense, is not customizable and is frustrating when dealing with 'Skill 4' and summoning Eagles (they're mapped to the same key and I have not found a way to change that).\n- The inventory system is a nightmare. Your inventory is only accessable on your current character, meaning you cannot equip your AI teammates. The AI is left to auto equip whatever inventory you're not currently using and thus makes managing it quite difficult. In multiplayer, some traded items would just disappear.\n- You cannot switch characters in game. This makes it a chore to keep your teammates up-to-date with stats. Often you'll find yourself three levels ahead of your teammates in terms of equipped skills before you get the chance to sort them out.\n- The save system is out dated. It's based off of a checkpoint system which is poorly thought out.\n- Finally, this game is poorly optimized. It is filled with bugs that may not be game breaking, but are certaintly frustrating and annoying. Including a particular graphic bug which causes a transparent white flashing throughout and entire level. I could not find a solution for this problem, and after searching the internet, I can confirm it is not my graphics card as many are plagued with the problem.\n\nIn the end, if you can get this game on a great sale and have a craving to play a Lord of the Rings themed video game - and you're willing to tolerate some frustration - this is worth it. I would also suggest Lego: Lord of the Rings. The voice acting and music comes straight from the three movies; it's very well done.\n\nAs a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, I think it is worth it to mention that this follows Peter Jackson's movie version, sadly. Although, it is to be expected from a WB published game.","January 27, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seemed like a great opportunity to play my favourite game genre with my friend. And it might be a decent experience, if you get around the bugs, some of which might force you into restart.\nMy rating without the bugs is 7/10. My rating with bugs is 4/10. I would not recommend this game for its full price, but with discount and some friends to play with, you might give it a try.\n\nPROS:\n\nApart from being a co-op game there really isn't any other positive outstanding feature in this game, because as an Action-RPG game it provides only a mediocre gameplay experience and boring dialogues.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Pour graphics even for 2011. Compared to Witcher 2, which was released in the same year, LoR: War in the North is something from Stone Age.\n-Simple battle system: just fast attack and strong attack, blocking and few skills. There are no combos and, if you are patient enough, you can just hold block and attack simultaneously, without taking any damage (apart from ranged attacks)\n-Confusing crafting system, unless you learn the names of all the plants and components, it's hard to understand what will be the result of your crafting.\n- There is no push-to-talk, you are forced to listen to all the background noise from your gaming buddy's microphone.\n-If you finish a quest, you can return to complete it again. I can't understand whether it's meant to be like that or it's a bug. Either way it doesn't help you to understand what to do next.\n- No mini-map. It's a big problem in Burrow-downs cave system and Forest for apparent reasons.\n- Bad camera work – does not always follow the character.\n- BUGS!!!\n\n1. Some quests get stuck. No solution. Restart the game or change the host (if co-op).\n2. Completed quests revert back "in progress", if you return to the same area.\n3. Some enemies (bosses), which should spawn, do no appear.\n4. Sometimes it's not possible to revive your allies. Normally it's possible.\n5. I started to play this game with my friend. But on our second co-op session this game told me that he has progressed further than me and that I will not be able to get achievements and to save my progress. However none of us had played the game in single-player mode after the previous session, so we were on the same line.\n6. Graphical glitches.","September 29, 2014","true","33.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got it for a decent price around $8 and it provided me with around 12 hours of gameplay so I think I got my monies worth :)\n\nYou pick one of three characters and journey to stop one of Sauron's generals who plans to start war in the northern realms. You can pick a ranger who can dual wield, a lore master (healer mage) or a tanky dwarf. They generally all play the same with a few unique skills attached to each class. Combat consists of mashing the normal attack and hitting the strong attack once enemies are weak to cause critical damage or finish them off. Levels consist of areas where you have to defeat waves of enemies before the next area is unlocked and you pick up gear for your characters and level up.\n\nI played this game solo but I can see the real fun is with playing with friends which I haven't tried, not even sure if it works or not considering this is an older game. Your AI companions can be pretty dumb often getting preoccupied fighting one weak goon while you get swarmed by enemies. You can only switch between the characters at checkpoints which is a shame and only your main characters look will be affected by what they are wearing.\n\nThe music and the voice acting are great although some of the dialogue is cliche. You do have some dialogue choices during the story but it doesn't really matter what you pick. The story itself is weak and predictable and when you finally defeat the last boss you instantly find out that the original Fellowship completed their epic journey making your efforts seem kind of pointless.\n\nOverall great game and still playable in 2016. I only wish you can freely swap between characters in battle and setup all your characters with loot and equipment that you find in the game.","April 4","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Multiplayer is super bugged.  It separated my friend and I when we both clicked on the map to travel to the same place.  We got stuck and had to exit.\n\nThe more I play, the more bugs are revealed.  Enemies have the ability to blink and skate around.  Dead things vibrate uncontrollably on the floor.  Potions never drop.  Some parts are extremely easy and some parts are extremely difficult.\n\nThere is also this dumb thing where your voice echoes when you're in caverns.\n\nRunning into Gandalf and Aragorn was not that exciting.  They both had the same stupid look on their face.\n\nThe dumb bird was useless.  It needed me to use a feather for it to attack my enemies.  If its smart enough to talk, it should be smart enough to see me getting ♥♥♥♥ed in the face by a horde of op terrorist bomber gremlin things.\n\nThe more I play, the worse this game gets.  I keep fighting the same trolls over and over again.  You have to click each item to repair instead of repair all.  I keep getting separated from my friend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g3s/recommended/32800/","g3s","Nixon Fury: Agent of SHIELD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g3s/","322 products in account","A fairly good movie-based game dressed up as a Gears of War-feeling Diablo clone.\n\nThe plot follows TLoTR from a group of heroes parallel to the main story of Frodo, adding a lot of backstory and "meanwhile..." kind of lore for diehard fans. There's a lot of good exposition and the custscenes are well done.\n\nWhile the game is firmly planted in the Action-RPG tropes of Diablo and Titan Quest, it plays a lot like Gears of Wars, minuse the cover mechanic. Sprinting feels like the "roadie run" and the rolls are almost the same. It's made using Epic's Unreal Engine 3, but its strking how much this game borrows gameplay mechanics from Gears of War with an ARPG shoehorned in and then told using the trimmings from TLoTR's plot.\n\nVisuals range from good to great and the sound is satisfying, but nothing amazing. Combat is fun and it's a delight to knock a big, ugly orc's head off and then fel his friend by slicing his leg off.\n\nIn case you're wondering, yes there is a multiplayer mode that allows you to play through the game in co-op.\n\nOverall, a nice buy for anyone a fan of ARPGs and/or TLoTR with a farily decent amount of replayablity.","November 11, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the same team that brought you Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, comes a third person LoTR game. A very simple hack and slash with not much else in terms of variety. Yes you have an inventory, yes there is a good amount of items to obtain and equip, but it's a very run of the mill RPG.\n\nThe one cool thing about this game is that it's rated M, which doesn't sound like it's a really game changing feature, but it shows a lot that other LoTR games can't, and it gives a certain realism and gritty feeling while playing the game, which really brings you in to the Middle Earth Environment.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes LoTR, or Baldurs Gate. make sure your friends play with you too, because going through middle earth by yourself isn't a lot of fun.","March 6, 2014","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/recommended/32800/","thethoon","Thoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/","87 products in account","A decent mutiplayer-focused adventure, best consumed with friends.\nWar in the North capably follows in the footsteps of the old LotR action games. While not as tightly constructed as its predecessors, the broadened RPG elements and online functionality safely glides the game into the recommendable category. Each character plays uniquely enough, with three skills trees each to vary things even more. The combat plays similar enough to the aforesaid games, albeit with some Arkham counter-attacks thrown in. Very fun. Very silly.\n\nBut be warned...\nThat said, if you're searching for an expansive single-player RPG, keep looking. This game was made for online coop, something blatantly evident during offline party management. Simply described, there are two inventories: the player's inventory and the AI's inventory. The player's inventory encompasses any currently controlled character (whichever they may be), whether offline or online. But the AI's exists utterly autonomously (as it would with another player).\n\nSo say you're playing the ranger when you pick up a nice axe you'd like to use when playing the dwarf. To trade it, you need to save and exit the current game and reenter as the dwarf character. Think of it as logging and relogging between two toons on an MMO, except all of your characters share the same loot bags. Conversely, and this is IMPORTANT, if you just trade the axe to the cpu version of the dwarf, the item will be cast into the nether: the cpu's inventory. You will not get it back. You cannot force the npc to wield it. When you log into the dwarf character, you will not find it.\n\nThis extends to leveling up as well. As much as you may enjoy playing a particular character, I highly advise you regularly redo previous missions with whatever characters you've been neglecting. They will not level up or progress their skill branches on their own. They will gain XP, to be fair, but they become increasingly outmatched as the game goes on. So if you rock the first six levels with the dwarf and decide to finally switch things up and finish the game as the elf, prepare to be overwhelmed.","June 29, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's no fun playing this game solo. My girlfriend and I had been looking for a GOOD co op game for a while... we've tried tons of games, so when we got LOTR we didn't expect much... Combat felt REALLY boring at first but once we got leveled and got our skills/spells we had a bit more fun comboing certain moves. In terms of story we honestly were having too much trying to get better loot... The game almost feels like a third person Diablo which may sound bad but to be honest it's quite enjoyable finding new loot and new armor. In terms of what I dislike... I don't feel too attached to the story but that could be because I'm not that far into the story yet...

Do not look to the negative reviews from 3 years ago for advice. It has since been updated, and now plays fairly well with little or no problems. However, Carn Dum gave me a lot of trouble. The game dropped frames like it was having a seizure. I eventually got past that part, but not after the game crashed not once or twice, but three times.\nBe aware that you may die in this game A LOT. But once you get the hang of it, its very, very fun.\nBe prepared to kill Orcs, Uruk-Hai, Trolls, and evil men Legolas and Aragorn style (if playing as the man, Eradan). I recently tried playing as Farin as well. He's basically Gimli with a different voice and a crossbow. The crossbow is useful because you can get an upgrade that allows for an explosive bolt every once in a while. However, Farin is fairly slow as compared to Eradan and Andriel, and seems to die fairly easily as compared to them as well.\nIn conclusion, I give this game a 9.5/10 for awesome combat, a good story, and great enemies.","July 23, 2014","true","143.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really can not fathom why. Looking at the game (which was made for consoles and later ported to PC) I'd give it a 9/10. It offers really excellent storytelling and TONS of lore and LOTR backstory that you would miss out on in a pure action RPG. I also really enjoyed the cooperative experience the game provided, as I haven't had something like it since the days of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Playing the game alone is alright, but cooping it with 2 friends makes it outstanding.  My only complaint is that is a straight from console port, which means the textures and graphics quality don't keep up with what is "normal" for pc games these days. That being said, the animations are very smooth and pleasing to do and look at. The music is fantastic and rings true of LOTR, and the voice acting is actually pretty decent.

You play as a small group that fights in the north to buy time for the fellowship of the ring.  You get to encounter six of the members of the fellowship, along with other notable characters.

When I finally aquired the game, I dove into the world of Tolkien once more. And I was fairly happy with the results that I've found.\n\nFirst of all let me say that the world of LOTR "war in the north" is a delicous a mish mash from many of Tolkiens LOTR's resorces. Like the books, movies, cartoon animations as well as the endless Imagination of snowblind studio. Which makes a woundful effort in blending the game into character with the rest of the other stories without feeling stragnly out of place. The visuals are just amazing and the dialog is heroic and thoughtful.\n\nThe events of  LOTR "war in the north" characters were invented, well crafted, and detailed by the grandfather of modern fantasy Tolkien. You play either one of three main characters: the female elf lore master Andriel " the sorceress ", the dwarf warrior Farin "the warrior tank", and a human Dúnedain ranger Eradan "the roge". In the beging the trio are seen walking into the Prancing Pony in  the city of bree, heading to a table were Aragorn is sitting. They inform him that the Shire Guard at San Ford was attacked and that the Rangers have suffered a great loss. After the raid a Ringwraith mets with a man of great malice and power called Agandaur. He tells the Ringwraith that he had done as Sauron commanded and he has started gathering the Orcs of the north at the old ruins of Fornost. Farin questions why the enemy would build up a force against the Shire and Aragorn replies that a hobbit with a great burden is on the move to Bree. He asks them to help him keep the Hobbit safe by thwarting the enemies preparations at Fornost. And so begins your adventure.\n\nThe game play is a decent standard type of action RPG . Nothing ground braking INTERSTELLER MECHANICES THAT CHANGES THE GAMING WORLD!!! or anything like that. Nevertheless, still decent.\nAll three characters have mele and range attacks when battlling the endless hordes of orcs, cave trolls and goblins. There is also a combo system which makes the game more responsive. When a yellow bar shows on an enemy's head you get a chance to do a critical strike chope some heads off and gaining more XP.\nThe pacing of the game is done well. However, there are too many mounted cressbows sequences\nthat kinda feels repetitive to a point.\nOn the other hand the game has a good co-op game play of three players. Which changed the expreance of the game altogether. You and 2 more of your friends can jon forces and lead the attack on the eeevil orc meness. And saving the hobbits for certain dooooooooom.\n\nOverall, the game is a wonderful piece of art that shouldn't be overlooked.","May 11, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.).\n\nStory/Presentation: 6/10\n\nAgandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).\nI say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.\n\nGameplay: 5.5/10\n\nNothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\n\nWhilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.\n\nReplayability 6/10\n\nWhilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character. I think this is a nice idea, but personally I would have rather put the difficulty higher on my first playthrough, than be forced to wait until I've completed the game once. That being said, it's a nice option, and I think many will enjoy playing through again with a second character.\n\nConclusion: 6/10\n\nA fun game, nothing special, but worth a play through. I don't think this game is worth a full price purchase, but if you see it on offer definitely give it a go. I got this game from the humble bundle, and I thought I'd end up brushing over if but I'm glad that I didn't. Take that for what it's worth!","February 1, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teodor95/recommended/32800/","teodor95","Teodor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teodor95/","358 products in account","This is your generic fantasy rpg game. I would not even bother with it if not for the setting...Middle Earth ! And damn it adds a lot to the game. You can play as 1 of 3 characters (elf healer/mage , dwarf warrior / crossbow guy  and the ranger / tank dunadain.(2-handed sword dunadain warrior op:) ). Anyway I picked it up with 2 other friends and I really had fun...until I started getting blue screens. I dnk why I encountered this problem since my computer never behaved like this with any other game and i meet the specs with ease. It was not from the graphics settings of the game (tried so many options) and it felt really random (would happen at random times in the game , not even twice in the same place). Just wanted to lay that out before I continue. The action / Rpg elements are solid with different talent trees (and the leveling is at a good pace) , a lot of loot (that also changes how your character looks) and the coombat feels good and smooth , fluid. The graphics are decent , but an RPG is not about the graphics and since the gameplay is good i am willing to overlook that. The story is your pretty tipical fantasy story with a middle earth setting , but I admit I enjoy that (although it is predictable). The voice acting though , it's kinda on the low side. Also playing with friends increases the value of the game so much so keep that in mind.\n\n\nIn conclusion I would say that you should buy this game at full price if you are aware that you might encounter bugs and blue screens and are ok with it and if you have friends to play with.Otherwise wait for a sale if you want to buy it as playing alone will soon become boring and start to feel like a chore.","December 22, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only issue with the game is that if you play multiplayer the will be in game voice chat between you which you are unable to get rid off.

And fairly gory which is kind of cool really.\n\nYour character can learn some pretty sweet combat moves. The combat isn't super deep though, but that didn't bother me.\n\nQuite a lot of characters to talk to if you're interested in the lore aspect. If not you can just quickly click through the conversations.\n\nI also find the graphics to be pretty nice looking at some points wich is a +\n\nBut beware! A big warning!! This game can be pretty ridiculously buggy and glitchy. I played the entire game in a LAN setup. One of my computers handled it without a problem. My second one had really bad stuttering and some crashes. Also at one point the character I used on that computer somehow lost all his equipment and gained the same equipment my friends character had instead. Not sure what went wrong there.\n\nIf you accept all the problems some computers might have with this game it is awesome and you should get it.

I really can not fathom why. Looking at the game (which was made for consoles and later ported to PC) I'd give it a 9/10. It offers really excellent storytelling and TONS of lore and LOTR backstory that you would miss out on in a pure action RPG. I also really enjoyed the cooperative experience the game provided, as I haven't had something like it since the days of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Playing the game alone is alright, but cooping it with 2 friends makes it outstanding.  My only complaint is that is a straight from console port, which means the textures and graphics quality don't keep up with what is "normal" for pc games these days. That being said, the animations are very smooth and pleasing to do and look at. The music is fantastic and rings true of LOTR, and the voice acting is actually pretty decent.

With a limited number of co-op games on the market and fewer that are good, this game is worth a shot if you want to play with some friends online.  However, note that you will most likely run into some if not many bugs that plague this game.  Several times in the game my friends and I encountered save file corruption bugs, random crashes, and glitches that prevent progression.  Thankfully, since we were playing co-op many of the bugs could be bypassed by switching who was the host of the game and reloading the mission.\n\nOne big annoyance is the fact that the in game voice chat cannot be turned off or muted.  The audio quality is horrible (for one friend the audio was incomprehensible) and  sound effects are added to the audio to try and make it sound like you are in a cave when in your character in the game is in a cave.  There is one workaround to this for compatible sound card/drivers where you set your default microphone as a "Stereo Mix" or similar functionality and then select your real microphone in your team chat software.\n\nIf you decide to play this game, make sure you periodically back up your save files located at "%LocalAppData%\WB Games\War in the North".\n\nAlso before playing the last mission of "Carn Dun" make sure that you complete all the desired side quests and challenge missions because when you beat the game your save file game progress is reset (you still keep your levels and items) starting you back at the beginning of the game.  Also for the game host the game difficulty is automatically increased for the next play through (but the difficulty is not increased for the invited players).\n\nSo while my friends and I had fun playing the game, there was also a lot of frustration regarding the bugs in the game.  Still I recommend playing it with friends, for the right price, and knowing what bugs you will have to guard against.\n\nTL;DR Before playing familiarize yourself with the common bugs here "http://www.warinthenorth.com/forums/forum.php" and make sure to periodically back up your save games.","November 25, 2013","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much.\n\nBiggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card.\n\nIt's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/recommended/32800/","GazNation","Gazpins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GazNation/","165 products in account","It's a decent game, there are just some flaws which bring it down. I originally played through basically the entire game on PS3 until a glitch occurred that made it so I was unable to progress past the spider boss regardless of how many times I beat it.\n\nThe game is quite a bit of fun on co-op and the combat is simple and satisfying. However, quite possibly the biggest problem with this is that the game forces voice chat upon you. There is no options in-game to disable the voice, make it push-to-talk, or to even mute other players. There is no way to disable the voice in this game without disabling the audio entirely. This wouldn't be a problem if the game chat was half decent, but from my experience it's delayed, echoey, and just overall unpleasant. Apparently there are work arounds for this, but I couldn't manage to figure them out, and really, I shouldn't have to go through that just to do something that should be so simple. Eventually I found the voice chat as part of the game's charm, but I don't really mean that in a good way.\n\nThe skill trees offer a basic variation to each of the characters' playstyles without getting unnecessarily complex. Treasure chests and hidden caches give a reason to off the path in search of better gear. There isn't much exploration to do otherwise, though. If you enjoy always getting new gear and improving stats (like me) then you will enjoy the equipment aspect of this game.\n\nCombat can get a bit tedious and there doesn't seem to really be variation in objectives. It's always going to be go here, defend here, open this all whilst holding off waves of orcs and the like. This is kind of to be expected, though. It's not like there was much else that could have been done with this style of game, but in long sessions you may find the game becoming repetitive.\n\nIf you have friends to play this with I would recommend it. Maybe not for $20 though. If you don't have friends, well, the AI isn't all that sturdy from my experience, so you'll be doing a lot of reviving.\n\nGloin / 10.","March 16","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very good story line and it is very fun to play. Combat scenes are very entertaining and very enjoyable to be a part of. The game is challanging but easy enough to focus on the storyline. They do a great job in tieing it in to the overall storyline of LOTR. I basically blitz the game to near the end (although my save file somehow deleted so I wasn't able to finish the game)\n\nDefinately recomend playing this game!","June 28, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have no idea why it scored so low in the reviews.\n\nA good story, excellent voice acting, nice graphics with tons of options for the PC version, and it never crashed on me once. it's a pretty long game (expect about 15-20 hours your first time through on Normal), lots of secrets to find, three different characters to play (each with their own play styles and each of them fun), and it has an absolute metric ton of loot to find, all of which alters the look of your characters, to go along with some good customization options.\n\nThe combat is simple but takes awhile to master, and it does get more involved on Heroic and Legendary difficulties, both of which are excellently balanced (though there are a few huge difficulty spikes in certain quests.)\n\nAll in all, this is an awesome game, well worth 20 bucks.

On average my game crashed every about every 2 hours. I reinstalled the video drivers and even tried beta versions but this did not resolve the problem. Some say you have to install a really old driver to fix the issue but I have not verified this. Otherwise, the game runs smooth on highest quality, except for the last area which seems to be laggy for a lot of people even with newer GPUs or Nvidia ones.\nIt feels like the difficulty doesn't scale up in Heroic and Legendary modes. I would not have minded e.g. twice the number of enemies on hardest difficulty.\nThe game only saves when you see the save icon, so not necessarily after travelling or a boss fight. You might want to talk to a shop keep or smith and cancel out to force a save if you just got some new loot or a reward.\nThe AI can be derpy at times too. Buddies and enemies can get stuck in some areas or teleport around.\nOne optional mission (the mithril one) can not be completed without someone playing as dwarf. If you are playing by yourself as either lore-master or ranger you will have to revisit a certain area as a dwarf.\nI think there is a money glitch which gives you infinite money once you reach 999,999. At least you can buy some nice equipment for your buddies (like 300k crossbows).\nLevel capped at 40. It would be sweet to be able to unlock and upgrade all skills and be even more OP. Oh well.\nPlayed on: Windows 7 with Xbox 360 controller, 3 playthroughs as lore-master (1 in co-op), all achievements.","August 10, 2014","true","42.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found it a worthy use of time, and I never felt like I wasted money (granted it was free with something else I bought haha).\n\nOnly one point in the game I was very ticked off with (the part with the two trolls, and a door, in the Siege). I must have failed so many times with that, and ONLY passed it because the trolls 'glitched' and just stood transfixed on the door instead of hitting it. Only bad part of the game, ridiculous difficulty (worse than the end battles!), and only passable due to a glitch.\n\nAnyhow, I enjoyed this game. Smooth graphics, wonderful locations and atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/32800/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","Many LotR fans might expect a slow-paced, narrative-heavy, immersive experience. War in the North however just gives you a middle-earthy vignette or a short stay in a very stripped down Bree, Imladris, etc. to provide you with weapon repairs, a shop, and an excuse to leave said location after ten minutes or less. Thus the equipped, we meet the meat of the game, a very linear romp through dungeons, moors, forests etc. where our job is to whack everything we meet. That's it. It's actually quite fun, but in a "a drink and a laugh" (ideally with up to two mates in co-op mode) way more than in a "curled up with a book and an unending sense of wonder" way, if that makes any sense. The game feels extremely arcade-y, from graphics to linearity to gameplay. (To actually put it in a real arcade, they'd have to turn the RPG-y clickable dialogs into cut scenes, and that'd be it.)\n\nMechanics: The game has three main characters (dwarven "warrior", human "ranger", elven "wizard"), of which the latter is a woman. Each character has their own skill tree. Characters that don't have a human player are controller by the AI (so if you play solo, you'll play in a group of three with two computer-controlled characters). The looks of your avatar can be edited (if you manage to find a mirror in-game, of which there are at least two), but the editor is very basic (a handful of attributes with six or so values each (hair color, face shape, eye color, hairdo -- in fact, that may be it already).\n\nThe game caters to the casual gamer. The combat system provides for some token variation without being complicated, and it's nigh impossible to get lost in the levels. If you only get to play once a  week, no problem, it's not like you could forget the current quest ("follow the path, kill everything"). The player characters are never really fleshed out in terms of backstory, so that's another thing you can't forget, and the story is pretty straight forward. Easy mode actually is easy. The game works nicely with a 360 controller. I can't speak to the other two classes, but the "loremaster" (wizard) skill tree had a sufficient amount of sane options.\n\nGameplay for the most part is quite fluid, though confusingly, WitN introduces a variety of game elements early on (while you're still learning the ropes and what to expect from the world; there is no out-and-out tutorial level) that are never picked up again later -- there's a side-quest that will timeout and fail if you do too many other things before completing that quest, but it seems to be the only one that does that. There are "mines" in the very first location that we're taught can be used to break large structures in the environment, except that we never see the mines again later on, and there's pretty much 0 interaction with the superstructure for the rest of the game. Another early level has a "find the key to progress through this door" situation, but again, it's the only time that happens in the entire game. (To add insult to injury, this happens after we've been taught for a good while what chests look like in the game -- only for the key to be in the sole chest in the game that looks different. Specifically, it looks like a slab of stone or a sarcophagus or what not. Also, it's in the darkest part of the dungeon, so, good luck not running past it.) Mind, those things are not so much a nuisance as they are puzzling. Had they planned to have more content to that effect? Was QC asleep? What was going on? :)\n\nLong story short, if you like fantasy and would like to solo or co-op through linear levels of a fantasy world that happens to nominally be MiddleEarth (it's much easier to believe the Middle-Earth part during the interludes; the action/arcade sequences feel like they could be anything), go for it. It's a nice, uncomplicated, casual game. If you're more the RPG/adventure type or expect deep immersion or generally feel like Tolkien is serious business, you may wish to give this game a pass.\n\nBought for $1.99 or so during Steam Sale, which, seeing as I completed the game, made it an excellent buy. Buy at $4.99 or better. It may only be worth full price to big LotR fans -- ones who are OK with the premise of an arcade-y game, and one where you don't play a character from the books.\n","February 3, 2014","true","45.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

This game was a personal favorite of mine. You battle through the North, accompanied with loyal friends, on a variety of dificulties with boss battles at the end of each level providing a harder challenge each time. On completion of the game you can restart to where it all begins with all your gear and complete it on a higher difficulty. The game also  has multiplayer for those missions you need help with.

This one... is AWESOME.There really is not exxagertation in my use of this term. The graphics and voice acting and constant freshness of the storylines inspire awe and leave you feeling the effects of it on a level that is just pure enjoyable FUN.\n\nI have played close to every Middle Earth based game that has existed to date, from pen and paper campaigns to console to old school computer varieties and I can honestly say-I have not played such a purely great Lord of the Rings/Middle Earth game in more than a decade.\n\nA wonderfully fresh and unique storyline within the LoTR Universe,the beautiful graphics, easy controls all add up to make it great.\n\nTo to top it all off, it does not even come with any sort of steep or long term learning curve. Less than 30 minutes in, and you will be a pro at controlling every aspect of your character from simple combat to speclized moves.\n\nThe voice acting is beautifully done for all cut scenes, both full and user input questioons/responses.\n\nJust a truly wonderful Middle-Earth game, and well worth the investment.\n\nWant more information? You start your role as not one of the major movie characters-but rather, a enitrely new storyline. Connected to the same time as the events of the main LoTR books and characters, but your own adventure. This gives two major advantages: One, the story is fresh and new. You don't automatically know what the next turn in the story will bring. The second bonus is that by having your own character, you have more 'freedom' in the way your character plays out. You have your own opinions and thoughts on the events that happen and are given different options to discuss and respond to them. This makes the character fel like it is yours, rather than you just steering a well-known character down the same, well worn path that everyone knows by heart from the books and films.\n\nThe con? If there is a con here-it would be that it may just be too addictive. You can easily lose yourself in it for hours at a stretch.  I honestly have nothing bad I can say about this particular RPG and in such a vast genre with so many options, there are very few games within it that can get this level of praise from me.\n\nLong story short: if you are only going to get one game in a month at this price, any fan of the RPG Genre, and especially lovers of the Middle Earth world, would be well-advised to choose this game to spend their hard earned cash on. It is worth every penny.","November 16, 2013","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Another early level has a "find the key to progress through this door" situation, but again, it's the only time that happens in the entire game. (To add insult to injury, this happens after we've been taught for a good while what chests look like in the game -- only for the key to be in the sole chest in the game that looks different. Specifically, it looks like a slab of stone or a sarcophagus or what not. Also, it's in the darkest part of the dungeon, so, good luck not running past it.) Mind, those things are not so much a nuisance as they are puzzling. Had they planned to have more content to that effect? Was QC asleep? What was going on? :)\n\nLong story short, if you like fantasy and would like to solo or co-op through linear levels of a fantasy world that happens to nominally be MiddleEarth (it's much easier to believe the Middle-Earth part during the interludes; the action/arcade sequences feel like they could be anything), go for it. It's a nice, uncomplicated, casual game. If you're more the RPG/adventure type or expect deep immersion or generally feel like Tolkien is serious business, you may wish to give this game a pass.\n\nBought for $1.99 or so during Steam Sale, which, seeing as I completed the game, made it an excellent buy. Buy at $4.99 or better. It may only be worth full price to big LotR fans -- ones who are OK with the premise of an arcade-y game, and one where you don't play a character from the books.\n","February 3, 2014","true","45.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, enjoyed the setting in Skyrim and especially if you are not afraid of some repetitive but challenging Hack'n'Slay action, you might find this game entertaining. I bought it for 5 EUROS and I have to say these are besides of the one I payed for Left4Dead2 the best invested 5 Euros since a long for a game. I enjoy a lot the graphics, especially the great 3d vision support, the music and the unique Lord of the Rings atmosphere. The fighting system starts poor, but gets better while playing and let you really take part in its evolution. Overall, you should give the game a chance as I am sure it will entertain you much longer than some AAA titles for 10 times more of the price. Btw, it has also a great Coop-Modus with some minor glitches. At the moment there are still some players, so you should hurry up, if you want to enjoy this feature. Overall I give it for 8/10 as I am already addicted, even with way too many weird glitches the game sometimes has. But what counts in the end is not if a game is full with different feature, but if it can entertain for quite some time and there War in the North makes far more right than it messe up: 8/10.","September 8, 2013","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you are looking for an interesting, simple hack n slash game that works fine with 3 human players, this is it.\n\nBasically an action game, with some simple role-playing thrown in and a linear story to follow, it allows for some really interesting coop playing if you have 3 human players. The whole story depends on your party of threee, so the game already looses much of its charm if only one of the 3 heroes is AI-controlled!!!\n\nI would not recommend it if you want to play alone, there are better single player hack n slash games around.

But beware if you plan on playing this game you will have to play co-op or have to play as the dwarf to get the skill taunt, as in chapter 7 part 3 its pretty impossible to kill 2 trolls whilst needing to protect a gate. The game also has more flaws such as this being an RPG you cant swap characters and this is very annoying as you cannnot choose what upgrades for them nor can you change thier equipment, you can only give them items, whether they use them or not is another matter so you have to take notes down as to what defence and strength they have.","July 27, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/recommended/32800/","ANCRON","ANCRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/","352 products in account","3rd person, hack and slash, story driven, action RPG in Lord of the Rings universe, that follows the story of the Lord of the Rings books / movies, yet is presented from a different angle, where you play as one of the three heroes set on a quest to eliminate Sauron's mysterious ally in the north.\n\nStory is very similar to the movies, and you meet many known characters throughout your journey, like Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas and many more. Most of the time you can only interact with them in "safe" hubs like towns and scripted cut-scenes.\n\nEven if you didn't watch the movies, there's fair amount of lore available through dialogues if you chose investigate dialogue options. I didn't encounter choice and consequence in dialogues, so probably they are straight forward and just there for information, lore and story.\n\nCombat is mostly hack and slash, with melee weapons as well as ranged ones, depending on hero. You defeat enemies, find loot in linear levels with some hidden passages and secrets here and there. After leveling up you get skill points you can spec into 3 trees, and stats points you can increase stats with, so your basic RPG elements.\n\nYou can find, buy or get as a reward different kinds of armor pieces and weapons. I have no clue if you can equip your AI controlled allies, but you can trade with them, and if you play in co-op, it's a good idea to trade and offer items you don't use to party members, as you often find items not wearable by your hero.\n\nCo-op is strongest aspect of this game, it's really fun and enjoyable, with great synergy between heroes. Dwarf can be tank or tanky melee warrior, Elf has healing, shields and support spells, and Human is basically archer or rogue damage dealer. All heroes have some sort of ranged attacks and require some aiming to successfully hit enemies.\n\nGame offers some side quests and challenge locations besides the main story. You can revisit almost any level for additional loot and XP. Dwarf can collect ore and bash through weak walls to uncover secret areas. Elf can gather herbs and brew potions as well as dispel magically sealed areas. Human however can only gather hidden cashes of supplies, and is a bit dull compared to other heroes.\n\nThere's decent variety of enemies in the game, orcs, trolls, spiders, humans, wyrms, dragons, just to name a few. AI is straight forward, usually rushing you head on as melee or shooting from range with ranged attacks, bigger creatures and bosses have special attacks and require careful positioning or dodging to not get hit. You can easily fall in battle after couple direct hits, unless you dodge or block the attacks.\n\nEnvironments look good yet lack detail, texture quality on characters is decent with somewhat low quality on environments. Visually game looks similar to "Game of Thrones" game. Voice acting and facial animations are decent enough and sound similar to the characters from the movies, yet I doubt there's any line from the actual actors in the game.\n\nFor a game made in 2011 it doesn't look that good, and could be much better with serious polish, never the less the story and 3 player co-op makes this game very enjoyable 12 hour experience. With hero switching and story replay on harder difficulties, this game will give you up to 30 hours of "content". I experienced some disconnects while playing in co-op, so it has some network issues, make sure if someone disconnect to not advance in story, and just remake the lobby.\n\nEnjoy.","September 20, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHyperion1/recommended/32800/","SourHyperion1","The Spanish Inquisition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHyperion1/","282 products in account","Do I recommend playing this game? Yes.\nWhat's the catch? Of course there's a catch:\n\nSTORY: The story in this is interesting, but don't expect some major twist. If you played the Third Age, it's kind of that same setup. Your mission is to support the fellowship by distacting Sauron's forces away from Frodo and gang. You'll meet the likes Aragon and Gandalf, but there's one problem: the voice acting. I'll give Gandalf's voice actor credit, he really tries to sound like Sir Ian, but he just falls short. Aragon's is just awful. It's not to the point where I can't listen to it, but don't be suprised when he sound's nothing like his film counterpart.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is what I imagine would happen if you took Dragon Age and Skyrim and paid them to make a baby. You've got the run around and find loot off of enemies and hidden chests like Skyrim (Yes, I know Dragon Age has it but I don't have to go find a Rogue whenever I find a chest in this game). The combat itself feels like a mix of Dragon Age, Skyrim, Arkham, and only the slightest hint of Gears of War. You have your two team mates that do somewhat support you unless you're playing in Coop (That's an entirely different discussion) and in a way it reminds me of Dragon Age, except that I have no control over them. It's like Skyrim in that there is no pause feature; you are constantly in the midst of the battle. It's like Arkham in the sense that you have really neat slow motion finishing moves occasionally (Yes, I know Skyrim has those, too, but I think that Arkham's has more in common with the style this game has). When I saw Gears of War, though, I don't refer to the cover shooting mechanic, I mean more of the coop system. Even in a singleplayer game, when you lose all of your health, you will go into a downed position and can slowly crawl to your teammates like in Gears. The constant, "Get on that turret!" command also seems reminicient of Gears to me, also. Aside from combat, you will be navigating a fairly linear world populated with breakable barrels, secret caches, and tons of Orcs. It's fairly simple in that regard. You progress through the level, break barrels for ammo, loot, and coins, occasionally stop at random places to purchase new gear or sell loot, and then carry on.\n\nGRAPHICS: I would say these Graphics remind me of Dragon Age 2, particularly in the environment. The way it's textured and modeled just reminds me of it. The ground doesn't look like, say, Halo or Crysis where you look at the ground and think how pretty it looks (I know that sounds weird, but seriously look down sometimes.) The ground looks like it kind of all blends together and there is no distinct place where a rock sticks up or grass ends and sand or dirt starts aside from a bland change in texture on a flat face. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different story. The characters look really sharp and well rendered. The clothes flow when you run, there aren't random sharp edges on the character, etc.\n\nOVERALL: Overall I'd say this is a neat game. If you like Lord of the Rings or want an RPG that you won't spend 50+ hours running around in like Dragon Age or Skyrim, absolutely invest in this game, but I'd stick to buying it on a sale. This game is by no means remarkable. It isn't going to astound you with its story, blow you away with its soundtrack or voice acting, etc. It's a game that manages to ride right in the middle where you'll enjoy playing through it, maybe play it again with some friends, and then occasionally look at it as you scroll through your Steam library and think how much fun it would be to play Shadow of Mordor which sits right above it.\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's really fun and doesn't get boring. The game also lets you play as 3 diffirent characters - each of them having diffirent armors, weapons, skills, and their own other characteristic things (Like one being a warrior, one a ranger and one a mage). The only problem with the gameplay that I have is the fact that it's kinda unbalanced. The game itself seems quite easy for the most part, and the challange missions are overly hard. Though it still isn't a huge problem in my opinion, thankfully.\n\nThe story is a not-too-complicated, good and entertaining story. SMALL SPOILER Though you get to meet the characters from the original LotR story, which is quite rad\n\nThe soundtrack is really good and has that LotR-ish style, of course. It really fits your current environment in the game.\n\nThe graphics are quite good (except on the main menu, where for some reason they are awfully blurry, but that's just the menu) and puts attention to small details - like your character getting temporarily dirty after rolling on the ground. The game also makes some really badass looking view changes and slow-motion when delivering the final blow to the last enemy in your area, which is awesome.\n\nReally reccomending buying this game to people who like actiony games.","November 11, 2014","true","20.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is compelling though not as much as the serie it is derived from. It plays easier and is more compelling when played with two friends. The side stories are nice and give for a fine additional touch. However the game does not arrive without it's flaws because If played alone (speaking from own experience) it might get repetitve. Creating the combination strategies with up to two friends and trying to complete the hardest modes is what makes the game fun. With a possibly ignorant AI the latter is difficult to achieve. Therefore I recommend the game, however do not buy it just because you are a fan of the series because you might get dissapointed without your favourite heroes being playable and but little references made to them throughout the story. Besides all this I hope you have fun playing it if you decide to buy it.","December 5, 2013","true","24.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game.\n\nTHE STORY: We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.\n\nGRAPHICS: Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.\n\nINTERFACE: Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited\nspace and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.\n\nGAMEPLAY: We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.\n\n-	For the Ranger: Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s,  the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree.\n\n-	For the Lore-master: Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game.\n\n-	For the Champion: Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL.\n\nOverall conclusion: ‘Lord of the rings: War in the north’ is a must if you are a fan over LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come on Heroic and Legendary difficulty) and we didn’t get bored with the storyline once. And once again: THIS GAME IS AWESOME!! *No addiction what so ever* Hahahahaha!!\n\nEnjoy the game!\n","April 29, 2015","true","54.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a really fun to play action rpg, especially in co-op, and has some good (albeit visually dated) designwork. The combat is gritty and satisfying. Story and characters are decent, but not particularly memorable. The adventure is fairly epic, and sends you to some interesting places in middle-earth.\n\nAnd now that we've covered the positives, on to the regretable bit: It seems proper quality assurance wasn't implemented or Warner Bros just said the product was "good enough." I've played this game on the Xbox 360 and the PC, and BOTH versions have severe game crashing bugs. It is so bad, that I cannot progress any further in either version, though I did get much further on the PC. WB was apparently working on a patch years back, but that seems to have gone nowhere.\n\nI had bought the 360 version used, and the PC version through a humble bundle event. If I had bought it at normal retail price, I'd have demanded my money back. It's a shame really, since the game is pretty fun otherwise. I can only hope WB realizes the full value of good quality control and testing. I get the feeling they just cut the QA department's budget (or the dept. completely) to save on development costs.\nA real damn shame...\n\nPS: So far I've only heard of issues plaguing gamers with AMD GPUs. Nvidia owners might not experience these bugs.","January 30, 2014","false","22.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And this is a huge plus, as is observed a clear link with the canon, but at the same time retain their essential game originality and uniqueness.\nGameplay pleases: RPG inherent management retains its form. With this, no one will not have problems. It's pretty simple and universal. Pumping capacity, sales of necessary and unnecessary - it is very important in the game process and at the same time not annoying. The combat system is individual for each of the characters, intended for their weapons with armor have their advantages and disadvantages (it is clearly demonstrated in the description of each species), the level of skills can and should be improved.\nAI in single coil mode, of course, not always on top - there are times when allies can just hang in place, and they will not move until you dislotsirueshsya at the next checkpoint. But these are trifles.\nEnemies in general classrooms. Canonical, active merzkovaty and terrible. Ordinary really filthy orcs; Uruk-hai are dangerous because of their size and power advantages; Trolls are huge, but slow and stupid; numerous spiders, goblins and the dead included in the category of those who are disgusted with their large numbers. This is all the awesome games.\nParticularly pleased that the main characters meet Fellowship of the Ring, and have the honor to talk to them.\nMusical accompaniment retains the inherent "Lord of the Rings" atmosphere that makes me nostalgic every time.\nMy score: 9 out of 10.","March 21, 2015","true","57.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is kinda annoying but if you have friends to play with you, the experience is very rewarding and funny.\nFrom my PoV, I find odd how this game was abandoned by the developer.

It's terrible console port and game was clearly made for casual console gamers. Even game menu is terrible - they had to think really hard, how to make it that bad and unusable.\nGraphics on maximum are awful, there are not many resolution settings, and what's funny, to enter option you have to first click Settings and then a menu shows... with only 1 option which is "OPTIONS", why? Same when you try to start the game - "You are attempting to run the game. Do you really want it? 1) Yes, start the game 2) No"\n\nHuman character looks like actor from a cheap movie, fortunately you can change that.\nDialogues are written very poorly, like game target was 10 yo children.\nControlling game with mouse is irritating - Y axis is less sensitive than X.\nThere are crates every-freaking-where, that you can destroy to get loot. It's like collecting beans in HARRY POTTER.\nWhen you run out of HP, your character starts crouching and enemies ignore you, even when you follow them.\nThere are tons of invisible walls - 1 step of stairs, but approached from wrong way? NO PASSAGE! Some rocks half of your height blocking the path - NO WAY.\n\nI'm a big LOTR fan and it's sad that most LOTR games are pure ♥♥♥♥. I don't know why people accept how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is.

To make things simple, if you can buy this on sale for $5 or less, then I'd say it's probably worth playing if you're into generic hack and slash RPGs. Otherwise, this could have been an awesome reimagining of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath but falls flat in so many areas.\n\nCombat encounters are loads of fun at first because you're not hindered by the awful AI partners; they can actually kill enemies, revive you, and face groups on their own without your constant babysitting. About 6 hours in (of around 12-14), the beefier enemy types stop reacting to your moves which turns the fun hack and slash combat into a chore of "XXY, roll away or block, XXY, etc," and reviving your AI partners because they don't block or roll. About another 2 hours after that, though, you run into enemies who interrupt your attacks and can stun lock you, so good luck reviving anyone once one of your partners is down unless you're lucky (or play Ranger and abuse his Evasion skill).\n\nThere's also no sense of empowerment as you gain new abilities and equipment. Even ignoring the fact that most abilities (for even the Lore-Master/Wizard) are just boring power attacks that have a cooldown, they never end up doing enough damage to make them feel worth while as you progress through the game. New enemies are thrown at you in such a way that by the time you're doing significantly more damage, the enemies have double the health they used to.\n\nI'm not sure how common the technical issues are (seems like more of an AMD thing), but unless you want to downgrade drivers you can probably expect to deal with an inconsistent framerate that BOMBS for seemingly no reason at certain points in the game. Bugs are littered throughout as well, but I didn't run into anything that wasn't solved by quitting and reloading a checkpoint.\n\nI should note I didn't play any coop in the game, so maybe that saves some of the issues with its combat, but it's hard to believe the studio that made the amazing Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath released this. It could have been so much more.","July 7, 2014","false","14.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Tells the adventures of three characters who are supposed to defeat the evil sorcerer Agandaur. He is a servant of Sauron himself.\nDuring the game we control one hero, but at any time we can go out to the menu and change to another . We can also play with your friends in co-op. We choose a knight, a magical elf or dwarf. Every characters have a very extensive skill tree.\n\nExcept to the main thread there is a mass of non core tasks for which we get the experience and valuable items.\nWhen searching very interesting locations we will face many opponents from the orcs to the huge snow trolls.\n\nGraphics are very nice and pleasing to the eye.\n\nI recommend.","January 11, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(a free punch in the jewels, tells me more than 1 person have sold an item they were using)\n\nDont get me startet on how incredibly weak the gear switching is, if you play solo you have to log out, switch char and then gear up, so unless you can remeber exactly what the other 2 are wearing, it just a massive hassle.\n\nNo going back: ye gods, how i hate that completely linear console way, where you drop downa a 30cm drop and now you cant go back, its in the top 5 reasons why consoles are the worst.\n\nDurability: its just so meh to have durability, and having to repair stuff, yuck\n\nCompanions: When you play solo, they dont wear the gear you give them, or play by the skills you put point into, thats just weak sauce.\n\nIm sure there are a ton more stuff that i forgot.\n\nBut when all is said and done, i played the game to the end, and didnt regret it, my ragemeter was just maxed, at seeing that a few core changes could have made this game great, now its just mediocre.\n\nThe combat is fun, albeit i am partial to blood, gore and dismemeberment, you have RPG elements, and gear upgrading, story and VA is decent.\n","December 26, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's terrible console port and game was clearly made for casual console gamers. Even game menu is terrible - they had to think really hard, how to make it that bad and unusable.\nGraphics on maximum are awful, there are not many resolution settings, and what's funny, to enter option you have to first click Settings and then a menu shows... with only 1 option which is "OPTIONS", why? Same when you try to start the game - "You are attempting to run the game. Do you really want it? 1) Yes, start the game 2) No"\n\nHuman character looks like actor from a cheap movie, fortunately you can change that.\nDialogues are written very poorly, like game target was 10 yo children.\nControlling game with mouse is irritating - Y axis is less sensitive than X.\nThere are crates every-freaking-where, that you can destroy to get loot. It's like collecting beans in HARRY POTTER.\nWhen you run out of HP, your character starts crouching and enemies ignore you, even when you follow them.\nThere are tons of invisible walls - 1 step of stairs, but approached from wrong way?

While Frodo and the Fellowship were dangling from a pitchfork above a kettle, the northern lands were defended by stalwarts (unknown) heroes, of which you happen to be part of. As you progress through the story you'll come to realize that, no matter the difficulty, your NPCs are dull and won't serve you well in dire situations.\n\nThat's where CO-OP mode kicks in. Secure a Teamspeak server with your friends, form your heroic trio and go kill some of Sauron's lackeys.

You'll get 10-14 hours of story about the Middle Earth and will follow a group of 3 heroes that try to make difference at the North. A story trully is beautiful and you'll meet some characters from the book/movies, will get to talk to them as well, which in my opinion was a great plus to the story.\n\nAs I already said before, the story itself is beautiful. Characters are well writen, music is beautiful, voiceacting is perfect and atmosphere is fantastic. Another thing that I found to be great (although didn't used it myself too much) was the ability to switch between characters in the end of each level, so that you could try all playbable character without starting the game all over again. Co-op is also an option (although I played solo because I wanted to get into the story as much as possible) and it is infact a lot of fun !\n\nAll in all, I really did enjoyed the game and can't but recommend it!","November 2, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/32800/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR: Third Person hack/slash RPG similar to Dragon Age 2, but set in Tolkien’s Middle-Earth. Melee combat has a similar feel as the first Witcher game where you kind of need to flow from one hit to the next to build up strike power. The game appears to be built around multiplayer co-op, but I’ve only played single-player thus far. WARNING: If you have an ATI/AMD video card you will probably have technical trouble with this game. Big thumbs down for the game breaking bug (near the very end) - 2/10. Would have been 6/10 if the game actually worked.\n\nIf you liked Dragon Age 2 more than you liked Dragon Age Origins (not many people do) you might want to give Lord of the Rings: War in the North a try. The game is more linear and focused on combat than world-building. This might have to do with the fact that the “main story” is happening elsewhere (Fellowship of the Ring) and you’re just the distraction to help Frodo sneak into Mordor.\n\nYou play one member of a trio of adventurers at around the start of the first Lord of the Rings novel. Before Frodo, Aragorn, and their buddies start their journey to Mount Doom, Farin the dwarf (melee fighter), Eradan the ranger (archer), and Andriel the elf (mage) are fighting the good fight against the servants of the dark lord Sauron, who are led by a bad dude named Agandaur. Since Agandaur is Sauron’s right hand man fighting the bad fight in the north, your goal is to smash him and draw Sauron’s attention away from the south, where the Fellowship of the Ring are making their way into enemy territory.\n\nThe game is played in the third person perspective and while you can only play as one of the three characters at a time, you get opportunities to switch which character you’re playing between game chapters. Really though, you should probably stick with one character per playthrough because the game will auto assign the stats and skills of the characters you aren’t using when they level up, and you won’t get much opportunity to customize if you keep switching around. Unlike the Dragon Age games, you don’t control the whole team, just the guy you’re playing. Also, you’re controlling all your character’s attacks as well, not just designating a target.\n\nLike many hack and slash action RPG’s you run into a lot of loot and equipment in the game. You pretty much have as many equipment slots as Diablo 2, but most of the gear you find is “non-magical” and can be easily compared to similar pieces. This means there isn’t much in the way of randomly generated loot stats, and you don’t need to spend much time grinding for items. In fact, you probably shouldn’t even buy weapons from the vendors because chances are you’ll just find something better in about 10 minutes.\n\nPros:\n+Co-op gameplay available so you can go through the single player campaign with a friend or two. Each character has a unique “secret finding” skill that can only be used when a human is controlling the character (in single player, you only find secrets that your character can “see”) so if you have a full team of human players you can find all the secrets in a level. Also, bear in mind that like many squad based games, you can revive your allies if they’re knocked out. So you don’t need to spend too many healing potions if you know your buddy can just bring you back to life at full health.\n+Decent story that takes you all over Middle Earth (well, a lot of it) and involves some of the characters from the Lord of the Rings books/movies. Why don’t the eagles just fly everyone everywhere? Play the game and find out!\n\nCons:\n-This is the big one. If you have an AMD video card like I do (Radeon 7850) you will find the game has extremely poor frame rate at many places. I was unable to finish because at the last chapter, the game slowed to a crawl and would crash out repeatedly at the same place. Searching online, this seems to be a problem for a lot of people. My friend has an nVidia GPU and didn’t have this issue.\n-The “critical hit” system of the game can be fun sometimes but after a while it gets really repetitive. You built up power by continuously hitting a single enemy uninterrupted and eventually you can use a power attack with a chance of instantly killing them. Problem is, this means it takes like 2 minutes to kill many of the more powerful enemies, especially near the end of the game. Also, you only hit one enemy at a time no matter how wide your swings look, so attacking large groups of bad guys is really annoying (the little ankle-biters keep interrupting your combos against the big guys).\n-Despite how linear the game plays, it’s still possible to miss side quests because many of the quest items are randomly dropped. Cleared the whole area and didn’t find the special quest rock? Too bad for you, play through it again.\n-You can’t see the enemy’s life (except for bosses) and most bad guys seem to have a ton of life. This is probably intentional to force players to use the critical hit system more, but it means every fight seems artificially prolonged. Should it really take 50 hits to kill an orc?\n\nOverall, the game is fun (when it’s working) if you enjoy hack and slash and want to dive once again into Lord of the Rings lore, but there’s a lot of room for improvement. The fact that there are 3 playable character classes is reason for replay, but from what I’m told they’re mostly the same. If this game is in your backlog you should push it back in favor of something better, but it’s worth playing eventually: IF you have an nVidia graphics card. The game’s developers have abandoned the project so the crashing/low frame rate issues will not be fixed. The 90% of the game that I got to experience was sort of fun.\n","May 7, 2015","false","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I managed to get through Chapter 2, despite the crazy amount of frame drops, stuttering, crash to desktops, had to restart the computer a few times, etc. Chapter 8 though. I just can't do it. I manage to get to a part where I'm supposed to find a lever after travelling through a series of sewage pipes under a fortress and the game just freezes up after a crazy amount of stuttering and frame drops. Just not good optimization for AMD cards.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad. It's a fun action RPG in the Tolkein universe, so I was sold right away. You get to choose one of three characters, a man, a dwarf, and an elf. And you're not stuck with just that character, you can switch off in the main menu and continue from where you left off with any of the other characters. The combat is neat, but maybe a bit repetivie. The graphics are okay, but the character animation is pretty terrible. The combat animation, however, is actually great. The story isn't too compelling but you get to explore recognizable parts in the Tolkein universe as well as areas that have been mentioned but not necessarily explored in the novels or films. Basically, the plot involves the three characters banding together to fight off an evil force to the north while the Fellowship travels south towards Mordor.\n\nI should mention the gameplay as well. It's extremely linear. Basically, you enter an area which is counted as a "Chapter", and you continue along a path in that area in Middle-earth until the end of the Chapter. So it's not open world if that's what any of you wanted to know.\n\nIf you have an Nvidia card and are a Tolkein fan, this game is good fun for its duration. No real replay value though.\n\n7.0/10 (Nvidia cards)\n\n5.0/10 (AMD cards)","February 17","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing special.\nIt's somewhat repetitive with the battles but nothing tragic. It's fun and simple.\n\nNot recommended for ATI users as well. Near the end it was literally unplayable because it was crashing constantly at Carn Dûm, stuttering and it was full of artifacts. I tried many guides with the hope it can be fixed, but nothing helped significantly. And some guides suggested to update bios or install older drivers. Of course i wouldn't go so far and put my self into such trouble for this game. I managed to complete it, by giving my save files to a friend of mine with nvidia so he could pass the point where my game was unplayable.\n\nAnyway, despite the terrible optimization, the game is okay, has okay graphics, it's a bit slow with the dialogs. Wouldn't spend money on it though, maybe when it is -85% off.

However, various things deny that potential. 5 second knockdowns, your companions blocking your way, no flinching upon being hit resulting in just dropping dead, litte logic within the story line and to much a linear way to play.\n\nAlso, having to choose a single class and the game forcing you to play that class till the end of the game, since all the fancy equipment you gave to your AI companions will be gone when you select them. Making sure that once you change, you've got no way to match the equipment to that level, unless you buy yourself the equipment, which is only possible after  you've reached Rivendell.\n\nAll in all, if the devs payed some more time upon developing the game, it would've been recommendable and enjoyable.

First thing you'll notice is the terrible in-game mic and the fact that you can't turn it off at all, which means if you have TS or Skype going you have to decide between terrible quality or an echo.\n\nSecondly the game crashes and glitches out constantly. Some are just funny things with NPC interations or ragdolls but other would break the game by not allowing you to progress any further because a boss or event decides not to show up. Our golden example of this was when the Final Boss decided he didn't want to show up for the fight, effectivley breaking our save file at the end of the game. Even reloading doesn't fix it. It's also terribly optimized in certain parts of the game. I have a decent computer that can run most new games at the highest setting yet there would be fits of lag in crowed areas, the worst being Chapter  8 where you crawl though the rust tunnels.

This game was hastily ported over to PC and has too many problems to list. Me and my friend purchased it on sale to just play through togeather, not excpeting much other than a cheap game to waste a weekend or two. First thing you'll notice is the terrible in-game mic and the fact that you can't turn it off at all, which means if you have TS or Skype going you have to decide between terrible quality or an echo.\n\nSecondly the game crashes and glitches out constantly. Some are just funny things with NPC interations or ragdolls but other would break the game by not allowing you to progress any further because a boss or event decides not to show up. Our golden example of this was when the Final Boss decided he didn't want to show up for the fight, effectivley breaking our save file at the end of the game. Even reloading doesn't fix it. It's also terribly optimized in certain parts of the game. I have a decent computer that can run most new games at the highest setting yet there would be fits of lag in crowed areas, the worst being Chapter  8 where you crawl though the rust tunnels. I had to look at the ground the entire time else I would instantly crash.\n\nMediocre game full with breaking bugs.

No seriously, like after the whole OMG its Aragon! OMG I can cut orks heads off and OMG most of the fellowship in rivendale, it just dies down to repetitive game and a character progression reminescent of skill trees of the old but half the size, yea no wonder it is just eh.\n\nIm not saying this game is bad and all but it is just not fun! I admit as a fan of the fantasy genre, I love Lord of the Rings, but this game is said to be a side, non-canon story, but it is still a good story none the less, and that is what pushed me to finish the game.\n\nIt is a standard hack and slash affair, but in this case, the controls feel sluggish and sometimes irresponsive, and I can see this is just a console port to PC. Also it doesnt help that every mob apart from 2 out of the 6 archetypes there are, will knock you down and make you immobile for a good 5 secs, which you wait for your character to stumble around and get up. Like the only 3 moves those 2 do will constantly knock you down and they are the most common of enemies in this game!\n\nThis game is definately not worth the amount it is asking for now, it is rentable at best from a video store for $1 or $2, whatever it is at your store, and the only reason why I got it on PC is cos it was in the Humble Bundle and I got it without a choice and I wanted FEAR.\n\nAlso did I mention that your team mates are solid and if you played single player like I did, they would stand there and be in your way and not move until after 3 seconds of running into them.

If you want this kind of experience, then go play that as a dual wielder. War In The North is a brand-riding money grab that's repetitve, boring, and has LoTR as it's one and only thing that anyone could possibly like this game. Srsly go read the wiki for the story, this game is not worth it.***\n\nThe one thing this game has going for it is the fact that it takes place in the LoTR universe. The aesthetics and the graphcs are mediocre, the voice acting is actually pretty good, but the game play is pretty bad.\n\nThe controls are unresponsive and wonky, the level design is not obvious, the enemies are repetitive and boring... I got to the part after the stream of sappers and was just too bored to continue. Oh look, I axed another one. Oh wait, I'm the archer because I'm an idiot and they make you buy arrows instead of giving them to you. Let's be the mage..... aaaaand she's a healer.\n\nWhat the means is that this game is CLEARLY MEANT TO BE PLAYED AS THE DWARF. If I have to spend my money on arrows (because you do not find enough to not buy them), then my equipment is going to be lacking. I'll let the AI control that. If you're going to play a healer for NPCs then you're either too lazy to play and just want the story or you're too lazy to read the summary on Wiki. Either way, letting the computer shoot unlimited arrows and toss heals at you is really the only way it makes sense to play this game. I know this because the dwarf wa the last class I played and it was the only way I could even tolerate this game. I fought the troll as the Ranger... which basically meant I watched my teammates do Up-Downs like it's pre-season football.\n\nWhich really lends insight into this game. Why even have those other classes if they're so much less effective than the dwarf? Really, the entire game just seems like a brand-riding money grab to me. Even the death animations on the enemies are repetitive... The game really holds no new interesting thingsdo I fly in the face of Mostly Positive reviews? I don't really know, to be honest. This game is really just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dragon's Age: Origins, which came out a YEAR EARLIER.","September 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The difficulty is far too steep and there is no incentive to keep trying once you've started to shout expletives at the game.

Since it's Lord of the Rings title, players and Middle-Earth fans alike anticipated something grand, a game that will finally maximize the potential of LotR in a video game. It didn't happen to the extent everyone expected. Yet it doesn't mean War in the North is an inferior product. Far from it.\nYou play as one of three available characters - a Ranger, Dwarven fighter and Elven mage. Each have three main skills at their disposal and a handful of minor ones. Even though the trio is a bit bland, they are likeable. The story runs simultanously to the Frodo's quest, which is a nice touch - your actions feel relevant as your party contribute to the greater cause.\nThe gameplay features a lot of hacking, slashing, shooting and looting. You face the horde of goblins, orcs and trolls under the command of one evil Agandaur, who is neatly tailored as a villan. War in the North offers an abundance of loot - here I would like to mention that the equipment in this game is superbly designed. The details on weapons and armor are fantastic, the overall feel of the equipment you find or buy fits the world perfectly, which is a nod to the coherent Tolkien universe and at the same time a welcome break from all the overdone, tasteless and improper design in most of the modern RPGs (a sexy female warrior with armor covering only her breast and groin area? Yes, practical indeed). On your travels you will visit locations and meet characters well-known from the books and movies (Ian McKellen voices Gandalf).\nThe game's length is reasonable, around 10 hours for a playthrough, and the replay value is here. War in the North is best enjoyed while playing with your frineds in a co-op mode. It's essantially the same campaign as the single player, but obviously more challanging as the opponents grow in strength with each additional player.\nRecommended. I approached War in the North without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality - it's not one of the best games you will ever play, but it's certainly enjoyable.","May 22, 2014","true","21.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seems that virtually every blockbuster in the past 20 years has had an awful accompanying game aimed at cashing in on the hype surrounding the name. I’ve usually felt differently about the Lord of the Rings games because they’ve been pretty good (the tie-ins on the original Xbox were actually pretty great) so I approached this one with rather less cynicism than I’d usually reserve.\n\nIt’s immediately obvious that this isn’t a high quality, high budget title. The cast impersonators are the first clue and every member of the original cast that appears in the game has an actor that sounds not-quite like what we’re used to hearing. The crude visuals, basic soundtrack and the sense that they’ve hired one voice actor to cover every other NPC were a little disappointing, though not enough to be off-putting.\n\nSo, yet another 3rd person hack ‘n’ slash, this one with the most basic of plots; “that guy is Sauron’s mate, let’s kill him”. Obviously, being a mate of Sauron he’s quite powerful and has many orcs between him and your party, so you’ve got to kill them off first. The plot is as simple as that. On the way you encounter some of the characters shown in the films, as well as some only mentioned in the books, (minor spoilers, though it’s not like the story here is that important!)  such as Gwaihir, Elladan and Elrohir, Radagast the Brown and Halbarad the Ranger.\n\nLevels are very simple, with three or four stages to each level and a peaceful base every few levels where you can return to repair, buy and sell items and turn in quests at occasional checkpoints. You won’t spend very long there though; the main part of the game is either chopping up orcs or running towards the next lot of orcs to chop up.\n\nGameplay is very repetitive and, though the combat is very functional, it gets quite dull as you go from one stage to the next doing the same bloody thing over and over. Combat is quite a standard affair, with standard fast and heavy attacks melee attacks, a ranged attack and the options to block and dodge. The controls are functional and work well enough, but everything feels quite floaty and a little detached. Each character has unique abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as the character levels up, most of which are pretty cool to execute. The problem is in how repetitive it becomes as you take on endless hordes of a very unvaried enemy. I often compare these types of games to God of War, but there’s a reason for that; in those games, there are dozens of various attack types and there’s a huge variety of enemy types, all of which require different tactics to combat. In this case, War in The North has 4 basic enemy types – a melee guy, a ranged guy, a sorcerer and a troll. Sure, there are technically more, with goblins, Uruk Hai and so on, but all they really are is the same thing with better stats – which doesn’t mean anything as they are only encountered later in the game when your own stats have also grown massively. This effectively means that you’re fighting the same group of things in a sequence of different rooms for the entire campaign, broken up by the occasional mediocre boss battle and combat is broken down to a sequence of dodge, attack, dodge, special attack for the entire campaign. Not exactly Ride to Hell, but hardly a prize winning game either.\n\nVisually the game plays it safe, using the same design aesthetic as in the films, although without any of the grand scenery or set pieces that I loved about the trilogy. The settings are familiar and just a little bland, but it does the job. It’s in the graphics that the game shows its limitations, especially in the resolution and framerate. This game looks like a last-gen console port and even running at 1080p it doesn’t look like it’s in HD. Framerate is similar, even though FRAPS showed it running at a solid 60fps it certainly didn’t look like anything approaching that, in fact it felt like 20. I don’t know why everything looked so poor, or why the framerate randomly dropped to 2fps for a few seconds at random, or why the last level is so glitched you have to reinstall 2 year old drivers for your GPU to run the sodding thing, but it’s very poor form and quite infuriating. That these issues haven’t been patched, despite the forums being flooded with various technical issues, is pretty disgraceful.\n\nWar in the North is one of those licensed games that get a recommendation because it’s “good enough”. If, like me, you’re a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you’ll probably enjoy going toe-to-toe with a horde of orcs and just being in Middle Earth. The game almost loses my recommendation due to the technical issues and game breaking bugs and if you don’t want to ♥♥♥♥ about fixing it yourself then I’d advise you to steer well clear. If you’re fine with that, it’s a pretty decent distraction for a few hours.\n\nMy score:\n\n6/10\n\nIt’s a good enough game; quite repetitive, and pretty average combat, but it’s a good amount of fun carving through a mass of orcs.\n","August 22, 2014","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It cannot compete with the AAA titles with hand to hand combat and fantasy element, but it is good enough to be worth at least one play through. From the start it is evident that the developers put great effort into the game to make the environment shine with detail and realism. I was surprised to see such quality of level detail, despite the levels and gameplay being linear.\n\nThe character models and armor are very detailed as well. Every time you put newer more advanced pieces of armor it reflects on the model of your chosen character. Be it helmets, arm guards, leggings, body armor. All of it. It is also very accurate as far as movie content. Human, Elven, and Dwarven armor and items are what you'd have seen in the Lord of The Rings movies. It is not surprising since the publisher of the game is WB.\n\nPositives written above do not come without the negatives. Nearly every level, no matter how spectacular in appearance, has plenty of invisible walls. These invisible barriers can be incredibly frustrating because often you'd find yoruself checking whether you can go in a particular path only to find that it is simply blocked by an invisible wall. As is the case with even the best games on the market, the level design becomes less impressive, and often shows plain lazyness as the player reaches the 2nd half of the game, and eventually the ending. Some areas start looking less detailed and more rushed. Invisible walls become bigger, lighting less consistent, etc.\n\nWar in The North also has issues with inventory organization. You may eventually gather enough weapons or armor to fill all the alloted slots in the inventory. Some items can be old, other items too high for current level, and there is no way to organize them. Neither manually nor automatically. You cannot select an item and move it in the inventory. Player just ha sto move the cursor over the items to see the stats of each.\n\nAnother rather inconvenient drawback is in the design of the game for those who want to play single player as opposed to 3 player coop. You have the option to "give" your excess items or items meant for other two classes to your CPU controlled teammates. This is a very poor design gaffe because CPU does not  always equip the item gifted to them, nor compensate the party for the item value. Once it is given to a teammate controlled by the CPU the item is as good as gone.\nThis is not an issue if you play coop with 2 or three players. The other player actually gets the item and can use it. Similarly, when you play coop you can actually exchange items with each other to acquire complete sets of items meant to be worn together. They may be strangely acquired by your CPU partners, and when you switch characters between levels you may see the items that could complete your set on the other player you have picked to play as, but you are not able to either put it in any "shared chest" nor give to another player. Wasted opportunity.\n\nCombat is very satisfying and as the character levels up you have a wide choice of upgrades and moves and magic spells to pick from. The upgrade tree is very similar to that of Borderlands games in which you have three columns of skills which you invest points in to unlock the most powerful ones on the bottom.

It cannot compete with the AAA titles with hand to hand combat and fantasy element, but it is good enough to be worth at least one play through. From the start it is evident that the developers put great effort into the game to make the environment shine with detail and realism. I was surprised to see such quality of level detail, despite the levels and gameplay being linear.\n\nThe character models and armor are very detailed as well. Every time you put newer more advanced pieces of armor it reflects on the model of your chosen character. Be it helmets, arm guards, leggings, body armor. All of it. It is also very accurate as far as movie content. Human, Elven, and Dwarven armor and items are what you'd have seen in the Lord of The Rings movies. It is not surprising since the publisher of the game is WB.\n\nPositives written above do not come without the negatives. Nearly every level, no matter how spectacular in appearance, has plenty of invisible walls. These invisible barriers can be incredibly frustrating because often you'd find yoruself checking whether you can go in a particular path only to find that it is simply blocked by an invisible wall. As is the case with even the best games on the market, the level design becomes less impressive, and often shows plain lazyness as the player reaches the 2nd half of the game, and eventually the ending. Some areas start looking less detailed and more rushed. Invisible walls become bigger, lighting less consistent, etc.\n\nWar in The North also has issues with inventory organization. You may eventually gather enough weapons or armor to fill all the alloted slots in the inventory. Some items can be old, other items too high for current level, and there is no way to organize them. Neither manually nor automatically. You cannot select an item and move it in the inventory. Player just ha sto move the cursor over the items to see the stats of each.\n\nAnother rather inconvenient drawback is in the design of the game for those who want to play single player as opposed to 3 player coop. You have the option to "give" your excess items or items meant for other two classes to your CPU controlled teammates. This is a very poor design gaffe because CPU does not  always equip the item gifted to them, nor compensate the party for the item value. Once it is given to a teammate controlled by the CPU the item is as good as gone.\nThis is not an issue if you play coop with 2 or three players. The other player actually gets the item and can use it. Similarly, when you play coop you can actually exchange items with each other to acquire complete sets of items meant to be worn together. They may be strangely acquired by your CPU partners, and when you switch characters between levels you may see the items that could complete your set on the other player you have picked to play as, but you are not able to either put it in any "shared chest" nor give to another player. Wasted opportunity.\n\nCombat is very satisfying and as the character levels up you have a wide choice of upgrades and moves and magic spells to pick from. The upgrade tree is very similar to that of Borderlands games in which you have three columns of skills which you invest points in to unlock the most powerful ones on the bottom. Once again, when you play single player you control your own player's upgrades, but the CPU manages them automatically and utilizes them in hit and miss fashion. Sometimes you'll see the Lore Master (Elf lady) use some of her very helpful spells often, other times you won't. Thankfully you can switch to another character midgame to experience their gameplay style. Whatever you upgrade them with and equipment you give them will be present again if you select them in the future, but not when CPU controls them.\n\nThe plot and the story is ok. It is not very impressive, but should be interesting to any fan of Tolkien universe or the Peter Jackson movies. The events take place at the same time as the Lord of The Rings three books. You encounter some characters mentioned in the books, get to visit iconic locations such as Lorien and get to talk to most of the main characters of LOTR.

Characters are voiced by quality voice acting, but unfortunately the same voice actors are recylced for many characters which feels very cheap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyPage666/recommended/32800/","JimmyPage666","JimmyPage666","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyPage666/","252 products in account","Experience has usually left me very cautious whenever I see a licensed videogame, particularly when it’s tied in to a film franchise. It seems that virtually every blockbuster in the past 20 years has had an awful accompanying game aimed at cashing in on the hype surrounding the name. I’ve usually felt differently about the Lord of the Rings games because they’ve been pretty good (the tie-ins on the original Xbox were actually pretty great) so I approached this one with rather less cynicism than I’d usually reserve.\n\nIt’s immediately obvious that this isn’t a high quality, high budget title. The cast impersonators are the first clue and every member of the original cast that appears in the game has an actor that sounds not-quite like what we’re used to hearing. The crude visuals, basic soundtrack and the sense that they’ve hired one voice actor to cover every other NPC were a little disappointing, though not enough to be off-putting.\n\nSo, yet another 3rd person hack ‘n’ slash, this one with the most basic of plots; “that guy is Sauron’s mate, let’s kill him”. Obviously, being a mate of Sauron he’s quite powerful and has many orcs between him and your party, so you’ve got to kill them off first. The plot is as simple as that. On the way you encounter some of the characters shown in the films, as well as some only mentioned in the books, (minor spoilers, though it’s not like the story here is that important!)  such as Gwaihir, Elladan and Elrohir, Radagast the Brown and Halbarad the Ranger.\n\nLevels are very simple, with three or four stages to each level and a peaceful base every few levels where you can return to repair, buy and sell items and turn in quests at occasional checkpoints. You won’t spend very long there though; the main part of the game is either chopping up orcs or running towards the next lot of orcs to chop up.\n\nGameplay is very repetitive and, though the combat is very functional, it gets quite dull as you go from one stage to the next doing the same bloody thing over and over. Combat is quite a standard affair, with standard fast and heavy attacks melee attacks, a ranged attack and the options to block and dodge. The controls are functional and work well enough, but everything feels quite floaty and a little detached. Each character has unique abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as the character levels up, most of which are pretty cool to execute. The problem is in how repetitive it becomes as you take on endless hordes of a very unvaried enemy. I often compare these types of games to God of War, but there’s a reason for that; in those games, there are dozens of various attack types and there’s a huge variety of enemy types, all of which require different tactics to combat. In this case, War in The North has 4 basic enemy types – a melee guy, a ranged guy, a sorcerer and a troll. Sure, there are technically more, with goblins, Uruk Hai and so on, but all they really are is the same thing with better stats – which doesn’t mean anything as they are only encountered later in the game when your own stats have also grown massively. This effectively means that you’re fighting the same group of things in a sequence of different rooms for the entire campaign, broken up by the occasional mediocre boss battle and combat is broken down to a sequence of dodge, attack, dodge, special attack for the entire campaign. Not exactly Ride to Hell, but hardly a prize winning game either.\n\nVisually the game plays it safe, using the same design aesthetic as in the films, although without any of the grand scenery or set pieces that I loved about the trilogy. The settings are familiar and just a little bland, but it does the job. It’s in the graphics that the game shows its limitations, especially in the resolution and framerate. This game looks like a last-gen console port and even running at 1080p it doesn’t look like it’s in HD. Framerate is similar, even though FRAPS showed it running at a solid 60fps it certainly didn’t look like anything approaching that, in fact it felt like 20. I don’t know why everything looked so poor, or why the framerate randomly dropped to 2fps for a few seconds at random, or why the last level is so glitched you have to reinstall 2 year old drivers for your GPU to run the sodding thing, but it’s very poor form and quite infuriating. That these issues haven’t been patched, despite the forums being flooded with various technical issues, is pretty disgraceful.\n\nWar in the North is one of those licensed games that get a recommendation because it’s “good enough”. If, like me, you’re a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you’ll probably enjoy going toe-to-toe with a horde of orcs and just being in Middle Earth. The game almost loses my recommendation due to the technical issues and game breaking bugs and if you don’t want to ♥♥♥♥ about fixing it yourself then I’d advise you to steer well clear. If you’re fine with that, it’s a pretty decent distraction for a few hours.\n\nMy score:\n\n6/10\n\nIt’s a good enough game; quite repetitive, and pretty average combat, but it’s a good amount of fun carving through a mass of orcs.\n","August 22, 2014","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It didn’t seem all that impressive from the trailers so I just said to myself: “Yet another one of EA’s attempts to milk the Lord of the Rings cash cow.”\nA couple of hours of hacking orcs with a friend changed my view of the game drastically.\n\nThe first and most important thing you should know about the game is this: Do NOT expect a fun solo experience. This game is meant to be played with a friend or if at all possible, two.\nIt is at its best when you are communicating with your friends in order to take down tough enemy groups and help each other survive difficult encounters.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the simplicity of its design, but honestly, that’s what makes it work so well. The combat is straightforward and impactful (I suggest a gamepad but mouse and keyboard controls work well also) and the looting is surprisingly fun.\n\nWar in the North won’t make you care too much about its story though. It isn’t very memorable or interesting in any way for that matter. This could have been improved upon by having the player actually make meaningful decisions. Unfortunately, the dialogue options seem to be there just to give you a little more information if you really want it.\n\n\nFrom a graphical point of view, the game is quite ok.

It didn’t seem all that impressive from the trailers so I just said to myself: “Yet another one of EA’s attempts to milk the Lord of the Rings cash cow.”\nA couple of hours of hacking orcs with a friend changed my view of the game drastically.\n\nThe first and most important thing you should know about the game is this: Do NOT expect a fun solo experience. This game is meant to be played with a friend or if at all possible, two.\nIt is at its best when you are communicating with your friends in order to take down tough enemy groups and help each other survive difficult encounters.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the simplicity of its design, but honestly, that’s what makes it work so well. The combat is straightforward and impactful (I suggest a gamepad but mouse and keyboard controls work well also) and the looting is surprisingly fun.\n\nWar in the North won’t make you care too much about its story though. It isn’t very memorable or interesting in any way for that matter. This could have been improved upon by having the player actually make meaningful decisions. Unfortunately, the dialogue options seem to be there just to give you a little more information if you really want it.\n\n\nFrom a graphical point of view, the game is quite ok. You won’t be amazed by it, but occasionally, you might find yourself nodding to a slow motion decapitation or some other small detail (like how the snow sticks you your armor after you roll through it).\nThis is indeed the grittiest Lord of the Rings game released and it feels great.

This was a big let down for me as I have played other LOTR games that were much better than this... It seems they whipped up the story line as fast as they could, the acting was horribly done and the story was far too breif. The action combat style of the game was the only thing good about it. However, the AI was dumber than previous LOTR games. I would of loved to give this game a great review, but it didn't quite reach my expectations as a LOTR game.\n\nSure you take a good amount of damage if you're hit, which is why people probably find this game moderatly hard, but honestly, that's all it was. They hit you hard, and harder on higher difficulties. The AI did not get smarter, just simply, your health pool took more damage. So if you know how to strike and move, this game is beyond easy...\n\nSo mainly what I'm disliking the game for is...\n\n1. Dumb AI\n2. Very breif storyline\n3. Extremely easy\n4.

If you've sene the movies more than once, nothing in this game will make any sense. If you've read the books more than once, you'll be shouting at Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond, etc every every time they're on-screen because they make absolutely no attempt to make them anything like the characters in the book or the movie.\n\nThis is a mediocre hack-and-slash that has the great fortune of being named "Lord of the Rings." Otherwise, it wouldn't have sold many copies.\n\nThe fight mechanics are boring, the archery is clumsy, and the equipment treadmill is just tiring. Srsly? I'm going to go to Rivendell, and the elf at the smithy is going to charge me for repairs?\n\nMost of the loot you'll get in this game is arrows or money, both of which the game would have been much better off without. There is so much ammunition hidden in jars that it's just stupid to make me keep track of it at all. In the first three missions (probably four or five hours of game time), I've run out of arrows once.\n\nBut really, there's not much point to ever firing an arrow. There's apparently a headshot mechanic, but in order to score a headshot, you still have to shoot a big orc in the head four or five times to reduce his HP.\n\nThis game is a solid D. If it wasn't a Lord of the Rings game, it would be a D+. But it is, so it's absolutely bursting with references to lore and history that play absolutely no part in the story whatsoever. But you can't be certain what's going to be important or might trigger something later on, so you click through every single dialogue.\n\nWhat a piece of ♥♥♥♥.

First, the game looks fairly decent. Graphics could be tuned up a bit (mainly with some textures), but overall, they aren't bad. Gameplay is a mixed bag. The characters move well enough, but there are some annoying collisions that will hang up your heroes, including places that "heroes" should be able to travel through (like stepping up a set of stone stairs from the side instead of moving around to the first step and stepping up that way - or trying to step down off a rock ledge a mere two feet off the ground below). Music is reminiscent of the movie and the sounds and mannerisms of the creatures in the game ring true. The game would be a fun 3-person co-op game, but I only played solo.. which is where some of the problems (and big ones), began to rear their heads.\n\nYour character gains XP in the game which allows them to level. This allows you to spend some points in typical RPG stats as well as putting points in skill trees, which allow you access to better killing moves. This is all fine and dandy except for the fact that if you ever switch out to one of the other characters, it resets your skills to default, meaning that you can't play a guy, switch over to another character for the next chapter and expect all of your choices to remain constant. On that point, the same goes for loot. You can share loot with the NPC allies, which they'll use on the mission you're on, but they will strangely have lost some or all of it when you switch over to them. If you opt to not give them anything, they are stuck "helping" you with starter weapons.\n\nAnd enemies and NPC A.I. isn't all that bright. I cursed so many times seeing my healer (whom I didn't want to play), rush into battle swinging her staff at a cave troll and getting two-shotted (of course). Then she cried out, "I am dying!" Yeah, no ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me started on the weirdly placed save spots either. Some are just so far apart that if you wipe, you have to repeat long and tedious chunks of the game.. which is a total buzzkill.\n\nI read up online that this game is huge too though, which is sad. Because the combat is pretty fun. There's enough hidden elements and fun gameplay that it kept me entertained. I just wish it was mechanically superior than what it is. I say no to this game. Perhaps a later incarnation will have these odd game mechanics worked out.","November 25, 2013","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.\n\nMost of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.\n\nI have made it through chapter 7 with it crashing about every half hour and now in chapter 8 of the game I found another section that will crash every few minutes similar to chapter 2 of the game.  Now I have to quit.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual review of the game (based on when it is not crashing)\none of the first things you get is a bird friend and you hit the 4 button to call for his aid.  Well the Elf character has a power that has you block and hit 4 (holding CTRL then hit 4).  even though the 4 icon has changed from the bird logo to a different logo, BOTH powers are used; the bird and area heal.  I wasted a lot of bird power trying to keep the other 2 friends alive.\n\n\nDefense missions are the worst part, it goes fine until the enemy brings in the giant troll and he walk past you not caring that you are attacking him and then kills the thing you are protecting in 15 seconds.\n\nI personally am more of a dodger power and like to dodge and not much blocking, I would of liked a double dodge (I only played the elf so I do not know if the other characters have a double dodge).  After facing a double sword enemy who is stabbing you so much that you can not dodge, I have learned to block against them just be for they attack and then attack them back.\n\nDialog was interesting even had a few points that you could try to tell some one that we are just passing through this very remote area to get to grandma's house (not exactly G ma’s house, but you are lieing about what you are doing so I thought it appropriate) and the NPC has non of that, but a very interesting choice to tell them.  Also there is a lot of repeat dialog choices that are represented as new choices.  Example: someone tells you of a castle; new option of the castle in dialog choices, npc just repeats the thing that brought up the new choice.\n\n\n\nCombat was fun and interesting, slowly adding in new enemies over the 6 chapter's I played.  I would of loved to see how the ending turned out and if they kept adding new enemies through the end, but sadly the bugs and crashing my computer is enough to make me stop.","March 10, 2014","false","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The amazing reviews ons team are most likely because the only people who will buy this game are already avid LOTR fans. I however, was not a fan beforehand and will deliver a serious review.\n\nHere's a complied list, and at the end of the list I'll let you be the judge of whether or not you wish to dive into this game\n\nIs the story any good?\nAbsolutely, as any RPG you have the freedom to partake in the story or to skip it and get into the action. Talking to the villagers of every town will get you side quests in which you can earn some intense gear.\n\nIs the combat any good?\nPersonally, the combat is pretty repetetive, but it does allow for some customizing, much like dragon age.\n\nIs there customization?\nThe customization is limited but it IS there, which is better than no customization. Note: You may only customize AFTER starting the game.\n\nDiversity?\nYes, you're able to pick one of the three heros and go along with it, there's also multiplayer functions so you can bring two friends and each have their own hero.\n\nAll of these things are good, so why is this a downvote?\nThere is only one bad quality, but you must realize the depth of the how terrible it is to understand why it's a thumbs down.\n\nWhat is wrong with it?\nThe game crashes OFTEN. This game was released on Nov. 1, 2011 which wasn't too long ago. Yet, the game runs like it was made in 2002, with how the graphics are I originally thought this game was made in 2006.\n\nMy computer is really new, and it is capable of running Bioshock infinite on max settings, yet it cannot run LOTR War in the North for over an hour without crashing. What's more, is that it does not simply crash the game/window/application. It crashes the ENTIRE DESKTOP.\n\nTHIS IS WHY THE GAME RECIEVED A LOW METASCORE, IT IS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. It is borderline unplayable, because up until the undead level, you don't really have any problems with crashing. but the second you get to the undead mobs, the game cannot control it's own software and seeminglye xplodes upon itself. And, because the undead levels are canon, you MUST pass through them. I was lucky because my computer was new, so I had a long grace period before it killed itself, but any run of the mill computer may not be able to handle it at all.\n\nAll in all, this was a great game, if it wasn't so cancerous to it's own programming, I as a person who is not a die-hard fan of LOTR can honestly say this would have recieved an 85-95 score for what it brings to the table. However, an amazing game CANNOT HAVE A FOUNDATION MADE SUITABLE ONLY FOR GAMES 5 YEARS BEHIND ITS TIME.","July 25, 2014","false","36.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, this game has made me question that policy, as it was disappointing in more than one aspect.\n\nFor one, the gameplay was painfully repetitive. You hack at enemies with staggering melee chains to deplete their tediously large amounts of health, and eventually score a "critical" slow-motion kill, with all such finishers being seen in the first five minutes. This would be all well and good if not for the waves upon waves of the same enemies in every battle, and reskins of the same enemies in every area. Virtually every enemy melee attack is slow enough that dodge-rolling out of them becomes literally half the game. Spells deal slightly above-average damage, yet they're incumbent upon leveling, are very few, have cooldowns, and can only be cast through the non-configurable and inconvenient number row.\n\nThe game is apparently intended almost exclusively for co-op, as your ally NPCs' AIs are complete crap. They focus in on one enemy and proceed to totally ignore everything else happening around them; This makes stealth impossible, and leaves the large bulk of the fighting solely to you. One of the only ways to heal is waiting for your mage ally to cast a protective field that very slowly regenerates health - this can be annoying if there are many enemies with high-power attacks chasing you, plus the field can apparently be broken by a strong melee area-attack, which quite a few enemies in each battle possess.\n\nAdditionally, although it may at first seem nice to have a semi-instant revive system, your allies are very stupid about using it: They will both run up to you regardless of how many enemies are in your vicinity, and proceed to get themselves mob-murdered, plus the revive will stop mid-way whenever they are hit by an area-attack, or by practically any projectile - making dying in a fight with a troll, a boss, or a few archers essentially irrecoverable. And even though your allies can remain in a near-death state infinitely, waddling about on their knees at random (making finding them at times annoying), you cannot, and game-over in a manner of seconds.\n\nThe equip system is also laughably level-based. You can fight three trolls and scores of enemies to retrieve a legendary bow, and in the very next area, find a cracked shortbow in a barrel with 2x better stats. On account of this, wasting hard-earned gold on buying anything other than health potions is a wasted investment, and it's basically pointless to slot elf-stones (item enhancements) until the end-game, when you've finally stopped switching out your entire armor every area. Your inventory is also constantly getting bogged down with what the game deems 'unessential items', which are literally that, and have no secret or quest purpose whatsoever beyond getting in the way of useful equipment.\n\nThe story is perhaps the only compelling thing about the game, but interacts badly with the mainline LOTR plot. For instance, when your party asks why you can't be part of the Fellowship, Elrond explains that the members must be stealthy and not necessarily powerful - when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are basically the most badass warriors in the entire LOTR universe. The dialogue seems pretty forced as well, and can be difficult to follow unless you are versed in LOTR canon.\n\nBeating the game unlocks the next highest tier difficulty to play on, but the game has so little replay value that it's hardly worth it. War in the North lacks substance mostly because of its absence of variety and configurability, and I can't say I'd recommend it to any sincere LOTR fan.","March 31, 2014","false","23.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really a shame the engine doesn't perform better, because the gameplay and writing are great.","June 18, 2015","false","36.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's... it.\n\nYou control one of three characters with no personality or character development trying to chain as many finishers as possible, until you unlock Farin's Explosive Arrow and trivialize the game. Even the only vaguely challenging sections, which are the optional horde challenge maps. Along the way you will meet other fan-favorite characters such as the Fellowship, but then you will discover they have about as much relevance to you as this game does to Tolkein's legendarium. Sorry, Lord of the Rings fans.\n\nYour mission is to go kill the leader of Sauron's forces in the North, Agandaur. He is pathetically easy, but it's worth it (?) to see the CGI animation that probably ate up 70% of the budget for this game.\n\nThe only way this game becomes decent is if you somehow game one, preferably two, friends into playing it with you. The time commitment shouldn't be that bad because the game is both easy and short. Playing with friends helps disguise some of the game's more egregious single-player faults, such as an incredibly limited inventory system, no ability to switch between characters on the fly (this requires you to completely reload the game), and the fact that some parts of the game are straight-up inaccessible without two or more players.\n\nFortunately the game isn't super glitchy (there are some glitches but reloading usually fixes it) or unplayable, and you'll probably unlock 95% of the achievements without even trying.\n\nSadly, War in the North failed to live up to any of its promise. It's not a HORRIBLE game by any means, but there are way better uses of your time.","June 14, 2015","false","35.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's just no way to say it more clearly.  It is easily one of the worst parts of this game.  The levelling and talent trees are lackluster, the HUD during gameplay is incomprehensible, and the combat is sloppy.\n\nStory - Yes, it's set in Middle-Earth, and they have gotten a lot of the names of people/places directly from the lore, but that doesn't make the story actually interesting.  Essentially, you are a small band of adventurers (a man, an elf and a dwarf, super original) that need to distract Sauron's forces from the ringbearer during the time of the LOTR trilogy.

I played single-player and so my comments are reflective of that experience.\n\nThe game includes three characters:  a dwarven tank, and human ranger who can choose between melee and ranged DPS, and a support/ranged DPS mage.  The three characters have decidedly different roles in combat and the fundamentals of the combat system are good, but other design flaws quickly mask those positives.\n\nGameplay is episodic, with small, linear maps broken up with portals back to town.  Each character has a small number of actions, making combat somewhat repetitive.  Town is a dull place with a few vendors, the interface for which is clumsy and inefficient.  Managing and building your character and gear is more tedious than rewarding.\n\nThe main flaw in the game is that you are tighlty tied to a single character.  Rather than giving the player the power to smoothly transfer control between characters on-the-fly (which I would think would be a very easy, obvious feature they should have included), you must play as a specific character for the entirety of a level while the other two are controlled by AI.  You cannot even equip gear on a character other than the one you are currently controlling.\n\nI admit I did not spend a lot of time in this game, maybe it would have gotten better as the game progressed, but to be fair I quit playing the game because I did not enjoy it.","November 25, 2013","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can choose from three distinct characters to play as: Farin, the dwarf champion, Eradan, the human ranger, or Andriel, the elf mage. Each of these characters has their own unique fighting style and can attack both in melee and ranged. The game features a stat and skill system not unlike the Mass Effect series where you can upgrade certain abilities to your own preferred style of combat. The story puts you in pursuit of Agandaur, dark lord servant of Sauron, whose efforts may hinder the quest of the Fellowship of the Ring. In the game, you travel from notable locales from the books such as Bree, Sam Ford, and even the troll infested Etternmoors.\n\nThe combat in this game feels very clunky and tiresome as combat abilities are restricted by both power cost and a cooldown timer. You certainly look heroic and cinematic as the animations of each sword swing and spell resemble that of the films, but the praise stops there. Alternating between 2-3 buttons, the combat feels repetitive and dull after the first few hours. Gameplay primarily consists of traveling from one zone to the next, defeating waves of enemies within a mostly linear path from objective to objective.\n\nWar in the North features multiplayer, which may make the overall experience more enjoyable to some players. However, from a solo player standpoint, this game feels very grindy and ultimately not worth the frustration/boredom to continue playing simply to progress the plot."","December 22, 2013","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The amazing reviews ons team are most likely because the only people who will buy this game are already avid LOTR fans. I however, was not a fan beforehand and will deliver a serious review.\n\nHere's a complied list, and at the end of the list I'll let you be the judge of whether or not you wish to dive into this game\n\nIs the story any good?\nAbsolutely, as any RPG you have the freedom to partake in the story or to skip it and get into the action. Talking to the villagers of every town will get you side quests in which you can earn some intense gear.\n\nIs the combat any good?\nPersonally, the combat is pretty repetetive, but it does allow for some customizing, much like dragon age.\n\nIs there customization?\nThe customization is limited but it IS there, which is better than no customization. Note: You may only customize AFTER starting the game.\n\nDiversity?\nYes, you're able to pick one of the three heros and go along with it, there's also multiplayer functions so you can bring two friends and each have their own hero.\n\nAll of these things are good, so why is this a downvote?\nThere is only one bad quality, but you must realize the depth of the how terrible it is to understand why it's a thumbs down.\n\nWhat is wrong with it?\nThe game crashes OFTEN. This game was released on Nov. 1, 2011 which wasn't too long ago. Yet, the game runs like it was made in 2002, with how the graphics are I originally thought this game was made in 2006.\n\nMy computer is really new, and it is capable of running Bioshock infinite on max settings, yet it cannot run LOTR War in the North for over an hour without crashing. What's more, is that it does not simply crash the game/window/application. It crashes the ENTIRE DESKTOP.\n\nTHIS IS WHY THE GAME RECIEVED A LOW METASCORE, IT IS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. It is borderline unplayable, because up until the undead level, you don't really have any problems with crashing. but the second you get to the undead mobs, the game cannot control it's own software and seeminglye xplodes upon itself. And, because the undead levels are canon, you MUST pass through them. I was lucky because my computer was new, so I had a long grace period before it killed itself, but any run of the mill computer may not be able to handle it at all.\n\nAll in all, this was a great game, if it wasn't so cancerous to it's own programming, I as a person who is not a die-hard fan of LOTR can honestly say this would have recieved an 85-95 score for what it brings to the table. However, an amazing game CANNOT HAVE A FOUNDATION MADE SUITABLE ONLY FOR GAMES 5 YEARS BEHIND ITS TIME.","July 25, 2014","false","36.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's start with the good things. It has amazing graphics and kill 'mini cutscenes', and does have rather good combat. But, the voice acting is horrible! If you have scene the LOTR movies, the voice acting for Elrond is laughable. They even had the audacity to put really bad american voice actors in the game. LOTR is mainly british (based on the movies and the books) and yet they chose average sounding american voice actors for some roles. Also, the story is very bad, and isn't original at all, because you are directly connected to the fellowship. At least have a seperate storyline, but no, they have to come up with a completely unoriginal, boring storyline. Also, there is abosultely no character development, and I think that if it wasn't for the good gameplay, I would have quit this game. Don't waste your money buying this game.

I had finished this game on my friend's Xbox 360 only months before and enjoyed playing it with him in Co-op mode. After finshing this game on my PC I realised how boring and repetitive the game really was. The game is not a free-roaming or exploring type. It restricts you to the very bone with it's story levels, which are the only things that you can actually do in this game. Sure, myself being a huge Tolkien fan should enjoy this game a lot, but the lore is barely touched on. There are refrencing to the movies and books but no huge give away of what the game/story is actually about to all new-comers. If your looking for a Middle-Earth game with heaps of lore and factual basings on Tolkien's work, please, please buy Shadow of Mordor.

The game could of been harder, people are saying it needs co-op... Honestly... That's what this game lacks. This was a big let down for me as I have played other LOTR games that were much better than this... It seems they whipped up the story line as fast as they could, the acting was horribly done and the story was far too breif. The action combat style of the game was the only thing good about it. However, the AI was dumber than previous LOTR games. I would of loved to give this game a great review, but it didn't quite reach my expectations as a LOTR game.\n\nSure you take a good amount of damage if you're hit, which is why people probably find this game moderatly hard, but honestly, that's all it was. They hit you hard, and harder on higher difficulties. The AI did not get smarter, just simply, your health pool took more damage. So if you know how to strike and move, this game is beyond easy...\n\nSo mainly what I'm disliking the game for is...\n\n1. Dumb AI\n2. Very breif storyline\n3. Extremely easy\n4. (Just throwing this out there) I expected more mobs. There wasn't that many to fight, and they came in small waves that were easily controlled.\n\nWhat's good about the game?\n\n1.

I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.\n\nMost of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.\n\nI have made it through chapter 7 with it crashing about every half hour and now in chapter 8 of the game I found another section that will crash every few minutes similar to chapter 2 of the game.  Now I have to quit.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual review of the game (based on when it is not crashing)\none of the first things you get is a bird friend and you hit the 4 button to call for his aid.  Well the Elf character has a power that has you block and hit 4 (holding CTRL then hit 4).  even though the 4 icon has changed from the bird logo to a different logo, BOTH powers are used; the bird and area heal.  I wasted a lot of bird power trying to keep the other 2 friends alive.\n\n\nDefense missions are the worst part, it goes fine until the enemy brings in the giant troll and he walk past you not caring that you are attacking him and then kills the thing you are protecting in 15 seconds.\n\nI personally am more of a dodger power and like to dodge and not much blocking, I would of liked a double dodge (I only played the elf so I do not know if the other characters have a double dodge).  After facing a double sword enemy who is stabbing you so much that you can not dodge, I have learned to block against them just be for they attack and then attack them back.\n\nDialog was interesting even had a few points that you could try to tell some one that we are just passing through this very remote area to get to grandma's house (not exactly G ma’s house, but you are lieing about what you are doing so I thought it appropriate) and the NPC has non of that, but a very interesting choice to tell them.  Also there is a lot of repeat dialog choices that are represented as new choices.  Example: someone tells you of a castle; new option of the castle in dialog choices, npc just repeats the thing that brought up the new choice.\n\n\n\nCombat was fun and interesting, slowly adding in new enemies over the 6 chapter's I played.  I would of loved to see how the ending turned out and if they kept adding new enemies through the end, but sadly the bugs and crashing my computer is enough to make me stop.","March 10, 2014","false","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Large enemies such as trolls require me to use the combat roll to get out of the way, and I actually have to ration my health potions. The game does have some combat abilities (such as power hits that are on a cooldown), but I personally don't use them very much.\n\nThe companion AI is very well done. I've noticed one companion position herself so that her spells benefit both me and the other AI, instead of just spamming her abilities off in a corner somewhere.\n\nThe armor system in the game is relatively interesting. I find myself actually comparing stats on armor and looking for gems to boost my armor's base stats. I also have to be careful with my funds so I can afford good armor upgrades when I find them on shopkeepers.\n\nThe game IS linear. At times, I have felt an almost on-rails feeling, but other times it's surprisingly open. The game has a lot of hidden chests and caches that encourage exploring every corner of the map. The items from these caches are typically very useful.\n\nThe game has many side-quests that are typically optional. You may revisit quest hubs in the world to complete these side quests at your leisure.\n\nI'm not a fan of the Lord of the Rings, but even I got into the story. The dialogue has a very nice RPG feel to it, and the voice acting is incredible.","November 27, 2013","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The textures in this game are really spectacular, the detail to everything from dust on your clothes, notched weapons, echo in the game chat while you're in a cave. The combat is simple but every kill feels rewarding. As you run through orcs and goblins drenched in their blood you can't help but to feel some adrenaline. The story, being set in Middle Earth, is just what you'd expect from the universe of Tolkien. The established locations like Bree and Imladris are nice to look at but the never before seen areas add to immense size of Middle Earth. If you get this game expect to be frustrated by the ♥♥♥♥-poor coding but know that you won't easily get bored.","November 27, 2013","true","27.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The amazing reviews ons team are most likely because the only people who will buy this game are already avid LOTR fans. I however, was not a fan beforehand and will deliver a serious review.\n\nHere's a complied list, and at the end of the list I'll let you be the judge of whether or not you wish to dive into this game\n\nIs the story any good?\nAbsolutely, as any RPG you have the freedom to partake in the story or to skip it and get into the action. Talking to the villagers of every town will get you side quests in which you can earn some intense gear.\n\nIs the combat any good?\nPersonally, the combat is pretty repetetive, but it does allow for some customizing, much like dragon age.\n\nIs there customization?\nThe customization is limited but it IS there, which is better than no customization. Note: You may only customize AFTER starting the game.\n\nDiversity?\nYes, you're able to pick one of the three heros and go along with it, there's also multiplayer functions so you can bring two friends and each have their own hero.\n\nAll of these things are good, so why is this a downvote?\nThere is only one bad quality, but you must realize the depth of the how terrible it is to understand why it's a thumbs down.\n\nWhat is wrong with it?\nThe game crashes OFTEN. This game was released on Nov. 1, 2011 which wasn't too long ago. Yet, the game runs like it was made in 2002, with how the graphics are I originally thought this game was made in 2006.\n\nMy computer is really new, and it is capable of running Bioshock infinite on max settings, yet it cannot run LOTR War in the North for over an hour without crashing. What's more, is that it does not simply crash the game/window/application. It crashes the ENTIRE DESKTOP.\n\nTHIS IS WHY THE GAME RECIEVED A LOW METASCORE, IT IS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. It is borderline unplayable, because up until the undead level, you don't really have any problems with crashing. but the second you get to the undead mobs, the game cannot control it's own software and seeminglye xplodes upon itself. And, because the undead levels are canon, you MUST pass through them. I was lucky because my computer was new, so I had a long grace period before it killed itself, but any run of the mill computer may not be able to handle it at all.\n\nAll in all, this was a great game, if it wasn't so cancerous to it's own programming, I as a person who is not a die-hard fan of LOTR can honestly say this would have recieved an 85-95 score for what it brings to the table. However, an amazing game CANNOT HAVE A FOUNDATION MADE SUITABLE ONLY FOR GAMES 5 YEARS BEHIND ITS TIME.","July 25, 2014","false","36.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
