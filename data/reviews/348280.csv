Highly polished mechanics, great visuals and an amazing soundtrack make it a wonderful party game.\n\nOrbit is original, fun, and extremely well made. I cannot recommend this game enough!","September 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and addictive. An awesome way for friends to have fun and blast each other! :)\n\nLack of the ability to play alone is kind of a downside.","October 2, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I looked for some help on this but i have seen nothing online about it. there is very little info about this game. normally ill spend a hell of a lot of time getting a game to work but here... i just want to play something fun to play with my kids on local. this isnt it for me.\n\nSo with the above in mind i rate this not recommened.","April 17","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
