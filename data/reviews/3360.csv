You have to get 3 or more of the same color close enough together to have all 3 touching so you can make them disappear but when you make those 3 disappear it makes the other colors surrounding come together so you can collect upon those colors to create great combos of as many colors or tokens as you muster up together.  It has different game modes to entertain those that want a challenge and for those that just like to get rid of things in their lives and see progress in little portions. It is a great game for those people that like to think their way through complicated situations of decision making. It is also a great game for casual gamers looking to burn a couple minutes and money while playing.","April 20, 2011","true","2.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","1.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The faster you click coins the more points you get, I find myself just click spamming like a mad man and got to level 9.\nOnce a row of coins reaches the top (much like Tetris) the game is over.\n\nThe music and gameplay is really fun, another game I would recommend if you're bored!\n\n9/10","May 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its ok and I am sure at its time it was a nice little "att the office" type game however since the genre has seen much more innovation like Bejewelled or one of my fav of the genre "Puzzle Quest" anyhow for its time i would say it would be fun as a little office escape as long as you were competing fort high scores amongst many.","October 4, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
