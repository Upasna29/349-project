I cant belive that i missed it when it was released, this game is just pure awesomnes. I think this is the best mount and blade in the series. Its kinda similar to the last edition , Mount and blade : warband, but new addition is improved graphics and Guns. Guns adds loads of fun. The combat in this game is best i have ever met, you fire your inaccurate musket or bow from range, and on close combat you try to hit enemy with your sword, and block enemys attacks, if you master the timing, you can easily take down large group of enemies\nIn singleplayer, you start as a little poor villager, you can Travel around the map, Take quests , trade ,rob caravans, besiege castles and all kind of things. When you start to Get some money and experience , you will start to Get better gear and armor, and buy more army to you. You can ally with factions and conquer the other factions. Its awesome when at start you rob small bandit groups with your Little army of mens recruited from villages, and after some time, you have army of 100 of mens, and you Attack an enemy faction castle along with your Friendly Armies. Singleplayer is like big sandbox, you can just be trader and make loads of profits, you can be bandit and rob caravans, you can create your own faction and conquer lands, or ally with other factions and eliminate others. You can get hours and hours and hours of fun.\nThis game also has really entertaining multiplayer, first you create the way your multiplayer character looks like, then you hop in the battle. Usually there are about 50 players in same match, other team is defending castle and other is attacking it. You can buy eguiment like better armor with gold, you get more gold when  you get kills. There are also classical deathmatch , battle and other game modes. I just love the multiplayer, just the feel is awesome, when musketeers fire their muskets and trowh grenades and trought the smoke charges cavalry who tries to stab foot soldiers, and as the armies meet begins hectic sword play.\nAlso , this game has really active mod community ;3\n\nI Cant recommend this game enought, get it .. now","April 26, 2014","true","74.4"," 220 of 239 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","220","239","0","2"

It's the last revelation of a secret society. Everything that makes PC gaming great is here. Unique gameplay that would never sell on a console, History nerd heaven, MODS out the Kaiser, and fun mulitplayer.\n\nWith Fire and Sword is also an amazing entry in the series. The new weapon types shake up gameplay in wonderful ways. The setting is unique for players too. If you are not playing any of the Mount and Blade series, you aren't living properly.\n\nI would say that With Fire and Sword may not be the perfect introduction to the series for a new player.

Beyond the challenge of getting your best friend, the King, to give you a little slice to call your own, when the budget screen shows up for each town/castle/village you own, instead of putting every tariff and expense on a single sheet with a breakdown of each category as was done in basic Warband, here they point out to you EACH AND EVERY thing you have had built, and every person you have had hired for EACH AND EVERY town, castle, and village. As I mentioned in my first review, there are a lot of options for each location you own. Now imagine every week in game, you are bombarded by a 30 page dissertation of every individual expansion you have ordered. It makes the game *almost* unplayable.\n\nThis is the only major drawback of the game that I have found. If you can cope with this first paragraph, read on and see why I would still reccommend keeping a dictionary handy to check your sperling and that you should purchase Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword!\n\n\n\nIt's fan-freaking-tastic!!\nI loved the original, but lets face it, there comes a point when there is no more challenge or suprise to obliterating your opponents on the field of battle. That game was drying up for me, it was finished.\nThen this little gem appeared, and the love was reborn!\nThe game is the same concept; pick a faction, crush the opposition.\nWhat makes this game so great? They give you freaking muskets, pistols, and grenades!\nThe reload spead is faster than reality, but who wants to stand around reloading all the time?\nBut the powder weapons, even at their worst stats are devastating.\nThe grenades are a lot of fun, but leave a bit to be desired. You can choose from three different sizes: Small medium and large. (Sounds like a freaking fast food menu, right?) The problem with each of them is they do not replenish after each battle as bullets and arrows do. But hey, they're already OP, so theres gotta be a drawback somewhere, right? Now here's where I have an issue with the game: Some unknown set of circumstances casues them to explode but do no damage. (Believe me, Im not missing. When you are taking the walls and you are the first one up, get to the top of the ladder and look down at the horde waiting for you [units set at 150]. You cant miss a target like that if you tried. So after the first two grenades, the rest seem to stop working.) But with any of the three types of grenades, you can expect 3-4 kills with one throw. Oh! There is nothing more satisfying than watching a surge of blood-thirsty warriors coming at you with every ounce of confidence that you are going to be splattered across the walls. Then with a single throw, 7 of them just drop dead. And the rest? Well, there seems to be a large impact on morale with these explosions. Sometimes you dont even have to hit anyone. They hear these beasts go off nearby, and that's all for them! FT! Im done!!\n\nAnother drawback to this game: They took out a lot of the weapons you could get in the original. My favorite was the heavy axe (Or something it was a one-hamded axe, dealing 40c) and they also took out the lucern (Fudge spealling, the pole-hammer) both gone. Replaced now by generic fencing swords and eastern equivalents. The game is still entirely playable, but you just yearn for your tried and true steel buddies of old.\n\nOther features of note: You can upgrade and armor recruits at mercenary camps. Each camp has their own nationality and their upgrades only affect that nationality. (Rascist, I know)\nIn cities and Castles/fortresses: You can visit Weapon, Armor, and Horse masters to order "custom" associated gear. There is also a WONDERFUL new adition of the Merchant Guild!! Leave a couple thousand Thaler (money) at the "bank" and let it accrue interest.\n\nTheres even more to mention, but if you even managed to get this far in my review, I salute you! If you liked Warband, just stop reading and get Fire and Sword already! You wont regret it!","July 19, 2015","true","193.0"," 115 of 127 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","115","127","14","0"

For one, the graphics are a tad worse (not that i care anyway) and personally i find some of the armour in this game to be absolutely hideous, understanding that this is a different culture of course. but lets get to a list, shall we?\n\nPros:\n-Guns!\n-Explosives!\n-crouching!\n-seems to run smoother than Warband\n-You can hire and customize mercenaries of your choice\n-more indepth caravan system\n-fighting feels more challenging, in a good way\n-for sieges, there are more options to choose from before commencing the assualt. also you can blow holes in the wall\n-this is more of a personal thing, but, different cultures and factions, like Sweden and Poland (although i do love Warband's factions)\n-you can have a not-so-fancy-gentlemen's-duel with random drunk tavern guests, (this is where the thrust only swords can come in handy)\n\nCons:\n-Enemy firearms can be OP at low levels\n-some weapons are specifically thrust only\n-rather boring early game\n-the map is rather bland compared to Warband\n-the explosives have a limit(this is more of a nitpick for me, cuz it IS realistic), if you have 5 bombs and use 5 bombs in one battle, you have to buy another 5 bombs because the other 5 bombs get removed from your inventory. Did i mention 5 bombs?\n-Modding is more limited, unlike Warband's Module system (however, there is a WFAS enhanced mod that makes the game awesome)\n\n\nThat is about all i can think of right now. If you do get this game, look into the WFAS enhanced mod i mentioned above to make your experience a bit better.","February 28, 2015","true","12.0"," 80 of 82 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","80","82","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bamul/recommended/48720/","Bamul","Zbójnik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bamul/","96 products in account","When Mount & Blade came out, it was an ambitious project that did not reach its full potential. The first standalone expansion  (Warband) added some key improvements to the formula, but ultimately it felt like a re-release of the first game with just short of enough new content to justify paying full price for it if you already owned Mount & Blade. With Fire & Sword is the breath of... semi-fresh air that the series needed. The essentials of the gameplay remain almost identical (except for the great addition of powerful firearms and some other additions, which force the player to come up with new tactics). However, it is the setting of this game that really sets it apart from the two previous M&B titles.\n\nBased on Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical novel "Ogniem i mieczem", the game pushes us back to a period in real world history instead of fiction. We are taken to mid-17th century Eastern Europe, where the once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is facing war with multiple of its neighbouring nations. This is where the facts end, as the player can choose to ally himself/herself with any of the real factions included in the game (the 'Polish Commonwealth', the 'Kingdom of Sweden', the 'Cossack Hetmanate', the 'Muscovite Tsardom' or the 'Crimean Khanate') and alter the course of history. Alternatively, like in Warband, you may choose to form your own kingdom or simply remain neutral throughout the duration of the game.\n\nUltimately, the gameplay of With Fire & Sword is refined to such an extent that it feels like the most well-designed of the first three M&B titles. However, it is still very similar to the previous games and suffers from the same main flaws at the core: lack of significant unique content in terms of story. The cold and calculated nature of the tasks and actions the player is permitted to do in the game may get tedious after a while of playing. If you didn't enjoy M&B, then perhaps you should skip this one unless you really like history. On the other hand, if you enjoyed Mount & Blade then I see no reason why you shouldn't like this game (its unique and unusual setting, which explores a period in history rarely ever mentioned in video games, makes this experience more interesting).","November 25, 2013","true","17.8"," 106 of 120 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","106","120","0","0"

If you hate idea of firearms in this kind of game you shouldn't buy this game. The grade is lower than in Warband, due to some problems in gameplay and large amount of gamebraking bugs.\n\nFull review:\nThe singleplayer of this game gives you the possibility to lead mercenary warband in the setting of 17th century eastern europe. Like in mount and Blade warband, the experience is generally exciting and unique. Unlike Mount & blade Warband, which is like huge sandbox, this game tries to create what many consider the the Holy Grail of gaming , which is combining story and sandbox gameplay. Unfortunately the developers failed in this in many ways.\n\nFirst problem is that many players didn't care at all about the story and wanted to play sandbox game, but this was difficult due to the fact that unlike in Warband, you can't create your own kingdom. You can't get married either and there are no tournaments. Because of these and some other reasosn he RPG and sandbox elements are lacking compared to Warband.\n\nSecond problem is that if you follow the story (I played the Black Mace campaign which on my opinion unfortunately wasn't interesting) you will face problems. The first one of those are huge amount of bugs, that force you to load your saved game many times during the campaing. Many of these bugs are related to the fact that the world of the game changes usually independently comapred to the story. Even when these changes don't cause actual bugs, they can seriously hamper the players attempst to progress in the story. I was for example given task to capture certain city from hostile country Poland, but by the time I had army to capture it, neutral country Crimean Kahanate had already taken it. In order to capture the town, my country would have to start war also against them. This would have been almost certain defeat due to getting into war in two fronts.\n\nThird problem is the setting. Some people might be scared about the strange setting, but that is not what is the main problem. The problem that the setting causes is that it affects the gameplay negatively. In mount & Blade Warband, the player can both be commander of his/her troops and also be the superhero in shining armour that kills dozens of enemies on his/her own. This is even somewhat historical because armour made medieval knights very difficult to kill. In Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, half of those filthy peasants :-) that you used to kill without trouble are now armed with firearms, that kill you with one or two shots on hardest difficulty. Even on lower difficulty levels it is difficult to be superhero anymore. The one shot kill firearms also make melee weapons relatively weak, which is a shame, because one of the best things in Mount & Blade series is the melee combat.\n\nDespite the severe problems in singleplayer I gave this game grade of 7, because the basic mechanics of Mount & Blade series are still there and they are great.\n\nMultiplayer part is good, mainly due to the uniqueness of Mount & blade combat. The reason to not to give 9/10 for multiplayer is that there are no modifications for multiplayer unlike in Warband, and because the gameplay is slightly worse due to what firearms cause to the gameplay.","November 27, 2013","true","165.1"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","65","75","0","0"

I've put hundreds of hours into it, and I'll likely put hundreds of house more into it. Takes place in the real world in mid-17th century Eastern Europe. There's 5 factions; Muscovite Tsardom (Russia), Sweden, Poland, Crimean Khanate (Crimea, which is a location in the game), and the Cossacks. You'll meet people from these areas as well as Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Scotsmen. There are muskets, and because of the time period, they come in a variety of flavours. Home made, matchlock, wheel lock, and Miquelet (flintlock) are the main ones, in order of quality. Accuracy is in short supply of course, but I do believe there are some rifled muskets in the game, however they are VERY expensive, and not something you can give normal soldiers. Only your own character, and heroes.\n\nYou amass your own Army, there are many different endings, and there are many different ways to fight. Personally I like to position my cavalry to the side, while my infantry takes 10 paces in front of my marksmen to defend them from enemy cavalry, while my own cavalry does the same. If the enemy bowmen/musketmen get too close for my liking, I'll send in my infantry to charge them, make them switch from ranged attack to melee, so that my own musketman can help quell them while they're busy with my infantry and cavalry.\n\nWorks very well for me so far, as you can tell it's all basically revolving around my musketmen, but the infantry and cavalry certainly have their place. Without one or the other, I would feel vulnerable. You can cavalry if you like, or perhaps just stick with infantry and musketmen, or even exchange the musketmen for bowmen but you best have some DAMN strong bowmen with some DAMN strong bows because as troops come with heavier armour, those arrows quickly start doing less and less damage, however muskets will always do a lot of damage... when the shots hit. Thick shields and thick armour combined can really lessen a musket's effectiveness however.\n\nThere's lots of quests, lots of cities and towns, lots of different methods to take in order to secure victory, the replay value is VERY MUCH present, and as many battles as I take part in, it never seems to get old. The tutorial is entertaining enough, complete with voice acting, but it's not something that drags out annoyingly long. It puts you in the action quite quickly, and then you're free to go, Eastern Europe is yours to explore! Though there are some muskets that are so accurate you'd think them rifled, there's always bullet drop, so you'll have to learn to compensate for that. It just adds to the gameplay however, which though simple, is difficult to master, and I'd have it no other way. Like Call of Pripyat with Misery mod (and The Armed Zone if you REALLY want to be overloaded with firearm selection), and like Red Orchestra II/Rising Storm, I expect to ultimately end up with 1000+ hours in this game as the years go by. Sure it doesn't look particularly pretty, but there's a unique appeal to it that I've yet to find in any other game or mod. An experience in and of itself.\n\nThe process of leveling up, improving my various aspects, getting better gear, customizing ther Mercenaries available for hire at Mercenary Camps, training them up from Recruit, to Experienced, to Veteran, to Elite... it's so much fun that I've lost count of how many time I've restarted the game. A clean slate starting at day 1, my current playthrough is over 450 days in-game, over a year's worth, my Army is at a max of about 87-88 troops, however when I put the coin down for Mercenaries with ALL the best equipment I can give them, then train them together with a few of my heroes to work them up to Veterans and Elites, my less than 90 soldiers feels more like 150-200 or more, usually depending on how many muskets the enemy is bringing to the battlefield. If none, it feels like I've got 300 troops, might even be gutsy enough to take on 350 if all they have is bowmen, but that might be reaching a bit too far. All the same, there's such a wide range of armour, melee weapons, bows, muskets, horses, troops, and so on... the variety is amazing. Ultimately though, we all know that muskets would come to rule the battlefields in the 18th and early-mid 19th centuries, so although most of the muskets in the game are primitive matchlocks, it can only be expected that they'd ultimately be superior.\n\nThat said however... armoured, well trained, and well equipped bowmen vs unarmoured, untrained, and ill-equipped musketmen? I'd put my money on the bowmen any day of the week. You don't pick up a musket and you're suddenly invincible. If you see a hussar barreling at you on horseback with lance couched, as of yet untouched on the battlefield, a single musket ball will likely do little more than ♥♥♥♥ him off, you'll want a second one to finish the job, but if he gets you with that lance, musket or no, you're equally dead both ways. Some say that cavalry with muskets is all you need, but cavalry can only use carbines of pistols, and not only that, firing on horseback isn't as accurate as firing on the ground, so not only does fool soldiers with muskets have more accurate firearms that cause more damage, they also have the advantage of firing on the ground.\n\nHowever once they have to be forced to use melee, the shooting stops, and if the enemy is still shooting or firing arrows, then you're at a heavy disadvantage, which is where the infantry comes into play. Troops trained in melee combat, often given better melee weaponry, have them positioned to protect your musketmen, just as pikemen had done before the advent of the bayonet. If the fighting becomes stagnant though, with the musketmen a mere 50m away, sending in volley after volley, order the infantry to charge, get up in their faces so they can't keep their muskets spitting, but keep your men firing lead balls into them. Yes, just like chess, there are many ways to attain victory. Find your own way, your own troops, your own tactics, and take 17th century Eastern Europe for your own!

Multiple ladders instead of one. Good if you are an attacker, bad if you are defender.\n~Gameplay. Overpowered bullet damage forces you to keep your distance and player smarter.\n\nCons:\n\n-HORRIBLE SIEGE AI. ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. Half the time your troops or the enemy is just standing there, doing absolutely NOTHING or they keep switching their weapons back and forth, whilst doing nothing.\n-Bugs. CTD bugs after tabbing out, finishing a battle, or just traversing the map sometimes. 'Line error' messages and more bugs sometimes after battles and quest completions. And then you can also shoot someone and the bullet will go behind and not do any damage. Extremely annoying.\n-Campaign intructions are vague and hard to figure out. You will end up using google to complete missions. I guarantee it.\n-Tax revenue from towns is no longer automatic. You have to visit your town to collect.\n\n\n\nOverall, it is a step down from Warband. Sure, you can say "but guns, so cool, much wow. pew pew gg" but these new additions do NOT make up for the sloppy AI and the bugs. The "RAAHH CHARGE!!!! I'LL KILL 50 OF YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!" feeling at the beginning of every battle is not the same as it is in Warband, there's more of a risk to go in balls deep forcing you to stay back in every battle.\n\nTL;DR - Do not buy this game if you are looking to get into the Mount & Blade series, buy Warband instead.. Vanilla (unmodded) Warband offers a similar experience but with less of the hassle. Modded Warbands offers a superior experience, and it has a wide array of mods in comparison.","August 3, 2014","false","29.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","20","27","4","3"

I've read both positive and negative reviews for this game and I can see how it can go either way.\n\nI personally enjoy this game, it gives you an entirely new perspective on the world forcing the player to adapt to a new environment very quickly. I find making enemies much easier in With Fire & Sword than it was in Warband, so you need to watch what you do or you could find yourself alone against an army.\n\nMount and Blade: With Fire & Sword is very similar to Warband only in a different era (The 17th Century to be exact).

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and doesnt mind to learn from mistakes.","March 17, 2014","true","230.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Maybe the guns are the fire part....This game include features not included in warband like Guns, Customization of your army (upgrade their gear), the game is set in the real world, I think the mercenary camps are new (You can hire soldiers and customize your army here). The hard part about this game is also the good part. Invading castles is harder now because the guns are more hard hitting than arrows most of the time being a 1 shot kill.

Example: my country's capital Vilna (Lithuanian spelling: Vilnius) had a river getting into two pieces, a very steep hill with a great tower on top and walls surrounding. the tower on hill is even today staying there. you could google it too. Trakai, that village nearby, was no worse, it had huge great fort in a island which was in a huge lake, altho what i've seen was a random village with a few houses ingame. The map could've been more accurate.\nCombat + Units 8.0/10.0\nThe game, has great combat, altho sometimes AI gets easily stuck or it forgets to fight and other funny buggy things. sometimes they even bug out so hard, but still its good.\nBut the units, you could've make a bigger variety of them, because i am pretty sure there was not a lack of unit kinds there. I like the ones that you made, but some are little inaccurate.\nStorylines + Quests 7.5/10.0\nThe Quests from cities are a little boring: if you do much of them, they repeat quickly...\nStorylines are good, but sometimes buggy.\nFactions 9.5/10\nWell they're great, but it would've been more amazing if we wouldve had prussia, ottomans, austrians too!\n\nOverall calculated rating of these things from me is 7.625/10.000","March 14, 2015","true","927.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

The difficulty between this game and Warband has been increased greatly, which isn't a bad thing. Once you got a hang of Warband the AI got fairly easy. Unfortunately success in this game is not only greatly more difficult, especially at the lower levels, but often your success in matters are not only random, but often the odds of missions you are given are literally impossible.\n\nIf the only issue was difficulty it'd not be a problem. But mission scaling is horrendously broken. If you take a mission, especially at the lower levels, you have typically less than a fifty percent chance of finishing it. I would say the game is just too difficult, but I've nearly mastered Warband and I can't play this one for more than a few minutes without either losing and getting captured, or save scumming.","June 12, 2014","false","55.3"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","34","60","0","0"

Thanks alot, buddy. Fire & Sword, as a standalone expansion to Warband, is almost mechanically identical to it's relative game and has everything from it that makes it good, but there are tweaks and alterations that set it apart from the game enough to justify it as it's own separate title. Not only changing the weapons that the skills constitute and the armor and apparel to go with the new, much more advanced and recent setting than Warband, but to go with that, they added guns and grenades (Hence 'Fire and Sword'.) which is my favorite selling point in this game, because of this, they changed the ranged infantry from Archers to Marksmen, whom you can command to form rows thanks to the new additions to the order-giving system this game has. However, Fire & Sword also shares the two infamous gripes I have with Warband: Frustration with regards to difficulty, and as mentioned in the Warband review, letting a snail win a race to you while you're -riding a horse.- Oh well, just like Warband, this gets a 9/10, an impressive.","December 27, 2014","true","32.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The only thing that comes close to saving this game is the commander game variant in Multiplayer out of my 120 odd hours about 100 of it was spent in that gamemode, it had a better feel to it than even the commander mode in NW. The smaller squad sizes and abiltiy to choose your troops specifically, gives the gamemode a much more tactical feel and when you loose a man, it hurts, it would actually sadden me when one of my 6 childeren took a bullet to the head.\n\nI will still reccomend the game because of this one gamemode, without it the game wouldnt be worth it.

It is not as good as Warband, but it's fun. It's got optional story, which is nice, and guns and horses and swords, which are all nice, (oh, and GRENADES!) but it has its fair share of problems. You can't set up your custom kingdom, you can only usurp existing ones. Bad. You can die (yes, that matters a lot!), which is not supposed to happen in M&B, and some of the storylines are just plain silly. Looking at The Deluge and Black Mace! False Dmitri is probably the best one. Speaking of which, this game is considerably more linear than the others, which is why it is out of the loop. Mount&Blade is supposed to be sandbox open-world blah blah. Also, you can't go home and become a family man here. You don't have that option anymore. So, go back to Warband for the moment, and wait until Bannerlord to -see if it is any good-. EDIT: Bannerlord will be the best game of all time. Be a family man.\n\nAnyway, returning to this, guns!

Though it isn't as good as Mount and Blade: Warband, it is still awesome in its own way.\n\nPros:\nGuns - guns are OP. Sure, they take a long time to reload, but they have power and can wipe out whole armies.\n\nActual trading - assessing local prices actually means something and you can make lots of money by doing it. Also, you get to form your own caravans, which is awsome and makes you very rich if you do it right.\n\nBanks and Guilds -you get to deposit money in banks and gain interest on that. You can also take loans as well. There are special guilds which can sell you special armor and weapons. Though expensive, they are very cool and can provide you with some cool stuff.\n\nUseful Castles - sounds weird, I know, but now every fortress or castle has a tavern and a marketplace. Unlike the Warband castles, which were basically just strongholds, the WF&S castles allow you to sell stuff, access the tavern, and talk to a mayor for quests.\n\nInteresting story-based quests  - there are special series of story-based quests for the Poles, the Russians, and the Cossacks. These stories are well-done and are quite interesting, giving you some history lessons while at the same time letting you campaign and battle Mount and Blade style.\n\nGrenades  - sure, they're almost always inefficient and usually not worth the steep price, but they are freaking GRENADES. IN MOUNT AND BLADE!!!!\n\nCons -\nBugs and Glitches - the developers moved on before the game was fully fixed, which is a huge shame. Though the game is mostly smooth and most problems have been dealt with, you may experience some graphical glitches here and there. At the worst, you will have a bug that wiill ruin your game. For example, a faction leader will be defeated in battle and never reappear, or the story-based quests will break and you'll be forever stuck on one part. Hopefully, you won't have these, but you've been warned.\nLack of variety - in Warband, all the factions were truly unique, with obvious strengths and weaknesses. In WF&S, all the factions seem the same. Aside from appearances and some strengths (Poles= cavalry. Swedes = infantry), the factions don't have enough variety to make they feel truly unique in battle. At the end of the day, they are all essentially the same.\nNo Story for Crimeans and Swedes - while the Russians, Poles, and Cossacks have story-based quests, the Crimeans and Swedes have none, which is a shame\nMap is Bland - in Warband, you have a desert, a steppe, a tundra, a mountain range, and a plains region. These added variety to the game and made the different areas unique. In WF&S, the entire map is flat, with just rivers and a few patches of forest. Woop-ee.\n\nOverall, don't let the cons prevent you from buying the game. It is a very fun and exciting experience which all Mount and Blade fans should have.","January 23","true","143.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I love this game and have enjoy it immensely a thousands times more than Warband. The line battles in Napoleonic Wars don't even match up to this game. TaleWorlds Entertainment is ripping themselves off by offering this standalone for 10$. I do not lie when I say if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased this at full price, not on sale and never picked up Warband. Its obvious more people like Warband because it's medieval theme, but for people like me, Fire and Sword is a little trip to gamer's heaven. While the loyal fanbase is moving on to Bannerlord, I'll still be on my little island, riding my war horse, bow in hand, leading Khan styled hoards, charging straight for an army of Polish Winged Hussars, while arquebus and wheelock muskets can be heard in the distance.","May 6","true","83.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Graphically i don't think Fire and Sword is really an inmprovement. Personally i don't think it looks very good, but let's be honest, that is never what Mount and Blade was about. If it was, they failed every time.\n\nThe playstyle of the game is very much the same as all other games, with the same idea behind blocking and attacking n melee, and shooting. This is set in the early era of the invention of guns, i don't know for certain but maybe early 1700's? Either way, the uniforms for the soldiers look very old, and the guns are NOT very accurate. They also feel very 'light' and a bit too easy to aim, in comparison to that of Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe campaign is 'good'. That is about all i can say for it. It is much like the other games of it's type. Overpriced equipment, limits on army size and plenty of fetch and carry missions, and still no luck with marrying into a wealthy family. I think once you have played any Mount and Blade campaign, you have played them all.\n\nI can't think of much more to review in this game, maybe because there is nothing else. Overall, i don't like the time era very much which has turned me away from the game. I prefer the Napoleonic Wars by far. Other than that, death and melee still looks stupidly unrealistic, gunshots sound like...anything but gunshots, and the music is quite bad.\n\nDespite all this, i cannot say i don't like the game. Mount and Blade are good at making addictive games that are quite bad in comparison to other games, yet still very good. I know all that made sense, but i feel better for getting that out.\n\n8/10. Graphics and the era ruined it for me more than anything, but i do like it.","January 10","true","47.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

My god they are annoying.\nSo say you want some good old swordfighting action, yeah? You want them to fully block, and attack\nlike a proper duel, yes?

If you haven't - M&B is a sandbox game. You are being thrown into a pretty big map, full of villages and cities belonging to one of five factions. And then... well, you tell me. You want to become a bandit, rob caravans and burn villages? Why not? Want to be a vigilante, taking down bandits and doing small jobs for the lords? Why wait? How about joining the faction, gaining fiefs, and taking over hostile factions? Go on. Or maybe... create your own faction, and become a king? Your call. Or you can always be a merchant. Still a good idea if you enjoy it. This applies both for warband and With fire and Sword.\nFactions in WF&S are Polish Commonweatlh (with their extraordinary cavalery), Kingdoms of Sweden and Russia, Cossacs and Tatars. Each faction has it's strong and weak sides, as well as it's unique units. Speaking of units, i have to say that I'm  disappointed. not by the numbers - there are plenty of them, but upgrades.... most of the units can only be upgraded to veteran/elite status. Even village recruits can be upgraded maximally to Mercenary status. Which means - obtaining unique faction units is really hard.\nA word about equipment. Crossbows were removed, instead, you get muskets and pistols. Pretty good and deadly weapons, if you know how to use them. Of course, they need bullets. Luckily, they refill after each battle. Weird enough, granades (yep, there are explosives. Quite powerfull, yet, quite pricy) don't refill. So if you buy pack of 3, use one - next battle you'll have 2. Quite annoying, isn't it?\nTo sum up, if you enjoyed Warband, but got a bit bored with Swandians and other Nords, and want to try something new, but not THAT new, try WF&S.\nP.S: Just realised that it's just like Napoleonic wars, if it were abit more to the east, and contained single-player","September 17, 2015","true","19.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It provides a historical backdrop for 1650's warfare in central Europe, including Cossack, Tatar, Muscovite, Polish and Swedish units and cities.  Some mods extend the map and available units too.\n\nGame is ungoddly awesome.  Something about riding a horse while shooting - it's a similar feeling to flying.  You can command units with great precision and it takes a while to master.  But what a rush to play - even though I completely suck at fighting, buidling up an army and working out the tactics is great.  The AI is is pretty good too (I'm guessing completely based on Behavior Trees).  Sometimes I play the sniper while the rest of the army is skirmishing - really hard to get in a good shot - and very satisfying when it connects.  These are ancient guns and not rifled, so they aren't very accurate from long-range.\n\nAlso playing solo (no army yet) and taking out the horse of some jerk who's tearing me up - it's a big rush of adrenhaline!\n\nEconomy is quite clever, where you can drive down market prices and then send caravans at a discount.  Can also take out loans in a pinch.\n\nIf you quit the tutorial immediately, then it's a little more challenging to start with no money, no gun and no horse - I think this is the best way to play it.","April 16, 2013","true","225.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That said, it's a fantastic game, with a few quirks.\n\nBest point:\n\nGuns.  They make every battle more tense and unpredictable, because it only takes a stray bullet or two to put you out of comission fast.  While in the old M&B I would just charge in and kick ♥♥♥ (once I got to a certain level) even against ridiculous odds, in this one I've actually found myself strategizing, having the marksmen follow me, coming in slowly.  Aside from guns, money and supplies seem a little more plentiful and goods more fairly priced, which means I'm not always worrying whether or not I'm going to have the funds/food to pay/feed the troops.\n\nWorst point:  Glitchy main story quests.  I had to restart after several hours of play, just because of a buggy quest that would not allow me to join a faction.  Not saying it will happen to you, but it certainly dampened my enthusiasm, at least initially.  Also, the tutorial is still too basic, and doesn't explain how or why to join your faction.\n\nBottom line:  If you only get one M&B game, it should probably be Warband (or the original, if it's on sale).  But I play this more than the original now.\n\nNote:  Have not ventured into multiplayer yet, but that's not really why I play M&B...","August 25, 2014","true","141.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingHusky/recommended/48720/","VikingHusky","Ignar Hrodgæirsson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingHusky/","47 products in account","Despite what people may say.. I personally think it's really good.\n\n\nSome of the Pros is that they have firearms. Outfits look really nice, HUGE map, and have a few story modes you can partake in (I believe it's Sweden, Russia, Commonwealth, and Crimea). Plus you can actually feel like you're in a line and if you know the commands.. Can win a battle in a single volley. Just as Carolus Rex, I was outnumbed in this battle against Russians. -4 Battle advantage. Didn't look promising for me. But I had a strong musket infantry line. And as Cavalry charged, most went down. And then the infantry came. Took out a large portion of them in two volleys.\n\n\nNow there is cons.. You can't create your own kingdom. Apparently the economics are bad(I haven't noticed, looks the same to me), can't recruit from villages(as far as I can tell), the huge map makes you look like an ant. So if you zoom out, you're gonna lose yourself. Or where you're trying to find.\n\nThough overall, I love the game. Very fun and unlike the Custom Battles for Napoleonic Wars of M&B, the AI can actually shoot their guns. The rating I give is Recommend and a 7/10. I think they could've done more to Fire and Sword. But it's still a good game. Don't buy into the negative "The economy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥" or "Glitches everywhere". Because I haven't found a single glitch yet. Or at least one I haven't noticed.\n\nEDIT - After playing for WAY more, I'll edit the review some more.\n\nThe Story modes are The Polish Commonwealth, Russia, and The Cossaks.\n\nAnd you can technically "own" a kingdom. You just can't name it, or be for one paticular side. The fief you capture will be called the land you took it from with "Rebels" at the end. (For example, if you conquered Warsaw, it would be "The Polish Commonwealth(Rebels)". Though, unfortunately, you can't do anything with it besides own having it for yourself. Regardless, it's still very fun.","February 25","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The biggest to me is probably the introduction of firearms into Mount and Blade, its pretty powerful. early on, and I myself never had any problems just riding into huge battles alone on horseback just to shot dead most enemies before finishing off any stragglers. That being said I feel like it is also missing some of the broader features of Warband, thus losing some of the variation in gameplay.\n\nI have not spent as much time with the game, on or off Steam as I have with the other two Mount and Blade games so I don't have as much experience with Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword.

Mount & Blade games are good because they are different to other games. Although some people might find it boring, I think you can spend a long time on it because there is singleplayer and multiplayer. Obviously people will mostly go on multiplayer, multiplayer is more challenging than singleplayer.\nFire & Sword is also quite realistic because in some games you can shoot people in the head and they don't die, but with this game they will die if shot with a gun or bow in the head. I would rate 9.5/10 because of the sheer lack of graphics, but that dosen't really interfere with gameplay.","August 7, 2014","true","74.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have a gaming boner for Mount and Blade single player campaigns and want to try one with a little more structure and story, or you have a history boner for north-eastern europe around the 1600s, or you just want to play mount and blade with guns but also horses and are aware of the fact that unfortunately the MP community for mods is universally tiny - this is definitely worth grabbing.\n\nIf you haven't played Mount and Blade and aren't sure you like the series, try Warband instead.","November 26, 2013","true","565.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have a gaming boner for Mount and Blade single player campaigns and want to try one with a little more structure and story, or you have a history boner for north-eastern europe around the 1600s, or you just want to play mount and blade with guns but also horses and are aware of the fact that unfortunately the MP community for mods is universally tiny - this is definitely worth grabbing.\n\nIf you haven't played Mount and Blade and aren't sure you like the series, try Warband instead.","November 26, 2013","true","565.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a storyline to go with the action, new factions based on true history and plenty of men to boot.\n\nThis Warband focuses less on allowing you to create your own faction and more or less forces you to become a Vassal. Again nothing wrong with that, it's just very unrewarding claiming your own kingdom so i tend to avoid it.\n\nOverall, everything is the same you just may not like it as much but it is still woth the money easily and the online also remains with guns helping increase the diversity of troops.\n\nI grant this a solid 8.8/10","August 25, 2011","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

My computer is complete ♥♥♥♥ and i can run this amazing game really smoothly and my computer isnt even a gaming computer anyways.\n\nheres the good about this game: the fighting in this game is really good and it is really fun to play with friends to have a good laugh with and team up agains other players you can customize your character Male/Female and make them look how ever you would like. There are a couple of game modes you can play like survival, Teamdeath match, Deathmatch and so on. Theres even a campaign so if you dont feel like playing with other players you can go on there or in private match to play by your self.\n\nThe bad: The shooting in this game is kind of hard you have to aim in a certain area to shoot someone in the head, leg, chest etc. if you are on a horse and your weapon is a  spear or sword you have to aim in a certain way as well to kill them easy. If you are on foot and about to fight someone and they have a sword and you have a spear it is hard to attack back because the sword is quicker than the spear AND YES there is weight heavy armor with a broad sword or a heavy pike you will run slow and if your getting attacked and trying to run put away your weapon and run.\n\nBUT all in all ithis is a great game i highly recommend it hope this helped :)","January 31","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall it's a great game, for me I like it because it's during the era of when the two nations of my background prospered (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). The aspect of employing prisoners is great, especially if you want to create a force of all German soldiers or all Polish Żołniers or Husaria. But what becomes annoying is running your own kingdom, and the constant encounters with brigands and rebels who think they have even a chance to defeat you.\n\nMy tip, forget infantry or cavalry, just employ musketeers and during battles or sieges line them up in 2 rows so when the enemy charges, you can just mow them down. The Crimeans are the easiest to beat since they mostly use archers instead of musketeers.","May 17","true","260.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

One reason this game is so unique is because it has a different style of musket fighting than in the other mount and blade mods. The game gives you a sense of individuality in multiplayer, in which there is no sandbox you just battle with other people. In the other mount and blade mods and other games like those, you fight in groups so you are more of a body of men than a single soldier. In the multiplayer almost everyone moves at their own free will, like an irregular. So being a musketeer means more of you by yourself than you in a battalion of infantry. But it also allows other things, imagine a knight with a gun. This game is very fun but the multiplayer takes a while to master especially since there are a lot of hackers on some of the servers so PRACTICE!!! But other than that this game is very wide spread so it covers a lot of fields so this game is definitely one of my favorites.","May 29","true","89.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Not Only are you getting a hands on experience about a certain period in time, but you also get to make your own character, build you own army however you please, and become a lord of your own nation. If that doesn't suit you, you can become in kind to a bandit and raid "innocent" villages and reap to rewards. Or you may wish to be a merchant, learn the arts of trade, what sells for good where and how to make money quick. Feeling lonely playing by yourself? You can play online with friends and pplay through different scenarios. Ever wanted to besiege a castle, or fight alongside up to 200 men? you ccan do all that here in a quick battle, too. The point is, this game is great in most fields and live up to more than its expectations. Mount & Blade in general is a great series and WFAS keeps the trend goiing. 10/10. Besides graphics, I believe this is one of the best games and you will not be dissapointed by getting it. GG no re.

I bought this game to play in a clan and I really was disappointed when there wasn't any multiplayer :(\n\nThere is that *lag* fire ( Firing when you do not release your mouse button to fire your ranged\n\n+++\n\n*Good things*\n\nAlot of players tend to play Captain Co-op. I love it! This is when you team up with other players to defeat the oncoming raids of AI soldiers.\n\nFunny stuff happens when you kill a guy off a castle wall into a pond xD\n\nAlso got a very cool story line- Deluge, Black mace :P Good achievements to be had also.\n\nto be continued ( Need to play more so I need ideas!!! =D )","April 3, 2014","true","48.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

There is nothing wrong with this game.  Living up to the standards I've come to expect from Paradox Interactive, this game is perfection, fine-tuned.\n\nSome say that introducing firearms ruined the game, but that isn't true.  It made it different, and people hate change.  Playing through the campaign of this game blasts you with the ideal that indeed, graphics don't need to be perfect to have a completly immersive game.\n\nHuge battles that are decently historically accurate (as far as weapons / armors go), and an excellent team-building system make this one of the epics.  A game I ALWAYS come back to.  Living the life of the gun-runner in the medieval era, or any other sort of life for that matter, makes this game great for me.

Whether is be from the fairly complex battle system, to the robust and dynamic economic system, all the way to just not having my hand held. The reason for me being, initially, overwhelmed, was that there isn't really any direction given to you (so, for all of you players who hate linearity, take a look at this). Essentially, you're thrown into a huge world after you complete the short tutorial, and with only two towns to note, you have no main quest line (at first), no grandiose story (also, at first), nothing. "Why?" you may ask. The answer is one that, albeit cliché, is simply because it's up to you.  With literally no bars to take note of, you can: make a living learning all of the best trading items and locations, be sure to spend a ton of money on mercs though; plunder every poor village you see, using the money and supplies to further expand your small band of unruly thieves; play the noble boot-licker, and live a virtuous and honest life as you win further glory for your lord. As the parenthetical phrases have said, the lack of a story is only in the beginning, when you're not a particularly notable character. Though, you could completely ignore that story, and still fully enjoy every aspect of the game.\n\nAside from the story, the combat system is something to take note of. There are speed multipliers that aide or detract from damage done on horseback, range and reach modifiers that take note of how much damage point X on a longsword does compared to point Y or Z, guns that can literally change the tide of any fight (I've been one shot so much while prancing around on my pony...), and fun archery, crossbows, and throwing weapons, all affected by range of the shot, location of impact, and all that nitty gritty stuff. As a side note, it's a fun little challenge (and I use that term loosely) to find a band of 10+ looters, or similarly weak enemies, and fight them by yourself, I've taken grenades into those fights, and run circles around the enemy to herd them, in a sense, and then just toss a grenade ;)\n\nThe characters are rather lackluster unless you're dealing with specific, named characters, who all have their own sets of morals and values. For an example, a more noble character may leave your party if you're constantly bullying small villages, whereas the more violent-loving characters may shun you from running from a fight - yes, even if it's your 20 man squad of peasants, versus a noble's 100 man squad of elite soldiers. Named characters also have their own skill sets, so finding the proper balance of brain and brawn, or just pure brawn, is all a matter of personal taste and is affected by your long-term goals for a character. The political aspect of each faction and character is something that I find incredibly amusing as well, blindly taking quests from the nobles of Sweden may land you as the enemy against whomever they're currently at war with, thus losing a key trading outpost (I say this from experience, be careful).\n\nThis game hasn't won any awards for its graphics, they can be buggy, low res, low poly-count, and all of the above at one time. And, speaking of bugs, there can be a lot. Tearing in a lot of terrain, a complete lack of rendering in the overworld, and just flat out moronic AI, the pros outweigh the cons, immensely.\n\nMultiplayer is something that I didn't bother with much, but I have dabbled. From what I've played, the classes seem fairly balanced, and the 'kill to coin' system if very reminiscent of CS.\n\nIn the case of Warband vs With Fire and Sword, I'd have to take WFaS. Overall, the game feels slightly more immersive with the landmass being real geographical locations, cheaper costs for mercenaries (which actually did take away a lot of frustration from a lot of my merchant characters), and guns. Guns are incredibly amusing to play with since the game takes place in the period of time when gunpowder just began to be utilized for firearms and explosives. There's also some quality of life improvements with the guildmaster from warband being replaced by the mayor, who's accessible from a town menu, there are also more towns you can actually visit, rather than large amounts of fortresses that only house nobles. Sadly, though, I have yet to see tournaments in any of the towns, and that was a major point of fun for a lot of my playthroughs.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game, with a lot more than you could hope for. Don't judge a game by its graphics: 9/10","June 18, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you want a more balanced combat system, with each class having advantages and disadvantages, then go to Mount and Blade Warband. If you want quick, ranged battles with the battles being dominated primarily by musketmen, then this is the game.

There's only four ranged weapons - Pistol, Carbine, Musket and Bow, where Musket is the only ranged powder weapon that can't be used on horseback. The melee weapons lack the cosmetic appeal they need.\n\nOh, and many of the quests are bugged as well to the point that you will have to consult a walkthrough in order to avoid the bugs. There is also a lack of ways to increase your renown in the game where there are only small groups of bandits and you'll be forced to fight the lords of one nation if you want to increase your renown faster than escorting caravans to towns and picking off small bands of bandits.","May 18","false","24.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Get warband instead.\nLenght: Infinate\n\nNote: Below is my review from warband. Imagine that it's basically like Warband, but not as good. Which isn't saying much to begin with! This title simply takes away the few features that made warband addictive and entertaining.\n\n\nWhile definately entertaining, this game feels like it was never fully developed and was released in it's beta, or even alpha state. It presents a weird mix of game types, from RPG like conversations via dialogue options to Heroes of Might and Magic style overland map travelling to open combat in third person, like in Oblivion.\n\nWhile this may sound great, and is infact entertaning (for a while), the game is lacking in so many departments that it's almost embarrasing. It could have been so much, but unfortunately, this is what we get.\n\nThe worst about this game, is, that it's unwinnable. There is no purpose in the game, so it's just a sandbox freeroam game with randomly generated missions and encounters. That get's old quickly.\n\nWhile not a true paradox game, I can see why paradox published it. There are some similar elements. This game is extremely addicting and can feel overwhelming at times, which is what hooks the player. The potential of going from lowly peasant to ruler of an empire and the danger of losing it all even at that point.\n\nThere is so much unused potential in this game.\n\nA new title is coming out soon, a "sequel" of sorts, I recommend waiting for that.","November 14, 2011","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's one of the few games I like enough to buy twice.\n\nMost people who've played both seem to like Warband better, and I'd have to agree that certain aspects of WB do make it a little easier to get into, one of the major ones being that you'll probably never get killed by some ♥♥♥♥ing peasant with a musket in the land of Calradia.\n\nThat said, I think that the majority of the people who don't like this game much only feel that way because they don't realize that you need to play it very differently than Warband. It's about commanding your army more than glorious personal combat, all because of the guns. This is a good thing, really, because an unskilled dude being able to kill someone who'd trained all their life for melee combat and had invested a small fortune into their equipment by simply pointing a cheap, crude little stick at them is what ended the feudal era. Very, very few games set around this time (or even far, far later) really accurately represent how game changing a gun really is.\n\nThe key to having alot of fun with F&S is to play it more like a first person strategy game. Don't charge in there with your mass of calvalry, maybe telling your handful of ranged guys to stand just a ways off of where the collision will occur. This will probably work if you personally don't get killed, but you will take some ridiculous losses. Instead, fight like you would if you were engaging a wall of enemies with deadly ranged weapons. Move up behind hills, set your own musket lines up, and let them slug it out  for a bit. Move around the side with your calvalry. When the moment is right, and the enemy is a little scattered, fix your bayonettes, sound the pipes, and ♥♥♥♥ing CHARGE! Your losses will still be noticable, depending on your army composition, but you can always get more conscripts, and the odds of you getting shot by just one or two ♥♥♥♥ing peasants with muskets is pretty slim.\n\nThis is the uncaring, unglorious, bloody fighting that is musket warfare, and this is the whole reason to buy this game.\n\nIn every other way, the game is actually quite a bit better than vanilla Warband. UI is better, menus are better, recruiting isn't really better per se, but much more realistic. Trade is better, etc. etc. It's sort of like fallout 3 and New Vegas - one seems pretty great untill you play the other, then it's hard to really go back and get the same sort of enjoyment out of it.\n\nBuy it if you want to support a good franchise, or if you think fighting with muskets sounds fun. If you want glorious personal combat, the ability to strike terror into your foes with Winged Helms, and battles that can always be won just by riding your horse in a circle, buy Warband instead.","November 19, 2014","true","23.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's economical aspect is much better than Warband who had basically no economy.\n\nI wish the economy of the game would reflect the income and resources a lord has. That way, commerce would be even more interesting, and being a bandit even more fun as caravans would transport important supplies.\n\nCombat, as in all M&B, is excellent. Adding firearms only adds another dimension to the already excellent combat system.\n\nIt would be nice if the designer could make a gameworld as good as their game system. Right now, few gameworlds were interesting enough to hook me more than a dozen hours each. I lose interest in M&B games due to the bland game worlds. I don't mind having no story if I have something to do in the game world like trading, building, patrolling, hunting, marrying, spying, conquering, diplomacy, politics, economics, road building, bridge building, cult-related stuff, etc. There are very few of these things you can do in all M&B games put together. I really thing they should improve the game worlds they use, they are too colourless.\n\nStill, it's a must buy for anyone who dreamed since the 1980s of having a game where you can fight on horseback in real time, not some dumb swings of weapons on horse back, real fighting with some physics involved.","May 19, 2015","true","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While many others did enjoy this game, with right reasoning too, I personally enjoy the other two predeseres to the mount and blade franchise. Let me tell you why. I have seen plenty of mods for mount and blade warband and they have been pretty good. In fact I would go as far as to say some of them are up to par or even better than what with fire and sword has to offer, a ten dollar game mind you, as where the mods were completely free (Minus the game). This game really brought me down and thought the mount and blade series was slowing and going down, but news of a sequal to warband has got my hopes up for the franchise again. Now let me tell you why I prefer warband to this. In this game you dont recruit people from villages anymore, a perfectly fine mechanic they threw that out the window to make it where you have to get people from the merc. camp in the faction. Now this is kinda a load of bull because they cost way too much and also are not very good in combat, the unit upgrade system was funky and when the game was released you could not even upgrade your troops to begin with. The interface and combat seems clunky, the weapons are very unrealisic, and the quests I just dont like in my opinion. Overall rating for this game? 4/10 could be better.","February 19, 2014","false","22.9"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","2"

Mount & Blade Warband also has a pretty decent vanilla game compared to this game, as this game constantly feels like its missing features as stated before.\nThere is one thing I do like about this game and that's the ability of fire arms in the vanilla game (which there are mods for fire arms in Warband) and the ability to mass recruit soldiers at low costs, other than that I don't really care for the game.\n\nIf you love Warband you may want to try this game but just know this game is lacking more so in the content department than Warband is and mods are what make up Warband and this game doesn't nearly have the wide variety of mods as Warband has.\n\nIt's a good game, don't get me wrong but it's just lacking with content and the world feels more empty than Warband and the lack of mods and vanilla features that were in Warband makes me give this game a thumbs down.","May 3, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I enjoyed courting my future wife and i enjoyed joining a tournament. I also miss being able to take on 10 guys by myself easy as pie. With the presence of firearms, you WILL die in 1-2 bullets, unless you leave your damage taken at 1/4 (Easiest) Getting fiefs is now a HUGE chore! Want to get your nice personal custom musket? it costs over 100k thaler.. How do you get 100k thaler? There are ways of getting cash, but it still takes quite a long time, I have done about 30 hours of JUST trying to make cash, and in that time i have the best gear OUTSIDE of custom gear. Now banks are useful, but there slow, want to raid a village? cool you get about 1-2k and that faction will hate you and hunt you down DEAD. I do enjoy this but if your a achievement hunter this game will literally take you over 100 hours to finish 1 storyline, unless you cheat but then you dont get that cheevo. The presence of being able to hire top tier soldiers is nice, but you have to wait a few in game days. There is ALOT that just makes this game slow..very very slow, if you are willing to put ALOT of hours into this go ahead. It is not as fun as Warband was, not even close, and I would recommend getting a mod called "mount and gun" before this game, i got it on sale for 2$ which is definitely worth it, but i would wait for a sale to get this, it is not worth full price.\nGood luck and enjoy!\n","January 6, 2015","false","49.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Some have all the features of Fire and Sword, such as different grades of food and gun warfare. The game lakes quite a bit of polish, even compared to the original Moun and Blade. The gameplay is ruined for me by the fact that for whatever reason, I can't recruit troops from villages. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or a gameplay mechanic, but it ruins the flow of the game because it makes getting high tiered troops impossilbe. If your looking for a fun game in the Mount and Blade series, just stick with Warband or wait for the devs' sequel.","June 11, 2015","false","5.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

The cities feel empty and I find them impossible to defend. The artstyle is also a little less atmospheric than Warband, and with it's graphics as it is in this day and age, you really need atmosphere. The guns are as OP as they were in those times, but for a game like this you often just get shot off your horse by some peasant and that's it. Your battle is over. Realistic? Yes. Fun? Nope. Not time after time.\n\nI found it hard to immerse and in the end I ended up just burning out.

The enemy coding remains just as horrible, however, meaning that once you've flailed yourself into a defeat, if you manage to miraculously get away you can expect the exact same enemy party that just beat you to immediately chase you down again, just to watch you Kermit the Frog your arms around until they beat you again.

Add butter and rub lightly into flour with your fingertips. Lift mixture high above the bowl as you rub, to incorporate air into the pastry and make it lighter. Continue until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir through sugar. Lightly beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon chilled water, then drizzle over flour mixture. Start to bring the dough together by cutting the liquid into the dough with a blunt knife, then form into a smooth ball with your hands, adding a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.\n\nStep 2\n\nTo make the filling, peel and core the apples, and cut each into 8 pieces. Toss immediately with lemon juice in a large bowl, to prevent apples from discolouring. Place the butter and sugar in a large frypan over medium-low heat. When butter has melted, add apples and spices, then stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until apples have softened. Set aside to cool.\n\nStep 3\n\nRoll out the larger pastry ball on a floured workbench to a 30cm circle (about 2mm thick). Roll pastry around rolling pin, then unroll over a 22cm metal pie dish. Gently press into corners and allow excess to overhang. Place filling in base with a slotted spoon. Roll the small pastry piece to a 25cm circle. Beat remaining egg with milk, brushing some on rim of the base. Top with small pastry.\n\nStep 4\n\nLift the pie dish and cut excess pastry from edges with a sharp knife. Crimp edges of pastry together with your fingers. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180°C, place pie dish on a baking tray. Brush top of pie with more beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara or caster sugar. Cut four small air vents in the centre of the pie and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.","July 23, 2015","true","172.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I pre-ordered it with high hopes from  the creators of Mount & Blade/Warband but unless you did heavy research, you'll learn the hard way Fire and Sword is basically a older version of Mount & Blade that was geared towards the European audience just repackaged and released upon the masses at retail price. ($30)\n\nWhen compared to it's "older" predeccesors it falls flat on it's face in every single way possible. The addition of firearms isn't nearly enough to make up for the short-comings. You could easily just get a mod for Warband to just add firearms. The character models look like they took the original Mount & Blade's models and just wiped their ♥♥♥ with it. The dev team has not done nearly enough to breathe life into this because in my opinion nearly EVERY faction is the ♥♥♥♥ing same. The only way I can diffrenciate them is "mongols, other guys with horses, Swedish, everyone else" the 'unique' units are a joke. The AI is lacking. Marriage? Gone. Companions are generic as hell, certainly no Nizar. I had to FORCE myself to play this game in order to validate my mistake of paying for this game. While they were trying to make it historical, Eastern Europe was not the greatest place to do it so I give them credit for working with what they had. There are not many mods for this game either because what's the point? the Trade missions are a DRAG, villiager missions can go to hell, in fact I can say every mission with MAYBE the main questlines are BORING and REPITITVE and POINTLESS. There is nothing redeeming about this game.\n\nRATING:\n3/10 (a BAD game)\nThe only mistake the devs made was releasing this AFTER Mount & Blade/Warband. This should've been the first game in the series. The M&B games after this would've been hailed as the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing improvement ever. If they were on such a money-grubbing mission they could've at least improved the graphics, AI, EVERYTHING before releasing it. Not even can be called a reskin of Warband because its INFERIOR to Warband.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/48720/","TakedaYabu","大名 Tanegashima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/","187 products in account","Mount & Blade: Fire and Sword is the third game from the game series of Mount & Blade. A sandbox game that takes players to control a character in an open world map with multiple  major and minor factions.\n\nThose who have played the previous/other games from the same series will know exactly what I am talking. If not, take a look at my Review related to M&B: Warband for a complete knowledge of what the series and its games are about: http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/\n\nSo, I’ll begin my review by writing about the bad aspects of the game which are many...\nNo character background story:\n\nThat lack of such feature before your adventure can even begin, gives you the feeling that you will be playing with a completely random character. Unlike of what happens to all the other previous games in the series, Fire and Sword does not have a custom character background history.\n\nSame engine and mechanics as in the previous game, Warband:\n\nThere is absolutely nothing new in Fire and sword that wasn’t been already seen and experienced in M&B: Warband. From the graphics and textures, what changes are that only muskets and matchlock pistols were added as a main weapon in the field of battle.\n\nIn few words, this game feels like an average community made mod/expansion, and not an actual game produced from a company who managed just before, to release the best game from its series that defined the whole concept of what a true sandbox game should be.\n\nEven more bugs and errors:\n\nDespite Warband having some issues with some insignificant bugs and errors that could be easily fixed most of the times, in Fire and Sword, not just it has the same bugs and errors but also other more bugs when you wish to do an action, but also in the quests themselves that can ruin your entire gameplay if you are unlucky enough not to create a save file before you accept that quest.\n\nBoring and repetitive:\n\nEven when both games follow the same concept of sandbox with a very similar if not the same gameplay style, the way the campaign map is designed being only made of grassland and more grassland instead of the 4 elements seen in Warband, such as the Desert, Snow, Grassland and Montains.\n\nUnbalanced game:\n\nDespite being interesting at the beginning, once you have invested some time in the game and in your campaign progress, you will realize that the game ends up by making you looting villages, sell items, hire troops and fight.\n\nThe players routine in the game to achieve success and power is a never ending repetitive loop.\n\nNow to the good aspects\nMusic:\n\nThe music in this game is wonderful I must admit, to hear the piano and the violin while you shoot and slain people is very pleasing and mixes perfectly with the time period where the game is based on.\n\nThe age of gunpowder:\n\nThe addition of firearms and armies based on it in a Mount & Blade game is unique and indeed a surprise to players who enjoy shooting and slashing down opponents!\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game a 20 out of 100 or a 1,0 out of 5,0 stars. The same exact graphics and game mechanics as in Warband in a game that could easily contain success, but failed miserably... a huge disappointment.","May 27, 2015","false","730.5"," 38 of 80 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","38","80","4","3"

If the latter, then it would explain so much.\n\nThis game has lots of good improvements and additions, yet it just falls so very short. With a game more focused on caravans, less chances for actual combat (In Warband, you could hunt down brigands and such in the early parts. Here, you don't really get so many to hunt down), and a strange voice focus on always saying "With Fire & Sword!".\n\nThis doesn't feel like Warband. It just feels so off and strangely..boring. You have less fighting, and more running around to find who sells salt or the frustrating quest of what Bishop wrote what on what cannons to use as some passcode. The nations/powers don't have the same 'personality' and feel as Swadia & Company.\n\nHonestly? Don't buy this. If you want guns THAT badly, find a mod. Any mod that puts them in. But this mod is not worth 10 bucks. Get it under 2-3 dollars if you really *MUST* have it, but Warband is much more fun than this.","January 1, 2015","false","6.6"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","11","25","3","0"

But overall, I consider it to be awful. I played only 3 hours, because of the early game. And here's the main reason: It's hard. You can put difficulty on easy and lower all options until you get "14% difficulty", but you're still going to be killed by villagers. The issue? You aren't fighting farmers, you're fighting the same soldiers you'd recruit. So, yes: 50+ units of the same level of the early game units. You might reply saying that you won't pillage villages soon. Well, wrong. The questline forces you to raid not one but three villages, a task that apparently may only be done with 15 mercs (and I repeat, easy difficulty with 14% difficulty in the options). Of which atleast 10 will die because there are musket militia, and your "riflemen" mercs have bows.

I was able to buy this on sale for like 1.99 or something.\n\nI regret the time I spent installing it. It's a partially reskinned Mount&Blade Warband with guns, but somehow it manages to lack the appeal of its predecessor. I didn't play long enough to really pick up on the nuances of why, but I didn't care to. Uninstalled it as soon as I finished my first session.\n\nProbably will reinstall Mount&Blade warband though!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poeticpariah/recommended/48720/","poeticpariah","Prune Juice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poeticpariah/","50 products in account","At first... I was like "Oh, sweet, a Mount & Blade set during the Deluge!  This sounds really interesting!"  It sounds interesting.  Sounds.\n\nI enjoyed Mount & Blade a lot, and I was expecting it to work as sort of an expansion pack similar to most mods or the Napoleonic Wars add on.  However, it turned out to be a stand alone game.\n\nWhatever, I can dig it.  I'll just start a new single player campaign.\n\nIt promptly asks you what difficulty and gender, and immediately after... skips the background and goes directly to the stats screen.  It was unusual, but I figured maybe it was after this part.  I enjoyed having a background for each character, afterall.  Added to the immersion, afterall.\n\nWhat a backstory for your character?  You won't get one here.\n\nAlright, that's fine, I can still hang in.  Now, where do I spawn first?  I think Sweden would be fun.\n\nNope, can't do that either.  You begin with a tutorial.  A tutorial.  It leads to your first quest which is fight a gang of bandits and hlp three guys you don't know out of a sticky situation.  Or something, not really sure.  I stopped caring when I realize they just drop you into the action with little motive or reasoning.\n\nWell, that was a rough start...  Still, its set during the deluge.  I wonder what weapons you can get.\n\nI turn cheatmenu on to see the item list... and it was removed.\n\nWELL, that sucked!  Whats the purpose of removing a cheat option?  To balance a game that's already been cheated?\n\nWhatever, I'm sick of campaign already.  Time to check out the custom battle!\n\nI set up a siege between Sweden and Poland, I'm fighting for the Swedes as a nameless Scottish Halberdier.  Whatever, I get to hit someone with a halberd and I like it.  ^^\n\nThe battle starts off like most Mount and Blade battles, so no real difference there.  The moment I die, the battle ends...  Which is strange.  Yes, I know Mount and Blade tends to end battles when you die, but with all the mods that continue the battles... you'd think they'd take a cue from the community.  I mean, Napoleonic Wars began as a mod.  And now its like $10 on steam.\n\nWhatever, I'll just host a mulitplayer match and turn a password on so the battle continues.  Siege again... and I forget the AI is stupid in Multiplayer.  Something they won't ever fix...  Not like they can just take the NPCs from the Singleplayer game and use them instead of the bots, but whatever.  I'll just take a moment to check out the armor and weapons we can get for each faction and each unit.\n\nThe stuff you get are just as bad, apparently.  "Its realistic, though!"  Realism would mean they didn't call Russian Musketeers 'Riflemen'.\n\nWhatever...  If you want some deluge action in Mount and Blade Warband, save yourself the money and find a mod on the forums.  I'm sure there is something that is just as good, if not better.  Overall, I don't think this game would be a good buy for your library.","July 11, 2014","false","14.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

When I saw gunpowder added to the mix in With Fire and Sword I thought it'd be great which the single player is fun and more in depth than Warband. The multiplayer has been ruined with cd key problems and people standing on top of (or glitching on top of) buildings shooting until theyre out of ammo. To me the great melee combat has been ruined by this mod of Mount and Blade, it has turned into a very poor medieval FPS!","December 26, 2013","false","104.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

But when i played this game it almost ruined the everything i loved about this series. I started watching a person call Reformist (go check him out he is great he got me into warband) so i bought warband. BAM!!! I went from playing steam only when my brother was on our ps3 to trying to get on every second possible yeah its that good\nmy machine can not run anything but it runs warband like a dream. Then this game went on sale and i was chearing a lot.\ni wanted this game soo bad so i bought it. when i first started it up... it crashed. When i finally got it to work i was really exited i played for a few minutes and then just did not like it. So if you wanna get a game save your money and get warband (it is 10 dollars more but it has like a billion mods.) So if you are going to buy a game buy warband.","January 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Firearm-based warfare simply does not fit into Mount and Blade's combat system, and the result is silly, disjointed battles rife with anachronistically-accurate gunshots. In the period during which this game takes place, one would be lucky to hit a barn at 100 meters with a musket. As such, massed volleys were the order of the day. Not so in this title. Want to hit an enemy from 50 meters with a pistol while riding at full speed on your horse? No problem. And don't be surprised if you get sniped from halfway aross the map under the same circumstance. And it's not just the battles that are bad: the campaign takes a giant step backwards from Warband also, lacking numerous gameplay aspects native to that superior title. Campaign gameplay in With Fire and Sword mainly boils down to running away from bandits and endlessly playing errand boy to local lords, and is both needlessly difficult and extremely tedious.\n\nThough this game is sold at a bargain-bin price, it is truly not worth any amount of your money or time.

The rifles are very strong so you can often get suprised killed by anyone. Useing a rifle yourself is even worse since the bullet can fly anywere. So shooting becomes more of luck then a skill. With the high relode time just makes it worse. If you want to fight with rifles in a mount and blade game i recomend the napolic dlc for warband.

The most obvious changes are the replacement of crossbows with firearms, a new map and the 16th/17th century setting.  This is the time that warfare gradually changed from melee based to firearm based.\n(A side note: the setting actually mixes  aspects of the 16 century setting with that of the  17th century. The halbediers belong more to the former century and the musketeers/cavalry more to the latter.)\nThere some  other changes. There seem to be more quests and the recruitment system has been overhauled. However, at the core the game is the same and as such has the same problems as the old game, such as a rudimentary battlefield mechanism, a nonexistent storyline,  a simplistic dialogue tree, superficial boring personalities and  tedious repetitive battles of which there are way too many. And these problems are  now compounded by the introduction of firearms.\nWith muskets you can kill an adversary from the other side of the map and what is more.. he can do the same.  In fact the ai is actually better at shooting because it isn't bothered by the fact that from a distance avatars are so small that you can't make them out right.\nMy first half hour was spend being shot to pieces. The only way to escape that fate is by  moving in an unpredictable pattern so the enemy can't take aim properly. In the meantime you either have to try and kill them with your own firearm(while moving about in a random way!) or with your  sidearm. Battles turn therefore into tedious hit and run activities in which standing still is an invite to be killed on the spot.\nThe milita that you can recruit at the start is woefully inept to deal with anything better than looters and once you have enough of them to actually have a chance to win a fight, your army is so slow that you can't catch deserters, brigands and such because they are faster than you. So you either have to fight enemies who are superior to your inept troops.. or hope to corner a band of ruffians,which involves you in chasing them across the map hoping you won't loose sight of them when the night sets in or when they run into a wooded area.\nIn fact the best thing to do is not to recruit any militia or infantry but to go from town to town to find and  hire mercenary cavalry or  heroes so you can overtake your enemies or have a chance to runaway from them when they are too strong.\nIn any event the game seems to promise to become a protracted boring game, like the basic game was, but now you can use firearms and play on a map that represents eastern europe.\nThe game is neither a good role play game nor a good wargame, because it doesn't implement either aspect well and  it amazes me  that people actually consider this game to be good.\nBut I guess tastes differ..","October 29, 2014","false","4.2"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","16","39","0","7"

It's not that. It sucks ♥♥♥.\n\n1. The guns are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n2. The map has to have been downsized by about 3 times.\n\n3. No more hiring from villages, you go to merc camps. Yay?\n\n4. Raiding cities is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. All of your men die almost instantly. (Even elite units)\n\n5. The "new" armor and weapons are poorly textured and none of them look cool.\n\n6. Most of the gun models look like rectangles with ♥♥♥♥ drawn on them.\n\n7.I loved the combat in Mount and Blade warband, but here it is boring.\n\n8. The AI of your troops is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I order my men to hold the position and they either charge or fumble around. And when they do either of those, the enemies are already here, and we're all dead.\n\n9.You will not make a big army. Big armies are a ♥♥♥♥ing dream in this game. I went to all the merc camps and cities and only had around 70 men.\n\n10.The gun's fire sound effect sucks ♥♥♥. I liked the one in napoleonic wars better.\n\n11. The maps are bland and boring.\n\n12. What the ♥♥♥♥ is a wagon fort?\n\n13. Enemies can hit you from a mile away, but you can barely even see them.\n\n14. There's like 20 weapons in this entire game.\n\n15. Most of the marketplaces are empty. There's about 5-6 items in each one.\n\n16. Almost all of the bandits are on horseback, making it boring to fight them with marksmen.\n\n17. You will not have epic shooting battles. You will have the battles where all of your men die and you have to shoot the enemy.\n\n18. There is no real improvement.\n\n19. You will not get a boner from the music. The music is not cool.\n\n20. The UI sucks my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ juices. It's all white and makes me feel like I'm going blind.\n\n21. The factions are boring and you don't really care for them. Sweden? Oh boy, I love that faction! no.\n\n22. There are about 3 types of boots in the entire game.\n\n23. None of the weapons or armor from the old game are in this game. Therefore, this game is a giant pile of monkey ♥♥♥♥.\n\nPros\n\n1. Guns are cool.\n\n2. Grenades are cool\n\nJust kidding both of these suck ♥♥♥♥ in this game.","August 20, 2014","false","4.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

Your character upgrades itself as you gain experience. Buy, collect or sell weapons, armour, firearms (Pistols, Muskets, Grenades), different kind of horses, sell prisoners as slaves, recruit troops, etc. The mechanics of fighting is the best part of the game. There are even seiges you can take part in to storm a castle.\n\nFire and Sword is based more heavily on trading than the original version and here are many more castles, and a bigger map. You can even send caravans to trade and in this version, this provides substantial money. Castles and towns can also be developed quite a bit after you own them. You can even order hand-crafted weapons at a steep price and which are slightly better than what you find on the market.\n\nGreat game!","January 30, 2015","true","212.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more or less an RPG set during the Deluge in Eastern Europe in the 1600s. Join an army, or rebel against the powers including Poland, Sweden & Russia.\n\nMy favourite part of the game is slowly developing your character in a way that is similar to that of The Elder Scrolls games (skills, inventory, quests, etc,.) and travelling across the map to hire soldiers and unique mecernaries for your army.\n\nI had one problem with the game and that was completing the main quest which proved impossible as I didn't follow the instructions properly, didn't complete the required tasks in a specific amount of time or committed actions earlier which halted the development of the story. I could not complete the game from this point and had to start again, it's wise to save your game before undertaking big quests.\n\nDespite the story problem, I love this game and I had alot of fun playing it!\n\n8.5/10","January 30, 2015","true","143.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are virutally no bandits, due to so many nation patrols, finding bandits for quests can be a hassle, finding people in general is a hassle.\n\nThe map is huge, which is good and bad. I love that every castle has a market and stuff, shows that the world is growing and on the rise. Fort sieges are tough. I like that, but if the enemy has only people with guns, you can expect to lose a lot before ever reaching the walls. Guns are powerful in this and surprisingly accurate. The mercenary customization is neat, no complaints there. Making your own faction, which we've all done in Warband, don't lie, is a lot harder, seeing as there are often more men in forts now, and then people will come after you, or, on the good side, try to recruit you. Its a fun game, no real complaints other than you can't really free lance, and the quests didn't really catch my attention. Its a good game, but not my game. 8/10 despite my feelings.

A cast of semi interesting characters join you on your ride through fake history as you lay waste to the country-side.\n\nThe customizable troops you can get is a nice touch, and if you get enough cash (eventually you will via plunder or trade) you can effectively travel with an army of epic geared troops, slaughtering everything in your (or your lords) name.\n\nStory?  Bah who needs one in this style of game?  Your story is the story, basically making it so you yourself get to design your own story by destroying army after army.  Or die trying.  And stuff.\n\nOpen world games are easy to get lost in, and while the graphics are dated (but being able to display 200+ troops in a FPS styled RTS is impressive in it's own right) there are worse things in life.\n\nI strongly recommend this game for people who wish that M&B had muskets instead of crossbows, as while the story isn't a big leap, the combat definitely feels fresh.  Skyrim this may not be, but in Skyrim you can't honestly lead 200+ troops around attacking people/villages at random or capture yourself a few castles without some serious modding.\n\nAlso look into the mods/DLC for this game if you like multiplayer, the community is pretty cool.","April 28, 2015","true","52.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started playing it only because Warband stopped working for me, but I'm glad I did. There is an improvement in graphics, and some of the combat mechanics such as blocking and mounted combat have also improved. The overall gameplay however, isn't as good as Warbands. Adding guns made it more fun in multiplayer, but it also increased difficulty in singleplayer, because you can easily be killed with one shot. You can't recruit people from villages anymore, you have to buy them from mercenary camps, which annoyed me, and having to pay extra to get decent equipment for your men is also a hassle.

Even if your army is 60 strong, the important quests don't care and will only give you a handful of your men (4-6), or even none at all again 20 or so men!\n\nThat's the most frustrating part, that your powerful army is of no use while performing some of the most important quests.\n\nSecondly, the introduction of muskets destroys any illusion of balance.\n\nThey're highly innacurate, yes, but it takes just one bullet to take anyone out of the fight.

It takes away every feature that made Warband accessible and enjoyable.  Tournaments, Productive Enterprises, Plunder and razing of villages, new faction creation from captured castles, recruiting from villages (replaced with a Mercenary Camp at every faction), and the ability to have a marriage. I played this enough to realize this is a downgrade not an upgrade. The map in singlepalyer is dull, mountainless, and has the same skirmish map for nearly every encounter. Guns in their current state are realistic in the fact that they destroy your health bar. This can be a very heavy imbalance when you cannot gain money to buy armor, buy recruits, and equipment. My friends and I could not have fathomed how disappointed we would be when we actually played the game. If you want a warband that has muskets and a historical setting, try Old Frontier 1755.

Graphically it is superior to all mods out there and there are some new features that are nice. The outfitting of mercenaries was a little awkward, so if that's a key point for you, you might look past this one.

A main story line. playable. brings weapons from the very first firearms and grenades into the game. CAn be modded.\n\nCons - Hard at the start. keep getting attacked by a deserter that you have paided to have passage. Guns can be one shot one kill. Hard to advance through the game. Hard to keep an army alive. bugs/gliches to where you have to restart the game. sometimes loss of save data. Items are too expensive.\n\nPersonal Review - Could be a whole lot better. Was expecting more of a game with the Mount&Blade Title. Then again, wasnt made by TaleWorlds I suppose. Fair start into a game already with a main quest and other things. But you are forced to play through the tutorial EVERY TIME you make a new character. This game is not as good as I was expecting, I play it from time to time, but its nothing like Warband, and never will be. Armour is too expensive to get, and Deserters are too over powered are the beginning of the game.\n\nI recommend this game if you are looking for a game with some difficulty, even though you can set it to easy, it will still be hard.","December 21, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firearms add a new depth to battle situations, and allow for more strategy when controlling your units. Seige mechanics have been greatly improved (mostly in the fact that not everyone is trying to cram themselves onto ONE ladder to seige the castle), including more diverse town and fortress layouts. Multiplayer is improved again with better seige battles, and the popular survival-squad type game mode.\n\nCons: Does take a while to get going and have a decent sized army.

Unable to buy stores and businesses in this version, and weapon diversity is down from the last game.\n\nOverall, excellent niche game for those who have played games such as Total War or Age of Empires, and have wanted to experience personal action on the battlefield, or if you like Chivalry, try your hand at commanding your forces.","May 20, 2014","true","61.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flat, plain and simple. It's not great (aka the other two titles), it's good. Now let me explain. First of all, this game actually has  more realism than Warband did. Want me to explain? Well, back within this time period, a shot anywhere generally meant you were dead. The infection would kill you, or the musket ball, the size of a small double-sized grape, would penetrate your body and break bones, ligaments, or even veins and arteries. In other words, musket balls could kill in one shot. In fact, it is possible to die by getting shot in the foot, or even in the leg without medical treatment. The musket ball itself would cause so much damage to the veins and arteries that the person would bleed out very easily. So I do give the game realism points when it comes to the guns. The bows, I believe, are slightly underpowered, but that could be based on my own limited knowledge of the game. The AI isn't as good as Warband, no where close. I had about 40 enemy units running into a wall trying to climb up stairs that they seemed to think didn't exist. If you want more of Warband (aka "sword swinging simulator"), then don't get this game. However, if you do want large line battles with troops moving into 5 lines or so and waiting for your command to fire, then you will enjoy this game.","January 1, 2015","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my "Favorite" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!\n\nI haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.\n\nIn this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).\n\nDuring sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.\n\nOverall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.","March 8, 2015","true","125.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly the game slowly decays as the quests are less and less intresting and just plain boring. Campaigns are rare. Most quests you get are just to send a blank message from one lord to another. You will also notice times when the AI pretty much cheats the game and a group of enemys fire the muskets at you and regardless of how fast or which direction you go, They will instantly hit you. Above all, There are almost no combat missions, That once important "Ransom a girl from bandits" Quest is all there is to fight in mostly as you will notice that there is almost no bandits. Losing all your gear is pretty much always a bad thing. Mostly when you lose all your rare and favorite items. But instead of fixing that, They make it so that you lose all your good gear regardless of how hard it is to get.\n\nThis game clearly only gets a 5/10. An average game. Not because of it's graphics or it's general setting. It is because of the bugs, Lack of content and other stuff. I really, Really want to give it a higher rate but I can not.","March 25, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even in the 960 series of Nvidia :(\n2. Soon after playing for a few hours, 40 vs 40 man battles will now lag\n3. This bug has been going on sincdd the creation of the game\n4. Unable to go full screen because of the missing cursor\n5. Super Bad Rifle aiming and reload speed is way too long\n6. Exp grinding takes too long.\nBut, What i love about the game?\nComparing to Mount & blade\n1. New tactics to attack/ take over castles. (Poison water, Bombings of wall ...)\n2. Easier time to recruit troops at mercernary camps.\n3. Able to earn Thales much more easily with merchant guild\nP.S Not sure about graphics of the game when im playing 84% performance.\n\n6/1o.\n","March 27, 2015","false","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this off of a combo pack that got me M&B, M&B: Warband, and this. M&B: Warband is the best out of the three with M&B right behind it. This game is in last out of those three. So... If you plan on getting any Mount and Blade games, get Warband. Or the combo pack when they have a sale.","July 26, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love these games. The freedom to do so much, attack anyone, raid/pillage villages, rule over kingdoms is exciting. It does have A LOT of grinding, especially early on. I have found that taking a break from quests, I'll do some trading runs for a couple hours, then jump back into the questing.\n\nThe battles are amazing. Going into battle and leading 100+ troops is exciting and very nervewracking at the same time. I definitely recommend these games if you're into simple free-form RPGs and have a desire to rule over kingdoms (or destroy them!)","September 2, 2014","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
