"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/259340/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Chicken Shoot Gold consist of two games, Chicken Shoot and Chicken Shoot 2. They are similar to each other, could say that CS2 is more of mission pack. Anyway, they came out around in 2003, developed by some Toontraxx and published by TopWare. They come from the era of shareware games, mind it, and seem to ride on Moorhuhn/CrazyChicken success, both being shooting gallery where you just shoot at many chickens.\nActually, as I found out from a friend, original name of this polish series was "Kurka Wodna". And what you see as Chicken Shoot Gold is combination of the second and the third game. The first game isn't all that known, but you can YouTube gameplay out. It's quite primitive.\nIt also for whatever reason was ported to GBA, DS and Wii (in 2007!). Which is way past the intented audience of bored office workers. Reviewers weren't afraid to dumb the game on those platforms. PC version seems to be the best anyway.\n\nTechnically it's as-is. For 2003 game. Which means low-resolution in forced full-screen which will go "we smoke everyday" if you alt-tab. No Steam Overlay. Nope, no widescreen. You can only increase resolution up to 800x600, but it will just increase in-game space. Meaning that you will see more. Which affects gameplay, making it harder, as eggs thrown at you will hit you only if they will be on screen.\nAlso, it doesn't usually remember CD-Key and scores, so check Steam guides to find out how to fix that.\n\nAlso, nope, Internet multiplayer doesn't work. It can't "connect to host". Local seem to function up to server browser, but you know, I don't have friend nearby with computer with local net to connect by to check this out. Not 2000 anymore.\n\nAnd so it begins, you got two games, with 5 usual levels in the first CS and 6 exotic levels in the second. Then you choose one of the two modes to play. Classic is score based, you worry less about being hit by egg and more about not accidently hitting other non-chicken living beings. With weird exclusions to both rules. Like owl-looking ones, who are too gross, I guess. Just try to get enough score in time to go to the next level. And arcade mode, where you got usual lifebar and have to avoid eggs by either shooting them down or scrolling away.\n\nAfter which you are shown intro where a farmer of sorts will wake up and starts shooting chickens who were eating spilled seeds of sorts, instead of trying to lock them back. After which chickens will suddenly learn how to fly away. And then you will murder all the chickens by getting even more disturbed, whether young or old. Which gets a bit wicked when you find out that some don't just fall over, but turn into angels.\n\nAnd well, really, it is what it is. Shareware-age moorhuhn-clone "me too". Albeit it has more content that Moohruhn in levels. And you can get more weapons to use and such. Final boss. This stuff isn't easy. Both games also have secret levels that I couldn't find how to get to.\n\nBut really, it ain't Virtua Cop. Or House of the Dead on Steam. It doesn't have much going on outside of shooting gallery. Just some chickens, some throw eggs, and interactive level objects you can shoot mostly for score. In all honesty, I wasn't sure whether to recommend it or not. It didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off, so I guess it's good if you know what you are getting.\nNowdays no one is going to play them past hour anyway. And owch my fingers on right hand.","November 1, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Trust me, it has been proven numerous types, your little brother/sister or your young child can sit in front of it for hours on end while you will be free to do anything. Especially if you show them there are more levels so they can play with a goal to progress.\n\nLong version:\nChicken Shoot Gold and Chicken Shoot 2 are actually cash-in games that rode the success of Moorhuhn (Crazy Chicken), a franchise that lasted 10 years and 30 games. Apparently Germans really like to shoot chickens around the turn of the millennium; during that time you could find dozens of these themed (usually cartoonish) shoot ‘em ups on the internet and on gaming magazine CDs.\n\nChicken Shoot’s primary selling point is the hand-drawn graphics, and I have to admit, they look good even in 2014 on a full HD monitor. While the game itself is simple as a stick (you get a gun, you shoot chicken, you reload, then shoot more chicken), the small details can really add a few layers to it here and there.\nFor example all levels (there are five of them in the first one, six in the second, plus an end boss screen in both) feature hidden bonuses you can shoot for additional points: shooting a mine cart into an abandoned mine, blowing off the top hat of a snowman and so on; this also emulates Moorhuhn’s crazy level secrets. And these are just a few of the Easter eggs you can find in the game– apart from those the chicken throw in your face of course.\n\nYes: the games have several levels. Most people who try the games out will never notice that, because you either need to kill all chicken (Arcade) or get to 2500/3500 points/level (Classic) to advance to the next stage.\nAnd yes, there is actually an end boss in both games, and in the second one beating the Chicken King can be a really difficult task. So… good luck if you try it.","August 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Shoot all the chickens to score points. You can also shoot objects (dynamite, bombs..) and other animals (birds, whales , sharks) some give you more points than others but you can also get score reductions for shooting the wrong animals (although I did not figure out how this works because you get points reducted for killing crows but not for whales....). You can also pick up several powerups and different weapons to help you in your mission.\n\nThe game pretty much looks and feels like a free browser game. You use your mouse to aim/reload and graphically the game looks OK (for a 2003 game).\n\nOverall it's fun for a few minutes but nowadays these kind of games should be free on a browser game site. For that reason I can not recommend this game, especially for the price of 7 bucks.","February 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

They turned into chickens. And they were aggresive. They attacked. Millions of chickens attacked, and the small milita of people had to defend themselfs. War broke out again.

This game is a must buy, it brings together the full package which the original just cant. The orignal barely lives up to the sequels glory.\n\nStory: The game throws you into an apocolyptic scene from the get go, which makes for a very engaging start (+1). The universe is set in 1934 Nazi germany... BUT WITH A TWIST!!! Instead of Nazi german humans the villans are actually portrayed as chickens, which, i believe, gives the game a deeper poetic meaning (+1). Perhaps the Nazi's have been portrayed is this manner to hint to the fact that not only were the nazi's villans they were cowards too, but its all open to interpritation (+1).\n\nThe protagnist of the game is a nameless man, you may be wondering ''Why isnt the protaganist a chicken too?? And Why am i reading this review??!'' Two very good questions. To answer the first one i would say that the devolpers of the game have tried to use the nameless man to represent the allied forces as a whole (+1). Now i know this game may seem slightly xenophobic, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 as a propaganda method for the allied forces to brainwash the minds of the succeptable younger generations (-1).\n\nAfter a few levels into the game we meet one of the co-protaganists of the game 'Jesus Christ'. The introduction of the son of god unlocks some new interesting features to the game (+1), but we will get to that later. The game then goes onto an amazing twist, i wont spoil much, but the story turns into a battle against time as you and 'Jesus Christ' go on a perilous quest back in time to stop Hitler from coming into power (+1). Ill leave the rest of the story for you guys to find out.\n\nSTORY POINTS = 5   Next up is the Graphics.\n\nGraphics: Not much to say here. Sure the visuals may not be as amazing to games such as call of duty and Kick ♥♥♥ 2, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 which makes it quite revolutionary in my opinion. (+5).\n\nGRAPHIC POINTS = 5   Lastly up next is gameplay.\n\nGameplay: The way the game plays is simple yet genius, alot like minecraft its a 3rd person side scrolling adventure. The game then sugar coats this with the addition of magic, you may remember me mentioning 'Jesus Christ' earlier in the review. Well after a few quests you earn his trust, and in return you revieve the holy bible. This alows you to cast spells which really spices up the game and kept it fresh for me. And personally this game comes under both of my faviourte game genres (FPS and RPG) and i would recomend anyone else who enjoy games under the same catergory to pick this up immediantly. (ONE BIG +1)\n\nGAMEPLAY POINTS= 1\n\nOverall id give this game an 11/10 Phenominal","August 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","59","17","29","12","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/259340/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Chicken Shoot Gold consist of two games, Chicken Shoot and Chicken Shoot 2. They are similar to each other, could say that CS2 is more of mission pack. Anyway, they came out around in 2003, developed by some Toontraxx and published by TopWare. They come from the era of shareware games, mind it, and seem to ride on Moorhuhn/CrazyChicken success, both being shooting gallery where you just shoot at many chickens.\nActually, as I found out from a friend, original name of this polish series was "Kurka Wodna". And what you see as Chicken Shoot Gold is combination of the second and the third game. The first game isn't all that known, but you can YouTube gameplay out. It's quite primitive.\nIt also for whatever reason was ported to GBA, DS and Wii (in 2007!). Which is way past the intented audience of bored office workers. Reviewers weren't afraid to dumb the game on those platforms. PC version seems to be the best anyway.\n\nTechnically it's as-is. For 2003 game. Which means low-resolution in forced full-screen which will go "we smoke everyday" if you alt-tab. No Steam Overlay. Nope, no widescreen. You can only increase resolution up to 800x600, but it will just increase in-game space. Meaning that you will see more. Which affects gameplay, making it harder, as eggs thrown at you will hit you only if they will be on screen.\nAlso, it doesn't usually remember CD-Key and scores, so check Steam guides to find out how to fix that.\n\nAlso, nope, Internet multiplayer doesn't work. It can't "connect to host". Local seem to function up to server browser, but you know, I don't have friend nearby with computer with local net to connect by to check this out. Not 2000 anymore.\n\nAnd so it begins, you got two games, with 5 usual levels in the first CS and 6 exotic levels in the second. Then you choose one of the two modes to play. Classic is score based, you worry less about being hit by egg and more about not accidently hitting other non-chicken living beings. With weird exclusions to both rules. Like owl-looking ones, who are too gross, I guess. Just try to get enough score in time to go to the next level. And arcade mode, where you got usual lifebar and have to avoid eggs by either shooting them down or scrolling away.\n\nAfter which you are shown intro where a farmer of sorts will wake up and starts shooting chickens who were eating spilled seeds of sorts, instead of trying to lock them back. After which chickens will suddenly learn how to fly away. And then you will murder all the chickens by getting even more disturbed, whether young or old. Which gets a bit wicked when you find out that some don't just fall over, but turn into angels.\n\nAnd well, really, it is what it is. Shareware-age moorhuhn-clone "me too". Albeit it has more content that Moohruhn in levels. And you can get more weapons to use and such. Final boss. This stuff isn't easy. Both games also have secret levels that I couldn't find how to get to.\n\nBut really, it ain't Virtua Cop. Or House of the Dead on Steam. It doesn't have much going on outside of shooting gallery. Just some chickens, some throw eggs, and interactive level objects you can shoot mostly for score. In all honesty, I wasn't sure whether to recommend it or not. It didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off, so I guess it's good if you know what you are getting.\nNowdays no one is going to play them past hour anyway. And owch my fingers on right hand.","November 1, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Trust me, it has been proven numerous types, your little brother/sister or your young child can sit in front of it for hours on end while you will be free to do anything. Especially if you show them there are more levels so they can play with a goal to progress.\n\nLong version:\nChicken Shoot Gold and Chicken Shoot 2 are actually cash-in games that rode the success of Moorhuhn (Crazy Chicken), a franchise that lasted 10 years and 30 games. Apparently Germans really like to shoot chickens around the turn of the millennium; during that time you could find dozens of these themed (usually cartoonish) shoot ‘em ups on the internet and on gaming magazine CDs.\n\nChicken Shoot’s primary selling point is the hand-drawn graphics, and I have to admit, they look good even in 2014 on a full HD monitor. While the game itself is simple as a stick (you get a gun, you shoot chicken, you reload, then shoot more chicken), the small details can really add a few layers to it here and there.\nFor example all levels (there are five of them in the first one, six in the second, plus an end boss screen in both) feature hidden bonuses you can shoot for additional points: shooting a mine cart into an abandoned mine, blowing off the top hat of a snowman and so on; this also emulates Moorhuhn’s crazy level secrets. And these are just a few of the Easter eggs you can find in the game– apart from those the chicken throw in your face of course.\n\nYes: the games have several levels. Most people who try the games out will never notice that, because you either need to kill all chicken (Arcade) or get to 2500/3500 points/level (Classic) to advance to the next stage.\nAnd yes, there is actually an end boss in both games, and in the second one beating the Chicken King can be a really difficult task. So… good luck if you try it.","August 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Shoot all the chickens to score points. You can also shoot objects (dynamite, bombs..) and other animals (birds, whales , sharks) some give you more points than others but you can also get score reductions for shooting the wrong animals (although I did not figure out how this works because you get points reducted for killing crows but not for whales....). You can also pick up several powerups and different weapons to help you in your mission.\n\nThe game pretty much looks and feels like a free browser game. You use your mouse to aim/reload and graphically the game looks OK (for a 2003 game).\n\nOverall it's fun for a few minutes but nowadays these kind of games should be free on a browser game site. For that reason I can not recommend this game, especially for the price of 7 bucks.","February 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

This game is a must buy, it brings together the full package which the original just cant. The orignal barely lives up to the sequels glory.\n\nStory: The game throws you into an apocolyptic scene from the get go, which makes for a very engaging start (+1). The universe is set in 1934 Nazi germany... BUT WITH A TWIST!!! Instead of Nazi german humans the villans are actually portrayed as chickens, which, i believe, gives the game a deeper poetic meaning (+1). Perhaps the Nazi's have been portrayed is this manner to hint to the fact that not only were the nazi's villans they were cowards too, but its all open to interpritation (+1).\n\nThe protagnist of the game is a nameless man, you may be wondering ''Why isnt the protaganist a chicken too?? And Why am i reading this review??!'' Two very good questions. To answer the first one i would say that the devolpers of the game have tried to use the nameless man to represent the allied forces as a whole (+1). Now i know this game may seem slightly xenophobic, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 as a propaganda method for the allied forces to brainwash the minds of the succeptable younger generations (-1).\n\nAfter a few levels into the game we meet one of the co-protaganists of the game 'Jesus Christ'. The introduction of the son of god unlocks some new interesting features to the game (+1), but we will get to that later. The game then goes onto an amazing twist, i wont spoil much, but the story turns into a battle against time as you and 'Jesus Christ' go on a perilous quest back in time to stop Hitler from coming into power (+1). Ill leave the rest of the story for you guys to find out.\n\nSTORY POINTS = 5   Next up is the Graphics.\n\nGraphics: Not much to say here. Sure the visuals may not be as amazing to games such as call of duty and Kick ♥♥♥ 2, but you must keep in mind that this game was released in 1936 which makes it quite revolutionary in my opinion. (+5).\n\nGRAPHIC POINTS = 5   Lastly up next is gameplay.\n\nGameplay: The way the game plays is simple yet genius, alot like minecraft its a 3rd person side scrolling adventure. The game then sugar coats this with the addition of magic, you may remember me mentioning 'Jesus Christ' earlier in the review. Well after a few quests you earn his trust, and in return you revieve the holy bible. This alows you to cast spells which really spices up the game and kept it fresh for me. And personally this game comes under both of my faviourte game genres (FPS and RPG) and i would recomend anyone else who enjoy games under the same catergory to pick this up immediantly. (ONE BIG +1)\n\nGAMEPLAY POINTS= 1\n\nOverall id give this game an 11/10 Phenominal","August 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","59","17","29","12","1"

In this game you play as a farmer whos farm gets invaded by chickens so you have to destroy all of them. So hows the game ? Its one of the worst games on steam period. Lets go over the reasons. The game is marketed as a an arcade shooter so that means it depends alot on the score you get. While the scoring system doesnt work at all its just one of the problems that the game is riddled with. The game has an abysmal hit detection that doesnt work at all. You hit the eniemies when you dont want to do that. The game has two settings Arcade and Classic. Arcade is just you trying to rack up a high score while in the classic mode you have lives. The game does have a beutifully drawn eviroment and some smile worthy animations but apart from that its not nothing special. Besides the first chicken shoot game you also get the sequel which is a review for another day. Overall this game is a very stale and a boring shooter with broken shooting mechanics and horrible hit detection. If you are curious about the game wait for a discount since getting it for full price is a rip off. I give Chicken Shoot a 3/10","April 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

No animals are harmed in that series of games.","August 9, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

A game that was made in the early 20th century. I believe it was 1999, I'm not sure, but this game brung back a lot of nostalgia. They both have the same concept, yet Crazy Chicken was more addicting and competitive.\n6/10","July 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

In this game you play as a farmer whos farm gets invaded by chickens so you have to destroy all of them. So hows the game ? Its one of the worst games on steam period. Lets go over the reasons. The game is marketed as a an arcade shooter so that means it depends alot on the score you get. While the scoring system doesnt work at all its just one of the problems that the game is riddled with. The game has an abysmal hit detection that doesnt work at all. You hit the eniemies when you dont want to do that. The game has two settings Arcade and Classic. Arcade is just you trying to rack up a high score while in the classic mode you have lives. The game does have a beutifully drawn eviroment and some smile worthy animations but apart from that its not nothing special. Besides the first chicken shoot game you also get the sequel which is a review for another day. Overall this game is a very stale and a boring shooter with broken shooting mechanics and horrible hit detection. If you are curious about the game wait for a discount since getting it for full price is a rip off. I give Chicken Shoot a 3/10","April 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

Don't mind this annoying need of cdkey at begin, which can be fixed anyway. Don't mind that it doesn't have pretty much a story. It's just a simple game. Simple and fun.\n\nI remember when years ago I played it many times. Got it from some gaming magazine and it was fun. I loved to play it around Easter - it was my yearly tradition to play it when there was Easter coming up. I probably wasn't the only one who did that. It was really hard game - I mean, how can you avoid all those eggs? How do you beat the first or second level, it's impossible! After some time I forgot about this game and didn't even wanted to look around for CDs, only to install a game that I would play for short time. In 2014 I got Chicken Shoot Gold from some bundle but also I didn't feel like playing it. Now, in 2016, I wanted to relive some of memories. Nostalgia trips from time to time aren't a bad thing. I played for some time and I was surprised how easy it is. While playing it for the first time after so many years I got rather good score and beat more levels then earlier in every try. It was fun to discover something new when it wasn't really possible as kid. Chicken Shoot Gold reminded me once again what gaming should be like - it's fun to play a game which have a good story, and same goes for graphics and new ideas but sometimes you don't need all of this and something simple, like getting rid off chickens in this case, can be really enjoyable too.\n\nThere is only one thing I'm not sure about - price. While for me, I would probably buy it at full price if there wasn't a bundle with it but for new players, for somebody who never heard and never played it, it's way too big price for content it offer. If there will be some promo, and you enjoy simple AND I MEAN IT, really simple games when everything you could brag about is your highscore - grab it.","March 28","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
