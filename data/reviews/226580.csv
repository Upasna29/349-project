Really like this feature personally\n- New cars, liveries, tracks, generally looks more streamlined and visually appealing\n- Handling/braking feel better and more realistic than previous versions (to me anyway)\n- Cheaper price than previous versions at launch\n\nCons:\n- New game coming out early in 2015 so unless you're a diehard fan of F1, probably wait until then\n- Small steps and improvements from previous versions, nothing gamechanging\n- Would've been nice to see scenario mode and/or season challenge extended in some way so they're not something you just play through once and forget about\n\nIt's a solid game, my initial impressions are it's pretty good and worth buying if you like the F1 series. If you're just a casual gamer and occasionally play racing games then I'd probably wait until the next one comes out.","October 16, 2014","true","40.4"," 193 of 252 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","193","252","2","7"

The reason for the lack of new features in the game is simply that Codemasters is focusing on the New-Gen F1 2015 game completely, to make it even better than the current games. They will also use and develop a completely new engine for F1 2015, which is taking time and that's probably why they didn't change much from F1 2013 to F1 2014, yet there are minor changes which have a big influence on the Gameplay.\n\nFirst off, you will notice that the Young Drivers' Test is no longer in the game, but has been replaced by the Evaluation-Test, which is automatically adjusting the AI-Level to your personal skill-level. The Young Drivers' Test helped to understand the basics and kind of guided you through the game. Now with the new Evaluation-Test you are thrown into a lap of Monza without any explanations at all. I recommend retaking the test several times to get used to the handling etc.\nAlso, you can now pick whatever Team you want to pick in Career mode and you therefore don't have to wait for a contract offer.\n\nNow we're coming to the gameplay-changing part of F1 2014. First, there is this in my opinion annoying sound of the new V6 engines, which is awful but unfortunately realistic, so it isn't Codemasters fault. Also there are 8 gears instead of the 7 gears of the F1 2013 Season and you can't adjust the gear ratios anymore. The design of the cars is good, but unluckily the Williams Design was changed a bit, because Codemasters had licensing-issues with Martini but there are mods already which allow you to use the original design of Williams.\nThe handling has also changed in F1 2014. You can actually feel that there is less mechanical grip. In addition to that, the car also has a more unstable rear end now, causing more oversteer and this is making driving without assists even tougher than it was back in F1 2013.\n\nNow we're coming to the AI:\nThe AI (atleast on Legend) is now more aggressive than it was in 2013, which is providing a bigger challenge for Players. Also, the overtakes of the AI in corners got improved, so if they overtake on the outside, they actually stay on track rather than leave the track and lose 4 Positions like in 2013. Yet still, if they overtake on the inside, they still back off and don't even try to go for a gap.\n\nAll in all, the game has made minor improvements, but does not feature any major changes to F1 2013. For me, as a League and Multiplayer-Racer, it is crucial to get this game, as it is a very long period of time until F1 2015 will be released. I recommend buying the game if you are a F1-Fan even if you already played F1 2013, because F1 2014 features the new Season, new cars, new handling etc.","October 18, 2014","true","494.7"," 83 of 104 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","83","104","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CASH-Synister/recommended/226580/","CASH-Synister","[CASH] Synister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CASH-Synister/","234 products in account","First off, let me open by disagreeing with most people's statements of "it's just 2013 but with new engine sounds/team rosters/tracks" while yes, on the surface, it seems that way, however, when you dig a little deeper, it's oh so much more.\n\nfor this review, I'll begin with Pros/Cons, then go through each of the main focuses of negative comments about the game.\n\nPros:\n-New Turbo engine sounds are awesome (in my opinion)\n-The handling rework has made the game so much more about skill now. 2013 required a lot of skill to drive, but 2014 makes you re-learn all the tracks with added braking zones due to the new car physics.\n-The AI is now extremely competitive, and will give you an even greater challenge while racing.\n-Young Driver Test: out, single lap of Monza with the option to skip: in. Frankly, I found the test to be both rewarding and infuriating in 2013. most challenges in it were fairly simple and easy, however, when it came to getting that one silver medal converted into gold to unlock all the teams at the start of career, it got rather frustrating when it got to a point where I simply couldn't squeeze any more time out of the lap. This game, however, has you driving a single lap around the Italian GP circuit of Monza which you can even skip and select the game difficulty yourself.\n-Career mode now has the option of Short/Medium/Long career featuring 7/12/19 races respectively. So if you want to race an F1 career, but don't have the patience for the entire calendar, then you can miss 7 or 12 races out if you like.\n\nCons:\n-Codemasters is very limited (much in the same way as EA is with Fifa) that they are contractually obliged to release a new F1 game every season, no matter how much/little has changed, which explains why 2013 and 2014 are extremely similar.\n-Some would've liked to see a new UI (I'm fine with re-using the old one, I'd rather not have to re-learn where everything is in menus as well as having to re-learn how to drive properly)\n-Mercedes is stupidly OP compared to all other teams.\n-Still no formation lap prior to the race and no podium scenes\n-No F1 Classics this season\n\nNow the Pros and Cons are out of the way, time for some issue addressing.\n\n-"It's Exactly the same as F1 2013"\nWrong. it isn't. Why don't you go ahead and do a lap of Monza on F1 2013, then play 2014 and try driving the exact same lines at the exact same speed as the previous game. I guarantee that 100% of the time, you'll massively understeer at the first of the Lesmo turns. The lower downforce on the 2014 cars is really shown in the game, and credit to Codemasters for their execution of how different the handling has been this year. Additionally, as I stated above, Codemasters (or whoever holds the contract) is obliged to make a new game for the franchise EVERY year, no matter how much has changed within the sport, so you can't always expect a game that's drastically different to the previous installment.\n\n-"There's no KERS"\nWrong again. What F1 2013 fans know as KERS, is now one half of the new ERS (Energy Recovery System) The KERS part is now known as MGU-K which draws energy under braking, and MGU-H draws energy from exhaust heat. While in 2013, the drivers could choose when to deploy their KERS energy, in 2014, from what I can tell, it's all controlled by the onboard ECU chip in the engine, which utilises the additional 33 seconds of increased horsepower as and when it needs to. So before you go moaning about the lack of deployable KERS, try watching an actual race and see if the drivers are even in control of their energy deployment.\n\n-"The menus are exactly the same"\nYes... they are, but as the saying goes, if it isn't broke, don't fix it.\n\n-"The Williams livery isn't right"\nNo, it isn't, this is because Codemasters were unable to secure the rights to use the Williams Martini livery, so they used the alternate livery from races where advertising alcohol is banned.\n\n-"What happened to F1 Classics mode?"\nThis was asked on the official forums, and the response was "Because this year's cars are so drastically different in performance from the old cars, we have chosen not to include classics in F1 2014"\n\nThis is about all I can think of for now, but if I can think of anything more than just needs to be mentioned, then I'll be sure to edit the review (mainly after I start playing multiplayer more)","October 17, 2014","true","81.7"," 93 of 128 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","93","128","2","7"

Yes, there are going to be a LOT of similarities to 2013, because as someone else pointed out, F1 is F1!\n\nThe difference in the car handling/sound etc from 2013 is very realistic. (Those complaining about the assistst, turn them OFF in the options!) (Those saying there are still assists present, where???) (Those complaining about traction control, well...TURN THAT OFF too!)\n\nThe physics & handling modeling are very good, I was just driving Monaco, started in damp/wet conditions on Inters and could "feel" the car improving as the track dried, and this transitioned upon chaning to Options. Oh, and love the random birds flying around, nice touch.\n\nI do have a few complaints, mainly realism complaints...Where are the marshalls? Also, the cars seem quite tough, luckily for me haha, and I've failed to avoid someone elses debris a few times and not suffered a puncture, again luckily.\n\nThere are a number of things I hope have been added to 2015 though, more back game play, ability to "wander" round the paddock and have to endure the journalist's questions, "shaping" your drivers charecter and how they are viewed publicly, and privately by other drivers, a little more "politics" that translates onto the track instead of driving against a bunch of mindless opponents. Surely it can't be that difficult to factor in the drivers' style and approach to their AI counterparts?\n\nThe racing, so far, they have got pretty bang on...now time to expand the rest of the game :)\n\nEdit: I've just seen a marshall!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snipernext/recommended/226580/","snipernext","snipernext","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snipernext/","551 products in account","F1 2014 is the latest addition to the Codemasters racing game series.\nEarlier this year announced Codemasters that they were working on two Formula 1 titles, one for the old consoles and one for the new consoles, and unfortunately this is something you'll quickly notice in F1 2014 for generally there has not been much in compared to the 2013 edition, and it can actually be quite difficult to see why there should be changes if you are not familiar with Formula 1 in advance.\n\nWhen starting the game will no longer greeted by "young drivers test" but instead you get a single round at Monza where you then get proposed a severity and assists. One should therefore no longer perform a number of tasks that test a racing driver then you will get some offers from different teams depending on how well you have done. Instead, you can now sign a contract with any team so that means you can sit down in a Mercedes racing and start winning all his races immediately. One need no longer run for the slow teams and gradually earn to be a top running, you will be just. It leaves a slightly empty feeling that you are allowed to drive for a team without actually and have done to deserve it.\nIf you have played games series before, there are no major surprises in the career mode. Once you have selected a team starts the battle to become the team's first drive, here you will be weighed and measured on how to cope in the season according to championship points, qualification and race results. Itself, it is will be the team's first run, which will affect the car's setup and how the further development of it takes place.\n\nAs soon as career mode begins, the game shows itself from its best side when one starts his first race, it becomes clear that you are not sitting alone in the car, but that you have a whole team behind him that is ready to help someone. One's engineer is often with radio announcements with information about how you're doing in the race and how you can improve yourself. From the start the team's requirements be somewhat reluctant until that has proven its worth, and then they begin to push for delivering results to the team. You will notice that the team's confidence to a slowly being built and it shows by example. may be prompted to save the tires of qualifications because they expect that you could easily go on. It works pretty convincing for it feels namely that the team pay attention to and that they are giving thought to how to cope in the season.\nIn addition to the career mode, the game this year at a reunion with the fantastic scenario game mode, here is everything as usual, you have the ability to run different scenarios that are taken out of the real Formula 1 world. Scenarios opens the possibility for players who do not have time to run a full 100% run of still having to get up to handle fuel, safety car and more.\nWhen it comes to gameplay feels the game is somewhat different than in the past, this is due to the new regulations that 2014 season has brought with him. The new hybrid cars have been a bit easier to manage because they have shorter stopping distances which makes it easier to correct the drive error as you do. The old KERS system which saved eletrisk energy which you could then use as a speed boost has been replaced with the new ERS. This means that you no longer even rådder of its electrical energy as the car is available.\n\nUnfortunately, featuring F1 2014 no longer on the classics that had been in F1 in 2013, it is shame because it really was a feature that distinguished themselves and who could easily have imagined had been extended to 00s racing cars. It seems odd that you choose to remove such a good feature when the game does not have much new to offer.\nF1 2014 is an odd game that does not really offer anything new, but you still can not accuse Codemasters to make just a reskin of the 2013 series, for under the hood, there are many changes that appear if you look hard enough, but you get nevertheless a feeling that Codemasters has just released F1 2014 will fill the void until F1 2015 is published as many racing fans are eagerly awaiting. So many places you feel that Codemasters could have done more for the game such. add podiums, running interviews, warm up laps as a fan of the series have long efterspurgt- but perhaps we see in 2015?\nIt is in many ways hard to recommend F1 2014, but if you a fan of Formula 1 is still hard to ignore, because of running rokaderne and the new regulations as Codemasters has implemented furnished.\n\n\nThanks to Alexander Mortensen from Pixel-TV","October 30, 2014","true","18.6"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","39","57","2","8"

This game is basically F1 2013.5\n\nHowever Codemasters are the only company in the world who could copy and paste a game and still make it worse.\nSidepod glitches are worse in my opinion while Autospin curbs still exist and the online is more unstable than ever!\n\nFor the record. The game is still quite fun and challenging to drive on the wheel, however pads have InBuilt traction control which gives them zero wheelspin and better tyre wear. In wet conditions the gap between the wheel and pad can be as large as 3 seconds, which is simply crazy. This is making league racing almost impossible, which is the only reason i play the game.\n\nCodies have had 5 years to improve, the game however has made no significant improvments, While luke spring, Steve hood continue to ignore all of the community and continue to make broken games!\n\nF1 2015 will be on a new engine (So they say...)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/recommended/226580/","startrekmike","startrekmike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/","210 products in account","First, I think it is best to start by saying that if you are looking for a good racing sim that covers the F1 2014 season then this is a must have. It gives you the new turbocharged cars, the 2014 track list and the 2014 roster (exempting some mid/late season changes).\n\nThere are a lot of reviews that call this a "copy/paste" of F1 2013's gameplay. That is correct but only because F1 as a actual sport is not one that changes it's entire rule structure, driver roster or track schedules in massive ways. it's a sport so any evolution is going to be slow and gradual. Going into F1 2014 with the understanding that it gives you exactly what it's title says (a F1 2014 season game) will probably save you from getting super upset.\n\nI mean, seriously. Are people expecting races on the moon or something? Perhaps Jet powered cars with missile launchers? It's a F1 sim/game so it is going to use the material that the actual sport provides.\n\nThe only really significant downer is the lack of 2013's classic mode but considering how limited in scope the classic mode is in 2013, I suppose I can understand why they want to wait until they can really do more with that concept and I don't think F1 2014 was the place for them to do that (though I think expectations are high for F1 2015).\n\nSo, with that out of the way, lets talk about specifics.\n\n1.) Graphics. This title is not going to be a massive jump from 2013 but it does the job perfectly. The car models look fantastic. The tracks look good and effects still do the job as well as you would want them to. The real standout however is the rain effects. Codemasters seems to understand the importance of good rain effects and how it effects the gameplay.\n\n2.) Sound. The sound is great. The cars sound correct and reflect the 2014 move to 6cyl turbocharged power units. The rest of the effects do the job just fine and give you plenty of situational awareness.\n\n3.) Physics/handling. This is where I think a lot of people have the wrong attiude in their reviews. They get so used to 2013's handling (with more downforce and less torque) that the 2014 cars can come as a surprise since they feel ENTIRELY different. This can make it difficult for those that mastered F1 2013 and some will get frustrated at having to adapt to a new driving style (just like the real drivers had to deal with). The handling is a real high-point in F1 titles and this is no different.\n\n4.) Gameplay modes. It does not have the classic mode which is fine but the rest of the normal options are still there. The only big change is the switch from a long "young drivers test" to a short evaluation lap which can either be welcome or unwelcome depending on your skill level going in.\n\nOverall. while it lacks the classic cars and tracks of 2013. It still provides a solid F1 2014 season experience that accurately reflects the technical changes in a satisfying way. If you want a sports franchise to change in leaps and bounds then you probably are not being reasonable but I suspect that a lot of the big stuff is being saved for the F1 2015 release.\n\n","January 8, 2015","true","13.7"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","32","47","0","0"

So does that make it a bad game?\n\nI'd say no. It surely features noticeably less content than its predecessor, but it's a solid game by itself with no real issues.\n\nI'm one of the few people who actually liked the changes in the 2014 Formula One season, therefore I liked this game as well. The handling has once again been changed for the better, and I'm slightly ashamed to admit it but I don't find the new engine sound bad at all.\n\nI like that it was designed with accessibility in mind - unlike the previous games, you can just jump into the career right away and pick whatever car you want without grinding for points to get into a better starting team and having to work your way up. Some people might dislike that, but being the filler this game is, I think it's alright.\n\nTo sum it up, I suppose that if you enjoyed the previous titles in the series, you're most likely going to like this game too as it's similar in its core.

Using a wheel (G27) and no assists, you can snap the car around, lock up under breaking and even have that dreaded wheel spin on exits... its all about setting up the wheel you have CORRECTLY (and if you need, using the profiler).\n\nI found that setups also now play a key role. Too much or too little spring/wing and the car becomes a nightmare. Thankfully gear ratios are out of the  picture.\n\nCars have "difficulty" ratings, with the top tier cars being easiest, and bottom hardest to drive.\n\nThe sound is as good as can be expected - it mimics the real life horrible sounds perfectly. Its not Codies fault that Bernie wanted them to sound like this.  After playing a while you get used to it. What still takes a while is the 8 speed gear box. I often found myself only using 7 on some tracks (I hate the 8 speed box,  but this is not a fault of the game)\n\nCurrent car models are spot on for Preseason and early season spec (as are the paint schemes). Easily remidied with skin mods. The stock skins are a nice quality but lack detail and realism.\n\nThe new tracks are a blast to drive! A1 ring is awesome fun.  The rubbered in racing line works perfectly (as does drying line) right out of the box..\nAlso track lighting seems to be specific for actual race start times  - ie. Melbourne is not in noon day sun but afternoon lighting with shadows across the front stretch.\n\nThe Ai is still stupid, but it will fight you harder, which makes offline racing fun. Positions between them change frequently - its no longer follow the leader.\n\nI have yet to really delve into the online racing aspect of this title, but hopefully its improved over 2010 - 11-12-13.\nFrom a short test I noticed that theres no warping of cars into the track.\n\n\n\nIn the end, if you are a die-hard F1 fan or race enthusiast - this game will give you hours of enjoyment. Take it at face value - a game, and you wont be disappointed.\n\nLike stated earlier, if you were expecting a massive new update for the series, wait until F1 2015.  * If you look at the reviews you will see that 90% of the "thumbs down" reviews come from people with less than 1/2 an hour in game, who are complaining about handling... but they have not played nearly enough time to set up a controller properly.\n","October 17, 2014","true","32.8"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","0"

I would say I have a long view of the genre at this point.\n\nWith that in mind, I would say that this game is quite good, and continues the incremental refinement that the series has enjoyed since 2010. You may have seen that the series has gotten lower review scores year after year, and that has more to do with the nature of yearly sports releases than anything about the game itself. 2013 was clearly a high point for the series, and it didn't have the scores that 2012 had, despite having tons of classic content, as well as a decently fleshed out career mode. One of the few shortcomings of the series is the continued lack of telemetry, which makes car setups a little less scientific than they could be.\n\nCodemasters have a fantastic physics engine, and have successfully modeled these new engines and that just-on-the-verge-of-snapping-the-rear feel that this season's pilots have to deal with. Lots of fun. The tire models have also changed, as in real life, with much more predicable, though probably too conservative, tire life (at least for my taste).\n\nThe classic content is missed, along with the Young Driver Weekend, though I still have F1 2013 if I ever get the urge to drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari at Estoril, Portugal.\n\nIf I look at this game without any prior context, is it worth it? Certainly, yes. It's a stripped down F1 game, no doubt, but when all of the rule changes, engine outputs, tire compounds, etc., it's quite a feat that Codemasters was able to release this game during their usual release window at all. I'll definitely be looking forward to F1 2015 which promises a bigger evolution in presentation. I give this an 8/10 so far.\n\nA final note: I loved the Geoff Crammond games, but anyone who says they were superior has selective memory. They were amazing for their time, but do not stand up to today's racers.","October 16, 2014","true","76.4"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","40","67","0","0"

As someone that has played F1 2011 onward this is somewhat dissapointing, it's far too Arcady for me, F1 2013 was a good challenge, this isn't, even with all driver assists off the car is easy to control. The steering does not feel connected to the car at all, when I'm stood still and I turn my wheel 90 degrees, the wheel in the car does the same, when I'm moving this is not true, there is still assistance on the steering and it really frustrates me. I never know how much I need to turn the wheel to go through a corner, because it changes depending on how the game feels.\n\nIt's a big shame, but save your money and get F1 2013, or for a really good experience, iRacing.

Just realised how crap this game really is.\n\nVery few changes from 2013 only BAD CHANGES.\n\nFor me the biggest con is the handling despite being a pad user. I hate that I have very bad grip in high speed the car just doesn't wanna f__ turnin, when you are in slow speed corners the entire thing is just so crap, you drift fullthrottle through every single accelaration zone, the car isn't a challange to drive. NO LOCKUPS even, in high large brakes I can barely lockup in the wet with abs off.\nIn my opinion if u want a good experience u better DON'T get this game.\nBecuase on this game you DONT NEED TO BE SKILLED TO BE FAST,  you just need to full throttle and full brake out of every corner, also didn't even talk about the mariokarting where u go down to lean and just full throttle and upshift.. just disgusting.\nLeagues have been ruined thanks to the handling too, people couldnt do wet races also people had to make seperate pad and wheel leagues because of the pad having overpowered traction, which was crazy, there are many videos about it on youtube.\n\n\nBy the way you cannot say that I dislike this game because I suck at it. Because I am in the top 50 in some of the tracks in time trial.\n\nFinal thoughts: Don't get this game I do regret getting it. Just get f1 2013 or f1 2010 they are the best. Don't ask me about f12015 but I heard that has issues too so yeah.

Bugs that where in 2013 are in this game and there are a couple AI issues too. you can get around all this with mods or just playing the game around the bugs.\n\nPeople complain about lack of grip/downforce etc. But you have to realise that the  game is replicating real Formula 1 so if F1 rules state less downforce then the game is going to have to do that too. another complaint i hear is the sound of the cars. That is not codemaster's fault so you cant blame them.\n\nThe career length can be adjusted to suit you as well as the race weekend length which is a nice touch\n\nOverall the game is "ok" at best and online play is not much to be desired.

It is similar, but Codemasters have added quite a few different tweaks to spice up the F1 experience. Apparently, a lot of people didn't like the 2015 edition so this is why I went for the 2014 one. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, especially as I snatched up this game while it was on offer. There has most certainly been an improvement in the graphics in comparison to the 2013 game, which is more noticeable on the street circuits, where the graphics are the most demanding on your system. All of the teams and drivers and circuits have been fully updated to match the 2014 season. I like the new Sochi track in Russia which offers quite a challenging driving experience. Also, it's cool that they brought back the old track in Austria. The F1 Classics is not included in the 2014 game, but I didn't really use it much anyway, so it's not a big loss. If you liked the Classics last year, then I would probably suggest sticking with the 2013 edition. So overall, I recommend this game to anyone who is up for an challenge in the world of F1 racing.","February 19","true","6.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cubejam/recommended/226580/","Cubejam","Cubejam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cubejam/","203 products in account","A great update to the 2013 title. Sure, not a lot has been changed with this title, but that doesn't mean it's bad.\n\nIt has a really challenging handling model, with a wheel, you need to feather the throttle to try to minimise wheelspin. Sudden direction changes will disrupt the cars balance so beware. With manual gear shifting it's easier to control the massive torque you get with this game.\n\nFor those reasons I find this title really fun. It's great fun learning to apply the throttle & it's really challenging to find the right gear to enter and exit a corner to deal with tyre degredation.\n\nAt the same time it's a shame they haven't taken the game up a level in terms of content and variety of content. There's not a whole lot here. Wet weather is almost undriveable & there are mods out there already to remove rain from the game, which is sad, but it's impossible to drive with aids off.\n\nThe reintroduction of the short career season is nice. I like 7 race seasons.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game with a challenging handling model. I recommend those with a wheel to just turn all assists off & enjoy the game how it should be played. Don't buy the game expecting it to be revolutionary, buy it as an expansion to the 2013 game, an upgrade on an already fairly enjoyable series.","October 18, 2014","true","44.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However... after I bought it (on sale, mind you), I remembered how quickly I got bored of F1 2013, and that game had many more features such as the Classic cars and tracks.

I do own all of the Grid series and I really like Grid Autosport. So I do watch the F1 series on television. The game to start with is not newbie friendly more like anti newbie friendly. The game gives you next to no information about how to change the wings on your F1 car. It gives you no information about the DRS system and how to use it. It does give you an evaluation test that in my opinion is useless that is supposed to set the difficulty automatically for you. Mine was very easy I later did a custom job as I couldnt stand a lot of the hand holding. Just one other point I should point out the AI has no tire wear in bad weather. They do pit but its a script. So in bad weather good luck to you.\n\nI know so far it sounds like I hated this game. Not so. I do enjoy the tracks, the graphics and sounds of the racing. Its great. In clear weather racing its fun and interesting. They have a ton of different teams you can join and the best part is the game its modable. Their is even an alpha to update the game to 2015 colors for cars and tracks. Great stuff.  Mods are at Racedepartment.com As I have mentioned before the game can be tailored to your liking. Make it  easy or maybe a mix of very easy and easy. Your choice. If you have all the assists to max its very doubtful your going to go flying off the track. The AI is a mixture of good and bad. Your rival who you can pick will end up being a great driver by the end of the season. He might start of terrible but as you soon as you pick him. Surprise he is suddenly a great driver. This is annoying.\n\nYou do have a partner and unlike Grid Autosport he is actually able to be in the top 10 usually. I do think however that had Grid autosport allowed Open-Wheel cars to pit that it would have a sizeable advantage over this game. The game is fun however its also very annoying as well. Due to the AI not having tires degrade in bad weather puts the human player at a big disadvantage. I should add I played this with a xbox360 controller. I do recommend this game only if its on sale. I payed $11 dollars for it and feel like I have already gotten my moneys worth out of the game. So their you have it. I would rate this game an 8/10 right now just based on my play time with it. Also I should mention that I did win the first seasonal championship in the game.\n\nI would like to add one more item. This game is not a true to life simulator. I would call it sim lite. My main issue with the game is the way the players car turns. Turn off the assists and it turns like a school bus. Also the back end gives out a lot more then it should. I have never driven a f1 in my entire life but watching them on television only. The handling feels off somehow. I honestly feel like Grid autosport is more true to life as far as open wheel handeling and what you would think the cars would drive like. Sticky tires and able to turn hard into a corner without the back end shooting out  all over the place.","September 7, 2015","true","22.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","1"

You'll now take the tyres you set your fastest lap in Q2 into the race so you can go balls-out (if you make it) in Q3 for pole with a set of the softs.\n\nThe sounds in general seem pretty good. The engines of the three maufacturers are represented and could be recognised from the onboard footage I watch week in week out on the BBC, Sky, F1.com, YouTube etc.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it appears fairly accurate. The Mercedes disappear up the road and the WIlliams, Red Bulls, Ferraris and to a lesser extent, the McLarens, scrap over the other podium spout and the top 10 order.\n\nThe total lack of control of ERS is a significant negative for this game though. In a year where the charging and discharging of the non-combustion engine has become an even more pivotal role Codemasters decides to bottle it and take that away from the driver.\n\nThe "classic" content from F1 2013 was a huge plus and one I revelled in personally. To not only not improve on but to remove it from the franchise was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The Scenarios and Season Challenges are welcome continues but it feels somewhat lacking. These new generation turbo cars would be complemented by some 1980s turbo kit.\n\nMultiplayer-wise, to date, I've really struggled with this game personally. I've probably spent more time in lobbies than I have racing. Can't think of a game version I've not tried and a lot of games have just ended up being full of kids with keyboards; no interest in a race. Just a destruction derby a lot of the time. I have no time for people who don't leave you room and would rather turn into an accident, lock wheels, than turn away and maintain momentum.\n\nRight now I don't think I'd recommend it as you can be charged a bit of a silly price for it. With it not being next-gen and most of my friends eing on Xbox One or PS4 I've not had to shell out for a console version as well this year.\n\nDo I recommend this game? As it stands, unlesss you're a big F1 fan - and you don't already own it - I'd say no and I wasn't expecting to say that.","October 19, 2014","false","54.3"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","1"

The guy standing at the front of the car is pushing last years model and his hands are more than a foot away from the new cars and is very offputting, immediately detracting from any realism you were hoping to feel.\nAI is just as dumb when it comes to moving off the racing line and will smash into you rather than avoid you if you are going slower on an out lap.\nThe rules can be totally ignored by the AI drivers which is especially evident when there's a safety car out. For example, I'm leading the race and lined up behind the safety car, just going into the final bend where the SC is about to go into the pits, nowhere near the finish/start line. The car in second place speeds past me and I get disqualified for overtaking with a safety car out.\nSo basically it's still plagued by the many bugs/flaws of its predessors and has to rank among the laziest 'updates' I've ever played, yet still I enjoy the game.

I think it was the new additions like new tracks, supersoft tires, new engines, and ERS implementations that made me enjoy it a lot more then the other installations. So to all those "OH ITS JUST A 2013 RESKIN", stop complaining, and look on the bright side more! :D Face it,  you play a game that updates every year, so nothing extremely grand can happen. For all the changes in the 2014 season I think codemasters did a great job, and I give the game about a 8.5/10. Could be a few improvements, but still a great game. I love the new cars and the new tracks like Sochi, and hope next year is just as great. I defiantly reccomend to anyone new to F1 games, as well as anyone coming from F1 2013. And especially to people coming from F1 2012 and below. Thanks for reading! Pros and cons below.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- No more tutorial thing to annoy you and just a one lap around monza to determine difficulty, which was VERY helpful.\n- AI to me seems at LEAST a bit more difficult than 2012 and 2013.\n- Up to date cars, tracks, and rules for the 2014 season. (ERS, Super soft tires, new engines, etc. They were also implemented VERY well in my opinion).\n- The ferrari looks cool as ♥♥♥♥\n- Minor track improvements here and there, nothing really major but little touch up that I enjoyed.\n- More details added around the tracks and cars to add realisim which i quite enjoy\n- More enjoyable handling IMO than in F1 2012.\n- I slightly bumped a curb at Hungaroring and my car flipped twice. I found it quite hilarious and just used a flashback, so I didn't really find it as a con :P\n\nCons:\n- Engines don't sound as cool on all of the cars.\n- Without assists I found the car slid a lot and was more difficult than F1 2013 or 2012 without assists.\n- No more classics expansion packs\n- The mercades are REALLY f*cking fast. On legend AI, if you let them the slightest lead, you will NOT catch them, they just streak ahead.\n- ERS is confusing for a newcomer\n- THE MERCADES ARE REALLY F*CKING OP AND FAST\n- It costs 49.99 USD\n\n\n**(this may or may have not been my first serious review so if somehow you do read this, dont bash me in the comments pls ty)**","October 18, 2014","true","54.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's disappointing to say it once more, but it's fact. This 2014 game is a step forward in on track driving but still lacking in immersion off track.\n\nThe game is enjoyable on the whole and the price drop is welcome since there is alot of copy paste going on.\nThe ontrack handling is very enjoyable requiring skill but the cars are more realistic and manageable, the brakes on the other hand seem to have been dumbed down in difficulty. You can really push the brakes now and there is a nice little audible that give you a hint in advance of any lockup. It seems to work well for gameplay.\nThe lack of traction in general has made racing the cars on the limit a hell of a lot of fun and very satisfying in getting those perfect laps, or if you over cook it a little and go into a drift.\nThe rules changed and removed KERS making overtaking a little trickier, but that in turn made successful overtaking more satifying.\nThe AI is still not very bright; at overtaking and can easily be lead into trying it around the outside, where it has to slot back in behind. Also sometimes it get offline and seem to just give up trying to take the corner and lets numerous cars go by before it slots back into the train.\n\nThere's no 3D modelled interactive agent, no paddock or motor homes. No interaction with the media and no press interviews for podiums. All hurting the game series since losing it in 2012. The animations are all old, even the HUD graphics are 99% from F1 2013.\n\nI'd recommend it just on the racing, but without the immersion it falls down to it's older brother, F1 2011.\nDon't get me wrong it's a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't endorse it as is to friends when F1 2011 exists.\nF1 2011 might be outdated, but it holds all the longevity gameplay items the newer F1 games by codemasters can only dream about,","October 19, 2014","false","30.2"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

Sure I could buy a larger batch to last a little longer but feta clean out of the brine is the way to do it. it taste better, smells better, and is still so moist.\n\nFeta is great in salads, on pizza, melted into veggie dishes and can be stuffed into everything from peaches to peppers. But what about just eating it on its own, sure I’ll go to the fridge and nibble on the block but never do I sit down with a fork and knife and go at it. I have to admit its is a very overwhelming cheese, the salt alone would make me want to get up and walk away. But what goes better with salty than sweet, nothing… So here is how you can sit down with a block of feta eat it all and still want more for years to come. The first time I ever tried honey baked feta was in 2009, it is 2012 and Im still thinking about it. Now this can be eaten along side a meal or you can set it out as a toothpick appetizer for a dinner parties.","June 15, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","0"

Firstly, as with any serious simulator, F1 2014 is designed for high-end PCs with the decent wheel and analog pedals that allow precise acceleration and braking. When you try to play on the console or with a gamepad, you’ll be severely disappointed: the game even on the Very Hard setting will became much easier. The second major drawback is the lack of full replays.\n\n76/100","April 19","true","10.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Even with only an Xbox 360 controller it can be really enjoyable. I feel like the difficulty level has gone down a bit playing on Legend difficulty, but for me it doesn't really matter as I find that extremely challenging anyway :).\n\nThere are no major differences from the previous F1 2013 in terms of car handling or overall game performance. The only difference is the new cars and some other stuff so if you aren't sure if you want to buy it or not I'd say wait. Wait until it gets cheaper or buy from a cheaper retailer (like I did). The graphics compared to previous game is the same. Completely the same no difference and still no SLI support (as if it's needed haha).\n\nHowever, overall it's a good game but I think there's not enough fun in it for it to be able to attract any non-F1 fans.

Even though people bash this game for basically everything from graphics to content-related mistakes to less fun from the gameplay, I found it just as enjoyable as 2012 and 2013.\n\nWhy do I like it?\n\nBasically it’s a new formula. New teams, new cars, new steering wheels, new rules. I was actually shocked by how much the car handling has changed. When I stopped playing 2013 game I was ruling the grid in a Lotus (4th best team of the season) with legendary AI setting and all assists off. I got into 2014 Ferrari using the same difficulty settings and in the first race qualified… 18th. The game is still demanding (maybe even more), some new aspects of driving were tweaked (in this one you can see and feel tyres cooling down on long straights, which creates a new set of challenges). And even though Mercedes are quite dominant in the game it is possible to win driving a different car, and some race events (like mid-race rainfall) can shuffle the grid in a way which creates way more interesting result than in real F1 timetables. The game surely isn’t flawless, but its strong roots still make it a solid product.\n\nWhy some people have a point bashing this game?\n\nYes, the new cars don’t have KERS, so there is no “boost” button to press when you feel you’re not fast enough. Presence of the 8th gear isn’t much of addition in terms of gameplay. Yes, Williams definitely has the wrong steering wheel. And yes, some tracks are unchanged, even though some of them were in reality altered for 2014 season. This last one isn’t entirely true. Canadian GP has a modified asphalt run-off area which was covered with grass in 2013, and some new buildings appeared in Monaco (most notably on the left of the famous tunnel exit). Plus two completely new tracks appeared on the calendar. The fact that some tracks were updated, while others were just pasted form the previous game makes me feel that development of the game was cut short at some stage.\nI still love the graphics, but what I have a problem with is that the cars somehow got ugly on the details. And I don’t mean generally uglier car designs. In 2013 I loved the front wing camera in the replays, in 2014 it just shows how underdeveloped the car model is in terms of detail. Just closely watch the nose and floor of Ferrari F14T – you’ll notice some very crude edges and weird shapes.\nSome people say that this game is just a 2013 mod featuring new cars. Sadly I have to agree. The full price is regrettable. Probably marketing strategy is meant make money of the newcomers. A person who had the previous game and buys this one for a full price may get furious.\n\nDo I recommend it?\n\nLet’s say a conditional “YES”. I marked “recommend” for this review because I have positive feelings about the game. But it clearly does not deserve thumbs up and “hell yeah”. You should definitely buy this game IF you are an F1 fan who wants to experience how formula changed in 2014, or if you like race simulations and haven’t tried F1 yet. And most definitely if you find this game on sale. The 2015 game will hopefully be better and all “next-gen”, but so far this is the only one with turbo engine F1 cars.\n\nPS: Fromula 1 fan ranting (you can stop reading, unless you are an F1 fan too, or a 2015 developer :)\n\nI found that the game was dumbed down a bit in terms of campaign interface, first race and team choosing. It’s nice that you can now select “length” of the season (number of featured races), but if they add an option of shortening a season I’d like to manually discard some of the races from the calendar. Some people liked replacing testing day with a simple racing sequence to evaluate player’s skills, like in GRID series. But I’m afraid it doesn’t work too well. When I tried it I found that it was around 1 lap of the simplest track (Monza) and all the assists were by default on. I almost crashed on the first corner when I started fighting with AUTOMATIC gearbox in an F1 car. Nice for newcomers, but will irritate the hell of the gamers who actually know what they’re doing. Also now you get to choose ANY team at the start of your career. A rookie in Mercedes AMG? Why the hell not. It actually doesn’t bother me since everybody can immediately choose their favourite team, and not struggle with Marussia or Caterham (yuck) for at least half of the season. What bothers me is that the team’s performance is defined at the starting point. Generally the developers decided that the big three is Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari. This hurts Williams which had a terrific 2014 season and their performance in the game is way lower than it should be.\n","February 13, 2015","true","124.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/horribletruth98/recommended/226580/","horribletruth98","HorribleTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/horribletruth98/","103 products in account","Many people will say F1 2014 was the worst ever made by Codemasters, and while it may be the worst F1 game, that's not saying much. This game is still good, even if it is a copy/paste of 2013. Here's a list of the pro's and con's.\n\nPros:\n\nFor starters, they removed the Young Driver's Test in Abu Dhabi (which if you weren't new to the games, got pretty annoying due to the fact you HAD to do it). Instead they opted for an "Evaluation Test" which puts you in a one lap race and adjusts your assists and whatnot according to your performance. Or you could just skip it all together, which is great for returning players like me.\n\nIt has the tracks and cars from the F1 2014 season (obviously) which is great if you don't want to put in a 2014 season mod in 2013 (but the mod would be much cheaper lol). Now, some of the liveries are inaccurate due to licensing and whatnot, but mods can easily fix that.\n\nAdded scenarios to the Scenario Mode. I personally don't care for the Scenario Mode but if you're into that then this is great for you.\n\nGreat modding community. My game is barely even Codemaster's F1 2014 anymore because of the great mods you can get for it. (Realistic Damage + Pastor "Crashtor" Maldonado is amazingly entertaining lol)\n\nCons:\n\nThis game is pretty much a copy/paste of F1 2013. Even in the files it says F1 2013 in them. But that's not to say it's a terrible thing considering how good F1 2013 was.\n\nThe handling is not superbly accurate to real life. I feel like the wheel spin is just a bit over done and the setups don't make THAT big of a difference in your speed and handling.\n\nIt's very rushed feeling. What I mean is, the glitches are awful at times. For example, it was POURING rain on Hockenheim, yet my wet tires were heating up like it was dry? And then my engineer told me to put on dry tires when it was RAINING on my screen. Whatever.\n\nIf you thought the A.I. were bad in 2013, you just wait. The A.I. are horribly slow on the first lap. Almost the point where you can be in a Marrusia and over-take the whole field in one lap. Then, the A.I. out of nowhere become gods and leave you behind. And they don't have tire wear which means they can just constantly put in fastest lap after fastest lap while you're struggling with old tires. I would love to see them fix this in F1 2015, but I doubt it will happen.\n\nThe lack of league support is just terrible. The lag is worse than ever in this game, especially with a full lobby. Servers are pitifully unstable. Multiplayer is just awful in this game.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nDo I think you should pay full price for this game? No, not even. Wait until a Steam sale or something because $50 is just outrageous compared to what a mod can do for free. If you're a die-hard F1 fan like me, it is worth picking up when it is discounted for sure. But if you can wait a little while, definitely wait until F1 2015 in June. If I were to give this game a number score, it'd be a 7/10. It does what it needs to do right apart from the A.I. and league support such as AOR. If you want the full F1 2014 experience, pick up this game.","March 28, 2015","true","47.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For gamepad users, I assure you everytime you play this game you will get this bug/glitch where your car suddenly starts to move either to the left/right (commonly right). I\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game! Bought a steering wheel, upgrade their RAM so they can play the game lagless, wasting their time eventhough there are important things to do, and so much more just for a game.\n\nAnyway if your using Windows below 10, I can promise you that this and all F1 games works perfect and smoothly (if you have the minimum specs of course).

The handling model is ruined in this one. Driver aids are forced upon you and it makes everything drive like junk. This is applicable to you whether you used assists before or not. Though if you didn’t use assists then the difference is even more aggravating. All the nice driving feel is gone. For them to claim this was in the name of accessibility is just baffling. The games have always had options to turn assists on for new players. Why couldn’t these new assists be included in said options? How does it make sense to force them upon people who purposefully turn assists off!?\n\nWhat is left is a game where driving is a chore not a challenge. The cars feel awful but at the same time you will find it hard to ever spin or lock a tire. Instead you will be stuck throwing yourself into corners like an idiot because the traction control will just do the work for you, otherwise you can’t keep up. Driving fast with a controller in this game feels like cheating and going back to 2013 I was well aware of how much worse of a driver it had made me.\n\nIn terms of content the only real addition is a shortened career mode, in which you advance through teams by setting their drivers as rivals and beating them in a best of 3 races. I actually think this is pretty cool and I hope it stays in the series. Apart from that everything is the same but they cut the classic cars and tracks, along with a lot of the new driver testing stuff.\n\nThis is what you get when you take a franchise that already struggles for new content because of its annual release schedule, then tell the developers they actually have less time than usual because their 2015 version needs to be next gen and released early than usual. Hopefully it makes up for this mess.\n\nSkip this one.\n","January 25, 2015","false","30.9"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

It's hard to recommened wheteher or not to buy this game while these circumstances are messing up with my joy while playing this game. First of all if you are looking for a simulator then this is not a game for you. Even on the hardest difficulty it is very easy to over pass your opponents like if you would be racing on the easiest settings and when it comes for your opponent to overtake you it's nearly impposible for them to do that unless you make a mistake your self. This game needs hell of improvments when it comes to the AI and the most dissapointing thing and which makes me rather say "do not buy this game" is that the F1 franchise is lacking on new content. I can assume this game is almost the same thing just as F1 2011 if i don't include in the new main menu, challenges, graphics and drivers and teams.\nOn the other hand graphics are impressive and innovative compared to F1 2011. The career mode gave me the feeling as if i would be an athentic Formula 1 driver, but again it's nothing new. That's about it, I can barely find anything that would satisfy me since i have the feeling of playing a recycled game.\nIf you never purchased an F1 game from codies then go for it, I am pretty sure you wont be dissapointed, but if you already did then stick to your older F1 game and you could just get a MOD for the new seasons. You wont be missing out much.\nAs an F1 consumerist i sense this is a recycled product (not garbage, just recycled), so just go get an older F1 game and say NO to this one.","February 22, 2015","false","115.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","1"

I play a variety of racing games including iRacing, F1 2013 and Asseto Corsa on a semi-regular basis.\n\nCodemasters, is a large company with many years of experience.\n\nGiven that. I should not be able to real of a list of things they should have done better.\n\nThe Williams livery - no excuse, I should not have to mod an official F1 game (there are already several good mods for this) so that I can have the cars look like they do in real life. It's absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThe AI - Far worse an effort than last year, the AI feel like they are driving completely different cars to me, at some parts they brake way later than I can, at others, they have so much more grip they must have made their cars from magnets and put iron in the roads. They catapult themselves between far too aggressive and far too meek, almost bi-polar even.\n\nIn 3 months there will be several high quality AI mods and this complaint will be rendered null, but I shouldn't have to wait until a modder, on his own time makes a mockery of codemasters.\n\nThe performance - My graphics card is overheating on high settings.\n\nWell obviously you say, get a better graphics card! Well, yeah, that too. But I've been playing the older games on the very highest settings, including using graphics enhancing mods and they look ab-so-lute-ly gorgeous. Surely, SURELY I should be able to make use of the same level of graphics? No, I absolutely can't, not only that, but they are significantly worse, the reflections are blocky and the colouration is distorted, the mirrors remind me of my N64 (yes, I exaggerate, but not by nearly enough) (already there are fixes on the steam forum for this, if users can fix it within a few days, why wasn't it like it in the first place?). It's just plain worse. And given that it's pretty much the same game as last year, I shouldn't have that problem.\n\nContent - Well, we all knew that this was going to be a stop gap until F1 2015. But that doesn't make it better. This feels very slim compared to the earlier titles.\n\nIt just frustrates me that these are issues, as sure as the Sun sets there are many other issues, but these strike me in particular as things that are easy to fix, should never have been an issue in the first place or just smack or finances being the goal and not the game.\n\nHaving said that, it's not all bad.

While the handling is quite different and does reflect some of the changes in the 2014 season you could just be driving the old V8s as the developers haven't bothered to implement the more refined features of the 2014 engines. In fact, there are fewer engine features in this game than in the previous games. Now you've just got the loud pedal, the stop pedal and DRS. There's no implementation of boost or energy recovery, something that seems to be a key factor for the real cars. Whether the developers didn't have access to this sort of information, thought it would be too complex for the average gamer or were just too lazy to put it into the game it does mean that if you're thinking of upgrading to the latest version to get the features of the 2014 spec engines then you're going to be disappointed. If you're happy to carry on with the V8s and an earlier driver line up then hang onto your cash and wait for the new technologies to be properly developed.","February 4, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrizb/recommended/226580/","chrizb","chrizb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrizb/","40 products in account","Having had a comparision to a long history of F1 Games from early atari via the penical of Geoff Crammond's masterpieces and lows like Alain Prost's racing all the way through to the current crop you can assume two things. I love driving games, especially simulations, and I am a bit of a mug, as I buy (almost) all of them. Seeing the progression of Codemaster efforts I can't help but shake the feeling that they are fallowing the market, no doubt backed up by the in game logging system that shows them statistical distributions of which features are used how often and so on. I am not sure that works for me.\n\nIn short: This game is great for casual to intermediate racers, but the simplification of the game has taken a lot of the simulation feel away. Please buy it if this is your first go, or if you prefer your racing fast, furious and not too serious/dull. It is definitly great fun and even a bit of a simulation. Having said that, don't be a mug and buy it if you own 2013. Just don't!\n\nLong version:\nOn the positive side I think F1 2014 is making a good stab at recreating the new feel of F1. Squeeling tyres, odd engine noises and the changed breaking distances are all reflected. In addition the racing is very emersive and overall the game gives you a good race in most scenarios. For example I expected the new track in Russia to be boring as F1 drivers stated that the simulator didn't represent the real fun of the track, as it flowed much nicer in reality. However when I started timed laps around it I got into a rythm pretty quickly and before long really enjoyed the track, which can only mean one thing: Nice job Coders :)\n\nWhen starting the game you get a nice intro (very much like 2013) and all the visuals are at the same level as 2013 with the odd tweek here and there. For example sparks flying from underneath the car are noticable and sometimes really get into your virtual face. The handling is also improved somewhat with a sharper feel, reflecting the oversteer nature of modern F1 cars. Scenario modes are there as before, increasing in difficulty, but if you have played them in 2013, then 2014 doesn't offer anything new. But scenarios are in general good fun. I found the rain / wet track scenario quite hard but that might just be me. Compared to other online racers, who post rediculously high scores, I seem to be middle of the pack.\n\nIn a season challange you again get the chance to pick an opponent from anywhere on the grid and as long as you beat them best of 3, then you get their seat. Starting this challange on medium I was surprised to be dumped straight into qualifying on a new track in Austria (although I had vague memories of the layout from F1GP2). Steep learning curve? You bet. Especially for novice drivers.  But great fun.\n\n\nThere are some differences that are fairly neutral. No boost button anymore, No gear rations to set and a couple of other minor changes not worth mentioning here. Suffices to say the format of F1 has changed in reality and this game reflects this. But it does lead to less to do and think about. Given that there is little new besides the sound and some drive models I can't shake the feeling that it is too little change for the better. One thing worth mentioning is that if you opt to return to the pits the 2013 version had a nasty habbit of continuing the engine noise. That has been fixed. On the otherhand desperatly trying to switch to a one stop strategy at Imola was impossible, even when calling for option tyres from the car. The pit crew just ignored me forcing me to stop again :(\n\nPit stops, corner cutting penalties and so on have all be retained although the execution has ever so slightly changed (you can switch this penalty off as well ). And this is where my list of gripes start. This should not be taken too seriously but I was hopping since 2011 that this would be fixed and it still hasn't happened:\n\nI am missing:\n\n1) freedom to set up the car asymetrically (different settings for every corner of the car)\n2) What about dampers, gearration at the beginning of the season and so on?\n3) The black and white nature of the commentary and news articles (I raced from last to 8th in a caterham on high difficulty level, one place behind my rival (Vettel) and ended up with an animation of my driver shaking his head in dispair - that does kill the mood\n4) Why not let us drive the pre-race lap to check out the track?\n5) cartoon physics and damage model - I am sick and tired of getting nothing but wing damage. Please sort it and negotiate harder with the FIA. This is probably one of my major gripes, especially since it now includes mid air drifting when jumping shikanes (you can try this on most 90 degree corners). It is also still true that in a pile up cars have a tendency to "stick together" because the collision detection still does not resolve object interlocking correctly (In the real world two objects hitting each other end up repelling each other, but not here). This has been a basic 3D Vector coding problem since the 1990s, and while some games have managed to solve this, codemasters is alas still stuck in the past (although it is not ruining the game!).\n6) The AI still has major flaws around lapping (slowing on the racing line most of the times when met in corners) and their tendency to drive into you from behind at the start of races is also somewhat annoying (of course with no penalty).\n7)  Can we have a story line please? You sort of had a half hearted story in an earlier version but killed it.\n8) Please give us better grafics than the playstation. We can handle it.\n9) I would like testing (could also be the tsrat of the story line) - especially pre-season to help with developing the car in a direction I like.\n10) accuracy of the penalty system is still poor. Sorry, but if 2 wheel are still on the road (U-Turn in Canada) even if the other two are not, then there should be no penalty - just as an example.\n11) Career progression is unrealistic. If you drive the socks of a Caterham and continously put it in the top 10 over 5 races in the season you will be offered a contract by one of the top 3 teams. But not in this game.\n12) What about two way communications around pit stops? Please fix that and enhance so that when tyre wear is low the pit might ask how it is going? How about having multiple race stratregies amd an option to switch to plan C?\n\nTherew are many more wishes, but the above could all have been done with a little bit more work and they are not ground breaking either. All in all this is a genuine attempt at getting something new represented in the F1 world, but the price does not reflect the changes made, which are overall minor tweeks. Not all of them to my liking. Simply put, by going after a broader appeal Simulation fans have ended up loosing out again. That is frustrating to say the least. It feels shallower and the physics execution is more like TOCA then F1. I still can't feel the build up of downforce as the speed increasese, and I can't gain a tenth here and there by doing very carful car set-ups.\n\n\nI know that is not what thew majority seems to want, but then this is my review and they can write theirs.\n\nDear Codmasters:\n\nPlease rework the phsyics from scratch (car, damage, collision, the lot).\nPlease give us more simulation options that make real differences on how the car feels, and\nbring us a propper career story line.\n\nYours faithfully\nChris (F1 simulation addict)","October 17, 2014","false","303.6"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

I started with F1 2010 on the xbox 360 and then F1 2012 on the 360 before finally making it to F1 2014 on the PC.\n\nPros:\n- Runs at a solid 60+ fps 1080p while recording\n- Graphics appear to have become better since 2012 (although i was on console for that)\n- Learning curve is reasonable. You can pick up the game fairly easy and every couple of races you can turn up the difficulty a little bit or turn off some assists to get better.\n- You get to experience the new turbo F1 cars.\n\nCons:\n- One major graphical error that bothers me to no end is that fact that when you are in the "TV Pod" camera mode as well as the driver's camera mode, the mirrors provide you with absolutely no information. The mirrors look like they came straight out of pole position. Legitemately, the reflection of cars in the side mirrors give you no benefit because pole position had better graphics detail and animation.\n- Home menu and submenus not necessarily the most intuitive\n- After exiting fullscreen through an Alt+Tab, the game cannot be put into fullscreen mode again without exiting game and launching game again (this may only be a problem for me but, I have to launch it using Nvidia Geforce Experience or it won't be fullscreen at all)\n- It's the same game as years prior (Coming from 2012 to 2014 and from console to PC, the only difference I notice is the graphics, the cars are supposed to feel completely different and be harder to drive with the new regulation changes, but I feel as though I'm still driving the 8 cylinder naturally aspirated F1 car with blown diffusers from 2010 and 2012.)\n\nOverall: If this is you first game in the F1 series, get it. If you already have a game but are looking for an updated version with an all new feel, don't. The game is a Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V of previous years. Unfortunately this is the Madden of racing games and I don't see the game changing this pattern in the near future.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 8/10\nNew Features: 0/10\nOverall Quality for New Player: 7/10\nOverall Quality for Returning Player: 4/10","March 27, 2015","false","12.9"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

Which is understandable. It's nice to feel the lack of downforce and to hear the turbos implemented in this season. It's a total change from 2013 and rightly so. I'm thoroughly enjoying trying to keep the car on track. The lack of downforce on the cars is really noticeable. For example just running the track in Australia I can visually see and almost feel the car come off the track. I've yet to complete most of the tracks as the game has only been out a few hours. I did however give Sochi(Russian Grand Prix) a whirl and it was a welcome addition to the game. Like previous iterations in the series the game takes some getting used to but it is possible to master the game and become a E-Formula1 legend.\n\nWith the aforementioned said. I do feel that my XBOX controller doesn't seem to have the same control as 2013 which threw me off just a bit. However I'm improvising, adapting, and overcoming this. I feel it's just me getting used to the new cars and changes in the sport. I miss the young driver test although the evaluation they have now isn't too bad. It just doesn't seem to place you on a team or let you pick from a few like before. I mean picking Mercedes AMG, Scuderria Ferrari, or Infinity Red Bull from the get go seems to easy. So instead I opted to drive for Sauber behind Bianchi (#JB17) as the number 2 drive. Which so far has proved quite the challenge I'm barely able to keep myself in 3rd place starting from 11th.\n\nEither way it's a great game and I'm looking forward to putting more time in.

It goes without saying that Codemasters are clearly focusing on their new 'engine' for 2015, however for 30 pounds i was expecting a little more than an update from 2013 which only adds 2 new tracks takes away classics and gives us the seasons cars, drivers etc.\n\nAs a conclusion, I was expecting more from 2014, however my enjoyment from the game is still pleasing in my perspective.  2015 will be a decider if Codemasters can cut the mark on the 'next gen' games market and I am very much looking forward to the game coming out.","October 30, 2014","false","182.4"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

Δε μπορώ να πιστέψω ότι η εταιρεία που μας έδωσε κάποτε τα Colin McRae Rally games δεν είναι σε θέση να δημιουργήσει έναν σωστό Formula 1 τίτλο.\nΑπό την άλλη, αν το έχει γυρίσει τελείως στα arcade racing παιχνίδια και είναι ανίκανη να μελετήσει σοβαρά το πρωτάθλημα της F1 για μία χρονιά, φροντίζοντας να προικίσει το παιχνίδι της με τις αναγκαίες διορθώσεις, τότε καλά θα κάνει να αφήσει κάποια άλλη εταιρεία να αναλάβει το -δύσκολο αυτό- έργο. Δε ζητάμε να δημιουργήσει ξαφνικά το τέλειο F1 simulation game, άλλωστε κάτι τέτοιο όλοι γνωρίζουμε ότι σε ετήσιας κυκλοφορίας τίτλους θα ήταν καθαρή αυτοκτονία από εμπορικής άποψης, καθώς δε θα είχε λόγο να δουλέψει πάνω σε επόμενες εκδόσεις. Ας δείξει όμως ότι επιτέλους έχει την τάση να το κάνει.\n\nAn unsatisfactory repetition of last year's game, F1 2014 cannot justify its release. The minor gameplay improvements are inadequate, compared to the various deficiencies, such as graphics and sound stagnation, lack of ERS system, absence of a special gaming mode like Champions or Classic mode of 2012 and 2013 respectively, problematic A.I and erratic penalty system.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/f1-2014-pc-review","November 8, 2014","false","37.5"," 2 of 45 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","2","45","0","0"

Graphics and the menus are completely unchanged. I assume, changes in this area will come with the next gen version Codemaster is working on. If one expects any news in this field, dont buy this game. But ...\n\nThe driving has changed significantly and I believe for the better. From all I have heard from drivers comments and TV footage this years F1 cars are more powerfull and have much more torque, than the 2013 cars. Although I never had the privilege to actually have driven a Formula 1 car in reality this programm gives me the feeling of how it could be. One need to be careful with the throttle, but the acceleration is really fast if you get it right. Looking on the replays of my first trials the driving very much looked like what I saw on TV. The F1 2013 version was really difficult to drive, but I never had the feeling that it was actually real driving. With the new version now I can really fight with the car and the opponents.\n\nIf you are a F1 fan you want to have the actual cars and drivers of 2014 anyway. If you love racing on computer, this game is cedrtainly a lot of fun, much more than the previous versions.  I have already deinstalled F1 2013 from my SDD to save capacity as I certainly will not use it beside the 2014 version. Although the price is slightly too high I strongly recommend buying the game, if you are a true Formula One enthusiast.","October 19, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well in this games case I would but with qualifications.\n\nF1 2014 is effectively an update to the 2013 game. The teams, drivers, tracks and rules are all updated to the 2014 season with the cars driving very differently from the 2013 versions. However I suspect given the earlier planned release of the 2015 edition (so we don't get the game with 3 races to go), that many features have been left out or just not complete.\n\nThere are clues throughout like the new bigger display steering wheels which are in fact copied and pasted between several teams.\nThe scenario mode, far from being improved from last year is truncated with no option to try the same scenario on a different difficulty.\nThe liveries on the cars are in some cases (McLaren) distant cousins of the real thing which will annoy anyone wanting accuracy. The graphics are an incremental increase nothing more.\nThe additional sting is what was removed, the classics last years seemed like a great beginning something that would be developed as the series continued but they are ripped completely from the franchise.\n\nPersonally I'm hoping this represents Codemasters shedding the limitations of the previous cycle to do something really special, with this release being a contractual obligation. I guess we will find out in 2015.\n\nIn the end can I recommend this? Well if, if you love F1 and want to recreate this season then yes. If you are just looking for some kind of F1 game, want value for money or have love for the days of Schumacher, Hill and Mansell then await the sale (or buy elsewhere) and get F1 2013.\n\nIf you already own F1 2013, well I hope my review has helped you decide.\n\n","October 21, 2014","true","45.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The handling model is different enough from last year that it takes quite a bit of getting used to, and on the highest difficulty the game gives you a good challange. If you do a few laps in practice, and then do qualifying and the race you get quite a lot of value from the game, even on the shortest time settings.\n\nThere are a few issues with the game that bug me though.\nFirst lap AI performance is terrible. Even on the highest diffuculty you can easily make up five to ten places on the first few corners, after which point the cars are spread out enough that it becomes a bit more realistic.\nMirrors look awful. Not only are they really low quality but they are not even accurate! At one point I was being chased by Rosberg but it was Hamilton's #44 that showed in the mirror.\nThe menus are slightly improved from last years game (it is now a bit more obvious which option is selected) but are still not really up to scratch.\nAI is not very good at recovering if you use the rewind feature. If an AI car is at a certain point in a corner when you resume it will often overshoot and go off track or hit the barrier.\nI wish that liveries were a bit more accurate, the lack of alcohol sponsorship in this game makes the Maclaren and Williams look really bare.\nDespite these issues I really do enjoy this game, even if it is just more of last years game in many ways.","December 24, 2014","true","59.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The handling seems stiffer, the chicanes seem rougher (and actually upset the car), and it is more difficult to race on easy setting using a gamepad (which I do).\n\nPros\n\n•	Menu music reminds me of Grand Prix 4 music\n•	Rookie test has been removed\n•	Russian track is fantastic and fun to race on\n\nCons\n\n•	Mirror animations of cars behind seems to have an incorrect aspect ratio as the vehicles seem squashed\n\nOverall this is a solid value especially if you can grab it during a discount.","December 25, 2014","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics and the menus are completely unchanged. I assume, changes in this area will come with the next gen version Codemaster is working on. If one expects any news in this field, dont buy this game. But ...\n\nThe driving has changed significantly and I believe for the better. From all I have heard from drivers comments and TV footage this years F1 cars are more powerfull and have much more torque, than the 2013 cars. Although I never had the privilege to actually have driven a Formula 1 car in reality this programm gives me the feeling of how it could be. One need to be careful with the throttle, but the acceleration is really fast if you get it right. Looking on the replays of my first trials the driving very much looked like what I saw on TV. The F1 2013 version was really difficult to drive, but I never had the feeling that it was actually real driving. With the new version now I can really fight with the car and the opponents.\n\nIf you are a F1 fan you want to have the actual cars and drivers of 2014 anyway. If you love racing on computer, this game is cedrtainly a lot of fun, much more than the previous versions.  I have already deinstalled F1 2013 from my SDD to save capacity as I certainly will not use it beside the 2014 version. Although the price is slightly too high I strongly recommend buying the game, if you are a true Formula One enthusiast.","October 19, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well in this games case I would but with qualifications.\n\nF1 2014 is effectively an update to the 2013 game. The teams, drivers, tracks and rules are all updated to the 2014 season with the cars driving very differently from the 2013 versions. However I suspect given the earlier planned release of the 2015 edition (so we don't get the game with 3 races to go), that many features have been left out or just not complete.\n\nThere are clues throughout like the new bigger display steering wheels which are in fact copied and pasted between several teams.\nThe scenario mode, far from being improved from last year is truncated with no option to try the same scenario on a different difficulty.\nThe liveries on the cars are in some cases (McLaren) distant cousins of the real thing which will annoy anyone wanting accuracy. The graphics are an incremental increase nothing more.\nThe additional sting is what was removed, the classics last years seemed like a great beginning something that would be developed as the series continued but they are ripped completely from the franchise.\n\nPersonally I'm hoping this represents Codemasters shedding the limitations of the previous cycle to do something really special, with this release being a contractual obligation. I guess we will find out in 2015.\n\nIn the end can I recommend this? Well if, if you love F1 and want to recreate this season then yes. If you are just looking for some kind of F1 game, want value for money or have love for the days of Schumacher, Hill and Mansell then await the sale (or buy elsewhere) and get F1 2013.\n\nIf you already own F1 2013, well I hope my review has helped you decide.\n\n","October 21, 2014","true","45.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My experience of modern F1 games prior to this was F1 2012 on my Xbox 360 (and the only reason I had bought that was to play Fight Night Champions as there are absolutely no decent boxing games on PC). I am purely an arcade racer I'm not ashamed to say, that is all I want from it. With 2012 on the Xbox I could win the championship on easy mode. I cannot do the same with this version. Initially I tried using an Xbox PC controller, then bought a simraceway racing stick which I now use. I am at the moment totally rubbish with this game, although I should improve like I did with 2012. This game runs brilliantly (incidentally, I initially bought F1 2010 on here - but it was buggy as hell and ran terribly and Steam gave me a credit refund). Superb graphics and sound (the engine sound is ok when using a wheel, but using a keyboard will make the engine sound terrible as you can't use gradual buildup like a wheel with a proper acceleration pedal. The game plays much like 2012 but with many cosmetic improvements.\n\nBut I get to my big gripe about this game. Although it is now possible to turn off racing penalties, the downside is that other cars think nothing of trying to ram you off the road literally. In fact, I would go far as to say this game has no actual AI for the cars as they appear to instead run on a fixed line like a drone car or a scalaletrix.\n\nThe jury is out for me on this one. Admittedly I haven't messed about with the setting nearly enough. Maybe all the above can be tweaked if I can be bothered. I say that, because most of my gaming time these days is taken up with Elite Dangerous.\n\nBTW, I am playing this game on a 3 monitor surround display. It makes a huge difference. Amazing to look at, a purely immersive experience combined with this game, just let down by my presently poor driving skills!\n\nI maybe will update this in future as I improve and understand it better. For now, I miss 2012 as I could get good times with it. With this the best I've had is 19th place finish :( Somebody said in another review that this game drives completely differently. I can concur with that - at least in the case of F1 2012.\n\nWould I recommed this? Yes if you want all the updated drivers etc. To be honest, if I can't eventually start getting good times (using this new surround display and wheel is all new to me so has thrown me a bit) then I'll consider this to have been a waste of money and should have got 2012 instead. Never played 2013 but heard superb things about it. Maybe I should have got that instead. As for now, I reserve judgement. I'm just hoping that after many more hours into this that it opens up to be a truely brilliant racer.","March 14, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can save and load mid-session as much as you want. Brakes are stronger and it's therefore easier to recover if you mess up. You can no longer use the manual power boost (kers?) but I think this reflects changes to the real cars. The graphics engine is the same as in 2013.\n\nIf you haven't played any Codemasters F1 game, this one is really good (I have four of them and they are all different flavors of the same thing, basically).

Leave aside the pad vs wheel debate and the autospin kerbs and the game is very, very good. Graphically it has taken a massive step forward since the start of the series in 2010, and the physics have improved no end, even though it may have been slighlty more dumbed down. Should you buy this game. Yes, but only if you don't have F1 2013 or you are hardcore.","May 1, 2015","true","63.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure it is basically a reskin for f1 2013 graphics wise but there are some things I really like about the game. I have 2 mods running on it which makes the damage more realistic and the AI more realistic. It makes it a good challenge to beat someone like Lewis even on lesser difficulties. I feel like this game is closer to F1 2012 handling wise. In F1 2013 I slide around a lot and had trouble finding grip anywhere but like in F1 2012 Its just a better game. The one downside is in career mode you can start with any team you want and not just a few low teams. If you do buy this game please add a few mods and have fun.

Perhaps it is a placebo effect, but the handling and controls feel matured, closer to what I experience when I play a more sim oriented game like Game Stockcar Extreme. The track was pretty close, the car handled as I expected, and I was able to catch her in time to prevent spinning it where I expected to have to catch her and even when I didn't expect it she gave a split second warning that could be countered effectively.\n\nYes, you can accuse Codemaster's of rehashing their engine ad nausea and simply pushing out a new F1 game every season, but they are refining their game. Each season looks better and with the odd exeption the handling is improving. The problem is that F1 2010 is still a very good game and if you don't care for the latest season there might be too little incentive to get the next game in line. Now I tend to wait for a good discount (pre-release or as with 2014 the first time I catch it on Steam).\n\nBut if you are like me, well each installment has its value and I keep switching between games - 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 (classic content especially - from the 70-ies to the early 2000s) and now 2014.\n\nF1 2014 is a racing game that will do the job for most F1 fans and worth a spin if you are not.\nAt a discount it is a no brainer if you like racing games on the sim side.","December 28, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of people who want to get on the yearly Madden boat with F1 games decided to put a lot of similarities between '13 and '14. Yeah, they are similar, but vastly different. Codies said that '14 didn't have a lot of effort put into it because of their focusing efforts on making F1 2015. Apperently not enough effort. '14 is the best F1 game for PC, and so far, '15 is your only choice on new-gen consoles.\n\nSo what changed? Well, several new tracks come in, both brand new and returning to the '14 season. Sochi, in Russia, Bahrain, under the night lights, and Austria's Red Bull Ring (formerly A1 Ring) and Germany's Hockenheimring come back. These tracks fun to drive. Also, the physics have changed due to engine and body changes, which will stir up some changes. The Young Driver Test has been removed in favor of an Evaluation Test that is 1 lap around Monza, which can be skipped. I would've liked the YDT to come back though due to potiential newbies to F1 racing, but to make it skippable.\n\nExcept for the tracks and handling changes, your standard features are still here. You have your standard Grand Prix mode to run single races or full race weekends. You then have your Career mode, that has been changed to allow you to join your team of choice right away instead of working from the bottom. You can choose to run a 7 race, 12 race, or 19 (full) race championship. Then you have your multiplayer options to play online, split-screen, or LAN play. I couldn't say anything about multiplayer because I play alone at home, and plus the online is a ghost town. I really want Codemasters to use their RaceNet hub system to allow for cross-platform play, but maybe that's out of their reach. Then you have Proving Ground, which is your challenge mode. Then finally you have My F1, which is just fancy for saying 'Settings'.\n\nAll in all, 2014 is the greatest so far in the form of PC F1 games, since '15 is very buggy, has broken wheel support, and special for PC, game crashes. At least '14 can run a wheel well. I haven't tried it with the G27, but I'd assume it would work.\n\n9/10 Same as '13 in a lot of areas, but why fix what isn't broken. Put on some different toppings and you get F1 2014.","October 24, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(McLaren all day here)  This game is just straight up racing fun. Minor issue is if you have 2013 and you are not a diehard fan like me, then don't get 2014 until a sale hits.  But if you are a diehard, or love the new cars, then by all means get it.","July 26, 2015","true","78.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
