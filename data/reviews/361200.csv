The CONCEPT of the story is very cool.\n\nAll that said, I am kind of offended as to how little research the developers did into the actual Coast Guard. I was in the Coast Guard. Its nothing like this. This is more like the story of the most well funded, die hard auxilarists the world has ever known.\n\nAlso special mention has to be given to the script and voice acting. I think the developers voiced this themselves in their house and had to keep their voice down because the kids were asleep or something. It's "Jill Sandwich" bad.\n\nAll that said, I'm enjoying the game and am impressed with the branching storylines (complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as some of them are) So this gets a tentative thumbs up, only if it is on sale.\n\nIf someone took this and threw a heapload more time and money towards it, we would have an exceptional gem\n\nSemper Paratus","October 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","62","67","6","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/361200/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account","**CAUTION!!: This game is only "cautiously recommended" as it scores right on the border!**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Coast Guard" is another one of these games that I knew nothing about until I received an email from one of my awesome PR contacts who told me a bit about the game and offered a review code for me to give it a bit of coverage. Of course, I don't keep abreast on every latest game, and so it's normal for some to fall between the cracks, but overall sometimes it's a good thing - I like finding surprise gems to try out. Add to this the fact that the game claims to be about the "coast guard," and I really wanted to give it a go.\n\nRight off the bat I should say that the game really isn't about the Coast Guard as most of us would think about it. From what I can gather after having played a bit of the game, this "coast guard" seems more like a civilian auxilliary at best, or maybe a privatized maritime security group operating at the behest of some fictional country or another. The flag, while at first glance appearing to be a U.S. flag, is actually just an orange and black striped flag. And there is other incidental evidence that says they are not a military group. So, this disappointed me a bit.\n\nThis game also isn't a "simulator" of any kind, really. To be honest, I'd classify it as a narrative action-adventure, which revolves around Finn Asdair and his crew and cohorts as they venture into the waters to stop smugglers and traffickers. It's really a mixture of different gameplay types. At times, you'll be navigating the waters on a clipper rescuring victims out at sea. Sometimes you'll be delivering someone to a destination or using the boat to board another vessel or location. Other times, you may be putting out fires with the hoses on your main vessel or interrogating a suspect in a maritime criminal operation.\n\nThe story at first is a bit confusing with how it drops you into things, but it starts making sense pretty quickly. Essentially, in the "present day," Finn is trapped aboard a "ghost ship" and is trying to figure out why he is there and how he can get off of it. There is some basic exploration and simple puzzle-solving that needs to happen during this phase of the game, but as he discovers interactable clues, the game will send the player into flashbacks that tell the back story of Finn and his operations and how he got to the predicament in the present.\n\nThe game's story is pretty interesting, at least to me. And I definitely find that the game has a pretty good soundtrack. The gameplay itself is decent enough, despite some bugginess and frustrating controls at times (particularly during the rescue mode on the clipper), but I was able to power through that enough to not totally detract from this game's score.\n\nThe game is good in places, yet flawed in others. The graphics (particularly on the character models) need work in places and the controls can be frustratingly-buggy in the maritime segments. The voice acting is very hit and miss. Some of it sounds like it was recorded during a 2:00 AM Skype call when people needed to try not to wake their family members up, and other parts simply have no emotion behind them. Yet, some of the actors (most likely people on the dev team or their friends/family) did a decent enough job and carried their parts well. It's too bad that Finn himself is so unemotional and boring, though.\n\nI question little things like why the "Director of Coast Guard Operations" would need to be manning a small clipper on his own to rescue victims out at sea, rather than on some large vessel or at an operations center on the mainland. Even if this coast guard is a para-military group that is a privatized security company, someone of that level/rank would not need to be out in the field.\n\nYet, in the end, Coast Guard does deliver in its mission to tell a good narrative story. It presents some interesting gameplay features (I like the different modes of play during your maritime operations, all the camera views, etc.), even if some of the execution is very poor or extremely flawed in places. It's ultimately the story, the ideas, and the soundtrack that save this game and give it the score I'm giving it.\n\nIt's borderline, though, so beware...Whether this one is worth getting or not depends on your personal tastes. Me? I'd only pick it up if you get it during a good Steam sale or as part of a bundle.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to 10, where a 5 represents a "true average," I give this game a:\n\n---------------------------------------\nAVERAGE...... 5 / 10\n---------------------------------------","November 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

No denying I enjoyed the majority of it. The game has real potential, and the different elements mixed together do work very well - sure, the first person sequences are rough and require work, and there's bugs galore, but there's the essence of a great game in here.\n\nUnfortunately the simple lack of a basic save system meaning you pretty much lose everything once you stop playing unless you're lucky enough that you passed a (unidentifiable) checkpoint means the game is basically alpha and not fit for public release.\n\nDoors which don't actually work properly, to interface elements which simple haven't been playtested properly, this is a game in early development which has evidently been released in borderline alpha state.\n\nShame really, it really is a good game underneath the hood, but unfortunately it's rather broken and stops you enjoying it as much as you'd want to.\n\nPolish it more and this is a definite yes, but as it stands it's just too rough to justify the cost - if it had been early access I'd have been infinitely more forgiving.\n\nCome back when you've done more work on the game, fellas.","October 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"
