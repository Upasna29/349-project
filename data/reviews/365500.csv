Either you in or either you're out, but if you're in, you'll really be in...\nAnd second, because it made me have this particular feeling that I wasn't playing the game, but the game was playing with me.\n\nI'm still trying to beat the third song, but the first time I played it, I couldn't help to smile ridiculously because this music and these colors made me soooo happy.\n\nThis game is full of joy, and the last song is like ecstasy.\n\nThe only drawback is that you may become dependent really fast.\nThere is only three songs at the moment, and once you're done with them, you'll be craving for more. But the developer said he was working on this...","May 14, 2015","true","12.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I love everything about it. The only bad thing about it it starting out, it is very difficult, but it is addictive. I would suggest a buy from anyone who likes rhythm based games or a good challange. I myself am still a noob at the time of writing. I also wish the dev woukd add stuff like customize-able backgrounds like pick your own color. all in all this is a great game and would reccommend to a friend.\n\nAny customers reading this, it for have about $4.34 USD, buy this game.","July 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So, here are my first impressions.\n\nI'm a big fan of Rhythm and Music-Based games. When I started, I was very confused as to what I was supposed to do. But as I experimented more and more, I realised how difficult it was going to get.\n\nThe gameplay is very unique. Focusing on the position of the small square while keeping in-line with the beat of the song makes for a great challenge, and each new animation that comes up just gets you nervous until you can get over it.\n\nI can tell this is gonna be a wild ride. To the dev, more levels would be nice, but I read you're already on that. This game has TONS of potential, and I hope you realise that. Please continue to improve upon it.\n\nI 100% recommend quadrant.\n\n","December 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Wherever the "little box" is, that's the next button to press. The "Big Box" moves to the location of the button you're supposed to be pressing. Make sure you hit the button at exactly the same time as you hear the "beat". Too early, and it counts as a mistake of the last "beat". Hesitate, and your rating will be poor.\n\nJust when you start to do well, the game starts changing colors, altering animations, and jittering like crazy. The first animation shift hit me like a brick wall every time; Here I am without even a half hour of game time or a single level under my belt, and already the game is trying to throw off the controls and rhythm that I'm still struggling to learn.\n\nThe music is good, which is crucial for a title like this. Workshop support seems interesting, though I haven't played any custom levels yet.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game: It's like the sadistic lovechild of Super Hexagon and Bop It, conceived on a bed of nails. I think "relaxing" is a bit of a stretch, but it's definitely a game that puts you in "The Zone". If you can persist long enough to work out how the game is actually supposed to be played, I think there's a real gem here.","August 19, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most rhythm games on steam these days don't actually require you to do anything in time to the music - like AudioSurf or all the twin stick shooters, they just have music as a focal point. This game actually requires you to stick to the beat and keep track of which button to press next amidst a bunch of distractions. And the music is quite good too - there are only three levels, but it has workshop support and you can download more.","September 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Theres no comfortable way of playing this AT ALL, and it's just.. Way too confusing, if you would've been able to actually click the tiny square inside of the box, that would've been a MUCH better thing..\nSecond problem: Whenever i make some changes in the settings, exit the game and reboot, it NEVER remembers my settings. Always starts in full screen, Always shows the epilepsy warning even though I changed it too "OFF", it's like.. There useless..\nI'm sorry but I just can't reccomend it, it's just very hard to find good controls and isn't really that.. y'know.. fun..\n\nP.S oh hey, first person to not reccomend this, great.","June 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","3"
