This seems to be the final state of the game. I'll treat it as that in my review then.\n\nCaribbean Odyssey is a pseudo 2D action adventure with a pirate setting. You play as Captain Henry Morgan (yep, the one from the spiced rum bottle). After a brief introduction to the controls you arrive in a tavern in Port Royal to meet the first NPCs and the first bits of horrible voice acting. The setting itself isn't bad. The graphics work, but are far from great. The gameplay mechanics and animations though lack. They aren't horrible either, just not good. The voice acting though is really bad.\n\nGiven the 10$ price and the slightly below average presentation paired with stereotypical writing and the most amateurish voice acting I've heard in a game for a while, I can't recommend the game unless it's really cheap or part of a bundle.","December 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","0"

Oh how I was wrong.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice and that is probably the only redeeming feature. What we have is a game full of bugs from the off, terrible voice work, dull swordfights, lack of free movement and ridiculous situations....oh...and did I mention the bugs? Gee, how can this be on sale for such a price!\n\nSo, after the nice opening screen we are deposited onto a jetty with the instruction of getting to the inn.\nThe first thing you notice is the lack of instructions for controls. They weren't clear, but could be figured out without too much stress. Then you realise you can only walk left or right. there is absolutely no free movement at all, which is ridiculous at times. One instance is when you enter the inn and go upstairs through a kind of stairway leading to the middle of a landing, you can't walk around the hole making the stairway though there is a clear way...no, you have to jump it. So daft.\nNext issue is the voice work. The main character's voice is so horrendously contrived and what makes it even worse is when you die, and you die a lot, you have to suffer the same comments again and again just to get back to where you were.\nThen we have the fighting. There are two movements with a sword you can make and no skill involved at all. There is the possibility to throw rum bottles, but I couldn't get the keys to work properly and there is a pistol that is about as much use as a cap gun. And to see it says on the game page on Steam 'Amazing Sword Fights' really does take the p***.\nNext we have the absurd. Again in the inn, after a dialogue with what I assume must be the intended heroine, we are told that guards are coming for the character. So down we go into the main bar of the inn and kill two guards. Meanwhile nobody else in the inn is batting an eyelid. They are all (well 4 of them as that's all there are) continuing chatting and dozing while two guards are being killed 1 metre from them. Then the barman casually sells my character another bottle of rum. I mean....woooot?\nNow for the bugs. I kept getting trapped in mid walk with nothing happening. Only my characters little legs were wiggling and but he was going nowhere. At the same time the enemies were just standing in front of my character also doing nothing. Another bug example is when my character was on a horse and the instruction flashed up to press the spacebar to make it gallop. Well, the horse continued to walk incredibly slowly, but my character was doing the amazing by shooting into the air by 6 foot from the saddle of the horse, each time I pressed it.\n\n\nSo, as you can see, this game is an absolute rip-off and a waste of money and I would recommend everyone to steer well clear of it and GameIndica.","May 16","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
