Movement is choppy and jumping is outright bizarre... The game manages to be entertaining as a representative of its rough era though. Can't say the same about Arctic Adventure or Pharoah's Tomb.","May 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

One of the first games I recall playing as a kid, spent hours and hours of problem solving and frustration. Must have been 4 or 5 years old when I played this, I forgot it even existed. Weird pre-nostalgia feeling as I play it, totally awesome and unexpected. Thanks for making it available!","December 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Astronauts have been disappearing in ruins on Mars, and your job is to discover the secrets and rescue the survivors. Gameplay is quite different from the Nevada Smith series because many areas only become accessible after tripping invisible switches, and there are movable blocks. Having a changeable environment is a great twist. Your character has infinite lives, but it's still a good idea to save in case you get stuck somewhere and can't die. Poor collision detection makes some of the later levels more frustrating than necessary. Developed by Scenario Software, Todd Replogle misspelled the name of his own company, listing it as "Scenerio Software" on the title page! There are 20 levels in each volume, which must be played sequentially because there is no map screen. There are 4 volumes in this game, with only the first volume playable in the shareware version.","February 20","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/watheanum/recommended/358240/","watheanum","W.A. the Anum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/watheanum/","489 products in account","Monuments of Mars plays somehow /somewhat like "Pharaoh's Tomb" - just better since its..."playable". So you can give this game sure a try and should avoid Pharaoh's Tomb, if you are going to play Monuments of Mars.\n\nThe Hitboxes are better, the riddles more fun and the gameplay itself doesnt feel "that bad".\n\nStill Nowadays more or less a "Timewaister" and you should maybe play it only for the "retro" feeling since its aged badly...","April 18","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So you have to make your way to the exit but every level gets a bit more challenging. Either its aliens, laser guns shooting at you, other lasers (or electricity, it depends), spikes or other traps, you should survive it all. And also think your way out in order to open closed gates or use moving platforms wisely. And that's pretty much it.\nAnd the control is very basic and easy, so no complaint about that.\n\nSure, it looks very dated and barely even has sound but if you like playing games like this one for nostalgia and don't feel bothered by all this you can get some nostalgic, cool sci-fi entertainment out of this.","May 5","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
