Except it's even better this time: three times the Rufuses, three times the chaos. Do yourself a favour and get this game if you've played the first two, because it's not only the grand finale, it's probably also the best game in the series. If you HAVEN'T played the first two... Well, go read my recommendations for Deponia and Chaos on Deponia instead then!\n\nEDIT: After some consideration, I think I should make special mention of that one specific part of the game. If you've played it you know the one. It's the one joke that is just absolutely not funny, and where I think the devs definitely stepped over the line of what is okay and what is not. It left a sour taste on what is otherwise a funny series. However, I still recommend it for all those other moments.","October 21, 2013","true","14.4"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","48","62","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/241910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The final chapter of developer Daedalic Entertainment's award-winning point-and-click adventure series is sadly coming to a close. Goodbye Deponia completes the trilogy following the exploits of one of the most hilarious antiheroes ever to grace the gaming scene. Since the first game, Rufus has failed in every attempt to escape the garbage world of Deponia and enter a life of luxury on the floating spaceship city called Elysium. Does Goodbye Deponia finally see our "hero" achieve his dream? Well, no spoilers here. You'll have to finish the story and see for yourself.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that Goodbye Deponia keeps the exact gameplay formula from the past games, but cranks up the insanity to stratospheric levels. I wouldn't have thought it possible after some of the jaw-dropping moments found in the second game of the series, Chaos on Deponia. After all, we saw Rufus offer a shoe to a homeless person to eat, purposely get our leading lady Goal struck by lightning, and knowingly had baby dolphins chopped up and processed into cans of tuna.\n\nI kept wondering whether Goodbye Deponia would finally see Rufus mature, and even find his moral center. Nope. Rufus is just as egotistical, self-congratulatory, and selfish as ever, with a horseshoe shoved firmly up his ♥♥♥♥. At times, you'll be ashamed at yourself for laughing at some of his pranks, but it's impossible not to. The scriptwork in this final chapter is absolutely flawless, and delivered pitch perfect by the veteran cast of voice actors.\n\nBut it's not just Rufus and his antics that deliver a gold-star performance. The entire ensemble is crafted with loving care, each character with their own personality that after two games you will have found yourself emotionally attached to: Doc as the master tinkerer that Rufus is always trying to belittle, Bozo and his pacifist nature, even Rufus' snobbish "twin" Cletus, whom you're never quite sure who's side he's on. And lest we forget Goal, whom Rufus tries to charm to no end, who is more adorable than ever... you'll see why.\n\nAs a point-and-click adventure game, Goodbye Deponia follows all the standard conventions. Gameplay consists of jaunting through areas, searching for items to pick up and interact with, with puzzles scattered around that require solving in order to advance the story. However, the Deponia series crashes through conventional realism barriers due to the nature of the story and the idea that any item can be plausibly accepted by the player since the action occurs on a planet comprised of trash. Thus, Goodbye Deponia requires you to think outside of the box... way outside. Any obtainable object can be placed in Rufus' coat pockets, no matter the size, whether it's a living creature or an open flame. These objects can sometimes be combined to create new items.Characters help at impasses by retaining any conversation options that provide hints to solving the particular dilemma.\n\nVisually, Goodbye Deponia is as gorgeous as ever. It's not so much a technical improvement over the last two games, but rather a clear sense of style and creativity that comes from Daedalic's artist, and the dedication that goes into each hand-drawn scene. The background animations in each area depict the dilapidation of the garbage world, although the actual travel of each character has set animations that at times feels out of place.\n\nThe music and sound effects feel genuine to the backdrop. Everywhere you go there are oddly constructed gadgets and poorly maintained appliances that fizzle, rattle, and chug along. The ambient music is filled with industrial-style synthesized beats, all very appropriate to the scene. And of course, the break in between each chapter is one I eagerly look forward to, where our banjo-playing bard of a narrator regales us with a jovial recap of the action and the manly chorus closes it out, followed by an epic orchestral climax\n\nI apologize for anyone hoping for more tidbits about the story itself, but as the final chapter in a cult-inducing series, I have little doubt that fans will want to experience each sidesplitting moment of Goodbye Deponia for themselves. It is a great finish to a truly original tale, and a trilogy that anyone not already familiar with the series should absolutely purchase and enjoy. The only tragedy of Goodbye Deponia is that it truly is the final farewell to all our friends on Deponia.","October 9, 2015","true","13.0"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","32","37","3","0"

The game itself is definitely worth playing. It was a fantastic title and a fitting piece of media for those that played the other two titles. I'm giving it a no in recommendation because of the ending.\n\nThis is similar to Mass Effect 3. The creators' desire to have this out-of-the-box ending ended up ruining my love for the whole franchise. Instead of giving us the tv tropes ending we were hoping for, they decided it'd be better to have this open-ended depressing conclusion that makes you want to eat fecal matter to wash out the taste.\n\nShould you play it as a fan of Deponia? It depends. Are you playing it for the humor and the puzzles and don't really care for an ultimate happy conclusion? If so go for it.

Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!\n\nOverview: Goodbye Deponia is the third and last game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium. Well, if you played the previous game, you know now he wants to save Deponia, too. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.\n\nPros:\nThe interface is really great and easy to navigate, including the new feature of being able to control 3 characters during a fairly long part of the game, switching between them and exchanging items\nThe story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way\nGood length for an adventure game, probably the longest in the series\nThe puzzles are really nice in general--the game provides you a few not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. I think you can do it without a guide, if you can deal with some frustration that helps you forward.\nCharacters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some "role play", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles.\nGreat voice acting\nThe 2D graphics are really amazing\nThe BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songs\nCons:\nDefinitely the least playtested/polished of the three games. There are a few minor mistakes in the speech, subtitles, translation, and even some small not-game-breaking bugs, like when I manage to make Rufus remain small when moving closer to the camera\nThe puzzle scenes close to the ending dragged, and they kinda lose the hand on controlling the climax, and, ultimately, the ending was not much satisfying\nThere were some parts of the game that didn't seem well thoght-out. For instance, you can go through a long quest in which you have to use something like 6 or 7 items in order to obtain another item, which you still don't know the use for. Others were sheer trial and error that didn't make much sense to me, even in hindsight (but the overall balance is still positive)\nBought on: Steam Store for R$ 6,24 (US$ 4.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.\n\nVerdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia, then go through Chaos on Deponia before playing Goodbye Deponia, or else it won't make much sense.","January 20, 2015","true","16.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/241910/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","The Series Continues!\n\nDeponia has been great, from start to finish. Which is something I’m happy to be able to say. There is nothing worse than a franchise that gets progressively worse the more sequels that are released. The Deponia series has managed to remain interesting and new.\n\nFirst off, I have to admit this game wasn’t exactly what I expected for a number of reasons but none of which knocked points off. Despite any feelings at the time of playing through it I would still say this is one of my favourite point and click adventure series of all time.\n\nStory wise, it was definitely enjoyable. It took unexpected turns a few times which was great but the ending for me was a little questionable, or at least it felt that way at the time. I would be utterly lying if I said that it ended how I imagined it would.\nI’m ill and half brain dead at the moment so naturally… I got confused and I cried. As you do. But I would say it was just unexpected and in all honesty I’m not even sure I know what was going on. It wasn’t even necessarily bad or upsetting!\n\nI noticed a very subtle difference in language that was used in this one, the characters swear every now and again. It was a little bit of a shock the first time but it was actually really amusing the way they did it. The characters are as loveable as ever, both main characters and side characters. I especially like their re-use of more insignificant characters.\n\nVoicing, sound effects and music is pretty much the same throughout the series (you notice a jump up in quality from first to second but the third is pretty much the same as the second) but I think it fits well, you start recognising certain music to mean certain things to get you a little more engrossed or emotional over the situations in which they are used. Definitely doesn’t come across as lazy or recycling.\n\nAs always with point and clicks there is always places where you get stuck, or there is a somewhat un-logical solution to a puzzle that you come across that ends up being frustrating. Deponia manages to keep a good balance between the items you use together being creative but logical. I got stuck quite a lot during this third one I won’t lie. At one point you are controlling 3 different characters that can influence each other and maybe that is why I was having such a hard time. You are essentially playing 3 different point and click games at once. Maybe it’s just because I’m brain dead at the moment being ill, but I found this third game harder than either of the previous ones.\n\nAchievement wise, there is definitely a lot more in this one then there was in the last 2, or at least it felt that way. It took me a total of 18 hours to complete this game 100% and that includes about 2 and a half playthroughs. Admittedly I might have been able to do it in less if I was paying proper attention but I completed the game causally the first time around.\n\nQuick shout out to the chorus guys, a very charming part of the series being the singing between chapters. I always look forward to their songs. But all in all it’s a great game and a great franchise that I have come to be very fond of. I’d say definitely go for it.\n\n\nTL;DR : A great end to the series. Engaging story, fun puzzles, great humour, wonderful art, loveable characters, good music/other media and easy to 100%. It’s a done deal!\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/214340\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Chaos on Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/220740/","November 23, 2014","true","18.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","4"

It seems like the ONLY black woman in the series, is used in a cruel manner by the main protagonist. I wish there were alternative solutions to these puzzles.

And, the opportunities they had to develop these characters more, for us to see them thrive and gain more through their experiences, to grasp the reality of their situation, then to grow wiser as a result, was all missed. At its core, all the characters are static. Rather than growing and being the preferable dynamic characters they should have been, they learn nothing and remain the same. It really is a shame, because all these characters are so likable and interesting. Instead of development, we had been given an abrupt ending that very poorly tried to end the series with an open note, but absolutely failed to do so.\n\nThe gameplay is improved, however. The first section is very well-done, and I found myself enjoying it far more than any other part of the series thus far. As the game went on, it became progressively more cryptic and difficult, but still managed to maintain a somewhat fresh twist on the point-and-click formula. The settings and environments remain beautiful, and the animation never failed to impress.\n\nThe Deponia series, despite its shortcomings, proved to be a very memorable trilogy of games filled to the brim with a sense of wild imagination that spurred my mind alive. It possessed additional potential that could have propelled it to become a true classic, but as it stands, I feel it is still well-worth your time if you're even remotely interested in this type of genre.\n\nEdit done due to a minor grammatical error in the review.","April 28, 2014","true","8.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

It's lengthier than the previous offerings so there is a great deal more to do, some locations from the previous games are revisited albeit in the form of different areas of those places. and most importantly Rufus, is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is not nearly so callous as in the previous games, a final recognition of his  character development. HOwever As for Argus and Cletus, well once again Daedalic fail somewhat there, in fact the largest rub I've had with the Deponia games is the lack of true understanding of their characters psychology. Daedalic tend to go for gags and tropes with the characters there to fill in the holes. This is unfortunately very apparent. It's a pity the writers have focused on the humour more than on their character motivations, it does seem to be improving however as they have gained in experience through the series.\nThe bizarre Piers Anthony humour still abounds, and the game has a plethora of pop culture references to find and discover.\nThe quirky art style is still just as appropriate to the underlying themes, and the vibrant, mechanisticly lush environments are as wonderful as ever. The music (much of it rehashed from previous games) is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. As for the Chorus Guys... well their lyrics are still just as awkward to try and "sing"...\n\nOverall I will recommennd the game, however it needs to be played with Deponia and Chaos on Deponia as well, so if possible try buy it as a part of a package deal, and not standalone.","September 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

The first game in the series was pretty enjoyable, if a little short, and the art style and setting were unique enough to allow me to get past the loathsome main character.  The second game was maybe a little better, with better puzzles at least, and I really looked forward to the final game in the series.\n\nBut it was terrible.  Start to finish, this game was terrible.  The puzzles were contrived, overly complicated, and all but required a walkthrough to complete.  A good adventure game has some logical connection between different puzzles, with items that conceivably could be combined or used together to move the character further along the story.  If that's what you're looking for, look someplace else.\n\nWell if the puzzles were bad, maybe the story was good?  Nope.  I won't spoil anything, but an interesting twist revealed about halfway through has no real implication on the ending - despite the world-changing ramifications of it, all it amounts to is an excuse to make puzzles more convoluted.  The main character, Rufus, only becomes more obnoxious and disgusting as the game goes on until you're just left feeling filthy for having helped it all happen.\n\nAnd the ending.  Don't listen to the people who talk about redemption, about "people only wanting a happy ending", or any of the other long-winded explanations for why this is a good ending.  It isn't.

To be honest, when I finished Chaos on Deponia I simply didn't want to believe I was about to finish a so far amazing trilogy. I had a lot of fun with Goodbye Deponia, and it's probably my favorite in the trilogy. There is just one thing about the game that I cannot stand but I am sure that everybody has previously mentioned. The ending. I just finished the game about 10 minutes ago and I really don't know what to say about the ending. I'll summarize the ending with 2 words; BULL. ♥♥♥♥. I really dislike the ending of this game, I was really starting to enjoy it. Especially after the speech and the Organon hymne, but nonetheless the ending is complete and utter crap for a game this good.\n*SPOILERS*\nSo basically, after Argus, Cletus, and Rufus are all stuck in the Rotor, Goal comes and is confused (of course) of which one she should save cause the 3 all look alike\nFirst of all I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\nWhile Cletus and Argus may look very similar\nRufus is more tan, doesn't have a goatee like Cletus and Argus but I digress.\nGoal ends up saving Cletus letting the real Rufus fall.\nLike ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me?\nBut anyway for an ending of a single game I might accept this, but for an ending to a TRILOGY? Where you're definitely not going to make another game in the series? No. Absolutely not.\nDespite this ending I am really sad to see this series go. It was a fun ride throughout it.\nI recommend Goodbye Deponia, BUT only after playing the first 2 games because you'll have absolutely no idea what is going on.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nPros: Pretty much everything, the graphics, the soundtrack, the humor, the colorful cast of characters, the locations, the unique puzzles, the drama.\n\nCons: The ending. If you loved the game throughout the whole journey, you'll be a bit disappointed\n\nI'm honestly sad and surprised to have ended this series\nOnly thing I can say now is\n\nHuzzah, I'm off now, goodbye!\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: After now thinking about it, I don't dislike the ending as much as I did when I first viewed it. If anything, the ending just gets me choked up because of the music at the end reminding me how much fun I had with the trilogy. Overall, I still recommend the game, but don't expect a happy ending because the whole trilogy had sad endings, this one being the saddest hitting you like a truck when you actually realize that Rufus did and DIDN'T deserve to be on Elysium because frankly, he was an ♥♥♥, but throughout the games, he did all that he could but people still doubted him and trash talked him, and when he was just a jump from Elysium he sacrificed himself, just so he could give his "friends" a better life, just so he could prove them wrong, like Goal said, there were so many opportunities where he could've gone to Elysium with her but he didn't. Just because he cared too much about his fellow Deponians, so in the end he sacrificed it all, so he didn't get to Elysium after all, so what? I mean we were all hoping it but as I've heard from other fans of the games they have said that Daedelic games always have unhappy endings, but hey that's just what I've heard, if you want to find out for yourself, buy the first game and try it out, as for me, I still whole heartedly recommend the trilogy and it is a fantastic series that I will always hold close to my heart.\nI just hope Daedelic gives some closure on wheter Rufus survives or not, granted he did fall from a huge distance into a pile of needles and survived but I digress.

Like it's predecessor's, the game looks gourgeous and is accomppanied by a pretty good soundtrack. However, looks aren't everything and It's sad to say that the game lacks in both the story and in it's gameplay.\n\nThe puzzles, for the most part are pretty selfexplanatory. For the most part. The game still has some annoying parts in which you are pretty much forced to try everything with anything, before you can comprehend the strange logic of the designer. Escpecially the last third is riddled with this kind of gameplay, when you are in control of three different Rufus's.\n\nSpeaking of Rufus, he's still the most annoying main character I've ever seen in a point'n'click game. He's outright obnoxius and overall unpleasant human being, with no regard for others (except Goal, of course), and same can be said for the writers.\nThe script contains borderline racist/feminist undertones, and has more than few characters whose lives are destoyed so completely, that it left me with an honest resent against the writers. And don't even get me started on that ending...\n\nThe game is also riddled with gameplay bugs and audiovisual glitches. I ran in to a game breaking glitch not once, but TWICE!\nAt the first part of the game when I'm supposed to extract certain things from a suitcase, the game simply denied it. I could not open the suitcase, thus forcing me to start from the beginning (previous save didn't matter, the problem wouldn't go away). The second time was at the last third. You are supposed to fire a cannon to distract  certain people from singing. It worked at first, or at least I thought so. The singing stopped but it wouldn't let me move past them. So I exited the scene and came back, only to find that the people were once again singing, and no matter what I did, I couldn't break the loop.\n\nOverall, the game falls flat, just like it's predecessors. In all honesty, the only reason why I even picked  this game up was the fact that I wanted to finish the story, and although they made some improvements to the quality of the puzzles (with some exeptions), the finished product feels rushed and unpolished.

He also is responsible for the deaths of a group of orphan children that he comes across, and feeding a baby an entire bottle of anti-depressant drugs. At the end he is also finally responsible for the death of his biggest fan, who jumps off the Highboat when Rufus falls.\nOverall, this game was a massive let down, and the ending to the plot made it even more of a waste of time, as the eventual result could have been achieved by just letting Cletus and Goal return to Elysium in the very first game, but many more lives would have been saved in the process.\n\nIf you love the Deponia series - Do.

If you are interested in the series, look at the Deponia 1 reviews or the complete trilogy and if you liked the last two game and want to have a complete experience, buy this one. K? K.\n\n[SPOILS]\nThe first three chapters of the game were great, thought the whole clone thing was far-fetched at first but I ended up accepting it and it did make from some interesting puzzles later on. Speaking of “interesting puzzles” later on in the game, how about that section where you have to get a print of a “fluffy bunny” and the actual pedophile you get it from. Or perhaps the part where you have to separate Goon and June, recruiting June into a job as a “monkey” (without much to wear…) for money, brainwashing Goon for burritos which you use to keep children warm, in the open mouth of a slime monster who specializes in eating children. Oh yeah, and the shop selling rope next to a therapist’s office and load of suicide jokes that come with it. I knew Rufus was manipulative, rude, and egotistical but, damn dude! I’m fine with some dark humor but that took me by surprise. Up until this part of the series that games have been pretty PG.\nI feel like the ending was fine. I would’ve really liked to see Rufus make it even though that would’ve been a somewhat boring and predictable ending. To have his character change and choose selflessness was a bold move.\nStill that doesn’t quite leave me satisfied. There are still a ton of loose ends like Elysium’s inevitable crash into Deponia, the cloning factory or Cletus is posing as Rufus (for the press? Not really too sure why that is nessesary). There is a ton they could go off, after all we haven’t had a Deponia game where any puzzles take place on Elysium. Also, Rufus is not dead, he’s fallen from high up before and survive just fine and since terminal velocity is a thing and the fact that it’s Rufus It’d be pretty easy to by him surviving. But I guess he wouldn’t become a sort of martyr. Either way, I think there’s a discussion group about ideas for “Deponia 4” so you can check that out for some more interesting ideas. Sorry for being too stubborn to accept the end of a trilogy, it’s just hard not to want more closure about some events even if it’s really not necessary.","November 29, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm not going to review it in detail, but make some generic comments about the 3 games.\n\nThe best thing in the whole series is the main character. When you think Rufus can't get crazier or more offensive, he walks the extra mile; in this one, among other things, he shows an indifference to children (well, that Rusty was a little annoying indeed)that must be shocking to most people. The way he gets to other people's nerves (specially Toni and Bozo _ I missed Wenzel ) is hilarious. And what about what he does to poor Goon and June? And the hommage to Donkey Kong?\n\nI also love the ragged bard's appearances, introducing the chapters with well written lyrics (with very irregular metric _ reminded me of some songwriters from my country, like Jorge Ben and Edgard Scandurra). The games are really funny and the voice actors are great. The puzzles and minigames... some of them are so out there that you'll probably will have to resort to a walkthrough once in a while. The same can be said for quite a few of the achievements (specially the ones that demand that you do something really stupid for at least 10 times); I doubt someone can get all of them in a single playthrough.\n\nIf you're a fan of point and click adventures, this trilogy is a no brainer.

And forgive me my poor English.\nSimply put: if I knew beforehand that the ending of this series was this lousy I would've never bought even a single part of it. I wouldn't recommend to buy this series of games for those, who would like to play for an interesing story with pleasant ending, though despite the ending all three games are interesing indeed. I can even tolerate the fact, that you have no other choice, but to act as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing some evil deeds around you not only unintentionally, but also deliberately. I could event tolerate all bugs and crashes of this series. But the ending is terrible. (Here comes the spoilers): Basicaly, the protagonist dies(presumably) and the antagonist gets the girl. Who the hell would think that this is a great idea to end a three-parted series of adventure games? I love the psychological and philosophical challenges of all Daedalic game plots I've seen so far (which also includes Memoria aside from Deponia trilogy), I like how in the end you always face some unpleasant decision, like (here's the spoiler for Memoria) to make your loved one stay with you without her being happy or to lost her, leaving her happy, considering that she completely forgot you and doesn't love you anymore, but why the hell am I supposed to enjoy the ending that kills off main character, who was desperately trying to make his life better and was constantly struggling against all the problems that came in his way? He certainly didn't get what he wanted. He was stuck with not a choice, but yet another problem, and the only solution was to literaly "let go" separating him from his love, killing him and making his loved one to go with not the one she loved. Total crap! I know that life is cruel, but why the hell am I supposed to be reminded of this fact in an entertaining game?","May 16, 2014","false","12.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

Having liked both previous game (the second less than I would have hoped, but still), I read many reviews before starting this one and when I saw the four major complaints (which I will explicit afterwards), I was scared of being utterly disappointed. Well, that would have been a mistake. Goodbye Deponia is a great game. I still prefer the first one, but this one is arguably better constructed/paced, funnier and ultimately more enjoyable. Now for the complaints (spoiler free-ish):\n\nThe puzzles are bad: The main issue with the second game was that it was damn near impossible to complete it with the sole hints the game provided. While playing the first act (which is moreover badly designed), my fears came true. You don't know what to do, how to do it and why you have to do it. At one point, the game even mocks you so, telling you that the solution is the least obvious one. Well, I insisted, took a walkthrough and moved on. Then, starting with act two (the "Hell" section), it got better and the puzzles, while more complex, were better designed and explained.\n\nThere is a racist segment about slavery: Yes, it exists. No, I didn't find it funny. No, it is not as bad as it seems. Rufus is a prick (sometimes a lovable prick, but still), it is explained why (not excused, far from it), so he does something horrible without thinking of the consequences and he's a d**k about it afterwards. If you exhaust every dialog option, you'll see that everything is not black or white (sorry for that one, but I had to)\n\nThere is a child molester: Yes, and Rufus tells some kids that it is okay to go into stranger's vans. As it happens, the children never go in, as they know better (morality is saved, yeahh). Afterwards, the joke (still not funny, I agree) is at Rufus' expense.\n\nThe ending is a downer/bad/not-the-ending-I-wanted: So the conclusion of the story is open-ended... Well, most people hate that, leaving to the imagination what could have been said. Those who would have liked the happy-ending with marriage and kids (which was unlikely knowing the protagonist) or something with less loose ends will be disappointed but it doesn't mean the ending is bad, or sad for that matter (if not for a pessimistic interpretation).\n","April 24, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Add in a little more of a solid storyline in this one, and the soundtrack was considerably better in my opinion.

But it’s worth it for the ending alone.\n\nLong version:Goodbye Deponia is somewhat of a rehash of the previous episode, Chaos on Deponia, in terms of story structure: yet again one of the main heroes (this time Rufus) is split into three, and you have to complete separate episodes for all of them to eventually progress in the main storyline.\n\nThe problem is that these sub-stories feel like reused, underdeveloped ideas from cancelled titles– for example the starting sequence in the hotel feels like if it is set in an entirely different universe. There is little connection between them, they are full of plot holes, and one of them is rendered pointless a minute after it is concluded. Not to mention that Rufus gets an origin story that is questionable at best, midichlorian level unnecessary at worst.\nThis stands in stark contrast with the last act, where the arcing plot reaches a surprising, clever, and fitting end. This takes up only a fraction of the story, but it is written so well the game is worth for this alone.\n\nThe puzzles are closer to the difficulty level of the first game; there is a new element in the form of item swapping between Rufuses (similar to Day of the Tentacle), but it is rarely used. The minigames offer more challenge, but they can be skipped here as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Goodbye Deponia cannot live up to the rest of the series, but strangely it provides an adequate conclusion that makes it recommended for anyone who went along for the ride this far.","June 10, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I think some of that is because it can be difficult to get into Rufus' sociopathic head:  Rufus cannot be redeemed - not even counting all the chaos he caused in the first two games - his actions lead directly to the (probable) death of children and breaking up a happy couple and then selling them into slavery.\n\nThat said, overall I would call this a good final romp in the world of Deponia.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjaofquest/recommended/241910/","ninjaofquest","ninjaofquest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjaofquest/","447 products in account","The final game in the Deponia Trilogy. The one that supposedly decides the fate of Rufus's home planet. The one that despite surprisingly offensive humor compared to the other two, somehow takes the cake for the best in the series. But it barely does so.\n\nAt first, i would've given this verdict to the second title in the series, Chaos on Deponia. That one is much more innocent and sophisticated in nature. The way the gamer gets to explore Goal's moods in her three separate personalities really helps to expand upon the plot of the series. In a sense, Deponia introduces Rufus, while Chaos on Deponia introduces Goal. These two are what got me interested in the storyline. Highly interested, in fact.\n\nNow, let me first state a point that I rarely involve myself deeply in a game's storyline and characters, much less follow them so intensely. This is coming from an RPG fan who has ventured through the lands of Skyrim on the XBOX 360, plays the once popular MMORPG RuneScape with all its lore-induced quests almost daily, and enthuses over almost every modern rogue-like on Steam.\n\nI may also add that the Deponia titles are the first true point-and-click games I have purchased. I look at the others and turn them down. I desire the thrill of gameplay that Skyrim or Diablo or even Binding of Isaac can give me. And yet, none of those could enthrall me as much as the Deponia series did.\n\nAt its core, this series is about a boy who chases a girl. A young, imperfect, self-centered, arrogant male, who chases the woman of his dreams, who happened to fall from the sky. Neither of these two would ever meet under normal circumstances. Everyone seems to be trying to split these two apart. The sheer fantasy of this is what originally stole my heart (and about 30 hours of my free time).\n\nI started Goodbye Deponia with the same hope that most other players had: that there would be a happy ending. I played through roughly half the game before I sought a walkthrough. That's when I noticed the common phrase "bad ending." Naturally curious, I decided to watch other gameplay from that point on.\n\nI spoiled the ending for myself. I was devastated that the game developers threw such a fatal twist. But yet, I continued my own playthrough. And arrived at the same ending. And was subsequently disheartened by that same ending.\n\nBut why should I give this a thumbs-up when the ending was this horrific? Simple: I wanted to know the answer to the questions. The questions that Deponia threw at us when it left. The problem is there will never be a Deponia 4. The developers have said this time and time again.\n\nSo why not create your own ending?\n\nYes, that's right, create your own ending. You may think how that would be possible, considering how the game only has a single path to completion. So why would you create your own ending? To hypothesize the answers to these questions and perhaps create a new ending.\n\nMany seem to dislike this ending. I am not saying they are incorrect; in fact, I also dislike how the series ended. But it also gave me inspiration. It allowed me to dream of an alternate ending in which everyone succeeded. That is the beauty of an open ending.\n\nThe question you might ask me is, "Why should I care?" My answer is this: If you have made it this far, you can see the end for yourself. And if you dislike it and want to change it, you too can dream an alternate ending. Heck, you could write an entirely new story. We, the fans, can create an alternate, happy ending. Rather than outright complaining about how the ending to Deponia was an absolute kick in the teeth and spreading hate, why not harness that negative energy into another, alternate ending? Or a new project in general?\n\nThe ending of Goodbye Deponia was not a good one. However, it was an inspirational one. We saw our hero, Rufus, never quit in achieving his Goal, despite any and all adversity. Despite his mishaps. Despite his egotism.\n\nHe simply never gave up. And in the end...he still didn't give up. And if you have watched the ending, perhaps Rufus won't give up then, either.\n\nThis entire series can perhaps convey the message that one should never give up. It's not over until it's over. You can do it. You can create another ending. You can achieve your Goal. You can.\n\nThis game, despite its abrupt ending, controversial humor, simple puzzles (compared to the first two), rambling dialogue, and descent from innocence into madness...is the best one in the series.\n\nI'm not saying you should buy this game, nor am I saying you should pass. I am simply describing a feeling of inspiration. If you want another opinion, read some of the other reviews. Read both positive and negative. Judge for yourself whether or not you want a poor ending. Watch some footage on YouTube. Heck, buy the first two titles, or the Complete Journey Edition, to see for yourself whether or not it is worth the trauma to continue the storyline for yourself.\n\nAll I am saying is no matter what, resist the urge to give up, and achieve your Goal.\n\n\nP.S. Why is this review not in Deponia: Complete Journey Edition? Well, I don't have that version. I just have the three standalone titles.","January 11","true","10.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No spoilers but it was a bummer, not that it did not have some redeemable heroic aspects for the ending and some mild closure, it left me wanting some specific things that I think we all would expect for Goal and Rufus' relationship. Somebody decided to opt for a more uncommon or "what if?" and slightly tragic ending, than what we were all looking forward to. Oh well...that being said, I did have some great humorous experiences from the three games, just don't get attached to any of the characters and expect something like you would see in the end of a interesing/humorous Japanese anime love story, that just never ends up right and most always ends up leaving the audience confused or wanting for a happier conclusion or a conclusion at all. Eye of Satinav series at least takes that aspect (and frankly values its audiences time more) into consideration for its players, and in the end they are more satified for it. Enjoy!  So I will recommend this game only for the aspect of storyline conclusion.","July 1, 2014","true","12.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is withought a doubt, the highlight of this installment along with the accompanying music, which is also likely the best soundtrack of the three in my opinion as well.\n\nEitehrway, if you really liked the previous ones, you should defintly get this one. If you haven't played any of them and you are considering this, I'd recommend catching up on the previous two before you do.

In fact, this game didn't just come close, it did the job perfectly. If you too played some of that last generation of 90s point-and-click games (Curse of Monkey Island, Toonstruck, Discworld) and want something that matches up to that greatness, then this game is it!\n\nSure, it has a few tiny issues (mostly translation issues from German to English), but these can be very easily forgiven since Daedalic got the mix of funny cynical charaters, story, puzzles, dialogue and story just right, picking up where these great games left off and drawing on everything that there is to be learned from them. If you like classic point-and-click game you WILL NOT be disappointed. They haven't fiddled with the genre or tried to bring it to thr touch screen like certain other devs have - they left perfection as it was, focussing instead on what matters in these kinds of games instead of trying to re-invent a genre which doesn't need to be re-invented.\n\nPerhaps the only thing I am annoyed with is no native Linux support and wished the devs would port this like they have with some of their other games. If you do use Linux, all three games run well on Wine - but obviously there is no guarantee or oficial support, so I would wait for a native version.","April 30, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game had a pretty interesting plot point in the middle, which could have been a turning point in character development, but they blew it for laughs. And those aren't really laughs either, just "oh noes" moments.\n\n(For example... Rufus finds some orphans, whom, in order to advance the game, you first have to send into the van of a paedophile, and then feed to a monster... I have no idea if there was a time and location where that counted as "funny", but it sure isn't now.)\n\nReally. The writing is a serious mess. The jokes are unfunny and sometimes downright insulting. And if you think "well Deponia is supposed to be like that", this game is totally nothing like the earlier ones. Really. Those were funny, most of the time. This is just, well, cringy. And the finale is completely off the bat, and does nothing to redeem Rufus, OR the writer.","May 29, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psppwner300/recommended/241910/","psppwner300","psppwner300","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psppwner300/","66 products in account","If I do have to say so myself, Goodbye Deponia was probably the least favorable in the series, but still good. If you take a look at the release dates of each game, you'll notice that Deponia and Chaos on Deponia are only a few months apart from each other. Goodbye Deponia, on the other hand, wasn't released until October of 2013, which was almost a year after Chaos was released. I don't know if the developer team lacked the interest to continue the series until fans persuaded them, or they maybe just ran out of resources, like ideas or characters or plot. In any case, you'll almost immediately know why when you play Goodbye Deponia.\n\nIt did have a good beginning, one that hooked the player's interest. Daedalic Entertainment took\nthe risk of stripping Goal to her bare underwear after Rufus holds on to her outfit while they are on the\nskyline heading towards the Organon cruiser, which was never introduced in the other two. They sit on this crane, trying to detach Bozo's cutter from the cruiser, which loosens itself off when Rufus\naccidentally found himself unscrewing the screws. The platform they were on all of a sudden detaches, moving at blazing speeds. Goal grabs the crane when it detaches from the platform while Rufus is holding on to her, in which the strip occurs and the two separate. Goal ends up endlessly spinning on a giant rotating axle. I mentioned that is was a risk because, although it would attract many male gamers, including myself (which, I will admit as my guilty pleasure, caused me to play the series in the first place), it might pose a threat to Daedalic's reputation, because the first two games in the series were known to not have those kind of elements. Oh, by the way, Goodbye Deponia resumes almost immediately from where it left off in Chaos, so Goal still has her split personality broken up into three cartridges. She acts as Lady Goal. Can you imagine if she was Spunky Goal that whole time? Hah!\n\nGameplay is just as traditional as it was in the first two: you play as Rufus, and your job is to\ncollect objects, combine them, and use them on other objects in order to advance the story. The puzzle elements, including its difficulty, are retained in this version. Sometimes the puzzles can get so frustrating to solve that you compromise, looking to an online walkthrough as a hope for finding the\nsolution, which, on more than one occasion, I had to rely on.\n\nI will also mention that Goodbye Deponia is to differ from the first two games because of its\ndarker, more depressing mood. Swears, although they appear as infrequently as the first two, are a little bit more provocative. There is a part where (spoiler alert) Rufus essentially kills Goal by accident by injecting a high dose of sodium-whatever through her heart. In Goal's last words, she utters, “I love Rufus,” while she has a twerky smile. They happened to be on the Organon cruiser when, after striking her, Rufus gets thrown overboard and lands into his own “hell,” which represents his hatred of himself in what he had done. It looks just like the tutorial stage. Rufus can actually insert the yin into the slot and, after pressing the button, you can see him getting crushed. A bit weird, huh?\n\nTo be frank, any attempt that the game made to make me laugh (which were many) were\nextremely few. The only time I remember giving a genuine “haha” is when Rufus is dressed like Cletus and he is trying to distinguish between himself and the real Cletus and another person, who is also disguised as Cletus. Rufus proves himself by saying to Goal, “I know what color underwear you're wearing,” or something along those lines, “you're wearing purple!”\n“How did you know?” she asks.\n“Uh, uh, because I saw you getting changed this morning!” like his typical responses. Otherwise, most of the other jokes were quite adult that I found no pleasure in.\n\nToward the end things get a little better, but by the time you complete the game (which is\nnoticeably shorter than the first two games), you're left frustrated because the conclusion was poorly\nput together, and you're left with so many questions that went unanswered. A couple of the major\nquestions I have is, how is Goal still alive? Why did baby Goal, after taking in the nucleic acid, transform into Donna? What happens to the real Rufus after he drops below the engine of the longboat heading to Elysium? Why did Rufus clone himself in the first place? Now that Goal has re-evaluated Rufus, is she still going to marry Cletus? As well as other questions that I have but are not on the tip of my tongue so I can't ask them now.\n\nIf you're a hardcore fan of the Deponia series, and you want to see the plot expand into ever-more\ncomplex events, then by all means, be my guest. I'm afraid, however, that it's probably not the way\nyou're going to expect it to develop the way you wanted it to be. I, for one, was hoping that the\nrelationship between Rufus and Goal was going to be more romantic in this one, and that the player\nwas going to be able to explore Elysium (or, what about playing as Goal?), but of course, something in the game always gets in the way to detract from the main objective, and Rufus ends up losing Goal\nanyway. The only time I've really seen any romantic element between Rufus and Goal in any of the\nseries is on Chaos, where Goal kisses Rufus not once, but twice (despite the fact that Cletus is her fiance?) So to label the series as “romantic” doesn't fit into it so much. To play this game, though, you had better finish Deponia and Chaos on Deponia first, because if you start with Goodbye Deponia, you'll be struck with extreme confusion. I do wish that this wasn't the end of the series.","January 15, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is really disappointing for a fan of the series. Yes, the game on the outside looks much like the other two games did. As I began to play the game there were a number of scenes that were very controversial in my mind that turned the once known light hearted humor into some very dark humor. This destroyed the story for me throughout the entire game and even the ending that I thought would be a good closure for the series way was not. I was left with more questions than I had for Deponia or even Chaos on Deponia (And yes it has been said that Poki does not plan on making a 4th game, something that I am actually thankful for). I guess many of the other elements to the game were similar to the first two, but in some ways I felt like the game designers tried too hard to make this out shine the first two, which ended up leading them to a pile of garbage! I still recommend the first game and the second for that matter. Unfortunately they made the second game like most games and movies that come in trilogies, where the story is intentionally left wide open in the second installment. And while all of the games appear to have some loose ends, the first game was clearly my favorite and the best ending of the three.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatperson/recommended/241910/","thegreatperson","Eyah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatperson/","7 products in account","This game is so frustrating on so many levels for it is very challenging to advance with the game. It took me more time than the first two Deponia games combined to finish. And I even replayed both gameplays! While I did enjoy the puzzles, I absolutely despised having to go through the agonisingly  e n d l e s s  dialogues. I progressed very little with the story that I considered myself lucky I stumbled upon random items, accidentally combine the items, even had to unintentionally switch the items in the inventory between the Rufuses. I admit I had to (constantly) look up walkthroughs to progress with the game.\n\nThe 3rd Deponia isn't as enjoyable as the 1st Deponia in terms of gameplay and storyline. In the first game, you're on board with the story of this egotistical narcissistic self-proclaimed "hero" saving his home and envisioning his life on some flying utopian city but in the third game, the story changes in a way that cheapens the efforts of the earlier games. The focal story is there: Rufus still needs to save Deponia from its impending doom but introducing the character Hermes into the story as their “creator” wasn't as meaningful as intended. It makes everything seem flexible; you can clone literally anyone. If you can cheat death by cloning, surely you can cheat doomsday by crafting another crummy Deponia-esque world.\n\nI was curious how Rufus and Goal were going to protect Deponia, since the two games have been relentlessly trying to accomplish that. So why not own the third game as well? At the start, I was neutral about the 3rd instalment, however the game drags on, and it just became repetitive, monotonous, and tiresome. Nevertheless, I actually liked the unorthodox ending. It shows Rufus’ development from a self-centred egomaniac to a somewhat altruistic noble hero.\n\n5/10 for gameplay – too much dialogue and hidden items but good puzzles (puzzles were simple enough to solve); 5/10 for story – did not fancy this Hermes and the cloning factory but has a nice enough ending to conclude the whole trilogy. Overall 5/10 – Kind of on the fence with this last one. While the first two were a lot more enjoyable than this, "Goodbye Deponia" still has some decent puzzles and ended the story on unconventional but refreshing terms.","January 1","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While not as strong as the first game, if you've followed the series this far, you will not be disappointed by the conclusion.\n\nAs is to be expected from Deponia, you follow the adventures of Rufus, an unlikable individual who manages to break everything around him, as he tries to now save Deponia from being blown up, maintain a barely healthy relationship with Goal, and not kill everyone around him.  The recurring characters are who they are, and if you like or don't like them, this game won't change anything, but that will mean the difference in if you laugh or cry when Rufus faces tragedy.  I don't like Rufus and laughed at him.  I did like his flawed humanity throughout the series though.\n\nThe writing and animation has improved a lot since Chaos on Deponia.  This also follows the translation where a lot more effort and reviewing has been put into it.  The developers knew they didn't want their series to fall down on its final moments and put the extra effort into making sure the final game went well.  Some of the jokes can fall from jovial to borderline offensive.  As an example, you break up an inter-racial couple and make the black woman in the couple take a job replacing an organ grinder's monkey.  Some of the events are engineered to make you feel less positive about Rufus or yourself.  While most of the game doesn't skirt that level of unfriendly, your mileage may vary with some of the humor.\n\nThe puzzles follow the same blend of narrative and dialogue puzzles they have in the past.  The difficulty at the start is not too bad, with the game reaching a high peak somewhere toward the middle.  Once you reach a certain point, the game rushes to the conclusion with the difficulty of the puzzles easing off and they become little more than pauses or intermissions in the narrative.  Much like the Chaos on Deponia, the game does use some puzzles which cause you to think outside the box and outside the conventions of normal adventure games, with tone puzzles, creative use of cursors and positioning, managing multiple characters, and plenty of red herrings.  So, you may find some of them easy to do if you think outside the box or you may get frustrated and have to consult a walkthrough at some points.\n\nI've praised Daedelic's gameplay adjustments enough to not have to mention them.  They are here as well, you have the mouse-wheel inventory, the hot keys, and the highlightable interactable objects.  They all make the game much smoother and don't bog down the game or story in the minutia of inventory clicking or mouse searching.\n\nWhile I don't think they've recaptured the magic of Deponia, they don't have to in a conclusion.  This is a satisfying ending to a memorable adventure game series which, through it's ups and downs, kept me entertained for a long while.","February 11","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Abandon ship at the end of Chaos and go about your life with memories of the time you spent in Deponia. Seriously.\n\nThe "humour" present in the second half of this game is downright offensive in about every way it could be. Suicide and mental illness as punchlines? Racism? Transphobia? Paedophilia? While the previous two games veered into questionable territory along the way, they never managed to be outright uncomfortable. Unlike Goodbye. God, I wish I could be saying otherwise, I wish I was typing some sort of positive summary of my time spent with this trilogy. But I'm not. From the moment a found therapist's referral was put down to a character having 'clearly lost his marbles', something in me sank and, let me tell you, it didn't stop sinking. I swear, at some point during the game's second half the writing team was switched out, the change was so marked.\n\nPrevious character development and traits were thrown out the window. Rufus, despite having joined the rebellion with Goal, pelts a pair of female recruits with endless mysogynistic comments about how they don't belong. He's shown having been drawn to Toni and "sassy" Goal (although, in hindsight, that might just be down to the fact that women in this series are almost exclusively baby-like or outright aggressive), yet the idea of women in that position is so alien to him he can do nothing but make relentless jokes? Not that that was anything in comparison to being able to sell one of the series' only black characters (who dances, nearly nude, as an organ grinder's monkey) to the grinder himself, who is rather blatantly drawn to be more ape than man, a rope salesman set up opposite a therapists office, nooses adorning his shop's roof or being able to lure children into the path of a paedophile. That last bit makes my blood boil just writing it. This game isn't just distasteful it's uncomfortable, even to think about, at this point. The whole series, the whole beautifully drawn, well acted series, has gone from something joyful to something I'd love to be able to purge from my steam library for good thanks to the bad taste it's left in my mouth and the knot of discomfort it's left in my gut.\n\nWho, at any point, thought any of this was okay? Seriously? Because it's not, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing not.\n\nTL;DR: Grossly distasteful, unfunny and unfaithful to the first two entries. Save yourself the time and don't bother.

I found the game (not just the character Rufus) to be notably sexist, generally insensitive and inept at its humor. Perhaps it was lost in translation but ~70% of what were supposed to be "jokes" didn't strike me as funny.\n\nWEAK ENDING (BUT NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T HAPPY)\nI found the ending unsatisfying not, as other posters have complained, because it is open ended or depressing. Rather it had no gameplay significance. I did the final "unselfish" action for the same reason I did all the selfish actions before: it was the only way to progress the game.\n\nI cared quite a bit about the character's change but mostly in context of those he hurt.\nI'd rather he fail to save Deponia, not get the prize girl (Goal), and even die, but only after making some actual impact with his character change. As it is his change seems tacked on and half hearted.\n\nDON'T RECOMMEND\nUltimately the series was a visual delight tarnished by its grating protagonist and thematic content.\nNot worth the hefty time investment required.","December 28, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I like the art and humor of the Deponia series especially, but the ending of this game left a sour taste in my mouth.  I expected another play section after the credits or maybe that i just got the bad ending and could replay for the good one, but no there is only one ending.  This is definately the weakest of the three.  Just judging by how this game made me feel, i would guess that the writers wrote themselves into a corner and didn't know how to conclude this story they spent two games building.  After how much i enjoyed the first two games, i'm disappointed that i can't reccomend this one, and by extension the first two, because of the poor ending to the series.\n\nWell enough people hated the ending so we got another game. Gotta check that one out now.\n\nReview still stands.  Deponia 4 very well might be the nail in the coffin.

Those were two marvellous games, i laughed and had a really good feeling about this game (i had not felt that since "grim fandango" or "broken swords")\n\nBut this third game is NOT the final opus you would expect. It's horrible, seriously, to go from the two first opus to this one crap. Suddenly the humour is totally random, with really bad taste humour.\n\nAnd i did search why. And i found why : the lead artist Jan Muller-Michaelis, who founded the game, who wrote the texts and scenario of the first two episodes, has been set aside to only direct voice acting. So, the whole thing falls apart. I will NOT finish this game, this is a total disappointment (and i won't go further since i found the above mentionned tragedy and since i have read what the rest of this mascarade is about on other forums and i really don't want to have the tainted memory of this third crap in my mind instead of the first two chapters)\n\nAlso, my impression is the guys who have taken control of the writing are nothing more than ♥♥♥♥ing racists (the ♥♥♥♥in kkk club in the hotel, the peep hole ghost, that black women called "monkey"... seriously ♥♥♥♥ off...)","December 4, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

He is utterly self-centered and willing to harm anyone and anything to get what he wants. The fact that he is incompetent about it is supposed to make him more endearing to us as an audience. The positive reviews seem to indicate such was the case for most people. But I am not one of them.\n\nConsider the following (spoiler alerts): In Deponia 1, he doesn't want to do the dishes. OK, fine, neither did I. But he will go to great lengths to make espresso for a pretty girl, even to the point of flooding a "friend"s house, blasting underneath three others', robbing Gizmo of a fair amount of his equipment, etc. He thinks nothing of picking up an unconscious girl, whome he claims to "love", with a crane and dropping her onto a pile of coal to ride, with every possibility of falling off, down a mine track. Then, when he goes to clean her cartridge, he doesn't do it delicately, as such fragile components need tender loving care. Don't you think if he loved Goal he would have cared to clean her cartridge more delcately? Instead, he messes it up even more, corrodes it, and scratches his name into it!! That's not funny! That's giving a person brain damage! That's intolerable. And that's just the first game!\n\nAnd he doesn't get any better in the next two: In the second, of course, he buys the cheap cartridges and splits Goal's personality, all for the sake of a ten-cent all-day sucker. The nerve! That's not adorably selfish. That's despicable beyond words. And what he does to Baby Goal - he does realise she's completely under his power in that state, right? It's just like handling a baby. He is basically no better than Ian Watkins (a recently sentenced paedophile who used to be a famous musician - God rest his soul ) when he hits on Baby Goal. He's even worse when he abuses her childlike trust to use her as a living lightning rod! Would you do that to a child? Is that an acceptable abuse of a child?\n\nNo. We should not give this guy our sympathy where it is not due. And the vast majority of his character is not sympathetic in the least. It is almost entirely abusive, and I do not think anyone can credit it to the reasons Hermes - God rest his soul - gives for why Rufus is the way he is. Rufus is not merely a jackass. He is the jackass to end all jackasses. When he killed Goal in the pod - I don't care whether that was an accident or not - the game should have ended there, or Rufus should have changed utterly. As previous reviews have mentioned, that, of course, didn't happen. He is no better by the end of the game.\n\nAnd, worst of all, not only is this despicable specimen of intelligent life the protagonist, he's the guy you play for the span of all three games. You follow him everywhere. You ARE him. I hated a lot of the choices I made playing this game, because I could not make a moral choice, a good choice, if the story was going to advance. I can think of better writing than this. I think most people can. If Poki was just trying to be as crass, or selfish, or harmful as one can be while saving the world, he hit the mark. But to call Rufus a "hero" - I sympathise with Bozo. I applauded when he exploded in Rufus's face, with the baby vomit all over him, and the antidepressants in his hair. It needed to be said. And more, much more, besides.\n\nThe way the game ends - it's almost a relief. Almost. But, Poki, you've left everyone to "die in their sins". You let Rufus die in his selfishness. You've left Goal to die in her misguided love. You've left the Deponians to die on Elysium, Elysium to die probably on Deponia. At the end of the Deponia trilogy, the world is not a better place. And, Poki, maybe that's how you see the world. Maybe that's how the modern world sees the world. But it is not so. Poki, I read your forum post (translated into English). All men have a goal in life, a race to run, a fight to fight. Neither should we settle for the garbage on the ground, nor shoot up to the Heavens. Heaven is not enough. Rufus was made for more than Elysium. He could have been the next Doctor Who, or Captain Kirk, or (God forbid) a Saint Francis or even Buddha (well, perhaps not Buddha - except on caffeine). These are men who adventured. Who helped make their worlds better, in little ways, wherever they went. Rufus could have been the subject of a new series on TellTale, or somesuchthing. And, fo course, he could have come to know the neverending adventure - God Himself. And someday, I plan to make a response to this dreadful series along those lines. I surely wish to, anyway. No story should ever play out the way this one did. Ever. This is Hell.","August 12, 2014","false","15.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

We're expected to have a giggle that a rope salesman who's set up shop outside a therapist's office is making a pretty penny, and, in his own words, has a "rope for every neck!" The therapist then proceeds to recommend to you an exorcism. Thanks for that, dude. Super sensitive. Nice.\n\nI thought I could push through - it was a stumble, maybe something that didn't make it through translation so well, but it got worse! Rufus, who has never been a shining example of feminism, I admit, began to spout overtly misogynistic comments and honestly, they were out of character, even for him. It's not the first time he's been sexist - I remember him asserting that cleaning was Toni's job, right? But there was a nuance then that's gone now. His implication before was not that it was Toni's job because she's a woman, but more that, through process of elimination, it was Toni's job clean, only because it was absolutely not Rufus' job. He's always been selfish, a bit of a knob tbh, but he doesn't look down on women. Here, instead, he outright states that the idea of female soldiers is laughable and that they shouldn't be allowed to join the resistance because they can't fight. Has he forgotten that he and Goal joined together? Seriously, given Rufus' dating history, he seems to chase after women who'll bite back. Why has this so suddenly changed?\n\nThough really, don't think that this is the reason I stopped playing. It's not. It isn't. Push on with this rubbish, and you'll get to hear distasteful race jokes galore (what's that? Only several black characters in the entire series and one of them is continually mistaken for a monkey? Ha ha ha ha wow). You will also get to literally sell a black woman into slavery. She will be forced to stand there, dancing, in a bikini, and you get to tell her she should be grateful for the opportunity.\n\nIf you're not bothered yet, this game has more in store! Did you know that Rufus lures children into the path of a pedophile? Did you know he later kills those children? He can even make a pencil rubbing of the pedohile's genitals and show it to them before killing them, just for extra laughs. Fantastic.\n\nSo incredibly disappointed, tbh, after how much I enjoyed the first two games. Would really like to hear Daedalic Entertainment justify using child abuse, transphobia, slavery and suicide (among other sensitive issues) as a punchline, but know it's never going to happen.","October 28, 2015","false","10.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","8","20","2","2"

Goodbye deponia falls short in storytelling and character development, but compensates by new ideas and wittier (and sicker) humor. The story itself is a bit "loose", meaning it does not feel like a complete narrative but like weakly tethered sub-plots. However, the puzzles are not as vague as in the previouse games, and the abundance of minigames makes it very enjoyable.\n\nAlso, Rufus is a character I 'oh so love' to hate.\n\n8.5/10 for the numerics junkies","December 15, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's great quality. The German voices are extremely well executed and with this the animations come to life for me.\nI got stuck on two occasions. One of them was a minigame I found a bit too much (you always have the option to skip those if you dislike them). But with one exception I always found the riddles rewarding.\nI love that it's not linear in the way you can choose the order of a lot of things. So when I looked into a walkthrough for the one exception, I could not find the point of progression I was looking for immediately :).\n\nSpoilerThe one exception was to get to the crate in the swamp. You have to talk to the children from a special place which I... didn't xD.\n\nThe ending is something special. I am somehow proud of the developers to be so courageous to not put a happy ending. Nobody would have taken a grudge. Rufus and Goal would have been frozen in time for us happily.\nBut I don't believe in something like this. This would be Elysium. And though we have seen the people in Elysium always happy, we only have been shown very little of them and I believe there was a shadow hiding in the hearts of the people there. That Goal left with Cletus is proof enough for me.\n\nOf course I am projecting their fantasy world onto ours. Perhaps they can be happy while abandoning their people. I somehow believe we cannot and this seems to be even somehow religious.\n\nThe ending is inspiring. And it is variation, change. Change in Rufus. Change also in Cletus, who now started to go creative. I dislike happily-ever-afters. They are just the opposite of reality. And that's the thing. If you only played "Deponia" for recreational purposes, then the ending will not make you happy.

I want to say many things about the story and the characters, and the potential that I felt was unfulfilled, yet justifyingly so, but I will try to refrain from writing any spoilers in this review.\n\nAs the last game of the series, the puzzles are only getting harder with the addition of managing multiple inventories instead of just one. There were definitely more times where I had to look up a walkthrough to find salvation for my overheating brain than the previous two games, but the challenge definitely makes the game entertaining to play (kudos if you can play through the game without looking up the solutions). Throughout the game you'll find various character references to other games/movies, and you'll have quiite a few giggles interacting with them as the MC. And finally, the adventure was simply beautiful and... magical. I never thought I'd be so emotionally invested in a point-and-click adventure game, but I've never been more glad to be proven wrong.\n\nIf it's not clear enough by this point, I am very impressed with the game and would recommend it to those who has already played the previous two games. For those who have not started the series and are looking for a game with a challenging-but-not impossible puzzles, a few good giggles and a great story, then I will say that being able experience the adventures of Deponia is worth every single penny in your wallet.

But it was far too bitter and not enough sweet.\n\n\n\n\nPROs:\nThe story is fun and quirky! Childish enough for a young audience, Crude enough for the adults. The puzzles are never too easy or hard. The game is full of FLAVOR! The Deponia series as a whole is oozing with color atmosphere!\n\nCONs:\nThe ending...\n\n\n\nFinal verdict?\nPLAY THIS GAME. PLAY ALL 3 OF THEM.\nIf you are a fan of point and click adventure then you NEED this in your life right the hell now!\nIf you are on the fence, Buy it when its on sale.\nTake my advice. I am not a fan of point and click adventures and this game won my heart! Play it!","February 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to say many things about the story and the characters, and the potential that I felt was unfulfilled, yet justifyingly so, but I will try to refrain from writing any spoilers in this review.\n\nAs the last game of the series, the puzzles are only getting harder with the addition of managing multiple inventories instead of just one. There were definitely more times where I had to look up a walkthrough to find salvation for my overheating brain than the previous two games, but the challenge definitely makes the game entertaining to play (kudos if you can play through the game without looking up the solutions). Throughout the game you'll find various character references to other games/movies, and you'll have quiite a few giggles interacting with them as the MC. And finally, the adventure was simply beautiful and... magical. I never thought I'd be so emotionally invested in a point-and-click adventure game, but I've never been more glad to be proven wrong.\n\nIf it's not clear enough by this point, I am very impressed with the game and would recommend it to those who has already played the previous two games.

The length feels about right. While many will warn you to stay away purely because of the ending I urge you to experience the game nonetheless. Part of why the ending feels so sour is despite the apparent unlikeability of the protagonist you still feel something at the end, but that said the ending is just hard to sit with. I definitely was not feeling good at the end, but thats because this game made me invested. That investment makes a rough ending worth sticking through. FTR when I say rough ending I do not mean bad. It is well thought out, metaphorically important, and the right amount of subtle allowing different players to take away from it differently. That said I think few players will be satisfied with this ending, but that's only to say we want Daedalic to give us more of this truly unique world and its fascinating array of characters.","April 30, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's great quality. The German voices are extremely well executed and with this the animations come to life for me.\nI got stuck on two occasions. One of them was a minigame I found a bit too much (you always have the option to skip those if you dislike them). But with one exception I always found the riddles rewarding.\nI love that it's not linear in the way you can choose the order of a lot of things. So when I looked into a walkthrough for the one exception, I could not find the point of progression I was looking for immediately :).\n\nSpoilerThe one exception was to get to the crate in the swamp. You have to talk to the children from a special place which I... didn't xD.\n\nThe ending is something special. I am somehow proud of the developers to be so courageous to not put a happy ending. Nobody would have taken a grudge. Rufus and Goal would have been frozen in time for us happily.\nBut I don't believe in something like this. This would be Elysium. And though we have seen the people in Elysium always happy, we only have been shown very little of them and I believe there was a shadow hiding in the hearts of the people there. That Goal left with Cletus is proof enough for me.\n\nOf course I am projecting their fantasy world onto ours. Perhaps they can be happy while abandoning their people. I somehow believe we cannot and this seems to be even somehow religious.\n\nThe ending is inspiring. And it is variation, change. Change in Rufus. Change also in Cletus, who now started to go creative. I dislike happily-ever-afters. They are just the opposite of reality. And that's the thing. If you only played "Deponia" for recreational purposes, then the ending will not make you happy.

But man, that ending killed it for me. It felt so abrupt, so pushed together. I'm truthfully just really disapointed in it. An ending of a trilogy is supposed to make you feel good, provide closer, and have you look back at all the hours you put into the game. I think Daedalic is just really great at making cliffhangers at the end of their games. If there was a 4th installation,  maybe of rufus actually getting to elysium and goal then finding out that cletus was pretending the whole time  , I would maybe have a better resting feeling about these games. It was still fun, although I had to look at the walkthough pretty frequently if I didn't want to lose my mind.

You, the player, sell a black woman into sexual slavery. You lead children onto the doorstep of a pedophile and later into the  mouth of a child-eating swamp monster. You drive a man to suicide.  We were first introduced to Rufus as a well-meaning buffoon. But as we progress through the trilogy, he becomes increasingly despicable and unempathetic. It becomes difficult for the player to project themselves onto this character.\n\nRufus was given a redemption ending. I feel that this was too sudden a change of character. It makes the finale less tragic and memorable.

That made the game a little more intressting. I found the puzzles were easier than in part 2 and the jokes funny but not to heavy. Some jokes in part to were ... well.. lets say not for everyone. I liked it that they were trying to make jokes on many different kind of games, films and so on. Out of the 3 parts I actually found this one the best.\nMakes me wish Ruffus never gets to Elysium and keeps always trying XD.\nWill surely get the last part as well...

But man, that ending killed it for me. It felt so abrupt, so pushed together. I'm truthfully just really disapointed in it. An ending of a trilogy is supposed to make you feel good, provide closer, and have you look back at all the hours you put into the game. I think Daedalic is just really great at making cliffhangers at the end of their games. If there was a 4th installation,  maybe of rufus actually getting to elysium and goal then finding out that cletus was pretending the whole time  , I would maybe have a better resting feeling about these games. It was still fun, although I had to look at the walkthough pretty frequently if I didn't want to lose my mind. Just wish there was more to the end.","April 12","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ending is unsatisfying and leaves far too many story threads hanging to provide real closure for the story. On the other hand, it leaves things wide open for a Deponia 4, but it appears the chances of that happening at this point are very close to 0. Poor ending aside, the story was mostly great, but some of the puzzle solutions were a bit dark for my tastes. I get that Rufus is supposed to be a jerk, but some of the solutions go far beyond that.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it's a huge step up from the earlier games. In both the earlier titles I had a lot of problems with minigames not working at all (and even a complete game breaking bug in the first game that required downloading an official savegame file to fix) but this one worked flawlessly.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is about right (although as with any adventure game some of the solutions are so random and obtuse that you'll probably spend a significant amount of time with trial and error unless you use a guide).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ride I had with the series (in spite of the ending) and can easily recommend it if you're at all interested in adventure games. Make sure to get the whole series in a discounted bundle (happens semi regularly).","May 18","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
