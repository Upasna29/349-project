You got a single repetitive sword slashing with no variety in game play.  Although it looks like a polished game and comes with high quality graphics and leaderboards, it's not a finish product and certainly not warrant $15.  I'll give it a second look when the finish product come out. Basically, I am not betting my money on it even though it's an early access.  Games like Brookhaven however, I would not hesitate to buy it because I know what to expect in the finished product. Not this game..\n\nThis release should have been a demo for now. It's just not finished.","April 30","false","0.3"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","36","55","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/400760/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nZenBlade is an addicting casual VR game that resembles Fruit Ninja! It is currently in early access.\n\nCheck out my Quick Preview here: https://youtu.be/SDIjbFyeogk\nI played the ZenBlade using the HTC Vive, and I felt like fruit and bombs are really flying at me, and I don’t know why, but I kept trying to jump away from the bombs even though they don’t hurt me.\n\nThere are two modes available. In timed mode, you play on a timer, and as the clock starts ticking down, you aim to get the highest score by slicing as much fruit as you can. In survival mode, you can’t let the fruit drop, when three fruit hit the floor, you lose. Slicing more fruit in one swing awards bonus points, but if you hit the bombs, you lose points!\n\nI really love the sword mechanics! You have to swing hard enough to slice the fruit, and swing from the right angle. You can also knock bombs away with the hilt of the sword, and juggle fruit off the sides of the blade to set yourself up for better combos.\n\nPros:even in early access, the game is pretty polished\nthe room scaling is done very well - I had zero nausea!\nmoving around, and swinging the sword feels very natural - the sword play is very responsive, and extremely fun to use\nthe haptic feedback makes it feel like you’re actually slicing through the fruit\naddictive gameplay, that is easy to learn, and fun for the whole family\ntaking turns and competing with friends locally is fun\nCons:repetitive gameplay that can get boring, especially if you're playing alone\nlacks content, there are only two modes available, but I expect more to be added before full release\nno way to keep track of players top scores while playing locally with friends (maybe an option to save scores with initials could be added)\nPlaying Zenblade is addictive as you compete to get better scores. It is still in early access though, so I’d still like to see more modes added, maybe some where the fruit comes in from other directions, or fruit comes endlessly until you hit a certain number of bombs or a mode where you have to dodge the bombs before they kill you. Or maybe even something where armored fruit enemies come at you from all directions and you have to slice and stab them where they are vulnerable. Now that would be awesome!\n\nSo far, I’ve been playing with others for over 4 hours, and even though I’m absolutely terrible at the game, I’m still enjoying it. ZenBlade has a lot of potential, and I look forward to seeing what they do with it before the full release. Since I have been playing with others, I am satisfied with the purchase. But, if I had intended to play alone, I would have waited for more content to be added or a slight sale price.","May 2","true","4.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","2"

I hope there will be more than slicing fruits with different game modes, like parrying arrows, dueling AI(s) or player, the choice of different weapons, stages, because if it is just a fruit ninja in VR it would be overpriced even for a good one. I will update if the game improves.","May 8","false","5.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I'll make an effort to update this as the development progress\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and it's very addictive. It has that effect of making you want to play just one more and beat your high score. In fact, I set some ice cream out to soften it and figured I'd play a couple rounds of this while it sat. 40 minutes later I came out and the ice cream was soup lol. The sword physics and the graphics are great. This has the potential to be THE VR sword game.\n\nBUT, it's not quite there yet. What is there is polished and well done, but maybe not $15 of fun. If the devs are speaking the truth and willing to put some work in on this I think it easily could be, but at the moment I'd have to advise waiting a couple of weeks and seeing how the game progresses in that time. I'm willing to jump in early and back them personally, but early access is a gamble so consider that before you buy.","April 30","true","3.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

All I can say is that I am glad Steam has implemented a return system, because this game is definitly not worth $15. It unfortunately really feels like a cash grab.

This round will be the one!\nNope. So Then I played it again and again.\nYou can play it just 2 minutes, but it's hard to quit till you get a good round  & workout.\n\nI bring this game out at all my demos. It's a good use of room size, and definitely the direction I want to see VR swordplay headed.  It's super good for beginners, but the skill ceiling is high. My top scores so far are 477, 336, and 330. Average is around 180. The current fruit distribution is random, some times are better than others, but if you get in the zone and connect your slices in a big swooping arc, you can get huge combos. They're one of those video game memory making moments.\n\nFor a while I was annoyed by the tiny fruit, but I got better at the game, and can slice it like mad.\n\nAlso, there are leaderboards (daily + all time) so you don't have to try to beat an insanely lucky person, just the best score of the day.\n\nAlso, I hear you can turn off the music with "M" so you can jam with your own tunes and try to slice to the beat. =)","April 30","true","42.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

You'll come back to it again and again, for a few minutes. This game definitely has that awesome replayability factor going for it but needs more content and depth to keep you engaged for longer than a game or two at a time. The new survival mode is definitely a step in the right direction, as you can keep going indefinitely if you're good enough, but without a variety of game modes this falls a bit short.\n\nIs it worth the price? Maybe. I would say it's currently worth about 10 dollars as the available content is a lot of fun, but a bit shallow. However, the developers state the price will not change after release and if so then I believe it will be worth it and more as soon as the developers flesh the game out a bit more.\n\nAnd please devs, make updates available on your store page, I found out about the survival update in the Discussions and it wasn't even stickied!","May 10","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it's also surprisingly addictive for gamers as well.\n\nThere are two modes - 1) Time Mode where you have 1 minute to score as many points as possible (additional points for slicing 2, 3, or 4 fruits with one stroke, -10 points for hitting bombs) or 2) Survival mode where you keep getting points until you either hit a bomb or let 3 fruits fall down without being sliced. The leaderboards make an excellent motivator to keep trying.","May 10","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it would sell many times more copies at $10 or even $5.\n\nBut it's a fun and surprisingly addictive game.\n\nI bought it mainly because I played a very old version of this on a Vive developer kit a very long time ago - first roomscale VR game I ever played...","May 10","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The price is a bit expensive this is a small app with boring gameplay.  Sure its worth playing but not for 10.

You'll come back to it again and again, for a few minutes. This game definitely has that awesome replayability factor going for it but needs more content and depth to keep you engaged for longer than a game or two at a time. The new survival mode is definitely a step in the right direction, as you can keep going indefinitely if you're good enough, but without a variety of game modes this falls a bit short.\n\nIs it worth the price? Maybe. I would say it's currently worth about 10 dollars as the available content is a lot of fun, but a bit shallow. However, the developers state the price will not change after release and if so then I believe it will be worth it and more as soon as the developers flesh the game out a bit more.\n\nAnd please devs, make updates available on your store page, I found out about the survival update in the Discussions and it wasn't even stickied!","May 10","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other times the sword will just phase straight through.\n\nI hope the devs add a lot more content and clean up the glitches as it could be a really good purchase.","May 21","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would recommend.\n\nA lot of negative reviews are talking about the lack of variety but remember it is in early access - there is a lot of potential with future updates.\n\nDefinitely one to keep an eye on and a good way to introduce people to vr.\n\n","May 19","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
