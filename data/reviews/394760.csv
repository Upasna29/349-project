It's clunky in every way you would expect a mobile port to be, and while it's cool to see some of the techniques and solutions they applied to a mobile platform, they do not carry over to the PC.  Ultimately, that's unfortunate, because while the production values are fairly low, it's not incompetent.","May 6","false","0.9"," 317 of 402 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","317","402","8","25"

Some of them are invisible until they attack you, some use hit and run tactics and most of them are bullet-sponges too.\nThe feel of progression is not given in this game - everything takes ages. Level ups take a lot of grinding and even if you find a legendary weapon you do not feel this "itch" what happens in every hack and slay rpg, because they nearly feel the same as the old weapon you used.\nVerdict\n\nThis game could be good, but in the end, the game fails at being fun. As said, everything feels clunky, uninspired and allready seen like a hundred times. For the asking price the game is just bad.\n\nMy guess is, that if you and a friend would get it for 5€ it can be fun for maybe 2-3 hours.

The story is, as many people said, B-series worthy. That said, who play zombie games like this one for the story ?\n\nThe accuracy system is a bit strange but you can overcome it quickly with the implants of your characters. The weapons selection is pretty wide. Want to use a shotgun ? Want to use a sniper rifle ? Want to use brass knuckles ? Want to use a laser rifle ? Want to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mjollnir ? Damn right you can. Upgrading the weapons costs quite a lot at the end but considering how much money you'll earn in the mission at the end, you'll be able to afford it. And like in all games, each weapon has a situation in which it is more useful.\n\nI saw some people saying that you can't access the weapons, gears, implants and abilities menus without talking to a NPC. That is false. You'll be able to access weapons, gear and implants through two consoles in the hub after a while or in the multiplayer lobby directly. In single player, you'll have to speak with a NPC to access your abilities unfortunately but you'll be able to access it directly in the multiplayer lobby.\n\nThe regular zombies aren't anything amazing but the special zombies can be incredibly frustrating (I'm looking at you, TNT dealer). Bosses aren't incredibly hard but they deal quite a load of damage even with the best gear possible.\n\nAmongst the soldiers you'll find ninjas after a while and they strike hard but you can usually kill them in one shot.\n\nWhat pains me the most is how crap is the online stability, suddenly dropping your fps from 70-80 to 5-10 and simulteanously increasing your latency from 15ms to 700ms for no reason.\n\nOverrall:\nLong story short, 7.5/10. Defo not GOTY but not as bad as most of the negative reviews claim it is. It's an enjoyable game, alone or with friends.

Dead Effect 2 was released on Android and Iphones late last year, and now we have a "premium" version on PC, so to speak. I spend only a little time playing the android version, mostly because I can't aim with thumbsticks even if my life depended on it, so I can't say too much about the differences. What I can say is that once again, the developers removed all the microtransactions (Thank god for that!) and this time around they really have pushed the Unity engine.\n\nYes, the game uses Unity 5 but you couldn't tell that just by looking at the gameplay or screenshots. The textures look really sharp, it has all the bells and whistles from depth of field to SSAO to bloom. It really doesn't look like the same game that I have on my Samsung S4 Active and that I played for few hours before giving up.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a mix of FPS and RPG (Think System Shock) and loot hunting like in Borderlands or Diablo. Each weapon comes in Common, Regular, Treasured, Legendary and Mythical ranks. With Common being the lowest and Mythical the highest. They also come in different levels and flavours, with option to upgrade the damage, reload speed, accuricy, magazine and add slots for "enchantments". The same is true for implants and armor, with armor also having sets that give bonuses with more parts of the set equipped.\n\nThere are three classes in the game, each with their own class skills. And although the Jane for example is an "assault" class the game doesn't restrict you from using equipment based on the class.\n\nOn top of the story missions (At the time of writing the EA version has 9 and the developers have stated there will be 20 by the time the game is released) the game also features "Generic Missions", that range from fetch missions to NPC protections to hacking. Biohazard pits you against increasingly hard waves of enemies. In Survival you need to survive for given time and Lone Wolf missions at the time of writing make you get through soldiers and activate consoles, after which you need to survive an enemy assault.\n\nFrom missions you gain XP, loot and credits, that you can use to buy new equipment or upgrade to old ones.\n\nI haven't tried the coop, so I won't comment on that. Although on the forums people have stated that the coop mode causes FPS drops by the time of writing.\n\nSo would I recommend the game? If you liked original Dead Effect, this one is bigger and better. Much better. For people who haven't tried Dead Effect, you might want to read some more reviews, but take note that on "teh interwebs" most reviews are of the mobile phone version.\n\nPersonally I'm loving it. Sure, it's missing content, but for me it runs flawlessly and it's in early access. And the gameplay is addicting as heck. I have tried to hunt for bugs but the worst one I have found was enemy spawning inside a tank and had to be killed by shooting it's legs. And that happened twice. During 18 hours of gameplay. Pretty damn good for a game that has been in early access for less than 48 hours if you ask me.\n\nThe developers also are really active on the forums and are working on the first patch already, so I can see the full game coming out "before the summer" as the developers have intended.","February 24","true","28.5"," 43 of 72 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","43","72","5","1"

Each of these characters have their own "unique abilities" which you can improve on later in the game.\n\nThere are different game modes (which you can access after progressing with the storyline), in which you can play by yourself or co-op with others. You can play through the storyline, which lets you unlock different shops later in the game to help you improve your character efficiency, or play through the other different modes which differs in goal on how to complete it. Every mission you play on every mode will yield you the credit points and other bonuses that you can spend and use at your own discretion.\n\n\nThe Pros\nLarge Item Selection - No doubt the most interesting part other of the game for me is the very large selection of items (weapons, armor, implants). Each of these items for use (expect for the bonus inventory items which are defaulted in 'legendary') are divided into specific tiers (common, regular, treasured, legendary, and mythical) and differs in effectiveness as well as the buying/selling price. Also, these items can also be upgraded to make them more efficient in the long run.\n\nIntelligent Enemy AI - This is the first thing that I noticed while playing the first few missions of the game. While the slowpoke zombies are still present, most of them can get "enraged" and rush towards you. Other types of enemies, the 'Cannibals' for example, can go in groups and go behind your field of vision instead of lining up in front of you. The 'Delta Soldiers' prefer staying away and hiding in covers while returning fire with their weapons and grenade from afar.\n\nMultiplayer Ready - Multiplayer/Co-op options are very welcome to every shooter as this gives the opportunity for the players to have fun with their friends/relatives, which contributes to the replayability and longevity of the game.\n\nAtmospheric Gameplay - The ambience that the game gives as a whole really captures what is needed for a horror shooter game. The soundtrack that plays during enemy encounters will make you either go rushing or very cautious while the graphics are greatly detailed in every aspect (the areas, enemies, weapons, etc.).\n\nThe Cons\nInaccurate Cross hairs - Noticed this early in the game since the first weapon you have will be a magnum pistol. Normally, I go for the head since it saves both time and ammunition but most of the time and even when you have directed the aim perfectly, the bullet still slips behind. While I am aware that this is normally attributed to the "gun accuracy" (which could be upgraded to the weapon once you have access to the shop), there still has to be a limit.\n\nNo Cut scene Skip - There's plenty of cut scenes in the game (especially, in story mode) that you can't skip, which takes time if you already know the story or is uninterested. Players who are after the achievements will definitely replay these episodes for a number of times, and could be annoying to say at the least. While this is something that is almost trivial to consider as a downside (since they take less than a minute), an option should still be included in my opinion.\nThe Verdict\nFor the fans of zombie FPS in there, this is a must-try to say at the very least. And for those who loved the first Dead Effect, you really cannot go wrong in buying this game.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 6","true","13.3"," 60 of 107 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","60","107","3","2"

Gun balance, honestly I do like the fact that the dev has made melee play somewhat rewarding, however this should not be at the cost of a gun user's experience. This is yet another example of why (RPG-ifying) accuracy is a bad idea unless excuted WITHIN appopriate boundaries. When operating a weapon it leaves a bad taste in one's mouth when having to deal with the fustration for the few hours of the game making me feel as if I'm on a ship floating around in water. I understand that adding a large margin to create a better sensation of progress, but it does need to be tuned down somewhat.\n\nINCLUDE ACTION INTERRUPTION. Please, I understand that this is early access, however being animation locked into reloading in a FPS (Especially with some animations being so slow, here's looking at you shotgun.) is a very uncomfortable and irritating experience.\n\nAll in all, this game certainly seems like it could be a good one as the promise is there.","February 27","false","19.5"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","31","53","3","0"

So the first levels are more like an introduction tutorial.\n\nThis is a great zombiegame in general and Its more like classical zombiegames and it does not follow down the same DayZ path as many other early access zombiegames.\n\nThere is alot of blood and gore and its satisfying killing the zombies.\n\nThe story is a bit deeper this time since you get to meet characters this time around.\n\nThe voices of some the characters sound pretty silly.

It would be one thing to satirize or parody a B-film, but this game has so many problems that I doubt this was the case.\n\nThe voice acting is grating. The voice acting was actually a big reason why I didn't play as long as I probably should have before writing this review. Yes. It's THAT bad. (Made even worse if you choose to play as the female character).\n\nThe shooting feels clunky. In early sections, I found myself taking shots at zombies' heads, with my aim PERFECTLY aligned in the middle of the head, only to have every shot miss. I was finally able to hit their heads after my moving my sights downwards more, towards their jaws/necks.\n\nI found some kind of electric gun thing that could shoot a couple of shots and then stopped. I would click again, and just get a 'beep' signalling I couldn't fire. I don't know why - the ammo counter said the weapon had infinite ammo, and there were no other visuals to indicate why the gun would stop firing. Apparently, there actually is an indicator, albeit a subtle one. The reticle fades to gray.\n\nMovement is PAINFULLY slow, even when sprinting.\n\nMenus can only be accessed via NPCs.\n\nThe first NPC has her nipples showing through her shirt. Don't get me wrong, I love boobs as much as the next guy, but they should have a reason for appearing - Boobs and nips showing up in hentai games? Makes sense. Showing up at the strip club in GTA5? Makes sense. Shows up randomly in a game about shooting zombies? No sense.\n\nGame feels like it wants to be a mix of Doom 3 and Borderlands, but lacks the polish and features to come even close.\n\nOn a more positive note, the graphics and environments looked very good, from what I could tell.\n\nEdit: Changed the review so that it seems less like a personal attack on the devs, while still maintaining my criticism. On the internet, it can sometimes be easy to forget that the person on the other end is a living, breathing person with feelings - not just text on a screen.","May 8","false","0.4"," 66 of 121 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","66","121","3","9"

If you're like me and remember a sad age in video games, a time in the 80's, 90's and even the early part of the 2000's, zombie games were rare, and even more rare were good zombie games.  Now in 2016 we have an abundance of zombie games, fast zombies, slow zombies, fat zombies, half naked zombies, zombies in Resident Evil games  (ok I lied, Zombies haven't been in Resident Evil games since like 2005).\n\nDead Effect 2 is the sequel to 2014's Dead Effect, the game has been improved in just about every area that matters, graphics, gameplay, story and sounds.  If you enjoyed Dead Effect you'll love Dead Effect 2, if you weren't a big fan of Dead Effect, don't let that deter you as the sequel is greater than the original.   It needs to be said that this is still Early Access and will be improved, altered and have additional content added, what exist currently is really awesome, to think it will actually get better is pretty exciting.\n\nThe Story\n\nYou get to choose between 3 separate characters Gunner Davis, Jane Frey and Kay Rayner, each character has a type of weapon they specialize in..  Davis is heavy weapons, Jane shotguns and Rayner loves those swords (Zero 4 the win).  I'm unsure if the story changes based on who you pick as I've only had the chance to play with Gunner...  The game is set after the events of the first game, it's set on the ESS Meridian, you awaken to find a doctor checking you over, after a moment, Gunner passes out again, the next time he awakens the room is empty, suspicious blood smears mark the lab.  A woman named Danette gets in touch with you, she gives you a brief run down on your situation, and lets just say, things have hit the fan..  She explains she's an experiment and needs your help to rescue her.\n\nFrom that point forward you'll do various missions for Danette, which are varied, nothing really too unique, your typical, go kill, go fetch, go rescue, escort,....  Although they are varied enough that you won't be stuck thinking "I've only done this like a million times."\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nYour typical FPS game, point your gun, watch as enemy dies..  the game has a large assortment of weapons and various skills to use.  You can upgrade weapons and skills, helping to make them more potent, and buy implants or character upgrades to further improve your character.  The enemies can get a bit repetitive, but the game is in early access and I'm sure the developer will probably add in additional enemy models as the game moves forward.  The game isn't the most difficult at this point in time, but again that can be explained away as it being an early access title.\n\nIs it Fun\n\nIs the game fun?  The game is highly fun and rather addicting, when you finish one mission you'll want to jump right into the next.  The graphics are smooth and crisp, the sounds are clear and pleasing..  You can tell the developers put a lot of thought, effort and time into making this game far superior to the original, they seem to have taken all the positive feed back from the original game and improved the sequel.\n\nPro's\n\nLarge assortment of guns,\n20 hours of gameplay\nco/op game play\ninteresting story\nZOMBIES!!!\n\nCon's\nVoice acting is a bit spoty sometimes\n"fairly often" glitch when aiming down the sights won't allow you to shoot\n\nRecommendation\n\nI'd say this game is well worth a purchase, it's a very solid purchase currently and will only continue to get better as time goes on.  Like most EA titles this one will likely increase in price as it moves further along in development.  The graphics are nice, the animations are smooth, and the many different weapons give the gamers a bunch of options to choose from.  I'd fully recommend buying this title now, supporting development and getting the chance to play this really amazing game as early as possible.","April 1","true","4.9"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","31","55","4","3"

You can team-up with up to two other players in any game mode and be rewarded with new pieces of armor, body modifications, and more to equip and advance your characters.\n\nStill in Early Access, there is quite a bit more to come to the game with a new update promised within only a week or two that'll raise the level cap, add new weapons, and more.

As it stands now, the game has too many flaws and I cannot recommend it.\n\nCons:\n- The biggest flaw is the wrong hit detection. Whatever goes on under the hood, many shots and swings feel like they should hit but they miss. This is unfortunately applicable for both shooting and melee combat, but amplified for shooting because of the strange ballistics model. All shots are very slow, kind of like darts, so you have to lead the shot even when shooting for a short distance (10m). Hit detection is the one thing that a FPS should get right, and DE2 unfortunately doesn't.\n- There are technical problems. The game stutters from time to time and sometimes there is a lag between your shot landing and the zombie body reacting - eg. you shoot the zombie in the head and half a second later the head explodes. These problems are intermittent and hard to reproduce but when they appear, they're very annoying.\n- HUD and the whole UI is clearly created for mobile/touch devices and not changed for the PC release. In-game menus are a mess of horizontal scrolling and unclear buttons. Sometimes the button "Back" will return you to a previous menu, sometimes it boots you out of the menu altogether.\n- The art design is horrible and completely relies on huge contrast, oversaturation and heavy postprocessing. The amount of bloom and lens flare makes it seem like you look through the cheapest and worse camera ever made. The postprocessing can be luckily toned down, the oversaturation and contrast cannot.\n- The leveling and loot aspects are badly thought out. The level cap is 20 and the level of a gun is its most important number. The levels come very fast, which means that you shouldn't invest in any gear until you're level 20, because you outlevel all lower lvl weapons and armor during the next mission. Once you hit level 20, it's just a game of chance until you get the highest rarity gear - "Mythical". The rarities however are a complete joke, because mythical gear drops as often as regular one, which means in two or three matches you have everything you need. To summarize: The loot is quickly obsolete until you reach the maximum level and after you reach it it takes you about 60 minutes to get max rarity+max lvl gear.\n- The story might be interesting, but most of it is hidden in datapads, small black, almost invisible tablets. The rest is told through the most atrocious voice acting I have heard in a game.\n\nPros:\n- Many weapons have a good feel. The melee swings feel heavy, machine guns and shotguns have meaty sound effects and proper impact, sniper rifles tear everything apart.\n- There is a good game hidden in there somewhere, but right now it's too deep.\n\nI recommend Dead Effect 1 instead.","May 16","false","15.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","2"

You can tell that the guys who made this title really love games in general and wanted to take a chance to implement all those things they like. Still, the final product could be -a lot- better.\n\nThe visuals are surprisingly good for something that feels like an indiegame, the gameplay however gets stale very quick once you figured out your perfect setup. Especially melee-weapons are extremely effective and make guns pretty much obsolete since you don't need to reload which is one of the most annoying things to do in this game.\n\nReloading feels like it takes forever and only disturbs the rhythm of the game, even interrupting an animation one frame too early will undo the reloading process itself. Pretty much the only time you'll need a ranged weapon is for dealing with those pesky drones since they seem to be immune against melee-damage.\n\nEnemies like the zombies which you'll encounter most of the time are either bullet sponges or die immediately, depending on the type of zombie you're dealing with. There's no real middle-ground, you either waste your time on killing enemies with extremely high lifemeters (especially bosses are a massive pain in the ♥♥♥ in that regard) or you're simply curbstomping whatever gets into your way. Enemies don't feel like they have any meaningful weaknesses, every shot you take feels the same.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen to you is ending up at the center of a zombie sandwich, once you're stuck in an obstacle you're as good as dead since there's no way to free yourself without turning yourself into a suicide-bomber. Speaking of explosives, they hardly seem to break up zombie-hoards which only makes you question the use of grenades at all. Even massive melee-weapons like the sword only seem to hit single enemies and never more than one target which makes it extremely hard to free yourself once you're surrounded.\n\nWhen it comes to the special abilities in this game, all you'll need is bullet-time and that one ability which grants you temporary immunity to damage. Both of those abilities can be acquired very early and make the rest of the skill-roster feel very much obsolete, they're just THAT good. And they're pretty much the only thing that can you get out of those nasty situations which I've described earlier.\n\nCollecting gear CAN be a fun experience but it gets old very fast, and I mean that in a literal sense. Pretty much any piece of gear you acquire is immediately obsolete after you're done with your latest mission. Even the so called epic and mythical items lack the "oomph" you'd expect from them, they're even weaker than regular gear most of the time to make up for their seemingly redundant ability bonuses.\n\nNow in regard of the singleplayer experience (I never tried the multiplayer itself, I prefer to play horrorgames on my own), the ending of Dead Effect 2 feels extremely abrupt and only leaves you longing for a conclusion which will probably follow in a third installation of the series. At this point I'm left wondering how they're even going to expand on the locations if we already saw most of the ship in the first two games so far.\n\nIf you're looking for something to kill your time with, and you happen to see this game on sale, you might aswell give this zombie-sci-fi game a shot. On average you'll get one hour of playtime for each buck you spend (and that's just for the singleplayer experience) - if that's okay with you, you know what to get. Personally, I hope they'll try to fleshen out their gameplay a bit more since that's pretty much the bread and butter of this genre.","May 30","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I must say I am not recommending this game; though, it came close to being a game I could keep.  Unfortunately, despite what it has going for it, some key drawbacks really prevented me from taking off.\n\nMy frames per second is utter crap.  Even when I turn the settings all the way down to the minimum (where everything looks like N64 graphics) it runs poorly.\n\nAll of the menus and strange interfaces are, to me, reminiscent of a mobile port:  Big text, large buttons, sharp edges, and imprecise values.  For example, when it says “damage: 45” what does that even mean?  Only units of time made sense in terms of upgrades, because I know what seconds are.  For me, it came down to buying weapons and testing them.  Also, I never quite figured out how health works.\n\nThe movement itself is very strange for a shooter of any kind.  First, the responsiveness is lacking.  I turned the sensitivity way down and completely turned off acceleration, which helped but didn’t completely fix it.  Second, there seems to only be two walking speeds:  slow and fast.  Actually, the even slower crouch does exist, but it feels like laying on the floor.\n\nAiming is also weird.  Not that weird is bad, but it needs more explanation.  I realize there is a correlation between standing still and precision, but not a guarantee.  Aiming down sights seems to make a bit of a difference.  Running really kills my accuracy, but I can never be sure how much.  The biggest problem is that accuracy in general feels ambiguous.\n\nThe upgrades (mostly gear) feel like I’m comparing numbers.  “I should go with helmet B because it has bigger numbers than helmet A.”  I guess I don’t feel like numbers automatically make games into rpg-games.  Although I like the idea, the different states associated with gear should be further diversified, and better explained.  That would at least not leave a bad taste in the mouth.\n\nThe skills are a tad underwhelming.  Not that the sprinting enhancement should be cranked up more than 9000!, but rather there should be a wider variety.  Most of the abilities are stun this, stun that, move here, move there, etc.  Other skills are nonsensical (vampire), but at least are interesting.\n\nSex in video games is not my thing.  To me, if I can’t play a game in the living room, it’s too awkward.  The lady with her nipples poking through the shirt is inappropriate for this title.  If in the intro sequence I rescued her from the stripper bar, it would at least make sense.  This is a zombie game, nobody (normal or at least healthy-minded) buys it for nipples.\n\nThe story, as we all know, is a bit unimaginative.  Though, I forgive you because this is a zombie game, and really all we need is an excuse to kill zombies.\n\nI bet this game is fun with more people.  You know, with a group of your mates who you drink beer and laugh at nipple-shirted women with.  The cheeziness is this games best quality.  But alone, this game doesn’t deliver in any significant way that I would consider a marketing point.\n\nI may keep an eye on your future titles, to see if you improve significantly in these ways; however, I am personally giving this one a pass.  This is why I am not recommending it.","May 9","false","2.3"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","27","55","5","2"

I chuckled at the name of the game, Dead Effect because in fact it does remind me a little bit of two other sci fi shooters, Dead Space and Mass Effect.  Dead Effect 2 does in fact show some of it’s inspiration from these games with a touch of Borderlands and Doom thrown into the mix as well.  While the game that you get as a result isn’t exactly wholly unique, it is none the less quite fun and engaging.  With a play style that feels polished, focusing on tight combat zones, cramped hallways, and life or death firefights, it adds to the somewhat oppressive claustrophobic air that the game seems to be shooting for.  Only between missions when you have a chance to shop, upgrade, and talk to NPCs do the cramped quarters take a break and you’re given a somewhat gorgeous hub to breathe in.\n\nThe music is very enjoyable, and that’s something I appreciate because I found even two hours in still having it running.  I normally cut music within 10 minutes of playing a game, but the pseudo organ music helps to end the right vibe to the game.\n\nA huge amount of gear is available, but unfortunately you’re only going to have the money to buy a small fraction of it, so make your choices wisely.  Do you go for the more long ranged rifle?  How about the automatic lead sprayer?  Maybe you’d be better off with a reliable melee weapon?  Then again it’s hard to skip the shotgun.  The game starts you with three classes, and I haven’t had a chance to try out the other two, but the main character I chose, “Gunnar” has a gruff ‘space marine’ esque vibe to him that hearkens back to the doom games all the way back in the 90s.  However you’re not limited to his playstyle when you choose him, you can gear and spec your character to be more ninja-like.  That is a freedom of gameplay that I appreciate.\n\nThe game does have it’s flaws.  Most notably the graphics are on the whole quite amazing.  Some of the effects are gorgeous and some of the character models of the enemies are great.  But that does set the counterpoint when you see a graphic that isn’t.  The first NPC you meet up with for example just looks…. Off.  It’s hard to describe why exactly, maybe her body proportions aren’t right, or her unit’s polygon count is too low, or then again maybe it’s just the distracting nipple bumps on her outfit, much like Rachel from Friends, circa the mid 90s.\n\nLikewise the voice acting is decent, but not great.  The main character is terse, and when he does speak it’s somewhat cliched.  Then again so is the mysterious female npc, the mentally deficient engineer, and the horribly voice acted russian doctor.  This is probably the game’s biggest flaw in my book, you really want everyone to shut up so you can enjoy the games, the gunshots, the dog growls, and the zombie groans.  But unfortunately the mentally deficient engineer has to blubber his own name over and over in hodor like fashion even when you’re on a mission.\n\nThe one thing that I find very interesting and haven’t had a chance to test out is the co-op play.  I like that the ability for friends to drop into a mission as they like is integrated right into the gameplay.  More multiplayer only helps this type of game in my opinion.\n\nAs the final word on this review, I’d say that this game isn’t perfect, but if you want an action FPS in a semi horror / space genre, Dead Effect 2 delivers.  It doesn’t revolutionize the wheel, but it’s absolutely worth the entry price.\n\nNOTE - I was given a free copy of this game in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","May 9","true","3.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","6"

The menus have been optimized more for PC, and all microtransactions have been removed from this version. Although, currently the game still needs a bit of work when it comes to the port. You can't change the resolution, or make it windowed. There's also an awful mouse acceleration and smoothing effect, but luckily you can turn it off.\n\nThe Game:\n==========\nThe game itself is actually quite fun. The gun mechanics feel quite a bit like Borderlands to me. There are a lot of ways to customize your character and weapons as you progress, which keeps the game fresh. You will use skill points to unlock different powers, and can find or purchase new guns to use.\n\nDepending on what character you choose, you will have a unique set of abilities and weapons to start off with, and the characters have their own unique dialogue.\nSpeaking of which, it's incredibly cheesy. The writing reminds me a lot of Duke Nukem and Serious Sam, although not as funny or one-liner-y. The story seems to be taking itself relatively seriously, but with a bit of tongue-in-cheek.\n\nExploring levels and doing small mini games like hacking will reward you with hidden loot and XP. Each level has a number of achievements that you can try to obtain, or replay a level in case you missed them. They add a simple replay value. There are also a number of game modes to try from, as well as a co-op mode.\n\nDon't go in expecting a great story. There's a decent amount of content to keep you playing for a while, and the devs plan to add even more as the game progress and comes out of Early Access. I also must say that the music is a joy to listen to!\nOverall, the game doesn't innovate in any crazy ways, but it's quite fun if you just want to shoot up some zombies and baddies. Fun stuff!\n","March 24","true","4.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

No freezes or stuttering, if I didn't have frame rate displayed I would think it had no slowdowns at all.  Can get very challenging, missions are varied and the setup for choosing them is excellent.  The upgrade setup is very well done in my opinion, I find it quite immersive.  For some reason, in full screen some menu and upgrade screens overflow the monitor in any resolution, but it plays fine in windowed mode. (Could have something to do with field of view, I have a 16:10 monitor)  Just an early access idiosyncracy, I am sure it will be ironed out.  If you liked the original at all, you will probably love this one.\n\n*I went into Nvidia control panel and set everything to match my ingame settings, and I have no more problems with menus overflowing the screen.  I think it had something to do with that 'Dynamic Super Resolution' setting, your mileage may vary.  :)\n\nWith Nvidia control panel setup matching game settings, I am now running at 1680x1050 full screen, DX9, at medium settings flawlessly, at 35  -  60 fps,  (adaptive vsync) rarely below 40.  Turning off the fps display, as I tend to watch it when I should be watching for pulse challenged critters.\n\n**Upgraded my video card to a Nvidia 750 ti, can now run at medium in DX11, and maxed in DX9 at a solid  55 - 60 fps.\nOutstanding for a Beta program, as my system is still light by the specs.","March 4","true","115.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Then ended up minimizing the sensitivity, acceleration and smoothing: really uncomfortable. I think its the game engine problem, really feels like Unity?

I have never played Dead Effect, but as I read different info, saw the pictures in the store I had a feeling this may be the FPS I have been searching for all my life. Sure enough IT WAS!!! It isn't even don't yet? Really? Well let me get down to it.\n\nThis game basiclly takes RPG, and FPS brings them together for some pretty interesting gameplay. Weapons are not class locked so even if you don't choose the sword guy you can still go sword crazy with Gunnar even though he starts with a pistol you can just buy a sword later on. Your character will have armor, implants, and upgrades for those armor parts, and implants. You weapons can be upgraded, and have special upgrade items added to them nothing like scopes just like "more accuracy" or abunch of items along those lines for all weapons, and armor. So far I have yet to notice if armor effects appearance at this point I don't think so, but would be cool if it did.\n\nCo-op is something I haven't tried yet as I have no one to play with, and haven't found any games to join yet.\n\nCombat is interesting. Enemies have patterns you can work with. Melee combat can get interesting if you know what are you doing before hand. For example cyber-dogs are fun to fight because you can move in with a heavy attack (right mouse click), and move back quickly after each strike to dodge their attack. I even challenge myself by increasing difficulty to Hell which btw will increase enemy levels.\n\nLevels are interesting bit of game changers. Weak weapons are worthless. Always buy better weapons until you get a level 4-5 weapons with which you can upgrade and play around with to make as good as a level 8 weapons. I found you want to build up wealth over time to get better, and better gear. Why? Because the shop keeps changing out its items to some times include legendary, and mythical items with insane prices that make you want to cry when you don't have the money for it. You can get lucky with drops. I once got a legendary shotgun fighting off zombies.\n\nRarity only means more bonuses nothing much outside of that it seems. It is always best to get the highest rarity you can get your hands on. Unless weapons are involved. Then it is a matter of "Can I use this?" Because let me just say some weapons are strange, and difficult to use. I had this plasma laser once and it was awful. Had to hold the fire button to charge it up like a mini-gun then it just unleashes a laser of DOOM on your enemies. Problem is it FILLS THE SCREEN, and makes it so difficult to aim that you just end up waving the laser around, wasting ammo, and probably looking stupid to all the delta soldiers in the process.\n\nGame saving is interesting. You save the moment you return to the resistance base. Everything you do is saved. So there is no shut off game to avoid things. If you screw up you screw up no take back. All missions can be repeated, and have their difficulty increased. All missions have bonuses to give other rewards. All missions have at least 4 achievements related to each. There are alot of missions. You may find yourself playing many hours of this to beat this game if your playing alone. I am playing alone, and just barely managed level 4 where you have to get the crystal made. Nearly died from impalement by a boss that throws spiked clubs at you, and a TNT throwing zombie... which might I ask... WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TNT ON IN THIS PLACE!? Also how is a zombie lighting TNT to toss at me? Wouldn't it make more sense if it were lobbing gernades at me?\n\nThe only issue I came across was when starting the game the camera was really glide like, and fast. I had to pop open options drop all graphics to lowest possible, and fiddle witht he aim sensativity until it finally worked for me. Now I aim just fine.\n\nWhen it boils down to it. If yuur looking for a fun FPS to pass the time with THIS IS IT, and whatever it will become when early access is over will probably be the real game changer for everyone. I have a feeling it could be that game you can get into, and have fun with others. At this time you could invest in this game, and enjoy it now, or wait.","February 26","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are one of thoses gamers that likes Sci-Fi, Level-up, roleplay games then this game is for you.\n\n\nI would like to say that this game as much as it may be debateable but it's feels it's inspired by lots of games. Examples are DOOM, Duke Nukem, Killing Floor, Quake etc.\n\n\nI think the game is mostly inspired by the ALIEN movie since it's set in space and an outbreak of ALIENS/Zombies/Mutants etc.\n\nThis maybe an early access but this game is Badass and i've really enjoyed it. It's got a great story and I like how Badfly Interactive have used the protagonist from the first game (Gunner Davis) which really fits well with both games.\n\n\nI do have have a question for the Devs.... Will Professor Wagner return in a Co-op Hard mission. Will he be ressurected in a future update?

There is a RPG System for skills and you can upgrade yourself with plugins and armor.\n\nI started the game, where you can choose between three characters, I chooses the bow & sword guy, because I like this kind of weapons. There are also an assault rifle guy, and shotgun girl. I play with keyboard and mouse and first movement was insane, I just tipped my mouse and the char was making 15 turns. :D So I adjusted the sensitivity, now I’m fine.  Now if have to move there, click there and kill zombies they got released to stop the army who try to get over the ship, problem is they stop me too. As I can see, you can play the game in co-op what will bring more fun probably. (Didn’t tested it). By the way, never saw such big crosshair. XD\n\nWith every level you can unlock a skill and upgrade them, with founded money you can buy/upgrade weapons/plugins/armor.\n\nYou find your missions in the middle of the control-room where you choose the actually one or previous maps, bad thing if you choose the first map/mission again you have to redo the tutorial and you can’t skip the cutscene, it’s a little bit annoying.\n\nGraphic\nThe graphic is decent for a mobile game but could be a little bit more polished for pc gaming, since it is early access it could be done.\n\nSound\nI like that the game have voice acting but its monotone without any emotions. Some other sounds like hitting with sword the wall, sounds strange.\n\nSummary\nIts a good game with room for improvement, i can recommend it, but you should get it on a sale or in bundle, for me it is a little bit pricy.\n\n\nThanks for reading","April 10","true","8.2"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","3"

I am positive that you will find this to be a good improvement over the previous tittle.\n\n::: ControlsControls are still showing their origins. It's not bad for a port, though it could use some improvement as a PC game. There are several actions in the controls mapping that is, well, redundant for PC's KB/M, still, redundant is better than missing ;D\n\nFor controllers, maybe, though I don't think that I had use the quick-turn action before in any other FPS/TPS game, not on PC.\n\nThe default mouse setting is kind of floaty, likes in mobile FPS games. Not in a bad way, but more on the preference. (too fast for me)\n\nThese mappings/settings can be changed. You can remap all actions, change aim speed, mouse smoothing, mouse acceleration in the settings to suit your preference. It just that the default settings are kinds of weird.\n\n::: UIYeah, it is a mobile-port alright. UI may need some improvements if the devs are intended to make the game, the PC game.\n\nCurrently, several UIs are big, really, too big, that it becomes annoyance, which is obviously a result from the game being on its previous platform, so, I feel that DEVs should improve this to be more suitable for PC as this tittle is intended the be a premium tittle for PC.\n\nI would love to see more options for the HUD, for example; toggle xhair, resizes hud elements, change colors, and etc.\n\n::: Graphic and FXImho, it looks nice and shiny with the improved graphic, compared to the original. The game comes with several settings to play with including ssao, and dof, which can be disable if you don't like it.\n\nPerformance-wise, my current PC (i5-4650k, 8gb ram, 760gtx) can ultra it at 1080p with a little frame drops during recording. Although, it's start dropping to around 30 when things get messy, and so I choose to have more stable frames than the beauty by lower to high-ultra (still looking good).\n\nCurrently, there is the weird performance problem when COOP, which can be found much less in SINGLE, dev already announced to fix it.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a problem concerning the graphic settings. When you try changing it mid-game, sometimes, it glitches the game, and must be restart to restore it.\n\nThe stuttering can be horrible, not that it drops badly, but the drops cause the stuttering, which might be a result from how the engine handle it. On Ultra, my FPS are around 40-60, which shouldn't be a problem, normally.\n\n::: GameplayIt is a solid FPS, added a few RPG elements in, game. There are skills / weapons / equipments / upgrades / consumables. There is a currency system, with stores for each category.\n\nThe game gears toward CASUAL shooter, however, the gunplays / bladeplays are satisfying. Guns are gun, not a toy. Melees are interesting to play with, and it is comparable with guns. Melee can be as effective as guns can be, imho, a little too OP.\n\nThe game use the Hub system, where you come back to your hub after every mission to manage stuffs. and choose the mission to play when ready.\n\nThere are 4 modes, which are Campaign / Free Mode / Wave-based Survival / Timed Survival. Each mission can be replayed later, and almost all of them can be played with friends.\n\nCOOP play is, well, you play the game with friends, instead of playing it alone. There are not many aspect that require cooperation from other players. Currently, it just that you can play and kill things together as simple as that. you cannot trade/exchange, or interact with others.\n\n::: Current Statusas of the time writing this review, there are some core functions locked away from players. Player rank is max at 9 at the moment, The dev states that they are working/testing them, and will release more contents later on.\n\nHere is the opening missions gameplay. It's 1080p, downsampling to 720p at 60% quality.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756097\n::: TL;DRIt's a solid game for the price. If you have no problem with it being a mobile-port FPS/RPG, where you cannot jump across small obstacles or a robot-like animations. This tittle might interested you. The devs are working on the tittle, so if you are not ok with incomplete game, avoid this for now.","February 22","true","9.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","4"

No crashes, no glitches. I have not even been able to find a bug. This plays like Unreal Tournament III, with zombies. Having a lot of fun with all the armor and weapon customization options, the addition of a Borderlands-style loot system really makes the game shine and keeps things from getting repetitive.\n\nCouple suggestions, if any of the devs are reading reviews...\n(1) Add models for the different armor sets in 3rd person. Some of the sets are fairly rare, and take a decent amount of work to get. It'd be nice to display them in coop.\n(2) Add a functional jump mechanic so you can leap over crawling zombies, and also hop barriers to get to lower walkways.\n(3) Add a 'lean out of cover' mechanic/animation for both the player AND for the Delta 13 soldiers. Nothing fancy, just something functional. Bind it to Q and E default. Secondly, add use of that mechanic as a separate AI package that the Delta 13 troops switch to when they are fighting the player, but not when they are fighting zombies. Their current package of smoothly advancing/crossing/firing between cover points makes perfect sense for fighting zombies, it's the most efficient and is the same thing that I do. However, that would never happen when fighting an opponent who also has firearms IRL, and these guys are supposed to be very highly trained, no? Have them fight from cover when engaging the player, and not move from it unless they've been flushed or flanked.\n\n(Update at 11 hours). Revolvers and sniper rifles are useless in current form. Could be cut from the game entirely, especially the revolvers. Firing rate is abysmal, heavy recoil. For coop, sure, you might want a sniper, but most of the rooms are too small for it.\n\nMelee is ok, but could use an overhaul. Too easy to get overwhelmed. This game plays best right now with the most powerful assault rifle you can afford and as many implants for recoil/accuracy as you can load. Headshot party.\n\nOther than that, so far this is great fun. Currenty playing with Gunnar, going to try a run with Jane to see if the mechanics feel different.","May 7","true","40.2"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","14","30","5","2"

I mean, I felt so accomplished just clearing levels to 100%. Very satisfying.\n\nNow the devs are bringing us the sequel and I'm not going to lie, I was super damn excited. I was looking forward to a beefier experience than the first game, an actual story that implied more depth and reason than the first game, an upgrade system that let us customize our characters a little bit, and, my personal favorite and utmost want, a varied of characters and unique gear types for the various "classes". I just cannot tell you how much these inclusion meant to not only me but the overall community because FINALLY we're able to really delve deep and sink our teeth into the meat of our played characters.\n\nLet me be brutally honest: As it stands, this moment in EA, the game is amazing in theory and visual ideals but falls quite short in actual application. However, that being said, don't let that intimidate you or put you off this game! There are glitches, performance issues, and some horrible screen stretching and ability issues that make playing a little difficult at times but despite these problems, which the devs have been very upfront about and are hard at working optimizing and refining for us, the game is still a good play.\n\nIf you're a fan of the first Dead Effect or just horror games that involve greedy corporations, science gone bad, horrifying abominations then you're going to enjoy Dead Effect 2.\n\nBesides, do you really want to deny yourself the opportunity to dive headfirst into a throng of rotting monstrosities with nothing but a wickedly tempered sword, frag grenades, a shotgun, and a smile?\n\nOf course not.","February 25","true","3.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","1"

The graphics are on par with killing floor two in terms of visual style (Lotsa contrast of dark and shine, etc)\n\nThe guns feel better, but the controls still feel airy and like they were meant for a mobile phone (Which they may have been) and of course still no jump button.\n\nThe story is less-awful, but the characters are still very dorky and bland. Every woman has outfits that are stupidly revealing and nipples that prod through constantly (Im not sure if there is a word for that, but eh, its very "Typical male" stuff)  You can pick from one of three, a sarge type character who will remind you of your grandpa who fought in Nam and is sure he was abducted by aliens, a female soldier who tries wayyyy to hard to sound masculine and tough (And has an IQ of like, -4) And finally a Ninja who talks like batman because... Ninjas are cool and... talking like you just snorted pepperspray makes you dark cool and mysterious.\n\nThe biggest complaint i have so far is the dorky weapon system, you get two weapons per mission, and are stuck with that exact same stupid taser thing from the first game, despite the fact this game has a TON of cool melee weapons, youd think you could take those instead, nooooooo those replace your PISTOL slot, you will ALWAYS be taking that stupid taser...\n\nAlso, silly point, but the armors in the concept arts do NOT show up on your character models, do not buy expecting massive amounts of cosmetic character customization.\n\nTo summarize, so far its much more playable and fun than the first, but its still a wonky game in its own, I haven't tried the coop yet, I will try to as soon as i can get it working!\n\nRecommended, but wait for it to go on sale so its no big loss if you dont like it.","February 26","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First, on the highest graphics settings (I have a late 2014 iMac Retina 5K) the mouse was very erratic and hard to control. Had to move very carefully to move, little alone aim. Dropped screen resolutions down and the game is playable, but the mouse control is still a bit difficult.\n\nSecond, finished the opening episode, quit (not sure if there's a separate save or not). Came back next day and my weapons are gone. And whatever it is you're supposed to do next doesn't appear evident.

Most of them are in a hibernation state but a small number of scientists, led by Professor Wagner, and without any restrictions on research from earth are working day in day out on new experiments. They created many new technologies and even managed to conquer death. After using these new technologies on themselves they create new and scary creatures, and lucky you, you are about to wake up in the middle of it!\n\nDead Effect 2 is a FPS/RPG game where you take control of one of three characters available to you at the start of the game. You can either choose to be an Assault ops, a heavy weapons or a close combat specialist and each one has their own specific abilities. Dannette, a super scientist will wake you up and guide you through your first mission. Make sure to collect all credits lying around, look around for the secret orbs and tablets, and don’t forget to open the lockers - you might find ammunition and additional credits! Throughout each mission, you will encounter different types of Zombies, as well as soldiers to kill. It can become extremely hectic and you might die once or twice.  At the end of each mission, you will receive rewards. Actually you will be presented with three options and you just choose one.  You will also get upgrades and unlock points which can be used either to learn or upgrade an ability.\n\nBack at your command centre, you will be able to talk to different characters. Dannette is the person to talk to in regards to upgrades or unlocking new abilities. Minikin will upgrade your weapons, and Dr Bielick your implants!\n\nThe controls are what you would expect for a FPS and are easy to master. I must say that the mouse sensitivity was the only thing I had to get used too. Very sensitive in my opinion. Graphically this game is superb and I really enjoy the atmosphere created by the music. If you liked Dead Effect, you will love this sequel and the incredible aspect is, it‘s an early access game!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Three characters to choose from\n-	Plenty of upgrades to unlock\n-	Good story-line\n-	Splendid graphics and animations\n-	Great re-playability\n-	Stacks of achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n-	Mouse sensitivity\n\nDead Effect 2 is graphically stunning and a very solid FPS game!  Really a game to own!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The voice acting is horrendous, the amount of references in the first ten minutes are cringeworthy, and at a certain point you are just doing the same thing over and over again (Clear out room, go to next room, clear out room, go to next room, etc) There is a diverse amount of weaponry to combat a insanely limited amount of enemies. The handwave is that cloning is the reason enemies have only one appearance.\n\nWhat the game lacks in design, art direction, and creativity it makes up for through doing one thing very well: It is legitimately attempting to tell a story. A poorly translated, B movie grade story, but it has one. It explains that levelling exists because otherwise the strain will overload your nueral net and kill you; it makes you have to rescue NPC's before you can use the shops or menus; and it makes you do some pretty stupid things just to stay consistant.\n\nThe resulting death-fest is dripping with character and visually if you ignore the lack of enemy variation it can end up looking fairly terryfing (As long as you aren't well versed enough in video games to recognize where they got the assets from)","May 6","true","10.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

A complex story, better animations, weapons, everything you could ask for.\nI'm a very big fan of the first game and I must say that the developers have outdone themselves with the second part, this time around they really have pushed the Unity engine to it's limits. The game uses Unity 5 but it looks like it was made with Cry Engine. And trust me, the game doesn't look like the phone version of it at all.\nOriginally, an mobile title which released in October 2015, it was later ported to Steam with microtransactions removed (which is AWESOME!!!). Dead Effect 2 is a direct sequel to the excellent 2013's Dead Effect where the story continues right after you kill Dr. Wagner.\nUnlike the first game, Dead Effect 2 starts off with you given the option to choose among 3 playable characters with different class specialty and play style. Gunnar Davis is the heavy weapons specialist, Jane Frey takes point as the assault specialist and Kay Rayner whom is the close combat specialist, for those who prefer melee weapons. Each of these characters have their own "unique abilities" which you can improve on later in the game.\nThere are different game modes (which you can access after progressing with the storyline), in which you can play by yourself or go co-op with others.\n\nAs the title suggests, you'll be fighting TONS of zombies, with a variety of mutations, shapes and sizes! And if that bores you, don't worry because the game also has cyber dogs, extremely dangerous soldiers, security drones and insane boss fights to keep you occupied. Although not nearly as good as the other big titles out there, Dead Effect 2 feels extremely solid!\n\nPros- The new addition to the PC version (which the phone version doesn't have) is the awesome co-op multiplayer mode!\n- It has so much content and rare loots that could let you play for hundreds of hours and never get bored.\n- A very big variety of weapons.\n- Dead Effect 2 is EXTREMELY fun and highly addictive!\n- Co-op mode works great and it's the perfect setting for the gamer couples out there.\n- For a mobile title, the game has very good graphics.\n- No microtransactions in sight. They were remove entirely at the launch of the game on PC and everything in the game can be bought by the in-game currency.\n- Enemy A.I. is applaudable as they can react to the player and move accordingly. This provide an additional layer of difficulty to the game.\n- It has a LOT of achievements.\n- The game uses a variety of minigames during the mission (hacking, turning valves, opening lockers, etc).\n\nCons- The frame rates drops drastically at some moments, so the game still needs some improvements.\n- The animation feels sluggish most of the time. Enemies are slow at one point and suddenly they become unnaturally fast when attacking.\n- Nobody plays the multiplayer, Steam Spy recorded only 64 max players as the peak record. Unless you have friends which owns the game, you can forget about playing multiplayer since finding an open lobby is pretty much a rare occurrence.\n- The game doesn't have any jump animation which feels weird. Being a super soldier and all but you can't even jump over a small ledge.\n- The game design is to be grindy as story missions progress. They become harder and the equipment needs stronger stats at each level, so you have to buy new weapons or upgrade your existing ones.\n- The voice acting is okay.\n- The mouse acceleration needs some improvements.\n- You can't skip the cutscenes.\n\nConclusionEven though Dead Effect 2 has quite some flaws currently, they really managed to come up with a very wonderful game which has a perfect combination for the genres (RPG + Shooter style) and with the right amount of work and dedication into the game, I'm confident that this game will hit the tables!\nWhile multiplayer doesn't have many players yet, the singleplayer worths every penny and the co-op is a really fun place to spend you're time in. This game receives from me an 4.5/5, with hope in mind that most of the cons will get fixed.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

I was looking for a new title and for £10 I thought that I would be satisfied. However I was mistaken. From the 0.4 hours I have played of this game I am disapointed and requested a refund. Firstly, even when running two gtx960's I recieve lag when looking around, which is extremely uncommon. Secondly, the game features no AA so all you see is jagged lines. Although in the screenshots it clearly shows that there is some form of AA. Lastly, I had great difficulty adjusting controls and mouse sensitivity as they just kept on returning to the previous values.\n\nI understand that this game is in Early Access, however it should be more refined because it has been out on different platforms. Moral of the story is? If you like this kind of genre then buy it now to save money, but don't play it until it has been patched over a couple of times!","February 24","false","0.4"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","9","23","2","16"

Originally a mobile title released in October 2015 and later ported to Steam last February, Dead Effect 2 is a direct sequel to the excellent 2013's Dead Effect where the story continues right after the fall of Dr. Wagner.\n\nUnlike the first entry, the sequel allows you to choose between 3 playable characters with different class specialty and play style. Gunnar Davis is the heavy weapons specialist, Jane Frey takes point as the assault specialist and, for the ninjas in all of us, Kay Rayner whom is the close combat specialist. Aside from the weapon preferences, each class provides unique abilities tailored to the specific play style of the character. Doing missions and scoring kills provide you the much needed experience to level up and consequently able to unlock and upgrade both active and passive abilities. So, go out there and experiment!\n\nOne of the biggest thing that surprises me in this game is how extensive the loot system is! Imagined it as almost similar to the Borderlands' style of loot system. There's tons of weapon types, ranging from the conventional pistols and shotguns to the highly destructive plasma cannon and good ole' chainsaw, different Gears (armors) and also, Implants, because no super soldier would be so super without them! On top of that, there's also various rarities from Common to Mythical, where the higher the rarity would provide better stats and more upgrade opportunities. There's also Codex which acts as socketable material and provide significant bonuses to the socketed items.\n\nAs the title suggests, you'll be fighting TONS of zombies, with a variety of mutation, shapes and sizes! If that bores you, don't worry because there's also, cyber dogs, extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soldiers, security drones and insane boss fights to keep you occupied! Although not nearly as good as the other big titles out there, Dead Effect 2 guns feels pretty solid and scoring headshots are always enjoyable as it was the first time!\n\nA new and very welcomed addition to the PC port of the game is the co-op multiplayer mode! Each game can be joined by two others and the difficulty is scaled based on how many players are present. Co-op are not restricted to only the story-related missions but are also available to be played in other modes such as Survival (time-based continuous wave, Lone Wolf (short scenario missions), Biohazard (standard Horde mode) and many more. Additionally, BadFly Interactive has just released the now beta PVP mode. So, the game has plenty to offer to everyone!\n\nDespite all the praises, the game still suffers from quite a few issues, ranging from the technical side to the game play. Still, the game released as an Early Access title is a sign that the game may yet evolve into something as good as the other big budget titles. As usual, I'll list the pros & cons of the game below:\n\n\nPROS\nDead Effect 2 is EXTREMELY fun and highly addictive! From the always enjoyable gorefest to the promise of rare loots, the game offers hours upon hours of playtime.\nCo-op mode works great and are perfect for the setting of the game.\nFor a mobile title, the game looks pretty amazing on PC.\nNo microtransactions in sight. They were remove entirely and everything in the game can be bought by the in-game currency.\nEnemy A.I. is applaudable as they can react to the player and move accordingly. This is especially apparent when fighting soldiers. This provide an additional layer of difficulty to the game.\nSteam basic functionalities are all present and functional except for Cloud saving and VAC (probably due to the PVP mode newly released).\nThere's quite a variety of minigames during the mission (hacking, turning valves, opening lockers, etc.)\nNEUTRAL\nBeing a mobile port, the UI for the PC could've been a lot better. Now, it just feels too blocky and unnecessarily large. It doesn't affect the gameplay whatsoever but a little tweak tailored to the PC community would be nice.\nCONS\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the game seems to be highly unoptimized for an AMD system! I tried bumping everything up to the max the first time around and the game is barely playable to me with frequent frame drops and grainy textures. I had to play on Medium or Low just to be able to play smoothly. For comparison, my rig can play Far Cry 4, PAYDAY 2, Rocket League, Wolfenstein The New Oder, etc. on Ultra or Very High settings with no issues.\nThe animation feels sluggish most of the time. Enemies could be slow at one point and suddenly became unnaturally fast when attacking. Also, what's up with the crappy hand animations at base?! Honestly, you're better off without them.\nThe story is non-memorable with not-so pleasing NPCs being the center point. Minikin, the chief engineer on the ship suffers brain damage and speaks in a simple language and Danette, the scientist that saves you at the start, have a default character model with clearly erected nipples. Don't get me wrong, everyone appreciates the female anatomy but come on, this is just inappropriate.\nThe player base is practically dead with Steam Spy recording only 64 max players as the peak record. Unless you have friends with the game, you can forget about playing multiplayer since finding an open lobby is pretty much a rare occurrence.\nThe game doesn't have any jump animation. It felt weird, really, being a super soldier and all but you can't even jump over a small ledge.\nThe game is design to be grindy as story missions get progressively hard and equipment have stronger stats at each level, so you have to buy new ones or upgrade your existing guns.\nThe voice acting is surprisingly HORRIBLE. No offense but I've lost count on how many time I've cringed hearing Jane's lines.\n\nEven though BadFly's Dead Effect 2 has quite the amount of flaws currently, they really managed to come up with a working formula and with the right amount of work and dedication into the game, I'm confident that this game will hit it right at home for the fans of the genre! I give it a hopeful 3/5.\nHonestly, I'm hooked just because of the amazing loot system and the fun co-op. I'd say wait a bit for a discount before you jump in or at least until they've rolled out a few more major updates. On the other hand, if you have friends with similar interests and are looking for a solid co-op title, then by all means, go for it! The game is very much playable in it's current state and offers tons of contents to keep you guys occupied.\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StyxHighwayProject/recommended/394760/","StyxHighwayProject","Mecha Carrier I.S.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StyxHighwayProject/","760 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs of this posting the game suffers from, at least for some players, an odditiy with mouse movement. Fast motions will read like slow mouse motions. And no, it's not my mouse. I run a tournament pro spec Corsair mouse, geared for FPS play no less. I can pop fast shots a plenty on other games with it, fine movement speeds on my desktop, but I play this game and the point of view moves very little if you quick motion the mouse.\n\nThis is a bug that needs to be handled first and far most if it's to be considered a relevent tittle.\n\nThat aside, it's cheesy. But it knows it's cheesy and rolls with it. Some of the altered versions of quotes are almost kind of funny, but feel like they try a little too hard.\n\nThe fine aim seems to aim a tad bit low from where starter bullets actually shoot, from the hip almost as bad, and when you start with average joe armor, your sprint is only two seconds to start or so. Yeah, that's a little silly. I know there is a leveling system, but I could run longer than that trying to drag fat age Opera behind me, and she carries a lot of emotional weight among others.\n\nSo the good? Looks about like the yester year of DOOM. Not cutting edge, but not terrible. It's definately not looking to be a super high end piece, and that's ok, but yeah. I want to like it for it's loose take on the story, and when you get away from the wonky issues, and it's one liner approaches, the story actually feels like it could be something. Not, again something top notch, but lovable for a sci fi nerd like myself.\n\nRight now, I don't feel like it's a severe loss yet, but when it can't work properly with mouse aiming, this is the sort that made Deus Ex Invisible War fall short initially, and that was a mouse movement delay. THis is blatantly taking Mouse acceleration and creating a deceleration effect in quick movements, and since NOT ALL OF US are facing it, some will smile, point the finger, and act like it's not happening and so it could be ignored for a while, but I hope they'll fix it.\n\nRight now that mouse issue really kills it for me wanting to move forward and test further, and as such I'll be checking in on this one again future. But for what it is, it has a blatantly broken mechanic, and a root mechanic that makes an FPS what it is at it's ultimate core, being able to aim. Fail that, you've failed to make an FPS.\n\nPlease fix, and then I'll more than likely recomend. Others like it for a reason, it's fun kinda cheesey yet a sci fi design, that if they wanted too, could actually really go somewhere. Just not when my mouse aim in quick movements goes essentially NO WHERE.\n\nTHE FINAL WORD:\n\nI actually want to like this game, probably because of the theme. Hey it's a sci fi zombie fest again, and they give you almost a more basic Deus Ex vibe to enhancing your body. But it's Early Access and the bugs are still very much there, especially the sensativity issue.\n\nRight now a lower price tag sale, yeah my thumb is down for now, but not be bad. But as of this writing, play the game with a controller if you run into the mouse sensativitiy that I did. For now it's kind of playable as is, if you use a controller to get past that issue if needed.\n\nDon't be surprised if I toggle this game back and forth from thumbs up and down. It's really the closest thing we have to a middle ground rating, and I really do want to see it fixed up and where it all goes.","March 13","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

As it stands, it needs some work and a lot of refinement, but it's well on its way.  Don't bank on multiplayer, as there aren't many people playing online.  The loot and leveling system is great and rewarding.  Not very optimized and it has quite a few bugs and kinks to work out, but it's still very playable and overall it's a solid shooter with rpg elements.\n_____________________________\n\nGraphics: Pretty good.  I've seen better, but considering this is from a small indie studio (as far as I know) I'd say it looks as good as it needs to.\n\nGameplay: Animations can be stiff or slow, but it gets the job done well.  I have only played 5 hours as of this review, but I have fun playing it.\n\nStory: The story is really simple, you're on a ship with people trying to kill you and you're trying to survive.  There's not a lot of content in it right now and even less story content, but the content it has right now is good and complete enough to enjoy.\n\nMultiplayer: Worst part so far, and it isn't even because of the game itself.  There's almost no one playing this game online.  I had to wait 30 minutes to find one person, which means that you're probably going to be playing most of this by yourself for now.  It just needs more players.\n\nThe RPG elements, like the loot and the leveling process is really good and interesting.  I can't wait until I level up to get some new skills.","March 3","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Nevertheless the game is a lot of fun, specially once you get to the good gear. The loot system is simple and fun, and the perks are no rocket sience. It reminded me a bit of the first KF, you kinda need to get used to the controls(and it's clunkyness)\n\nPros:\n• Simplyfied loot system\n• Huge amount of different gametypes (survival, objective etc)\n• Co-op\n• Decent GFX\n• Good Sci-Fi atmosphere with lots of detail\n• Good amount of different enemy types\n• Potential to become big (if the devs keep at it)\n\nCons:\n• B-Movie story, it really is bad...but even this has it's charm\n• HUGE ICONS EVERYWERE!! Left over from the port no doubt, and hopefully will be adjusted in future updates\n• Starting players might be put off by their lack of skill to survive... (Hang in there, it's worth it!)\n• Enemies get stuck in some maps (and sometimes disappear to respawn somewere else)\n• Some enemies are a bit meh...

Having upgraded abilities such as the electric ball or bullet time to max makes a crucial difference in being able to manage them for a prolonged time.\n\nI also forgot to mention that you can buy ammo and med packs in advance, which helps prevent situations in which you run dry and there are no pickups. As far as I can tell, there is no limit and the game pauses in single player when you are in the inventory. The only question is will you hit the inventory button in time.\n\nTHE LONG REVIEW: This game, a sequel to the humbly budgeted but still fun Dead Effect 1, expands into a Borderlands/Destiny-esque style of play, with a lot more elements effecting your shooting rather than just "Upgrade these stock weapons". I'll start with the rundown and positives.\n\nWHAT IT IS:  An FPS. (Yes, A sci-fi FPS with zombies, I know, wonders never cease, keep reading)\n\nHowever now it's an RPG/FPS similar to Destiny/Borderlands - Zombies and soldiers drop gear ranging from guns to augments to upgrades in the usual color coded scheme, plain colors being lame, and the more offensively the color, the better the weapon. Your health is shown on screen, and does not regenerate by itself. You have to find regeneration stations that take time to recharge after being used. You can also carry an absurd amount of medkits in your pants. (Hey, you're a cyborg. What's a morphine overdose when you've got heart, chest, and brain implants?)\n\nUNLIKE Destiny and Borderlands, there's not ten thousand side quests nipping at your heels. Side missions are in their own contained areas or are extra challenges to do when replaying the story mission for achievements. There's no quest log.\n\nThere's a campaign that unlocks more side mission areas and stuff to do, as well as more gameplay elements, but if you feel like you need more money, or you only have about 5-15 minutes to spare, side missions are perfect since they rarely run longer than that.\n\nYou got your generic missions that you can do over and over again, timed survival, wave elimination survival, and Lone Wolf "Fight Human Soldiers" missions. You can set the difficulty and length of almost all these missions.\n\nShooting wise, it's straight forward. Aim down the sights, shoot zombies, become aware of their HP and XP. You have a taser arm thing that's so powerful it makes heads explode but eats ability energy, a one handed secondary, a primary and grenades.\n\nYou can take a melee weapon, including space hanzo steel katanas of course, in the secondary slot. The primary slot is where everything from shotguns to plasma guns to grenade launchers go. There are not only a large number of weapons, but also a variety of types that have effect how you play. Don't take the shotgun and Katana when you need to be fighting a small quick annoying drone thing that shoots at range! Also, ONLY THE STIG PISTOL HAS THE MOTION TRACKER. I mention this because the game doesn't.\n\nYou can also do Co-op for just about any mission, but there's nothing like raids as of yet. It's purely if you want to do it. You won't turn a corner and run into a level 40 orange boss thing that stomps you out of nowhere.\n\nIt's all pretty fun and accessible, but there are some problems...\n\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD (AND BAD)\n\nThe hud is kind of obtuse and isn't really intuitive. You have health, stamina and energy, represented by a colored bar of squares for each. It's really hard to gauge how much of each you have as there are no numbers, or even an option for it. This is pretty distressing when you have nothing in the health bar but aren't dead.\n\nThere's actually a lot of information the game doesn't tell you - it's not clear how long the health stations take to recharge, and it's clearly time based. Some enemies clearly have an armor stat such as robotic drones and bosses - but how much? There's no way to tell how effective your weapons are until you shoot them. By then it's too late to change weapons, you can only do that in the hub!\n\nThere are some optional objectives in some missions such as "avoid detection". The AI for this desperately needs reworking. In the Water Purification mission, you are encouraged but not required to avoid a patrolling drone. The Drone's pattern of movement is hard to figure out, and doesn't work the way you'd think - I "snuck by" about three times by simply crouch walking to the door as it slowly hovered over my shoulder, but when I was "caught" it was trying to finish the level where it looked at me across the room and sounded the alarm!\n\nSpeaking of robots, Boss enemies are just terrible. They have great visual design and their attacks are impressive, but they're terrible to fight! You need a really high damage weapon, but most weapons don't seem to do much. Sniper Rifles are really effective, but grenade launchers just do a piddling amount of damage to these armored enemies.\n\nI don't think I should be emptying all of my weapon stores on one solitary enemy, even a boss, and that's when I'm doing nothing but headshots. If I had to make a suggestion - give me something to shoot at or some kind of opportunity to do more damage than usual. Shooting a zombie cosmonaut in their broken faceplate seems intuitive, but doesn't help much.\n\nOverall, a fun, shlock-tastic game, but still in need of some rebalancing.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\nThey're still adding content, so I don't know how much of this will be valid.\n\nI could really use a number popup, even if it's only for the player's information only. Also The STIG is the only gun with a motion tracker - you should mention that, it makes a weak weapon incredibly useful.\n\nPlease rework the boss fights. It's a time-consuming slog at the moment with every weapon I've tried, and I've tried 10 and 12 gauge Shotguns, ARs, Katanas, Knives, Mining picks, Machetes, Grenades (HE, HV and Tripmine), revolvers, STIGS, Gauss guns, plasma rifles, Sniper rifles, grenade launchers, and even my trusty stun glove. I think the stun glove has done the most consistent damage to bosses like the Golem or Minigun zombie.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Easily the best B-grade Syfy channel movie I've ever played, bad acting and all!\n\n\n\n\n(But seriously, it's good cheesy fun)","March 7","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Take caution if you play this on hard it will be extremely difficult to finish, you will need help. The mulitplayer is the mode where you make the most money do not disregard multiplayer. You will not be able to afford the goodies without it, period. You must constantly upgrade and sell your weapons for much better ones with a higher degree of damage not to mention your armor and implants. All this is very rewarding if you like digging into your character however if your looking for regular FPS zombie game this can be a huge turnoff.","May 30","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One for himself and one for myself. We were in search of a new, fun co-op gam to play to break up some of the monotony of CS:GO. We\'ve had the game for several months now. This games has some of the WORST negative mouse acceleration I\'ve ever seen. No matter how much I mess with the settings, I CANNOT get this ♥♥♥♥ to turn off. It\'s gotten like 50% better over the last couple of patches, but how do they expect us to play when the faster you swipe your mouse the slower the reticle moves...? As for performance, I\'ve had little to no issues besides random crashes, but my friend who has an i5 processor constantly has severe stuttering and other performance related issues. Whatever, we\'ll check back in like a year and see if the issues are fixed. Stay away for now unless you love reverse mouse acceleration.","June 1","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Bought it and it was pretty good except one thing. The voice acting is very bad (sorry creators). But thats really the only thing, the graphics didnt go well with my computer but i just turned them down and it worked with almost no lag. I would recomend this game for zombie game lovers!","May 31","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
