It's got a lot of heart. The animations, the graphics, the voice acting, it's all wonderfully cinematic, and it's a loose sci-fi blue collar theme, with space contractors in a space wasteland planet trying to do science in the face of aliens everywhere. Your dude is a bearded contractor who gets messages from his wife and country music plays in his giant robot. Gamers in general don't see much manual labor so it's always nice to see stories that focus on that sort of hard work. That said, thematically, it's a bit of an odd mix since your average mission is to "go fix X, okay, all done? Good, now get back to the robot and march back oh wait there's 400 aliens between you and your robot. And this isn't a problem at all." What was the want ad for this? Space engineer, must be able to perform QTE repairs while shooting 4000 aliens. Still, they want it to work so bad, they fill this story with real heart.\n\nBut for all the glitz and polish it's just not that much fun. You walk places and walk some more then get in a robot and walk places with slow robot clomping and FINALLY you get to dive roll and shoot aliens and that part is actually kinda fun in a low budget Red Faction Armageddon sense but then you get to walk back and talk some more and walk and walk and climb and it's all just such a waste of time and then they expect you to go back to earlier locations for some dumb sidequests and there's just no way, no how.\n\nIt's clear the man hours went into this game that should, by the book, have created a solid fun, but forgettable AAA game. But the talent somehow didn't make its way to the final product. And it's a shame because so much love went into this but it just was not enough.\n\nI would have watched the movie of this.","October 12, 2014","false","1.6"," 640 of 728 people (88%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","88","640","728","50","17"

That being said...\n\nThis game is not good. It certainly starts out well, the story is interesting, the graphics are pretty (especially given how well-optimized it is), the sound design is good, and the voice acting is solid. HOWEVER:\n\n-The game is unbelievably easy (I played 95% of it with just the infinite-ammo pistol) except for random HUGE difficulty spikes\n-The game world is incredibly small and stifling\n-The "hostile" and "uninhabitable" world poses no threat at all (you can walk around in major storms to your heart's content)\n-Controls are lazy and stupid (P is to pick up ammo! Why not the "use" button??)\n-The cover system is the epitome of crappily-made. They don't even tell you it's there, which makes sense, since it DOES. NOT. WORK.\n-The strategy for killing the akrids (including the bosses) is always the exact same (dodge as they charge, shoot when they're stunned)\n-Fighting in the rig is beyond pointless (it's ALWAYS better to get out and fight in-person)\n-The boss fights are ridiculously stupid (the one in the rig is mind-bendingly atrocious)\n-Bosses are recycled all over the place (you kill the giant crab thing in 3 different boss fights alone)\n-The game straight-up lies about button prompts ("W/A/S/D to turn wheel" really means "tap f repeatedly")\n-The audio logs are filled with SO MANY juicy, lip-smacky, mouth-poppy sounds that it sounds like the mic is being eaten\n-The base only has a few people you can actually interact with, so it feels lifeless\n-It is completely arbitrary where/when you can grapple/repel\n-There is no visual indicator of health (other than when you're near-death), and your ammo count vanishes and reappears whenever it feels like it (EDIT: I've been informed that your ammo count and the rest of your HUD disappear when you get too far from the mech)\n-And so many other little tiny annoyances\n\nIf you're a more patient person than I am, you could probably put up with this game, and might even enjoy it. I, however, found it joyless, tedious, and boring. It is a paint-by-numbers, designed-by-committee, heartless blob of checklists, man-hours, and coding. Life is too short to slog through uninteresting crap, and this game didn't make the cut (for me). You may enjoy it, but please don't spend more than $5 on it.","March 15, 2015","false","8.3"," 348 of 408 people (85%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","85","348","408","44","14"

Dead Space 1-3 are FAR better games, and feel incredibly similar. The Dead Space games actually feature some genuinely creepy and horrific moments, and the atmosphere is top-notch. In comparison, everything here just falls flat.\n\n75% of Lost Planet 3 consists of walking around in a very slow, defenseless Mech / Rig. When you get to where you need to be, you spend 15 minutes turning a valve, and then when that's finished, walk a few more steps and spend another 15 minutes turning another valve. Every single button \ computer you interact with breaks down, leading you to find 'another route' / far away button \ computer. It's just dull, uninspired, tedious game design.\n\nYou also have to backtrack for a lot of objectives, and enemies spawn in exactly the same locations; there is no variation, in both the environments or the enemies. When enemies spawn, you can also see them literally appear in front of you most of the time.\n\nThe checkpoint system is inconsistent; especially before some of the bosses and harder encounters. After dying, you have to sit through 5-minute unskippable cutscenes again and again. Very annoying on harder difficulties.\n\nI made it about 5 hours in and encountered a game-breaking bug that prevented me from continuing. I'd encountered the bug several times in the game, but they were overcome (eventually). When using the Mech, you have to turn a valve (again) and the controls simply stop working. I tried it on both M+KB and a 360 controller and it just wouldn't let me pass. This is a fairly common bug apparently.\n\nAt this point, I'd seen enough of the game and wasn't enjoying it much, so it was the last straw.\n\nThe PC controls often don't work, and when the button prompts appear on-screen, they're very often wrong, even using the default control scheme. The game clearly wasn't bug-tested or had much, if any, quality-assurance. Even playing on a 360 controller has some issues with wrong button-prompts and slow interactions.\n\nWhen very similiar and much better games like Dead Space exist, I find it impossible to recommend this game.","October 20, 2015","false","5.5"," 228 of 290 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","228","290","8","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CardinalFailure/recommended/226720/","CardinalFailure","-HA- Autistic Muse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CardinalFailure/","612 products in account","Okay, so here is the deal.\nYes, the gameplay is altered substantially from the previous two, yes the T-Energy mechanic doesn't come into play sadly. I had hoped the game might have had a section as a nod to the old games where Jim's suit gets damaged but alas it did not.\nCo-operative play is also not featured anywhere in the single player story.\n\nThis said however, while the gameplay is somewhere inbetween extreme condition and the first dead space title, the controls most of the time feel fairly fluid.\nThe characters, especially Jim Peyton himself are really likable and it kept me immersed in the story. Jim's wife is a very interesting character (as well as Jim himself)and the game has a lot of soul.\nJim isn't a grizzled space marine who can kill an akrid from 300 metres, but he is also not out of his depth.\nWith a temperament somewhere between a trucker and a cowboy he instantly became (for me) one of my favourite videogame protagonists of all time\n\nWhen you're out there on your own, with just music you brought from planet earth (the game imports music from your computer files so you can creat your own soundtrack for the cold wastelands) you really feel like there's no-one else you can count on but yourself. You feel isolated and in danger at every second.\nThis also works in reverse, that when you get a message from your in game wife you feel like you're at home, like you're making a difference and the characters really come to life. The same can be said when you return to coronis and upgrade your rig and weapons, greeting old friends.\n\nThere's a fair bit of longevity in the upgrades to your rig. Certain upgrades allow you to get to new places you couldn't before, or allow you to scrounge for scrap metal in new places.\nThe controls when fighting the akrid will feel a little alien at first due to the over the shoulder viewpoint of the camera, but you quickly get used to the contextual-only use of the grappling hook as well as dodging out of the way of enemies.\n\nFans of the series will be pleased to know that this does actually provide an interesting and very unexplained part of the story of the franchise and while they do retcon one or two things, it really does feel like it's for the better. The plot makes sense and while isn't anything spectacular, it is coherent and well-written. The supporting cast for me, was what really pulled along the plot for me and kept me interested even while trying to hunt down those annoying albino akrid.\n\n\nThe setpieces out in the ice and snow are quite fantastic and this is where the game excels, in the sheer scale of the areas outside. The opposite is unfortunately true in that on the occasional offchances you go into an enclosed space, combat and movement can feel clunky and out of place.\nIt's a shame likely the repetitive sidequests will put anyone off buying this because the atmosphere is amazing.\nYou really do feel like a lone contractor out in the middle of nowhere drilling for a precious substance.\nI imagine the feeling and atmosphere in this game is not all that disimilar from the feelings of isolation and longing that ice truckers deal with on a day to day bonus.\n\nWhich brings us to the Rigs. The rig is not the vital suit (this is a prequel don't forget), it is an entirely different breed of machine, but this isn't a bad thing.\nYes, there are a few mechs in this game and while at first you may lament the loss of having shoulder mounted rockets and gatling guns, you will immediately warm up to the defensive and offensive capabilities of Jim's machine. Admittedly the rig can feel quite slow at times and while this may have been an artistic choice by the devs at Spark it can bog down the pace at times until you access fast travel quite early in the game. The good news is that those who loved the sheer mayhem and carnage of slicing off a limb or two from the large akrid will be right at home. It is just as satisying, maybe moreso to time your grab just right as you hold the creature and helplessly drill into it's cores with the drill arm as their lifeblood (T-energy) spills out.\n\nI should point out that I was only ever interested in the game (and series) for the single player experience and therefore I did not touch multiplayer. My understanding is some of the maps from extreme condition make a reappearance and generally most reviewers say the online is where the strength of the game really lies.\nThis game did poorly due to the mountain of scathing critiques and generally poor write-ups it received.\nI personally enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the series for the story.\nIn terms of all the bad press and poor scores, I'd advise you to try it for yourself, it's not the most amazing game in terms of graphics or presentation but I sure had fun with it.","August 6, 2014","true","45.9"," 116 of 133 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","116","133","0","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/recommended/226720/","PyroUltimate","--","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/","550 products in account","First of all I want to say that I didnt played the first Lost Planet game but I played the second one. I like Lost Planet 2 because it has its own style. Lost Planet 2 was "crazy" and I enjoyed the journey through the singleplayer campaign. I hoped Lost Planet 3 would have the same style but I got greatly disappointed.\n\n\nNegative Points:\nControls\n- The assignment of keys was horrible in Lost Planet 2 but this time they really wrecked it. I changed the sh*tty layout but after that the most keys just didnt work correctly anymore. I changed the key layout to default because of that but I also had to start a new game cause nothing worked properly after I used a different layout.\n- Default layout also dont work as well as it should.. Great work!\n\nControls (again)\n- I raged a lot because the game says at some quicktime events things like "Hold w/s/a/d" but in reality I have to press "F" several times. It really p*ssed me off.\n\nCover System\n- The cover system works horribly. I even stopped using it because 1) It doesnt work well and 2) You dont need it.\n\nHUD\n- I dont like the HUD. It doesnt show me the things I need in a acceptable way. And if you are too far away from your mech you will lose important things like the mini map.\n\nEnemies\n- Sometimes enemys just appeared in front (sometimes even inside) of me\n- The variety of enemys is a joke\n- Grabbing enemys with the mech is so buggy\n- Enemies often just stuck in something (especially the flying ones)\n\nBoss Enemies\n- "Boss Enemies" - or should I say "Boss Enemy"? Really you have to fight the same typ of Boss enemy for uhm 3 times I think. Well maybe the crab looks a little bit different every time but it is the same stupid "crab thing" over and over again.\n- One time the boss crab was invincible.. wasted 30 minutes.\n\nWeapons\n- Boring weapons like shotgun, pistol or assault rifle. No crazy "Holy sh*t" weapons here..\n- There are also just a few weapons for you. No fun!\n\nMap/World\n- They call it "Open World".. I call it "Path between 2 loading zones"\n- Loading zones.. so much loading...even with a strong PC\n\nPrice & DLC\n- Overpriced DLCs\n- Got the game during a sale and I am happy that I didnt pay the full price (40 euros - 1 year after release) because it is way too much for this game.\n\nBugs\n- There are some bugs in the game which can make you rage a lot (game breaking bugs like not triggering something are §/"§&$(%&$!!!)\n- Other bugs are for example: Explosive weapons shell just explode after you shot for no reason so you hurt yourself a lot / cant shoot (only aim) with weapons / invisible walls (no I didnt reach the end of the map because I walked there 5 minutes ago without problems)\n\nSteam Connection\n- You lost connection to steam for about 2 seconds? Well no connection to steam = playing not possible. The game will stop and throw you back to the main menu. Will the game saving the progress? Nope. Seriously why cant I play the game in singleplayer without a connection to steam?\n\nWindows Live\n- Dont worry GFWL died and Lost Planet 3 uses Steamworks now. I still blame every studio which have chosen this GFWL sh*t!\n\nMultiplayer\n- Is nearly dead. You will find some players in Team Deathmatch but the other modes are dead. Maybe you will find some players which are playing for achievements but normally you will not find anyone in a other game mode than Team Deathmacht\n- Lost all my stats. Just got reseted and after that happend the new stats dont work correctly. Well I dont care that much because I dont got much after 4 hours MP\n- Now I am in the "Top 1000" from the MP leaderboard again.. with 4 kills. Nuff said.\n\nSavegame\n- Only 1 save slot\n- Savegame got wrong date (I dont think this is the year 2013..)\n\nOther problems\n- Subtitles (german) are sometimes incorrect\n- Lip sync is so bad\n- The jokes which are made by the characters are really bad the most time\n- You liked the mechs in Lost Planet 2? Yes? Well forget them you only get 1 boring mech with no third person view!\n\n\n\nNeutral Points:\nGraphics\n- The game graphics are ok (not good for release 2013 but also not the worst).\n\nStory\n- I have to say that I didnt follow the Lost Planet 3 story that much cause it bored me very quickly.\n\n\n\nPositive Points:\nCharacters\n- I like Jim, his wife and the other women you will meet, I dont want to spoiler too much. You will know which one (psst I dont mean the annoying black b*tch) just in case you still want to play this game.\n\nWell I just tried to find something positive... actually I hate more characters in Lost Planet 3 than I like.\n\n\n\nConclusionAt the end I have to say: Dont buy this game for more than 5 euros! It is a boring game with so many problems. You can feel that this game was made for consols and not for the PC. Lost Planet 2 had a lot of problems too but it was much more fun than Lost Planet 3. The style of Lost Planet 3 reminds me a little bit at Dead Space 3. Also Lost Planet 3 failed as sequel just like Dead Space 3 did. Maybe the number "3" is cursed in the gaming industry and Gabe know it? Would explain why we will never see Half Life 3..\n\nBack to topic: Do not buy this game. If you really want to buy it do not pay more than 5 euros and do not buy the DLCs!","September 28, 2014","false","18.0"," 227 of 319 people (71%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","71","227","319","20","4"

TE no longer works like it used to, grappling hooks went from fun to just a means of getting to exactly placed points and can't be used elsewhere. While the combat on foot is par for the previous games, the combat in the RIG is sluggish, slow, unreactive, and while the QTE-like moments while battling larger Akrid is sort of fun, the windows for counters are so tiny that you need to be quite good at the game to survive, and it is often better to simply combat the Akrid on foot.\nThe game does a good job at creating it's own world, however, and when viewed as its own title, rather than a sequel, it is honestly not bad. I could see myself really, really enjoying this game due to the beautiful, awe inspiring graphics, colour and environments, and while some of the designs are pants on head (Ie: not a single main character covers their face in the -50C weather), they often come off as their own product with it's own feel. The models are very much unlike game characters, and feel more like watching a live action series or movie.\nThe mechs, as a fan of the genre however, are garbage. The design team laxed back on huge, impossible to balance, utilitarian piles. The desperate attempt to seem believable and realistic is overshadowed by things like a giant, breakable cockpit window that constantly suffers damage, has complete ice overs, and serves as nothing more but face recognition that is impossible to see, as you're locked in first person view. VSs do exist, but the fact that these bloody things in no way resemble them but are somehow developed from them, and look not a thing like the original VSs, is a bit of a kick in the balls to fans of the mecha genre and fans of this series, the two of which often overlap. Instead of quick sliding and manouvering, we get CLANK CLANK CLANK. LP1 and 2 did the utilitarian mecha well, with it being reasonably sized, and with enough variety to suit anyone from the average anime fan to hardcore fans of old style mecha, and even to fans of western styles such as Battletech. However, this is mostly one bitter robot fans lament, and this is really up to personal opinion.\n\nAll in all, solid gameplay with a few problems and quirks. Beautiful graphics and design and a relatively believeable story, if not hindered by very poor dialogue at some points.\nBut, this all has to be ignored to some degree, as this is a title in an ongoing series, and indeed by that logic, must follow in the steps of its predecessors. The game fails on almost every level in this, and is something akin to an insult to long time fans of the series, and with Capcom's standard "It was your fault" schpiel to us for not demanding another game like Lost Planet 2, this game feels more like an insult than a new addition. This is a game for casual fans of the TPS genre, fans of sci-fi and sci-fi horror, but not a game for fans of Lost Planet.","March 3, 2014","false","9.3"," 207 of 290 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","207","290","0","7"

Having come back months later this bug seemed to have been fixed so I decided to edit my review.\n\nUnlike a lot of space shootman games, LP3 takes its time introducing its characters and giving you the opportunity to give a ♥♥♥♥ about them, it also focuses on civilians like scientists and engineers instead of your usual "HOORAH SPESH MAHREENS!". Biggest example is the protagonist, Jim Peyton. Jim is no Master Chief or Commander Shepard, he’s just a contractor out to get a paycheck to support his family. He’s a relative everyman and the game does a quality job actually showing you his relationship with his family, mainly through videos he exchanges with his wife, Grace, back on Earth. The game takes it time establishing Jim’s day to day life and I think it works. All the approaches the writers make to establish the characters really help give some real heart to what otherwise could have been a generic TPS game. Though there is also the atmosphere which is really freaking good, EDN 3 looks like an utterly hostile planet filled with freezing blizzards and massive lava pools. The country music Grace gives you also adds to this “space trucker” vibe that the game gives off and it really adds to the atmosphere, though you can just play your own music if you want.  Overall, it was clear the writers (One of them wrote Anachronox!) wanted something more than flimsy cardboard excuses for story and characters most actions games. They do well for a while but disappointingly it craps itself at the end with a transparently evil villain that ruins the whole theme of not having any real villains. This really brings the game down from being great but the writing is still solid.\n\nWhen it comes to the combat it is essentially Dead Space and its serviceable but way too many enemies tend to spawn and there’s not much enemy variety. Fighting in your mech can be cool but sometimes it can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥ due to some obtuse mechanics. It’s not a game you really play for the combat, just stick to Easy.\n\nOverall LP3 has a really strong start with a more unique character driven take on an action game but this peters out as it goes on. It’s still a solid game and worth picking up on sale now","February 17, 2015","true","18.0"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","57","73","4","0"

The overall plot structure is "evil corporation wants you to help them suck out a planet's lifeblood", which we've all seen before. But Lost Planet 3 distinguishes itself with characters who are anything but stock, written and voice-acted with skill and flair. Throw in some gorgeous environment design and some halfway-original gameplay and you've got a game worth playing. Plus you get to stomp around in a giant robot that actually feels utilitarian instead of being gratuitously anime.

The story is full of clichès, predictable characters, predictable actions that just makes you think you're watching some badly rated Hollywood movie, so instead you focus on...\n\nThe gameplay: for a good 70% of the time you'll drive this slow and bulky legged tank across miles of snow, to then get yourself into linear hallways filled with facehuggers that you can easily avoid by running. The gameplay of the rig feels forced as most of the time the combat with it will imply CONSTANT Q.T.EVENTS, in fact, there's not much gameplay to speak of, as i've never seen so many qtes if not in uncharted. The on-foot combat is what you expect from a generic third person shooter, so not much to say for this, overall it's just incredibly boring.\n\nThe Bugs: I don't even know where to start... checkpoints that bugs themselves poiting to a previous locations that you already passed, winch that doesnt work, areas that cannot be passed if not by using some criptic combinations of time traveling (which is useless in my advise as the map is not even that big, but feels so thanks to the slowness of the rig). THanks to the constant bug in the game i couldn't even finish this as i got stuck in the storm testing mission, as the pointer tells me to go to an invisibile wall, searched for the solution online and i couldn't find anything.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nSoundtrack 7/10\nReplayabilty: 3/10\n\nIf you're interested in the story, just watch some videos on youtube, if you're interested in the gameplay, just play some other 3rd person's.","November 8, 2015","false","9.1"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","51","67","5","3"

I finally took the plunge and decided it was time to try it for myself and see what it was like. The game is very different than the first two, and seems almost like an "Americanized" version of the franchise. If you go into it with the mindset that it will be the same as the old games, you will be disappointed.\n\nThe storyline is really the stand-out part of this game. In it, we learn the origins of this "Lost Planet" and how\nthe conflict between the Snow Pirates and Nevec began. The gameplay is quite similar to Dead Space, right down to the "breadcrumbs" mechanic and the inventory/map screen. Even though Lost Planet 3 does copy the Dead Space's gameplay style, it still does it quite well.\n\nThe switch to Unreal Engine 3 is really what struck me as odd about this game, and is what turned me off of it in the first place. MT Framework 2.0 is a vastly superior game engine, but being that Lost Planet 3 was developed by the mostly unknown company Spark Unlimited, I can see why there seemed to be a downgrade in that regard. While I feel Unreal Engine 3 has run its course, the game still looks pretty decent graphically. There are quite a few different graphics options and scales pretty well for those using older hardware.\n\nI am glad I got this game on sale, as I don't think its worth $50. I got about 12-14 hours out of it and don't regret buying it. If you are open to a change in the franchise, and want to see a very well told story unfold, I recommend it. If you are expecting more of LP1 or 2, stay away!","January 4, 2014","true","13.9"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","47","61","0","0"

And I wasn't dissapointed one bit. Well maybe I'm exaggerating but I want to recommend this game if you dig anything I write here about it.\n\nFirst of all, I disliked the first 2 games that came before it. Arcade shooting is done right in those previous games, but there isn't much else to back it up unless you have the hots for Lukka.\n\nI can assure you this game goes into a different direction with more visceral heavier combat, and also opens up with a good story that has very well characterized characters and good worldbuilding. This last one is a real improvement.\n\nWhile combat is visceral with very beffy guns that are few but are as good as they should to get a good shooter fun, gameplay sometimes gets repetitive. The slow cooking of the story (wich I really dig) sometimes also puts the pacing in a slow move. But you'll be compensated with new guns, new enemies and some cool devices for you worker mech.\n\nYep, working mech. Combat has two facets: you shooting (and dodgin, cuz the akrid creatures are very vicious), and you brawling with giant akrid with a mech mano a mano. It's pretty satisfying to eviscerate those biggies with big industrial tools. You also travel on this thing, and it may be to slow, but don't panic! there's fast travel tool eventually unlocked.\n\nControls are all over the place, but at least the ones used for combat get the things done. And thankfully because the monsters you face are really dangerous. Akrid behave like the vicious creatures they're told in the story instead of those dumb bullet sponges of previous games. Some of the are so cunning that I recommend getting your upgrades (moded bullets, weapons, rig pieces) as soon as you can. This game wasn't easy.\n\nYep. there are QT events , but they're well placed and are actually tense, like trying to aim to the monster to attack instead of just bashing your keys to the extreme of breaking them.\n\nThe game is overall consistent and it has an identity apart of the other ones, with the situation being "you're an everyman in an hostile land away from your family, for them". The only Lost Planet game I enjoyed really. It's underrated if you ask me.\n\nDidn't found any game breaking bugs in my long and worthy playtroughts, but I have a tip for you: when the game is telling you ROTATE WASD in your rig, just press F reppeatedely.","July 3, 2015","true","56.8"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","47","62","4","0"

The vistas are something to behold and even the small details you come across in the world.\nThe facial animations in the cutscenes are expressive and the voice acting is top notch. I really cared about these characters and their back stories.\n\nIt played a lot like a poor mans Gears of War, which in my book is not a bad thing. The gun play was pretty basic but at times frenzied as well. More than once I fear for my life much the way I did in the Dead Space games. A lot of the enviroments are truley unsettling and coupled with ALIENS soundtrack I was hooked and immersed.\n\nIn true Capcom fashion there are little details that make this game stand out. One being the 'hominess' of you RIG (mech). You get messages from your wife back on earth, updates about your baby boy and even a vlog. Not only that but in most of the traversal parts of the game you're able to play a music list. By that I mean YOUR MUSIC ON YOUR PC! that changed a lot of the game for me. Heres an example:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/_7J2fI0vz9Y\n\nBeing able to listen to oldies or whatever your cup of tea is while walking around this vast frozen tundera really scored big points with me.\n\nTo keep this short, play it for yourself. It's on sale right now and if your up for something immersive and pretty erie with a tight story to boot then give Lost Planet 3 a shot. I'm glad I did, it's something I will remember for a long time to come.\n\nNow, for a fight with a giant Akrid to 'Sleepwalking' from GTA5.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/a6KDHYEDaOU","September 11, 2014","true","12.8"," 115 of 181 people (64%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","64","115","181","39","6"

They are both 3rd person shooters with open level design, though the extensive use of robots makes Lost Planet 3 a better game. It is playable and enjoyable, at least from the single-player perspective. The MP segment doesn't bother me at all since I rarely indulge into it.

It doesn't look like LP 1 or 2 but Lost Planet 3. Now also many people don't like that either and want the old look back. They compare it to Dead Space or Red Faction. What can I say. Well I dont think so. I have played al those games and Lost Planet 3 doesn't try to be anything but Lost Planet 3. A 3rd prson shooter is a 3rd person shooter. And this a really good one. The story is really starting to pick up. The Voice acting  is very good and so are the sound effects and graphics. A great effort from Capcom.

You must not, i repeat you must not play this as you would the other Lost planet game, because it plays nothing like those. This game carries the Lost planet title, but doesn't deliver the lost planet experience most are accustom to. At heart its a AA budget game (pretty sure it cost more to make this than the other lost planet games) action game with a decent story, that may come off Hollywood quality with the action the match.\n\nIts a competent game as it is, but its not lost planet. It it didn't carry the lost planet name, im sure this game would be more recieved by the steam community. This game is a action story driven game, that doesn't have the variety you normally get from the series. Theres some jank and stank to this game, but for the most part its enjoyable, as long as you dont think lost planet while playing it.\n\nWhen i did play this game, i have to admit that it felt like the devs got some inspiration from Deadspace 3, because i could have swarn i was playing Deadspace 3 in some sections of the game. The gun play in this game just isnt as satisfying as other shooters. the enemy A.I is what you normally would expect from dumb alien wild life creators, till you bump into human enemy A.I and boy are they morons. The focus is on the creatures so i guess i can forgive the devs for that.\n\nAll and all this game is a decent experience as long as you don't play it as Lost planet, rather you enjoy it as a action Hollywood kind of experience.

That much you can get from any other review, and that by itself puts some people off - but not me, and I think you should give this game a chance. That said, I'm not much one for multiplayer, so my comments are about the campaign.\n\nThe sound and graphics are good, especially the sound design for the weather. Very atmospheric, it really gets your attention when a howling, thundering blizzard rolls in and whites everything out. The music is not bad, and comes in two flavors: moody science fiction-style instrumentals, like what you'd hear in Aliens or Homeworld, and some surprisingly classy western-style guitar and fiddle tunes the main character likes to listen to. They're both understated, but nice touches.\n\nThe art design and graphics fit the mood as well, giving E.D.N. III a stark beauty you don't find very often. The character animations are a little stiff in-game, but not anything that really breaks immersion - and the mech animations feel nice and stompy, like they have real weight to them. It's a nice effect that I appreciate.\n\nThe storytelling style is well done, particularly given it's a Capcom game. I don't think they'll ever really live down Resident Evil's infamously cheesy dialogue, but this game feels like it was written by Joss Whedon. Some commenters have mentioned the game feeling similar to the movie Aliens, and I can see that, but I think the main character has more in common with the frontier pragmatism of Jim Raynor or Malcolm Reynolds.\n\nSo, that's scene-building and mood-setting, and it's done well. But this is a shooter, right? So, how is the action?\n\nIt's a solid third-person shooter. You have different loadouts you can switch between, upgradeable weapons, and a basic cover system. Getting new weapons can be kind of slow, especially if you focus on side-quests, but every weapon always has some utility: there aren't many trash guns in this game.\n\nThe pacing can be a bit spastic, and is my only real issue with the game. One of the first QTE's - sorry, I didn't mention those, did I? Yeah, there are some QTE's in this game. They're pretty forgiving, though, and they don't show up enough to be obnoxious.\n\nWhere was I? Oh, right, pacing. One of the first QTE's is in the middle of a "help us, player character! Fix this problem RIGHT NOW!" situation that blows in out of nowhere. The urgency of that errand is a pretty sharp break from the smoother pace the game had had before that, and afterward, it goes immediately back to that "take your time if you want" approach. It's a bit jarring sometimes.\n\nSo overall, if you're a fan of shooters and gritty science fiction, you like mood-building and atmosphere, and you don't mind some pacing shifts, I would definitely recommend this game.","February 18, 2015","true","47.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","16","20","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/226720/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Lost Planet 3 is a Third Person Shooter with sci-fi weapons on a frozen alien world. There are some RPG elements such as weapon and suit upgrades and fast traveling to revisit prior areas, but it’s definitely more of an action shooter than anything else. I never played Lost Planet 1 or 2 and had no trouble following the plot. Don’t let that hold you back if you’re wondering whether or not you should try the game.\n\nYou play the character James Peyton, a new arrival on the planet EDN 3, an ice planet packed with T Energy, which is supposed to be the solution to Earth’s energy crisis. The entire EDN 3 research expedition is funded by the Nevec Corporation, who will do whatever it takes to make sure Earth gets the energy it needs. Unfortunately for both you and Nevec, the T Energy is sort of hard to acquire since it’s mostly found running through the veins of the alien creatures inhabiting this frozen world. The creatures aren’t the only threat around here, as you’ll find right from the start Nevec is as shady as they come.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the game is played in third person over-the-shoulder most of the time, but you do spend a lot of time in your Utility Rig, which is a big mech with a drill arm that you can occasionally battle giant monsters with. Mostly the Rig is for story-based missions though, and for getting around the various environments with your winch (like a grappling hook). The health system for the game is basic regenerating  life where you just need to take cover for about 10 seconds and you’ll be back to full health. There aren’t that many weapons to choose from but if you’re like me you’ll probably be using the same ones most of the game anyways (assault rifle + sniper rifle). You can only carry 2 weapons at a time + your basic infinite ammo pistol. Throughout your game you can use the T Energy you collect as money, purchasing upgrades for your weapons (including specialty ammo) and upgrades for your Utility Rig (such as improved armor).\n\nPros:\n+Decent story and “modern” graphics.\n+Giant monster bosses, which is always nice.\n+The specialty ammunition adds some variety, though you really won’t use it very much.\n\nCons:\n-This is a console port and a couple things (such as opening large doors with your Rig) are not well implemented. It tells you to press the WASD buttons to open the giant gates, but really you just mash the “f” key.\n-Moving between the various “areas” of the game is kind of tiresome because your Rig really doesn’t walk very fast.  You can probably get out and run just as quickly but then you wouldn’t be able to transition areas.\n-Multiplayer is completely dead. Nobody’s playing online so you can’t get the multiplayer achievements.\n\nOverall the game is fun enough to consume 10 hours if you enjoy shooters. As I’ve said, I haven’t played the previous 2 Lost Planet games so I couldn’t say how they match up. If I had to compare Lost Planet 3 with any other games, I’d say it’s more like Red Faction Armageddon than anything else (without the destructible environments).\n","April 21","true","16.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

The last game is entirely different than the previous two, gameplay wise. The first two games put on a whole lot different fast paced action 3rd person shooter, meanwhile the last game pretty much put forth a moderate 3rd person shooter. The weapon choices got smaller, the VS mechanic got replaced by a "rig" which is a drill and a robotic arm. Though at first I liked the rig's soundtrack option, I got devastated by the fact that most of the game it is "unavailable". Overall, I would not dare say the game is bad, it is just not Lost Planet.","May 14, 2015","true","15.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

(Also because their games are anything but popular)\nThe reason for this is Capcom wanted to get a Western studio to develop the franchise with the intent of expanding the LP series in the West.\nNow, I don't want to write an essay on this game because it would be all too easy, but if you're still interested in buying this or on the fence, I reccomend watching total biscuits review for the game; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoQQPmjF5T4\nAlthought this review is very negative, I feel it captures my sentiments for the game perfectly.\n\nTLDR; The only similarities to the previous installments in the series is the lore, it's a story driven game, combat feels very dull and repitive.\nThe writers of the story got nominated for outstanding achievement in videogame writing by the writers guild of America (it does have good story, and great character development)\n3/10 from me, I dropped this game due to the combat.","March 7, 2014","false","6.3"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","33","52","0","0"

I can only recommend it conditionally -- get it on sale, otherwise, pass it up.  You'll get frustrated with some of the problems.\n\nI haven't played the other two Lost Planet games in the series, so I have nothing for comparison (which is what lots of the negative reviews seems to be about.)  As a stand alone game, it has a solid linear story line in single player (and single player is what I play for) RPG with really good narrative cinamagraphic cut away scenes, plus the occassional cut-in videos of communications between the character you play and the wife back on Earth which adds to the character background.  Everything experienced is in the past - a retelling of events as a sort of confessional story.\n\nThe world is not free roam. There are definte restrictions on where one can go and how one can move through the environment.  Not a huge problem for the linear narrative story format of the game, but there are few opportunities to really explore that makes the world really interesting. No really hidden areas or out-of-the-way places to discover that would flesh out the world a bit more for the player.\n\nPlayer movement is also limited - you can't jump or climb or crouch or crawl except in special places and in a choreographed manner. This normally isn't a problem, except in combat where you see a place of solid cover, but there's abosolutely no way to get to it... however, there generally are points of cover available in most combat settings, if one scramble about sufficiently to find them unless the combat situation is designed without it (and, yes, there are those situations, often in "boss" type battles.) Though, on second thought, it would be nice to be able to jump over obstacles instead of having to walk around them and even be able to jump on top of them.  It's also rather nice not to be able to wander over a cliff as most cliffs have an invisible barrier to prevent this, but it also takes away some of the fun of game play if you can't have those moments of "oh, fraaaaaaaaaaaack...." as one plummets over by mistake.\n\nWeapons are simple, but work fine for the game. The game isn't really combat intensive as you're fighting indigenous creatures, some very easy to defeat with a shot or two while others are heavily armored.  Enough variety to keep it interesting,  if only it doesn't get too tedious over time. I'm not there yet, so I don't know though I could see it becoming so given the limits of the creatures and one's own arsenal.\n\nMy major complaint is that they keybindings for custom key settings are screwed up. When I set them, I get errors like the key is already assigned and it obviously is not as it doesn't show the key, or I assign the key and then when I play, the key doesn't work.  A similar problem occurs when I try to change graphic or sound settings, and then click on "Apply Settings", sometimes I get the prompt to save the new settings, sometimes nothing happens.  It's very odd.\n\nAlso, I often run into the issue that the standard keys for action don't work on ocassion. notably for maniuplating the  clamp arm of the utility rig (after clamping on to an object, the WASD keys don't operate to turn or pump or move the grasped object.)  Very frustrating when the keys don't work.  Makes the game unplayable and it seems to happen at random and I have yet to figure out what gets the keys working again.\n\nA second major complaint is no SAVE feature beyond the AUTO-SAVE.  This really sucks as the AUTO-SAVE seems to kick in only after a mission completion.  So, if I'm half-way through a mission and need to quit to get on with my real life, forget it.  I lose all the progress on the mission, even if the last thing I have to do is turn a crank, then open a door and go through it after defeating the "boss" creature.  Sometime, yes, real life can't wait for those extra five minutes. Rather silly not to have a user initated SAVE option.\n\nFinally, I expect playing with a game controller would be easier than with keyboard/mouse. However, I don't have that option with my set-up. I suspect the problems I'm having with key mapping don't apply with a game controller - or maybe they do if all the game controller does is map to keyboard/mouse. In which case, same problems.\n\nADDENDUM: The WSAD issue is cleared up on the Steam Forums (took some searching) - one can simply use the F key.  Hey, that isn't presented on the screen, another problem! Wrong instructions! Also, on the Steam Forms, one can locate how to edit the key mapping config file directly to bypass the cruddy and disfunctional ingame interface, if that's to your liking.  Me?  I'd rather have a functional interface rather than have to muck about with config files... I've gotten past that sort of thing in my life and I just want to recreate now, not hack on the back end of things or tweak or poke about in the mechanics of the program or config files so much anymore.","September 14, 2014","true","71.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

A planet covered in ice and snow but pumped full of a liquid thermal energy that is humanity's "last hope" for a renewable power. the reason I put the quotes is because, well, for a last hope energy source, nobody really seems to be in a rush to to get it, but I digress.\n\nIn Lost Planet 3, you play as Jim Peyton. An Adrien-Brody-looking "Rigger" who takes a job on the planet E.D.N. III mineing and harvesting the thermal energy in the planet to support his wife and child back on Earth. The catch there being that the planet is infected with insectoid-like aliens know as Akrid who seem to also have the T-Energy in there own body as well.\n\nThe game features both a story mode and multiplayer mode. The story it's self is strong, way better then the first game, with a lot more focus on the main character and less of an arcade feeling. It works well with the third-person set up. It also offers upgrades for both the weapons you purchase and your rig, which is also your main way of traveling on E.D.N. III. The NPC's are also fun, but really cliched. You have the foreigner who is your main rival at the base, the young, cocky mechanic, the scientist that wants to go to far in his experiments, and lastly, the doctor that is the only real voice of reason whom everyone ingnores.\n\nThe Multiplayer, well . . . Have you ever been sitting in a movie, and you think there is going to be something post-credits so you wait and wait and the credits are completely over and there is you and like, two other people left sitting down and you get that awkward feeling in the pit of your stomach becasue the ushers are ready to clean up the floors but you and those two guys are holding them up, and it's just. . . dead? Yeah, kinda like that.\n\nI do need to say, before I wrap this up, that I did not complete the story mode. Aprently the PC port of the game was riddles with bigs that caused a few things to not work in the main story and a few of the side quests. Locked in a location, enemies not spawning, and even one boss that will not die. Capcom promised for months after the release that they were working on a large patch to fix the story (along with a deleveling bug in the MP) up to 6 months after the game launched, but arounf the 1-year mark, there was silence, and Capcom mvoed on from LP3.\n\nShould you paly the game? Eh. . . uuhh. . . yeah?\nI mean, the game is by no means perfect, and the bugs seem to be game by game and not that consistant. I was danceing on a fine line between yes and no, but I really enjoyed what I played and even if I knew ahead of time that I would not be able to finish the game, I still would have played it.\nSo Yes, play it, wait for a crazy sale before you buy it though, that what I recommend.","October 22, 2015","true","7.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Good, not great.  Lost Planet 1 is one of my favorite shooters of all time, mostly due to the unusual story, characters and the setting/atmosphere.  This game acts as a prequel (by a longshot) of that original title.\n\nThe story grabbed me out of the gate, and the setting and atmosphere are just right for Lost Planet.  The planet feels even harsher and more alien than it did in the first outing, which is great.  There's a certain "Alien" quality to it.  (In case you're wondering, I hated the characerization-free, multiplayer-ish, terraformed Lost Planet 2).  The characers, acting and emotive faces really reel you in, especially the very human-interest bits.  It's an unusual, almost Disney animation-ish art style (but more realistic)... it's hard to describe, but it works.\n\nYes, this game plays more like a "western" 3rd person game (read: Gears of War) and has quicktime events.

The introduction to E.D.N. III was splendid and gave me a pretty blatant message that the game was not going to be like it predecessors. Which in some ways is unfortunate, but in others it's great.\nIt was great because it meant they changed it to a way that would allow a much more closely followed story. Rather than LP 2, where the story kinda jumped all over the play till it came all together at climax.\n\nThe akrid enemies were varied in some scenarios, some added new tactics other than just being big an menacing, and some just marched toward you like an explosive cow towards a humansized-shotgunweilding-meatgrinder. Not to say it wasn't fun mowing down waves of that strange basic acrid tripod thingy.\n\nFighting the large creatures on foot proved a challenge sometimes, though their tactics were easy to learn. When you later face similar creatures in your Rig I found the experience of welding and/or drilling them to death quite relaxing.\n\nOne unfortunate thing is the grappling hook. I loved that thing in the first installments of the Lost Planet series. Sadly thanks the games changes, usage of it as an exploration and tool have been limited to 'designated' cliffs and such. I mean later in the game you get a zip-line upgrade that lets you slide on zip-lines sometimes. Either way, one the few things I didn't like.\n\nOverall the game was good from start to finish. Except for a certain part about 2/5th in, where they try to shove you into a cramped station and the pit orchestra from Dead Space returns with a raging vengeance as they ♥♥♥♥ your ears while the awesome nothingness ensues! Really, they try to create an atmosphere that just really was never there for me.\n\nSo in closing:\nDo you want a game that's fun and you can just ♥♥♥♥ around it?

But the way the single-player campaign is formatted hurts it a great deal.

Graphics are great, control is nicely done, framerate superb even in highest settings.  I'm playing this on a i5 Mac (with win7 installed).  This is one of the few games that keeps me engrossed for long periods of time.  The FPS in the MECH like vehical is awesome.  (I hope it has some sort of guns later).   I loved the old Mech warrior games and this is really fun to walk around in.  If on sale - grab it... but it's not a hard core game. The play is fairly easy, but cool - your guy has a cable much like Batman games.  It's no  METRO - but it's still very enjoyable.  The feeling is very cinematic... I often feel I'm watching a movie, the sound track is a big part of that.  I like this a lot and purchased 1 and 2 as well (yet to play)\nThere is one annoyance. Every so often if steam looses connection the game will drop back to main menu saying there was a change in character or login or something like that.

This, I guess, limits you in the enemy variety as all the planet's life feels pretty similar.\nThe story starts slowly, but soon presents an intriguing mystery for you to slowly discover. If you have a number of sci-fi books and games under your belt you'll get plenty of ideas about what's going to happen next - and one of them will most likely be always right. Nothing you haven't heard before I guess. Characters are okay, if unmemorable. None of them really stands out one way or another. Of course, this is a first game from the Lost Planet series I played, so maybe the characters are significant to the other games which might make them more intriguing.\nYour equipment is a gun + two weapons of your choice, but there's not much to choose from. Enemies explode and splash quite satisfyingly as you shoot them. There are plenty of boss fights, but they are basically the same.\nYou move across the planet in an utility rig - a kind of a mix between a mech and a truck, and on foot of course. Your rig moves really slow, but fortunately you soon get a fast travel option.\n\nSome significant negatives:\n- The game seems to suffer from the curse of "everything needs to be open-world". There's barely anything to do in this open-world - you can visit places to get more resources and do a few insignificant side missions. I never bothered with any of that, instead just fast traveled wherever the next mission marker pointed to. It is my belief that the game would be much better as a straight linear experience. It would make it somewhat shorter as well, but if the portion you cut consists mainly of 'slowly walking what is basically an empty hallway' then I think it would be a good thing.\n-Bugs! I had one of the bosses glitch on me (and judging from the forums, where I looked when that happened, I am far from the only one).

But as a game, it's just not what Lost Planet fans needed.\n\nIn truth if they just took the gameplay and mechanics of LP2, made it a mass player co-op experience with customization support or randomly generated levels for missions into the future, that easily works without Windows live garbage, it would've been that grand experience we could hope for. Especially if they could do it while keeping the journey like the first game.\n\nAs for this game, it's a bit of a hit or miss, and overall could've been left out. Game play wise it chokes out the old options and possibilities that came with 1&2 by limiting where you can grapple, less vital suit options to what feels less than the bare minimum and it lacks anything you really would've hoped for from past co-op and multi player offerings.\n\nIt makes me sad that most of Capcom traditions past will never live up to the expectations anymore. Sadly much of this so called AAA industry just feels really out of touch with what really moved games up the ladder of what's fun. So much money asked for high end visuals but fails to really expand properly on gameplay options and fun.\n\nThis game felt like truck driving without the social experience. It felt like a job without benefits by the time you got over looking at the scenery.\n\nJust give us a better up to date Lost Planet 2 with an ongoing frontier and some story with other updates over time. Give us what we would want. An immersive, fun, experience with a proper growth of options to keep it going.","February 23","false","7.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","2"

First Lost Planet, which I absolutely love, was waaay more about shooting aliens, wrecking enemy VS' and making a lot of noise. This game, however, is much more story-driven and sometimes suffers from it - it gets boring at times. What it lacked in fast action it made up for in characters and storyline, which I really liked. The main protagonist, Jim Peyton, is a very well-written character whom which I identified a lot - the way in which he acts and speaks is not only lifelike, but also logical and at points witty, which makes him a likeable fellow. What saddened me is the unused potential of Jim's robot, RIG, which looks awesome, but is pretty much useless. I admire Capcom for sticking to the convention (its a prequel, so robots with big-♥♥♥ guns were unneccessary), but I really regret that in the end the player-controllable RIG never got any weapon other than its utility equipment, and most of the fights are resolved by quick time events. To sum up: a good 7/10 game: intresting story, characters and dialogues, decent graphics, but too few not sufficiently varied Akrid to shoot, dissapointing robot and monotonous locations. Had fun anyway.","September 7, 2014","true","18.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

I found there were some great effects for bullets hitting enemies and in addition, there were nice modifications to buy with in-game points for weapons. One thing I did notice though was a lack of weapons. I found I was limited as to what weapons I could choose from, which limited my expectations of the future gameplay. However, they totally won me over with many boss battles that took a long time to conquer if I had picked the wrong weapon. Weapon customisations are vital to the harder enemies towards the end of the game.\n\nAlso, there were customisations for what the character calls his Rig. It is the vehicle you play a lot of the game in and customisations for that are not vital, but are pretty cool. In order to customise your Rig, you have to collect special parts that are scattered around the game. I found this was a good opportunity that the creators added in to really get the gamers to explore their full creation. Not only were there those collectibles, but there were audio logs and text logs scattered around the map as well, which you could then listen to on your menu screen. I found that this gamification really was a good thing to add to the game for some real emotional intensity to the game.\n\nThe storyline of this game is really long. I had idled for 6 hours on this game, and so my play time is an exceedingly long play time - but no worries, take 6 hours off of my game time and you have your result for how long it took me to complete this game. It has taken me around 11 hours to complete the campaign. Personally, I found this game droaned on with the same stuff up until around 3/4 of the way through. Things then got a lot more interesting, unexpected twists happened in the game which really gained my interest and I was hooked to the game.\n\nWhile playing this game, it has made me laugh at some points where the creators have used a touch of humour to the conversations in the game. I think this is really cool, because that adds extra audience attraction, adding to the matter of how much we enjoy it.\n\nThe end of the game made me cry for about 30 seconds. Any game that makes me cry is automatically classed - to me - as a game with effective emotion. This game conquered my emotions. Good job to the creators!\n\nThis game looks beautiful. On the maximum graphics setting, it really is a stunner, bearing in mind this game was made in 2013. I really like the gunplay in this game, and the 3rd person point of view has a good camera angle. The reason why I mention the camera angle is because some 3rd person shooter games have some dodgy angles, which furthermore makes it hard to actually play the game comfortably.\n\nThere are very few cutscenes in the game. This, for some, may be an issue. However, for others this may be great news. Personally, I quite like cutscenes and - although this game doesn't have many - the cutscenes in this game really are relatable and gain my full interest. The creators of the game have thought about emotion well as they have used a wide range of emotion and expressions throughout the game.\n\nThey have effectively created a strong link between the player and the main character, which is always a bonus to the entire effect of the game. The end of the game was really good and is something that nobody wants to miss.\n\nJust another thing to add in, there are side missions that you can complete throughout this game for more in-game points. I didn't do many of them, but they are good ways to gain yourself some points towards weapon modifications.\n\n===================================================================\n\nProblems:  These problems happened for me, however other users may not encounter them.\n\nWhile playing this game, I have realised that there are a couple of problems concerning the controls and a slight technical problem with my graphics driver. At many points you are supposed to use the [W,A,S,D] keys to turn some valves. For me, this hadn't worked, and so I needed to use a gamepad's analog stick instead. Due to this, I decided to switch over to gamepad for playing the game. However, after a little while of playing with the gamepad, my game kept crashing at random moments for an unknown reason. This is when I decided that how I'm playing this game is plugging the gamepad in for the valves but then unplugging it for the rest of the game. So basically, I'm using the gamepad to turn valves, and that's it, due to a problem with the controls configuration. I did look into the problem with my graphics driver crashing (Windows Kernel Driver) however I wasn't able to find a fix - or one that worked for this game, anyway.\n\nUpdate #1: In addition, I have found that every now and again, the game crashes on the highest settings. I'm not sure if this is just due to my graphics driver, but I have lowered my graphics to "medium" to prevent crashes, as they are very fraustrating.\n\nUpdate #2: My graphics driver has still been crashing on Medium settings. This could possibly just be due to my driver but all other games have been fine. It's just this game that has been a little on the dodgy side. This happens on a very rare occasion now though, and so it doesn't worry me too much. And yes, my graphics drivers are fully updated.","February 19","true","17.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Produced by Capcom Lost Planet 3 stands out from all other games on the market. It is classified as an action/adventure / shooter.  It is the perfect combination done right as a hybrid game combining elements from series such as Metroid & Dead Space to create a fufilling experience. The main character actually plays much like the main character does from Dead Space 3. What I mean by this is the weapons and controls feel much like Dead Space 3 while at the same time the creatures in the game remind me most of the Metroid series published by Nintendo.\n\nThis is one of the most underated games in the history of Capcom's games and IP's they have made throughout many years of hard work. Many people complain that think the story and gameplay is nothing but mere mediocrity.\n\nNow I will tell you a story to illistrate my point why this is my favorite personal computer game I have ever played and gotten into. Remind you I don't play many shooters but it looks like Metroid with many elements taken from Dead Space which instantly became satisfying for me. A few years ago I got addicted and obsessed to a video game where I spent 2500 active gameplay hours in one game over a four year span without enjoying or playing much of any other games I had owned at the time. I got rescued from my addiction by Christ who is who ultimately saved me from my trap. In the points in my addiction for a long time I knew I would probally never be able to fully return back to gaming ever again because of what it always did to me. Though Christ said to me, "I will make you into the leader that you want to be deep down in your inner spirit. I will deliver you from your destruction but what I need you to do is to follow this road , steps , plan and recovery process I have before you to make sure that you never go back again and make the same mistakes."\n\nGod made me a leader of my realm and domain I fell into in materialism which was video and personal computer gaming. He has told me all the lessons, knowledge and discretion I need to be successful by sharing my story with others, giving others advice in which suffer from the same problem I suffered from and problems that are alike to save them from the pains I had to go through to be where I am now.\n\nWho am I now?  I am now a gamer that sets a time limit daily on the amount of time I spent on games. I have more going in my real-life now then I do a viritual world sometimes I am in. It is more about people to me now then it is about games and other materialism in life.\n\nI tell you all this story so you can understand that I am a guy that doesn't claim to have fun with many games because  to escape my addiction, I had to abandon all pleasurable vices I had at the time in order to not be tempted by my obsession I had anymore. Now I am able to finally enjoy Lost Planet 3, a game that is the first game since Resident Evil 6 I could tell you that I have enjoyed from the beginning to the end and found some satisfication in powering through the story, a love for the characters involved in the game and experienced good role models in the game that are protecting others in their colony from death and extinction.\n\n10/10. Would play many times again. Such a good game that is one of the most underated series in Capcom's IP history. Other then comparison to Metroid there are no other games that exist much like Lost Planet. I love the snowy environments, the character progression and especially at the end when the credits roll to see how many people contributed to make all of this possible.\n\nIf you like Metroid with many elements of Dead Space, love snowy environments and a strong story with characters you actually care about, character development and progression then try this one out and I promise you will not be dissapointed.","July 16, 2015","true","39.1"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","17","28","4","0"

Never played the first 2 despite really wanting to coz i like the look of the location and aliens.\n\nImpressions:\n\nThis is a great game hampered by a load of minor irritations. While I think it's worth playing I found myself constantly reminded of how the better games this one is aping handled things better. In fact I'd just 100% completed Dead Space 3 on hardcore when I started LP3 and found it extremely similar in mechanics but with a less interesting story and weapons.\n\nI hated the quest system right from the start. It pointed the way but not to what level of the base so you randomly pick a floor, wait for loading, wrong floor, try again. Maybe I missed something but it was beyond me.\n\nI was excited to get into the Mech and do some damage but early on it seems you trudge for minutes, get out and kill a bit, get back in, swipe some ice, trudge, repair with Mech, uneventfully trudge home. Even when the Mech gets into a fight its sadly quicktime events which I know some find pretty boring and these aren't as forgiving as Dead Space.\n\nWhat I found baffling was when on a repair mission the repair was done by holding down a key.. why wasn't the repair a mini-game? That could have been really fun and while the rest of the game feels a lot like Bioshock and Dead Space it seems a huge mistake not to have added this element as well.\n\nThe Good:\n*Looks great, the snow planet and it's occupants are impressive.\n*Weapons and aiming work well.\n*The story is functional and your characters situation feels real.\n*The tutorial is built seamlessly into early play.\n*Good voice acting.\n*Grapple hook works well but rarely tactically useful.\n*Camera locking makes for some interesting switches in movement mechanics.\n*Quests make sense and the main plot develops organically as you play.\n*Feels a lot like Dead Space 3 in mechanics and locations (take that how you will).\n*Reloads on death are quick enough and auto save gets you back into the action.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n*Lots of wandering around for audio logs.. for an achievement.\n*Walking Mech from location to location, at the start, is tedious\n*Guns are boring standards: pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rifle.\n*Mech Grapple line sometimes frustratingly picky about targeting.\n*Lack of damage info means your not sure if your shots are actually damaging.\n*Characters are mostly stereotypes with fetch/repair quests.\n*Early on the HUDs limited info makes the map confusing.\n*Some sections have no clear sub-objective and leave you stuck.\n*Walking the Mech for 3 minutes without diversion gets boring.\n*Repairing? Hold a key down... not even a mini game?\n*Missions usually have a tedious return journey back the way you came.\n*Aliens are confused by the Mech and get stuck on it while you kill em on foot.\n*Mech battles are quicktime events.\n*Seemingly random keybindings that could have been consolidated into one key.\n\nRecommended for: Dead Space 3 fans looking for a very similar but lesser experience. Shooters who don't mind console cliches like QTE's.\n\nConclusion.\n6.5/10. Both fun and frustrating and worth while if you can forgive console tropes and minor irritations.","December 6, 2013","true","10.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The map is broken into approximately 10 areas which lead to smaller areas and until you unlock fast travel you'll have to walk all the way through multiple ABSOLUTELY empty areas to get where you need. And even fast travel doesn't really help a lot since it's garbage and yes it will save you some time but you'll still have to spend a lot of time walking in your "Rig" and trust me it becomes a chore before long. The worst part is that you always have to come back to your base to get a new assignment, this is absolutely unnecessary and it would've been soooo much better if it was simply linear and you received your new orders via radio or something so you could move on without backtracking cuz you spend way too much time walking and it's depressing at times, trust me.

It wont win any awards and it certainly has some issues. That being said, it is FAR better than I was expecting and probably the best LP game. Certainly leaps and bounds beyond 2 at least.\n\nThe good:\n- Good world building and a decent-enough story. Sure it is a bit cliche at times and I cant even tell you any of the characters names, but it serves its purpose.\n- Pretty good level design / open world.\n- Fun gunplay / exploration.\n- Upgrades / sense of progression.\n- It can be quite pretty. Except for some (not all) faces.  Something about the main characters face bugs me.\n\nThe bad:\n- Bugs. (Ironically). I ran into 3 so far. One minor, the others more annoying.\n----1. Dialogue from past conversations randomly playing when I am in a mission doing other stuff.\n----2. A boss not moving after a certain point.\n----3. The same boss stomping on me and my character getting stuck below the ground "swimming" unable to move.\n- In previous LP games, you had options of RIG/Mech type. This game gives you one option and it is a bulky thing with no guns. Meant to serve for exploration but not combat, which might feel a bit backwards and against convention for the series.\n\nOverall, the game is good. I would recommend it (so far). If you had fond memories of 1/2 then you may find certain parts of this game a little off-putting.

Not even bothered finish the campaign, the gameplay is slow and stale.  Everything that was good about they prequeal I so dearly loved, they just completely ignored. After the 3 hours of play there has only been 3 different types on enemies, and 3 different weapons.\nThe story so far was very linear, and I saw no point in even attempted side quests as they sounded boring and offered no reward that would be worth while. I finally gave up after coming across a boss that consisted of just boring hold trigger, dodge combat until he died. And took several attempts as when he was near death if you failed to dodge he would stun lock you 3 times and you would be unable to dodge.\nAgain LP2 offered a great experience with huge rediculous bosses and crazy weapons you could pick up and swap between, The gameplay took some teamwork with the great co-op gameplay it had, and had to figure out what the tactic was to take it down. LP3 doesn't allow for co-op and the combat is nothing new. The ranking, customization and extra challanged and gamemodes that LP2 had to offer was what keep me playing after the story, where LP3 has nothing going for it.\nI have no idea what they were thinking to create this, I can only say they've focused a lot more on character building and attempted to make a more engaging and emersive story, which for me it even struggled to achieve that. I was interested to see the end of the story but I just could not be bothered with the gameplay I had to deal with up to this point.","November 9, 2015","false","3.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Very immersive. The first two games I barely have a few hours game-time total and could not stand the constant timer you were on. This game fixed that, changed T-ENG into currency instead of a timer for how long you have to live. Story is fantastic, the writing is really good. This would have been an alright B-grade sci-fi film. Voice acting is great too. The gameplay keeps you engaged and by the time it starts to get grindy you are fairly close to done. Playing through the first time on hard took me about 18 hours total. There are a few downsides to this game but everything else is great so I'm just going to list the few negatives:\n\n-Hunting down T-ENG post locations, albino Tarkaa, and Mementos counts for 80% of the grind in this game (use online guides or go crazy) and while optional doing all these things improves your character in lots of ways\n-One-off experience, after beating the game once I enjoyed almost all of my time with it but it's just one of those things only good once\n-Console port issues: A few mis-labled button hints and I had one crash in the very middle of the very last boss fight\n-Steam login issues: If you lose connection to Steam (problem either your end or Steam's end both) it will boot you out of the game into main menu, even on singleplayer, workaround is play in offline mode on Steam but you will not get achievements\n\nMultiplayer looks neat but I'm pretty sure not many people are playing. I beat the game, got Extreme Conditions achievement and am happy with the experience as a whole. A few small problems bring this down to a 7.5/10 overall rating for me, if they fixed the console port issues, crashes, and disconnects from Steam servers booting you even when my internet is fine then this would at least be an 8/10. Story and characters get 10/10. Regular price of $25 for game alone is too much, when it drops around $15 or about $1 an hour when playing through on hard then this is a good deal.","February 23, 2015","true","20.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I wouldn't pay the full price for sure, but for around $10 I would grab this again.\n\nThe game feels like Mass Effect; where you have a core base with 3 levels and go out on various missions. The "rig" or mech is somewhat slow, but I didn't find it to be a negative experience. The mech is just a transport to get you to various areas; from here you will exit the rig and kill some aliens.\n\nMultiplayer was dead so that sucks, it looks like it could have had some potential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitechili/recommended/226720/","whitechili","whitechili","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitechili/","23 products in account","Introduction:\nI got this game for 6.99. Not even worth that much. The combat is always the same: shoot the little guys with your pistol and kill them in one shot. Boss fights are always the same. You fight the same scorpion and crab thing 4 times! Almost back to back! The part of the game that was suposed to be the best... sucks. My next complaint. You get this stupid rig that the only thing it is useful for is giving your ammo back. Combat is HORRIBLE in it. You are always better to get out WHEN YOU CAN. Sometimes the game forces you to stay in the rig to fight bosses. Fighting is bland on its own and just plain out frustrating in the rig. Even fighting the little guys is a pain because of your limited range! The huge metal tank rig DOESNT EVEN HAVE A GUN ON IT! Don't buy this game! Not even if it is on sale. I gave it 8 and a half hours to give me something good combat wise and I got nothing. The story is cool but the actual game itself was terrible. They should make a Lost Planet 3 movie. That would be better than the game itself. Shows how bad this game was and I regret spending 6.99$ on it.\n\nNow onto bug complaints. When it says rotate with wsad, it really means spam F. I probably wasted 10 minutes sitting there hitting wasd in every possible combo until I just got bored and tapped f and it worked. Also, when you get the winch thing, a little caution tap logho looking thing appears. You to move into just the right position to where the logo changes to Z and then shoot the winch. I spent 20 minutes trying every possible place to throw the winch.\n\nControls: TERRIBLE! To pick up items, you have to reach all the way across the keyboard to hit the P key. Since it has multiple controls for picking things up (control for pick up item, control for pick up ammo, which are both set to P by default) and it doesnt allow you to bind the same key to multiple things, so you are pretty much stuck with it\n\nWeapon choice: sucks. the grenade launcher is absolutely useless in 99.999% of combat situations. Buy the shotgun and assault rifle if you muist purchase this game. That and the pistol are the only useful weapons and I found myself using the pistol 99% of the time. You don't even need to buy weapons. I played the game on normal and I rarely needed to pull out the shotgun or the assault rifle unless I just wante dto quickly finish off a boss\n\nTo sum up combat: shoot or drills small glowing areas for bosses which somehow can take 36 shotgun rounds before showing any damage has been taken. The little guys are just annoying. They make annoying noises and there are usually so many, you find yourself begging for no combat so you can just continue the story because the combat is TERRIBLY ANNOYING, FRUSTRATING, AND BORING.\n\nVisibility: 80% of the time you can barely see what is only a few feet in front of you. All you see if blue and white everywhere. Occasionally you see red, but those are just Akrid eggs (the monsters that want to kill you) and they explode if you get near them without destroying them.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nLP3 suffers from bad combat, bad visibility, bad controls, and gives the player no sense of upgrading or gain because the upgrades to weapons are useless unless they are extended mag upgrades (pretty much the only upgrades). The only pros to LP3, in my opinion, are the story and the graphics. LP3 is a pretty good looking game. The story is interesting, but with how much annoying combat, bad visibility, and bad controls there are pretty much cancel this one out. I would never recommend this game to anyone.","June 17, 2015","false","8.3"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","36","68","5","0"

Your primary obstacles are arthropods that inhabit the planet. You are able to purchase and upgrade firearms and you travel around in a large, upgradeable robot suit that you will use to do battle with. The game consists of a typical primary and side-quest system that allows you to stray and then progress the story at your own pace.\n\nI felt that the story was fairly good and I say that because I actually wanted to play through it to find out what happened next. The gameplay isn't particularly difficult, I played through on 'normal' difficulty, but there are maybe a couple moments where you might get frustrated; there may be some tricks to defeating certain bosses.\n\nI thought that the graphics and audio were good considering that it's a last-gen console game. I ran it at 2560×1440 @ 144Hz and it sat at 144FPS the entire time with the exception of some small hitches in one area. I had no bad technical issues with the game but there were a couple issues: 1) the 'turn the claw' button is displayed wrong and 2) it seems that if Steam goes offline that the game boots you to the title screen; fortunately it auto saves often.\n\nI enjoyed it and I might even re-play just a bit but it's not a game I'll probably entirely replace since most things are achievable in the first playthough.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILERS:\n1) You're run out of ammo on one boss and will have to use the handgun to pick away at it.\n2) One of the later bosses seems to be immune to grenade damage.","November 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If that is a major turn off I would not reccomend getting this. Lost Planet 3 is an interesting case where the devs decided to take a more story driven approach. You play this game for its story, and that's about it. It has this interesting quest system that made me feal as if I were playing an rpg game, and to be honest I liked it. I believe the game has a great story, one that really wrapped me into to it. While the pacing could have been better I really felt for the characters, they meant something to me. And in terms of story driven games, that is very good.\nBut now lets talk about the gameplay itself. Lost Planet 3 takes a Dead Space approach to over-the-shoulder third person view, unlike other Lost Planet games. The gunplay is also similar to the Dead Space series. There is a lot of running from here to there but don't worry there are plenty of baddies to shoot on your way...most of the time.\nThe game has its fair share of good and bad, the good being the story, and the bad being the fact that this game does not do justice to the Lost Planet name. Really what is important to know is that this is a game with a good story and decent gameplay, but do not expect it to be the next big Lost Planet game it set out to be.\n","February 20","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not nearly as bad as people (fanboys) make it out to be. It is however very different from the previous games. In this game you are freelancing for a mining company so you pick up missions from their base and head out to complete them. In the base you have 3 points of interest which are Lab, Shop, and Workshop.\nLab offers missions that reward new ammo types in the shop.\nShop is where you buy stuff with T-Energy.\nWorkshop lets you upgrade your mech.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe multiplayer is pretty dead but it would be quite fun if people actually played. It has a progression system with ranks that don't affect gear unlocks.

Plausible, relatable characters with some genuine depth to them, along with a wide variety of enemies that challenge you to improve and adapt as you play. A smallish but well-chosen selection of weapons, larger if you consider the offensive potential of your giant mining robot... which you should, because not every game that lets you pilot a giant robot really makes you feel like you're in one -but this one does. It doesn't zip along on jet feet, sure, but that just makes it feel more real, more massive.\n\nControls are quite functional, one issue exists where an incorrect on-screen instruction says "Rotate W/S/A/D" when it means "rapidly tap F", but a quick googling could have told you that much. To make it up to you, if you have an Xbox Controller for Windows, you can literally plug it in as you play, use it to do perform the gamepad versions of various tool interactions, then unplug it again to return to mouse aiming. Or you can use it all the time if you like, just saying.\n\nGraphics are perfectly fine, bordering on gorgeous. Depends how picky you are, I suppose, but I find it hard to imagine the type of person who would actually complain. This game has a lot to offer and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys mechs, shooting, narrative or combinations thereof. At its current price of €40, I would wait for a sale, but if you can catch it at a price that works for you, I say don't hesitate. The sound of your rig's soundtrack, echoing across a snow-swept canyon and up to your perch on a recently-grappled cliff, is waiting.","January 31, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The series has always been known for it's massive, colossal boss battles and frantic action. The story takes a back seat and you just blow stuff away. Lost Planet 1 had amazing boss fights, but was repetitive in the gameplay department and the story stopped making any sense halfway through. Lost Planet 2 forget to implement a story and instead gave us an intense, action packed kill fest that we could play with friend. Mindless, but fun.\n\nThen developer Spark gave us Lost Planet 3. Finally we have a logical and coherent story with characters that don't feel like they have jumped out of a bad anime. The story is a prequel to the first Lost Planet and follows the original colonists sent to explore E.D.N. III.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing special at all. Just another run-of-the-mill third person shooter in a sort-of open environment. You fight enemies, earn money, upgrade your weapons and your RIG, which is your giant mining mech you use to traverse the hazardous landscapes of the planet. There are some sidequests to earn a little extra cash, and the game itself is a decent length at about 15 to 20 hours depending on how much you want to explore. The graphics are decent, and some of the outdoor environments are gorgeous, but some of the character models are rather bland and the animations can be spotty.\n\nThe story manages to stay very interesting throughout, and unlike it's predecessors, makes sense. There are a few jumps in the plot here and there, and the game ends with a few questions still unanswered, but the result is still satisfying. What makes Lost Planet 3 great is it's main character, Jim Peyton.\n\nJim Peyton is a simple man who takes a mining job on E.D.N. III to support his family. Jim isn't special in any way, has no mysterious past, or any special skills or attributes, he is just a guy who travels halfway across the galaxy out of love for his wife and son. Throughout the game, Jim receives audio and video transmissions from his wife, and he sends some of his own in return. The two are just so damn adorable to watch and every message between them just makes their characters that much stronger and more interesting. His love and devotion gives him the drive to survive and keeps him smiling and helping those around him. Jim is not a battle hardened warrior or brooding anti-hero, he is a human being like you and me. You want Jim to succeed. You want Jim to see his family. You can't help but get engrossed in his journey from the very beginning and pray for a happy ending for the two.\n\nThe gameplay may be standard, but the story of Jim Peyton is a damn good one. In my opinion, he ranks up with some of the best video game protagonists like John Marston and Nathan Drake. Lost Planet 3 came and went with minimal fanfare, which is sad. Because under a by-the-numbers shooter lies a fantastic, character-driven story that 90% of games fail to achieve.","February 13","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The setting sucked me in instantly, and roaming around on foot or in my hulking rig instills a sense of isolation and feels authentically cold. The characters are all well developed and interesting, even the Nicholas Cage look alike you play as. The missions themselves are interesting for the most part, especially the facility you explore that takes a more horror centric approach. Really the game's trouble lies in its combat. The guns feel underpowered most of the time, and the knock down hits you take from bosses feel cheap. The QTEs are also strange, you are forced to wait until the last moment to dodge or block, rather than using quick reaction time. For example I see an enemy telegraphing a hit, if I roll as soon as he starts his cue I'll get hit. You're supposed to dodge at the EXACT moment his fist is about to clobber you, not before. All in all a little disjointed, but for 2 dollars (bundle price) I am enjoying the heck out of it.

It has flawed level design, the occassional showstopping bug (especially on the PC port), and some frustrating boss fights, especially when forced to use your clumsy "rig". Outside of those flaws, the action is not great, but it is good - it is a solid shooter. It is quite linear - you have reasonably free roam at times, but there is generally only one path through an area once there. This is not a flaw in my opinion - it works well with the game's format.\n\nThere are many opinions on what lets the game down - my theory is the level design, which drives the need for such silly restrictions on mechanics like the grappling hook - but whatever the cause, this game suffers deeply for it, because the non-game elements of this game are superb. The levels don't play well, but look incredible; the characters, especially the lead character, are interesting; the voice acting is excellent; and the writing is well above par for most games. Those elements - especially the story - were what sucked me in and kept me going, even as the gameplay grew more and more frustrating.\n\nIf you enjoy a good story along with a bit of shooting that it sometimes annoying, you could do worse than this, and it will be worth getting on discount; but for the game alone, I cannot justify recommending it to others.","June 5","false","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Character development is spectacular. Voice acting, animation, and environment make all characters supremely believable, if not lovable).\n+ Environments are incredible (The planet is portrayed as hellish and inhospitable, and by god does the level design deliver. Environments often change as the game progresses. As an example, imagine a blinding, otherworldly snowstorm. Massive, house-sized chunks of ice ripped from the earth and tossed about in the storm, crashing into your rig and slamming into the ground. This game delivers.)\n++ Ambiance is supreme (as someone who has always prized ambiance in a game, this game makes me giddily happy. Iced over wreckage from a long lost expedition echoes and creaks as ancient ice shifts and cracks. Crew quarters at the home base glow from the warmth of wall heaters and sing with the music of a guitar wielding crew member, who gets better as time goes by. Inhospitable alien caves pulse and crackle with forbidden energy and echo with the feral screams of frenzied akrid. Frigid wastelands howl with freezing gales of wind, as you, the pilot, huddle securely in your rig's cockpit. A good set of headphones and a decent computer will transport you to this unforgettable experience.)\n+ Gameplay is polished (Guns handle well. The rig feels every bit to be the one-of custom machine that it is claimed to be. The player gets stronger and more skilled as the game progresses, but the volatile, aggressive enemy never becomes any less of a threat.)\n\nOverall, the story and immersion are unparalleled. Anyone who played the first two games can attest to the minimal, often confusing story that the games presented (frequent faction switches and cut-scenes certainly portrayed EDN III well, but the players still generally had no idea as to what was going on beyond "Those enemies have T-ENG. Shoot 'em!"). This game more than reconciles that, giving context and clarity to the first two installments, as well as carving a beautifully crafted story for itself. Many of the game tweaks that nay-sayers complain of are actually meticulous details that improve immersion.\n\nTo address some:\n\n-Rig is slow? It's a utility rig, not a fast attack vehicle. I feel like a pilot in a lumbering machine, not like a speedy player in a twitch run-and-gun.\n-Guns suck? Guns are actually great! Upgrades make a noticeable difference, and every gun has a purpose, rather than some guns becoming washed out by later acquisitions. All this just makes the giant, armored akrid in front of you that much more intimidating when it doesn't go down easy.\n-FPS drops? I have a 5 year old rig, am running everything on max, and have never dropped below 60 fps.\n-Controls suck? Keyboard controls do suck, yes, but this game was always intended for use with a game-pad. Use one.\n-Repetitive and boring? Yeah... Tell me more about how you came to that conclusion with only 3 hours in-game... Go back to your run-and-gun.\n\nOverall, highly recommended to anyone that digs a good story and fans of Lost Planet/Dead Space. Just don't expect CoD action pacing. You aren't a 'roided-out super soldier (Hi, Marcus!). You aren't the Hero of Time. You are a married man, looking to make a living for his family on an inhospitable rock. If you have a good set of headphones and want to be transported to a savagely beautiful, icy world where untimely death is a daily consideration, this is the game for you!","October 19, 2015","true","44.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I tried playing it on hard to start, but the battles against armored Akrid got to be too trudging, so I lowered it to easy and really got into the story.\n\nLike most Capcom games, it is lacking as a PC port, since it keeps the sorry autosave of consoles instead of a save-when-you-want and quicksave feature like a real PC game. The keyboard and mouse controls were serviceable (though the incorrect prompt for turning the claw took some research to overcome - Press F, not WASD). There were a few too many quick-time-events, like in the Resident Evil games, which made my forearms ache (I can only press F so fast, people!).\n\nThe game looks great, and plays pretty good. It was a bit different than Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, but I didn't think that game was the best ever, so a little change was fine by me.  The boss battles were challenging and maybe a bit too picky about how, exactly, you did what the game wanted. The overall experience was positive, though, and a fine addition to the Lost Planet story. It makes me even more interested in playing Lost Planet 2, which I've been waiting for a super cheap sale on.","April 6, 2015","true","193.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Inhospitable alien caves pulse and crackle with forbidden energy and echo with the feral screams of frenzied akrid. Frigid wastelands howl with freezing gales of wind, as you, the pilot, huddle securely in your rig's cockpit. A good set of headphones and a decent computer will transport you to this unforgettable experience.)\n+ Gameplay is polished (Guns handle well. The rig feels every bit to be the one-of custom machine that it is claimed to be. The player gets stronger and more skilled as the game progresses, but the volatile, aggressive enemy never becomes any less of a threat.)\n\nOverall, the story and immersion are unparalleled. Anyone who played the first two games can attest to the minimal, often confusing story that the games presented (frequent faction switches and cut-scenes certainly portrayed EDN III well, but the players still generally had no idea as to what was going on beyond "Those enemies have T-ENG. Shoot 'em!"). This game more than reconciles that, giving context and clarity to the first two installments, as well as carving a beautifully crafted story for itself. Many of the game tweaks that nay-sayers complain of are actually meticulous details that improve immersion.\n\nTo address some:\n\n-Rig is slow? It's a utility rig, not a fast attack vehicle. I feel like a pilot in a lumbering machine, not like a speedy player in a twitch run-and-gun.\n-Guns suck? Guns are actually great! Upgrades make a noticeable difference, and every gun has a purpose, rather than some guns becoming washed out by later acquisitions. All this just makes the giant, armored akrid in front of you that much more intimidating when it doesn't go down easy.\n-FPS drops? I have a 5 year old rig, am running everything on max, and have never dropped below 60 fps.\n-Controls suck? Keyboard controls do suck, yes, but this game was always intended for use with a game-pad. Use one.\n-Repetitive and boring? Yeah... Tell me more about how you came to that conclusion with only 3 hours in-game... Go back to your run-and-gun.\n\nOverall, highly recommended to anyone that digs a good story and fans of Lost Planet/Dead Space. Just don't expect CoD action pacing. You aren't a 'roided-out super soldier (Hi, Marcus!). You aren't the Hero of Time. You are a married man, looking to make a living for his family on an inhospitable rock. If you have a good set of headphones and want to be transported to a savagely beautiful, icy world where untimely death is a daily consideration, this is the game for you!","October 19, 2015","true","44.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The controls may take a bit to used to, but so far I'm enjoying it. The mixed reviews here are quite misleading. Imagine if Diablo 3 were on steam, you'd see the exact same complaints here when that released, that it's not like the first two. Those who haven't played the first two won't really care.\n\nMy only gripe so far are the controls. They did take a bit to get used to because the aiming feels floaty (console-ish), and the binds for the mech suit were clearly an afterthought. The story is interesting and it's a fun ride so far as well.

I have mixed feeling about this game. The first half of the campaign is great, I really feel like I'm a rookie employee in an exteme condition planet stumbling upon a dark secret. But the second half is mediocre at best. The plot and storytelling is mediocre. Graphic quality is comparable to other 2013 A-list games while the game play is standard third-person shooter.\n\nOverall it's still enjoyable experience. Only one thing annoyed me, there is no manual saves, only checkpoints. The checkpoints are far between and there is no option to skip in-game cutscenes. So everytime I died, I have to watch the same cutscene over and over again.\n\nBy the way, this game has great music soundtrack that really fit the game atmosphere. Setting the giant mecha on top of a mountain and just watching the sky while listening to the music is a breeze. Video-output the game to the projector and audio-output the music to the hi-fi sound system... and I'm lost in the planet ;)\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on sale price.","May 26","true","56.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The voice acting was good and script was at times really funny.  The story was enough to make me want to see what happens next.  The combat was alright and there are guns, mech, and upgrades.  So it has a lot going for it and on its own it wasn't a bad game for a third person action game.\n\nI would not give this game a thumbs down... but let me tell you why I didn't like it and some folks will agree while others will not.\n\nI love the isolated feeling, massive boss fights, and soaking up T energy like a fat pig in Lost Planet 1.  I had a blast with all the different areas, weapons, coop, even more massive boss fights in Lost Planet 2.  In fact out of my 350+ steam games, it is in the "Fav" list of about 20 games.\n\nLost Planet 3 wasn't really anything like Part 1 or Part 2... with the exception of Ice and monsters with glowy areas.  I cannot quite put my finger on it, but this felt dumbed down in combat, boss fights, and areas were small/cramped.  The combat wasn't as fluid and it felt sluggish compared.\n\nMany people who didn't like Part 1 and 2, may like this... but most people didn't find Part 1 and 2 as fun as I did.\n\nAnyways - Not a bad game, has good stuff going for it, but wasn't what I expected.","January 18, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also the multiplayer is dead :(\n\nI really liked it. I mean sure theres a few gripes, and its certainly no Lost Planet 2, which I general consider one of the best games I've ever played. But it was well made, handled well, weapons felt good, and the Aliens were suitably creepy looking. A lot of the time It honestly felt like I was playing a Dead Space title; in a good way. Particularly in how your giant robot doesn't actually have a weapon on it - Isaac Clark would be proud. The creepy abandoned bases parts were easily my favourite.\n\nOn the flip side, to talk about negatives: The ending is fairly stupid. Multiplayer is dead (so keep in mind You're paying for half a game), ammo is never a problem, It feels short and really could've used more areas, and most annoyingly is grapple hook is limited to where they say you can use it (as opposed to previous titles where it was a mode of transit). Also hard mode is the kind of hardmode where everything is the same, but all the damage values are horribly skewed against you.\n\nI can't tell you if you'll like it, it was fun and well made romp though winter wonderland that makes me wish it had another 10 hours of story in it.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere, fight mechanics, utility rig, landscapes, main character and other characters, story and ending. Locations aren't boring (but may become boring when revisiting for collectibles), although walking long distances is a bit annoying. Side quests like emptying tanks over and over could be interesting - but it's really easy to get lot of currency so i've never done it and felt that it's unnecessary. Other side quests however are quite interesting. Boss fights focus mainly on QTE, but well... the feeling is great. Fighting on foot focuses greatly on dodging, but fights are hard, you can feel how dangerous is the planet and winning gives a lot of satisfaction. But...\nEnemy respawns are sometimes really annoying and they can kill all the fun in fighting.\nAltogether the game is fun, story interesting, sometimes touching and overall nicely told.

The cutscenes are its high point, and I'd often find myself trudging along just to get to the next one and advance the plot. You'll spend the majority of the game tasked with reaching a specific point, using your slow-moving robotic biped ("mech") that isn't nearly as fun to operate as it should be, navigating corridors on foot, and shooting waves of bug-like alien creatures along the way with routine boss fights. It gets very tedious and redundant very quickly; I found myself continually hoping it would improve, but it never did.

The shooting is very competent and the structure of the game, while not unique, is pretty cool. It basically feels structure-wise at least, like the first Arkham game. An open world that opens up more as you gain new equipment and upgrades, more or less Metroid style. I love the aspect of being a miner essentially in a giant mech, setting forth into undiscovered and dangerous territory on a frozen desolate planet. This scenario lends itself to a great atmosphere.\n\nSecondly, This game is literally nothing like the previous 2 entries, unfortunately. Lost Planet 2 is probably the most unappreciated game of all time, and is easily one of the best co-op experiences ever. So, obviously fans of the series will be turned off by Lost Planet 3 at least initially.\n\nWhile not much of a Lost Planet game mechanically, LP3 stands on its own as worthwhile experience in my opinion. The music from Jack Wall (Mass Effect 3) is outstanding and haunting. The core gameplay is good enough to not get repetive or frustrating in the some odd- 15 hour playtime. Taking out big monsters on an ice planet will always be rad, so its got that going for it. The story is actually really good, which is a first for the series, and it basically tells the story of how EDN III came to be the way we find it in Lost Planet and Lost Planet 2.\n\nAll that said, Lost Planet has gotten a bum wrap by critics in its last two entries. There is plenty here to enjoy, and if you like scifi or third person shooters, you will be suprised by how much you enjoy this game.

Some spoilers will be in this review.\n\nI HAVE TO SAY I REALLY ENJOYed PLAYING THIS GAME,no matter i gave negative review.\n\nStory is very interesting,excellent optimization(my 5 years old pc can run game on high settings),beautiful world,interesting missions,battles in rig are interesting....and it's reavealed that there will be LostPlanet4 with Jim Peyton's granddaugther as main character... and that's pretty much all positive things i can say about game....\nUnlike most of serials where sons of daugters are replacing their fathers or mothers,we have granddaughter here! And in my opinion,this is one of most interesting and unique things about this game...\n\nNow to bad parts...\n\n-Controls are extremly bad. Let's take riding a rig for example. Does really E have to be used for getting in or out of rig instead of using it in battle? Assuming you use WASD for moving, E and Q should be used for most important things that you need most of time.\n\n-User interface is also extremly bad. Especially map and logs you collect.\n\n-You can fast travel in open world of lost planet 3(which is small,but reasonable for this type of game and it isn't problem),but.... you can only fast travel when you approach new sector of map,which is extremly ridicilous...I did not expect to fast travel while you're in hidden building,but while you're on road...\n\n-NO SMALL RIGS !!! In Lost Planet 2,you had small rigs that you could use in battle. NEVEC is also major part in LostPlanet3,i don't see reason why developers didn't put some small rigs too in game instead of only gigantic one...\n\n-Lack of Akrid species ! If i remember well,in lost planet 2 there was at least 10 different Akrid Bosses(bosses,not lesser akrid creatures). In lost Planet 3,all together there are cca 13 different Akrid creatures(Bosses+lesser Akrids)... Some bosses you have to fight multiple times during campaign,so basicly... There is only 1 unique boss(Big Red Worm)... That's very pathetic... Most of game you will spent fighting sepia and armored sepia akrids...\n\n-SNIPING... Using snipers is very hard to use,kinda broken...Not in way that it's made to feel like real life,it's broken is way that developers made mistake... Who played game,they will know what im saying...\n\n-END OF GAME... LostPlanet serial is known worldwide by figting Huge Akrid... At the end of game,you fight enemy rig,not Akrid(althought,there was huge chance to put final unique boss)\n\n-Storyline have some tiny flaws... What was Jim Peyton and her granddaugter doing in cave when he got crushed by rocks. What happened with Jim's son(s) or daugter(s),what happened with his wife? This might be fixed in LostPlanet4 althought...\n\n-There are some small FPS drops and short freezes during one part of storyline,but nothing scarry...\n\n-Your ammo count and the rest of your HUD disappear when you get too far from rig,what is extremly stupid since you have small computer on your hand(like pipboy from Fallouts)... For example,you can always see how many granades you have left on Jim's belt,but when you get to far from rig,HUD dissapear !\n\n-At the beggining of the game,people in base warning you about storms and how dangerous it can be.In my 19 hours of gameplay,during all free roams,i did not have any problem with storms,except those during main storyline quests...\n\nPitty.This game had huge potentional,but obviously developers made awful job.\nIf anyone will read my review,don't bother yourselfs with those who say world is small(and i see most of those who gave negative review they complain about that),world is just big as it's supposed to be.\n\nI simply can't give positive review to this game,to much flaws or missing things...However,i deffinitly would reccomend you to buy this game... WHILE IT'S ON SALE!!! Paying 25€ for this is deffinitly not worth...\n\nIf LostPlanet 2 was 9.5/10... LostPlanet3 is 5/10...","July 17, 2015","false","41.8"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","1"

I would say Lost Planet 2 is my favorite because of the freedom to explore and the ability to customize your character and weapons but Lost Planet 3 has changed into a generic third person shooter.

Awesome. (You'll love picking up Akrid followed by crushing them with your claw hand or drilling them to death)\n-No longer straight forward stage after stage, open world for the most part (though the story will pretty much lead you straight forward, take your time to explore to get the most out of this).\n-Thermal energy is now used as a form of currency/EXP to purchase new weapons and upgrades for various purposes.\n-Weapon upgrades change the physical appearance of the weapons along with a few misc upgrades here and there.\n-Put your own soundtracks from your PC into your rig/mech! (Why can't all games have some sort of ingame playlist like this?)\n-Explains a hell of a lot about E.D.N. III.\n-You really get pulled into the story and want to push forward more to find out where it all leads (At first it's a pretty meh /boring I admit, but go through it a while things get real interesting real fast).\n-Quick travel does not unlock right away giving you a chance to immerse yourself in the environment and various category storms.\n-A whole lot more.\n\nCons:\n-No more co-op campaign?!?!.. DAMN IT! (Dunno about anyone else, but this is what I enjoyed most about LP2 and the only reason why I bought it in the first place. That stuff was fun on the hardest difficulty when playing 4 player co-op).\n-Minor bugs here and there such as some akrid stuck in walls and not showing on radar yet knowing they're full well there and hearing them (Yes this is a bug, not an ambient sound or Akrid crawling in vents or anything).\n-Why does my game crash when I press F4 to skip a track and I can only safely skip back using F3? (Originally the F4 key wouldn't work so I manually set it to F4 again in the control options. Ever since I reset the F4 button it just crashes the game every time I skip forward in music. If it doesn't for you then try skipping back and forward a few times and see what happens and lemme know if it's just me).\n-Rotate claw using w/a/s/d? That doesn't work! *mashing of keyboard* Oh.. It's F! (This is really weird seeing as the tooltips actually show correctly when you manually set keys)\n-In some crawl spaces and tight areas (it'd be a spoiler if I added more description to that) for some reason the character seems to struggle greatly to move through and you're forced to press a variety of buttons w/a/s/d just to get the character 2 maybe 3 steps through the gap towards the end of it? (this has only happened once or twice so far so really, no biggy)\n-Sometimes the character can dodge a little weirdly or.. Out of sync I guess? (your character is invunerable when you press the spacebar at the right time, this can result in a few clipping issues with the Akrid - basically the attack had obviously hit you yet you somehow are out of it unscathed).\n-Needs an increase in run speed or a decrease in standard roll speed, your character has no roll limitation and rolls a hell of a lot faster over running/sprinting (This is a big pet hate of mine when games do this, pretty sure I don't need to explain why).\n\nI covered most the good and bad points me thinks.. Though I'm still not quite done playing this, I've been taking my time with it as I literally want to do everything I can in LP3 - I feel it is worth it. It really is an awesome game, not sure why so many of the LP fans disliked this one. Oddly enough the gameplay reminds me a lot of Dead Space and I can't really figure out why..\n\nAnywho all the cons I mentioned are nothing game breaking and nothing really all THAT bad because these things don't really happen often aside from the rig/mech music thing, but that could entirely just be something on my end. Honestly though since they're not that big (the bugs) I'm not sure why Capcom didn't bother to fix these minor issues, wouldn't have taken much.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis is a great game you wouldn't want to miss in my opinion, how I overlooked this for a fair while simply because it had no co-op campaign is beyond me and a really silly reason now that I think about it! It would've been a great asset to the game if it had that function, but honestly co-op campaigns can sometimes restrict storyline quite heavily and this here would've been one of those cases. No regrets in buying this game and after 10 hours so far I'm still finding myself getting more and more caught up in the story and the game itself.\n\nLookin' forward to more installations of the LP series if more are to be made.","February 20, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I just listened to all the reviewers out there and thought it was a crappy game BUT having played it myself I only feel annoyed for not picking this game up a lot earlier!! I played through Lost Planet and most of LP2. It seems each game has it's own personality but this latest installment is very good. The presentation is great (graphics and audio work well to create a believable environment) and the story and characters do a good job. Just wanted to ensure that if anyone else out there feels unsure about this but loves gaming in general that they buy it and have a go. I grabbed it in the sale and I'm very happy with it. This has really taught me a lesson not to listen so hard to the reviewers opinions. Dead Space copycat it isn't...there are similarities BUT I think this game holds it's own. I've kept it vague as I didn't want to ruin the originaliity of the opening hour as I found it a real nice suprise...thanks to all those who wrote reviews saying it wasn't that bad.

I played the first two when they were released and the experiences I had with them led me to not bother with the 3rd for the longest time, boy was I wrong.\nOne of things I look for in a game is a great story wrapped in a solid campaign mode, also being huge science fiction dork, this game had everything I needed. It's an absolutely solid story through and through, plenty of twists and plenty of exposition throughout. So many things that bug me about most science fiction stories where outright done away with within the first hour or so, Jim Payton is perhaps the most grounded and realistic protagonist i've ever seen in a game. He asked every question I would have asked and done everything I would have done in the same (albeit totally ludicrous) situation. The voice acting and dialogue where outstanding, full of really great writing and genuinely likeable characters. The story never dragged, it never slogged and there was just enough to keep it going at a great pace, highly enjoyable right up to the credits.\n\nThe gameplay is doled out through perfectly serviceable a solid 3rd person cover based shooting and giant mech sections. Running around on foot can be a little slow outdoors, but you'll be busy soon enough fighting off hordes of giant bugs and loving every minute of it. The combat on foot feels tight, all the weapons maybe your standard game fare but they all pack a hell of a punch, they handle great and upgrades keep things nice and dynamic. The mech sections are fun for whole other reasons, it just feels so cool to wander round the frozen tundra smashing and drilling your way to success. The game is almost half exterminator half space drilling simulator and I loved all of it. The world itself is a mash up between Hoth (some of those corridors look awfully familiar) and the Ishimura from dead space, each sections bring their own challenges to combat and traversal, exploring was a blast.\n\nLastly the graphics, boy is this a pretty looking game. Maybe not the most technically advanced but the animation was top notch, lip syncing and cut scene work superb and the whole thing just had a real science fiction feel to it. Seeing that stark orange color against the cold blue background just made me happy.  Framerate was flawless, never dropped and never stuttered, audio mix was great. Really have nothing to bad to say about it. Game time clocked in at about 11 hours with a few side quests still left to do. Unfortunately I haven't gotten round to the multiplayer yet, I remember the other two being a blast so I'll be interested to see what happens with it.\n\nSo at current, for a few quid you can have one of the most grounded and entertaining  science fiction stories in years, and I highly recommend anyone who likes a good space age drama to give it a go!\n","February 21, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It really brings the feel of being on a frozen harsh world with unfriendly rare wildlife across.\nThe graphics may look a bit flat and sometimes comic like due to the missing ambient occlusion and the like, but the engine is so less demanding that you can play it in highest settings also on older cards and with DSR in 4k on newer ones and then it looks really not that bad!\n\nWhile it may have been a bit expensive for what you got then it was released, I think nowadays 25€ is ok and I got it for under 10€ in the latest Steam Deal thing and it was completely worth every € for me.\nI didn't experience the mentioned glitches - I guess they are mostly fixed by now.\n\nSo if there is another Steam reduced price event for this game in the future and you like to be just entertained for a few hours with a decent SciFi Shooter I would recommend giving LP3 a shot!","March 1, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Dialoge is very well done. If choppy and at times slow. I like the characters. Did i mention it was slow?\n\nEverything is slow! There is a good story there, somewhere but it takes so freeking long! Long walks, long pauses between characters. Long transition animations...\n\nAnd a whole host of dumb, mind numbing, repetitive, pace slowing, rediculous things that drop kick you out of the game experience.\n\n1. Crouching tiger. In the middle of combat why do I have to put away my guns and crawl through a hole I could stand up in? Btw, some akrid can kill you while you are crouching, others walk right on by and ignore you until you leave the tunnel... or pipe... or whatever it is you appear to be hiding under.\n\n2. Lethargic mechs. Many times I find its better to get out and take on the 3 story monster bare handed. The mech would never counter or block with (q). It just wouldn't. And the times that it did... you had to wait while the world stopped and the akrid gave you his arm.... then you insert your massive, upgraded drill into the glowy flesh and drill..... and drill.... and drill..... and drill.... and dri... you get it. Each time it shrugs you off and you have to do it again. Honestly, its better to just dodge a little, and throw a grenade in its throat and manually blow its arms off with you shotgun. Leave the mech at home.\n\n3. Troublesome game mechanics. Collision problems. Spawning issue.... ugh. Lots of stuff. I try to dive away from aggressive, tough akrid but instead my idiot goes into cover... WHAm! Then I try to run... slowly.... it doesn't help. The  Akrid change directions mid air. Its actually faster to forward dive/roll around the map- you look like an idiot, but its faster. Oh, and if you die... you have to watch the whole cutscene over again. Enjoy! :D\n\n4. Touchscreen, would be better than these controls. P is pick up ammo? really? Ok fine, ill change them. They have 'F' and 'E' as multiple uses/actions but apparently I can't use 'E' twice. What?\n\n5. Users manual. Ignore it. When the screen says 'use w/a/s/d to manipulate the controls - its lying. Use smash 'f' repeatedly or mash your keyboard until you find it.\n\n6. Misfire.... some weapons like the crossbows malfunction and can make you kill yourself. Especially if you are injured. Surprise!\n\n7. OC? or just OC? No... there is an Akrid somewhere in the map still. The door won't open until you kill it. Nope, you can't flip that switch until all the akrid are gone. Oh, and you can't repair that either. Not until later. :D Yes, you could repair it earlier... but you can't now. Even though it might be helpful.\n\n8. Fire for effect.... and thats about it. Turrets have practically no ammo on hard. Don't bother taking the risk to repair them.\n\nAnd in spite of all of this..... I want to know the story. What happens!? But to do that I have to drill for red stuff and trudge up a mountain again. Sigh* fine!\n\nI'm sorry, did I recommend this game? I guess I'm stubbern like that.

Haven't played much but the story seems intriguing. Although, this game has changed throughout the Lost Planet series. Lost Planet had a main story line whereas Lost Planet 2 did not. I found Lost Planet 2 to be different as it gave me the impression of being a hunter in a partial open world where you can grapple hook onto anything and run around shooting aimlessly. I would say Lost Planet 2 is my favorite because of the freedom to explore and the ability to customize your character and weapons but Lost Planet 3 has changed into a generic third person shooter. Those who have not played the Lost Planet series I recommend that you try this. Those of you who are fans of the old Lost Planet series may be disappointed.","June 24, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

At first I didnt like the game, it seemed like a poor console port, with invisible walls stopping you from accessing certain areas, for eg. a 40ft mech unable to advance past a 1ft step. After awhile though you tend to forgive this poor design and just enjoy the game for what it is..... and that is a pretty decent third person game with plenty of well hidden collectables and exploring to do. I do wish they would have sped the movement up a little although you do have a fast travel option to teleport across map. The graphics are pretty at times and make for some great screenshots, I cant really complain about that department. The achievements are simple to aquire although the collectables can take some finding... a guide will help you alot with this. The multiplayer is ok, survival being one of my favorite game modes although as far as I could tell theres no ingame voice or chat whatsoever making gaming with randoms very hard to enjoy. If youre looking to 100% itll take you 25-30 hrs for the sp and 15-17 for mp. Lots of boosting-grinding needed in mp for the 100% sphere achievement. With all said and done the game was pretty enjoyable.......... buy in a sale and youre onto a winner  7/10","April 18, 2015","true","47.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

It has an amazing story that is unfolded with great care.  To anyone expecting a good multiplayer game like Lost Planet 2 was, this is not it. Games rarely excel in both single and multiplayer campaigns. This one is a perfect single player. It's like watching a movie in which we can play.\n\n2) For all those who left negative feedback with less than 5 hours on the game, I am saying: you missed out on the best. The game has a relatively slow story development during the first four hours, after which a trigger event occurs unfolding a really, really interesting plot that only gets better and better and better until the epic end. The intrigue slowly builds up as we realize something is wrong with the colony/planet and that's when I really got hooked to the game. After the first four hours, the game also unlocks many perks that makes everything more enjoyable. For example, there's a fast travel feature that unlocks at that point.\n\nIt's really fun­. I recommend it.\n","January 2","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And this game did not disappoint.\n\nLet's go over the game.\n\nStory\nThe story was not bad. You're a engineer/technician of sorts that harvests Thermal Energy and fix up the base. After getting accustomed to the job, you start discovering the planet's secrets. The story goes through many phases from the pseudo-horror abandoned base, to the survival element of the various frozen settings, to a thriller cat and mouse between the various factions. The story is very coherent, and although somehwat predictable, it is definitely not bad.\n\nThe characters? I loved them all. They all had life to them, even the minor ones you meet throughout various parts of the base(s) that you explore. Lost planet 1 had characters that I actually cared about and in my opinion, lost planet 3 was a vast improvement.\n\nGame mechanics? The foot combat is the typical run and gun type. Nothing fancy and complicated, but satisfying enough. I loved the battles using your utility rig though. Like dead space, your rig is an engineering tool and not a weapon. So although it does not have cannons and missiles like in LP1+2, it does have a drill arm, and some very nifty and freaking cool pseudo-weapons that you will unlock in various parts of the game.\n\nGraphics. Apparently I've heard that the graphics are worse than Lost planet 2. But the weather effects I think were very well done. Being in the middle of an emperor class storm in your utility rig was an amazing experience. I actually felt the chill of the setting.\n\nNow, this isn't a masterpiece perfect game. There were parts of the story where I thought I was doing busywork, and your mech is a bit slow. Fast travel only works in sections of the map where you are leaving/entering it. I get it that it adds immersion but sometimes I don't want to walk for 10 minutes to get to the next objective.\n\nAnyways, this is a definite thumbs up.

Being in the middle of an emperor class storm in your utility rig was an amazing experience. I actually felt the chill of the setting.\n\nNow, this isn't a masterpiece perfect game. There were parts of the story where I thought I was doing busywork, and your mech is a bit slow. Fast travel only works in sections of the map where you are leaving/entering it. I get it that it adds immersion but sometimes I don't want to walk for 10 minutes to get to the next objective.\n\nAnyways, this is a definite thumbs up. Grab it during a sale!","December 22, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I did play it all the way through, so it has some enjoyment element to it. My favorite part about it was the well drawn characters that stick to their parts well and the interesting dialogues the main character has with them and with videos he sends back and forth between him and his wife back on Earth. Visually the game was engaging and every landscape interesting in its own way.\n\nMaybe Capcom should consider making movies instead of games because after the beauty of the maps and characters the "game" elements desentigrate from there. It attempts to be unique at times, but isn't. It attempts to be scary at times, but isn't. Basically, it achieves moreorless nothing new or very innovative, except for maybe the ice planet itself. Even the ice planet appears to be large, but is dissappointingly tiny (or rather the parts you get to explore). A confusing mapping system (or perhaps simply bugs in the game) gave me half a dozen side missions or so that I never did because I couldn't find them or the reward was just not really needed... if you just play through the game you'll unlock pretty much everything you need in the realm of upgrades.\n\nIn summary, I did enjoy it and you may too, but I can't recommend it because of how much the negatives outweighed the positives. I felt I had finished a game that had huge potential, but either due to budget or just exaustion on the project the thing was ended before it should have been.","January 11, 2014","false","21.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

When I heard news about Lost Planet 3, I was completely looking forward to it. Though when it came out, it got mixed reviews, so I decided to wait for the price to drop before actually playing it, due to skepticism.\n\nLost Planet 3, puts you in the shoes of Jim Peyton, as man who gets a job on EDN III to harvest T-Energy so he can support his family. Jim is a likable protagonist, and I actually really enjoyed the storyline of Lost Planet 3 a bit more than past entries in the game. They also did a pretty good job on the cutscenes and it is a step in the right direction for the series. While the acting wasn't perfect, it was still pretty good.\n\nThe graphics in Lost Planet 3 are great, and it is what a Lost Planet game should look like. While they aren't the best out there, they are an improvement over it's predicessors.\n\nNow the important part of this review, is the gameplay. It's good, but different. It definately does not feel like a Lost Planet game, for better and for worse. The gunplay felt a bit smoother than past entries, but the aiming isn't great as it could be, and overall it kind of loses that signature Lost Planet feel. Some of the animations like rolling and reloading also seem a bit clunky, and with a few minor tweaks they could have been far better than what they are. The mech combat is also somewhat shallow, but isn't bad. The enemies are very simmilar to past Lost Planet enemies, and if you enjoyed fighting them in past entries you'll find that these guys will be what you are expecting from a Lost Planet game.\n\nOverall, I would have to say this entry is one step forward and one step back for the series. While the cinematics and graphics are great, the combat could use some work, but yet it does add some things that improved it. It's fun, but you should wait for it to come on sale, as it's difficult to reccomend at full price. If you are looking for an experience simmilar to past entries in the series, you won't find it here. Instead you'll find a fun Third Person Action Shooter game set in the Lost Planet universe. Hopefully, they'll take what they learned from branching out too far and use it to help make Lost Planet 4 better, and hopefully, more like Lost Planet 1 and 2.","December 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The story seemed intresting after completing the whole campaign but the multiplayer wasn't fun at ALL. The fact that Spark Unlimited decided to not add any 4 Co-op Multiplayer on campaign seemed to sad to hear but that's not the thing that bothers me. Compared to LP2 and LP1 this is completely new, now I'm not going to say that LP3 has to be much more common like in LP2 and LP1 but this is a really new change. First of all, no VS...I mean yes, the RIG is pretty much VS but it's the ONLY ONE in Campaign, however there are some VS's in the Multiplayer game. The T-ENG (Thermal Energy) now in LP2 and LP1 you used T-eng to heal up, support people, use on VS and other stuff but in LP3 T-eng is pretty much the money on the game. Seriously, you buy weapons with T-eng...aren't you supposed to use it to survive the cold environment to survive against Akrids and other things? The Multiplayer, plain dull...when I was going to try it out it seemed very boring. There were lack of gamemods, the new gamemodes didn't seemed to be fun at all. One gamemod was when you're supposed to fight 3 waves of akrids until you start fighting players. Oh, and multiplayer uses Gamespy, now when I looked gamespy up the company have abandoned working on gamespy leaving it dead. However the community of Gamespy seemed to be alive. There are probably more things I need to mention about this game but i feel like I just wrote all down. So the result was: I did not enjoy LP3. I stopped playing the game after some weeks and i hope Capcom will still make updates and improve the game alot so I can maybe come back someday and give it a shot, but for now it looks plain boring. I'll go with LP2 for now...even though I don't play it much I'd say it's more fun that LP3. So to all you LP fans out there, don't buy this game...unless you want a complete new experience that isn't related to the other LP games much.","September 15, 2013","false","20.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In LP3, they've made it mostly a means to travel from point to point, with some melee fighting abilities.  Most the big battles you end up doing on foot, with your standard load out of guns.  That wouldn't be so bad, but its all done in the arena, bigger and bigger creatures, shoot the glowing orange spots while dodging and running around like a mad.  Sorry, but the whole 'boss' fight style in FPS games needs to die.\n\nThe music for the game is very well done, and a neat component with the rig blaring out the music from earth.  The graphics are very nice, and the vistas are sometimes breath taking.  The UI is well done, and the controls aren't too bad.  Some of their choices for what does what don't make alot of sense, since almost everything they could have tied to a simple 'use' key intead of making every different action type a different key.\n\nI won't be finishing the game.

To me, it's good, I dunno what it is to you. The combat as changed though from LP2 in some ways for exmaple, you can't shoot back when another player has made a sucessful hit on you and the only way to recover was to evade, but there are some elements that I do miss in LP3 is the co-operative campaign, which in my opinion was spectacular in LP2 and was a bit disappointed that it wouldn't return in LP3, so I've might have not been in too much detail about LP3 due to spoilers or that I haven't completed the game just yet and my conclusions are lacking analysis but I see this game as more of an "extended version of LP1" rather than anything else. Alas, this is probably a new turn that the developers took and try to be unpredictable yet brilliant, all I can say is commiserations but I'm convinced of playing LP2 more than LP3 probably because it wasn't what I expected. Just saying. But at the moment, this games great, I love it, just fix a couple of things and it would be a pretty decent game and . I gotta say that Capcom has never let me down in the games they publish like Monster Hunter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Dead Rising and I loved Capcom for these games but.....in my opinion for LP3, I'd give it a 7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/recommended/226720/","endchronicle","Rekyua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/","675 products in account","+Summary at End+\n\nThis game is great, I almost feel bad I didn't get into it at the tutorial and almost skipped it.\n\nLost Planet 3 is its own beast in the series and differs greatly from the others, its more character and story driven and got rid of the arcade style missions (no more end of level scoring) and adds sort of a hybrid open world as well.\n\nNote: No multiplayer review.\n\nThe audio and visuals are very slick and for being an ice planet they keep everything looking great considering the limited palette choice. You can even add your own radio station, so to say, while using your rig (mech) however the times you can use the radio are limited and you'll often find it disabled while doing missions. Nothing blends either so you won't really have any problem finding what you need and they've included a breadcrumb system you can bring up if you're unsure where to go (which you do tend to use often mainly when going to a mission location) which is always nice to have and its use is optional during most points of the game.\n\nGunplay is simple, turning is more fluid and it doesn't require buttons for moving 90 degrees at a time like its predecessors, but I do have one complaint, the default controller scene is terrible for keyboard and mouse. If I'm using the mouse to look and the AWDS keys to move WHY IS 'P' THE USE KEY! It doesn't make any sense, I just used a controller which made sense with its default scheme. They added cover to the game as well but on normal difficulty I only used it during the last stage so in most playthroughs its a forgettable mechanic. The AI isn't too compelling either but you can still die if you're careless.\n\nActually, there really isn't a threat during the game but it doesn't keep things from being tense.\n\nYou  don't have small mechs this time around, instead you have the first generation "rigs" which are big lumbering robots and for story reasons don't have weapons. So you'll be relying on melee combat while using your rig which is surprisingly satisfying. However, again you aren't really in danger most cases as even if your rig is... shut down? It will heal itself over time and you can usually be back in it at full health in little time.\n\nSo, it's fun but bear in mind that if isn't the most challenging game you'll find.\n\nWhich is fine, because the main event is the story, Jim Peyton is who you'll be playing and he's come to E.D.N. III as a freelance contractor, bringing his rig with him to replace a crew member they'd lost (also the only other rig member) and the game starts out with you doing routine work around the base before slowly finding that there's a larger picture to the expedition and secrets about its sponsor, NEVEC. I won't say much about it but I found the story enthralling and I had no regrets blowing through it during my weekend (doing side missions, but skipping some of the kill x amounts, clocked in at just over 17 hours total) was worth it and memorable. However, it isn't too long. I'd say without all the side missions I'd done it might take somewhere between 10-12 hours to finish but considering it's a third person shooter and not a RPG that's reasonably long for its genre.\n\nI do have some complaints though, about the story and game.\n\nI'll start with the game, as I said it's a hybrid open-world and this involves moving across the various areas in your rig. The problem with this is your rig is painfully slow. There is no running in the rig, walk is all you get. Eventually you do open up a fast travel but often they'll tell you to go to a place in an area that isn't marked on the ingame map, so unless you remember where something is fast travel won't help too often. There is also an issue with the weapon variety, theres a multitude of weapons to choose from but a majority of them fail to compare to weapons you can find hidden away in the game, even with the option to upgrade and purchase weapons they still don't hold a candle to what you can find. By the end of the game there were only two weapons I used primarily. You do have the option to not use them I suppose, but enemies are invulnerable unless you shoot their weakness, the other weapons are either slow to use, inaccurate, use too much ammo, and/or don't do enough damage. It's an illusion of choice I suppose.\n\nAs for the story? It doesn't go deep enough, there are a few details in the story that I would have loved to have seen spread out further but often you'll just get a cliffnotes detail about a character or event, and things you might be wondering are left unanswered... which is a pity because its not exactly a short game either. It doesn't really seem to keep in line with what it is either, being a prequel and all. But after actually playing through the first Lost Planet they really couldn't have done anything but do a sort of reboot to the series for the sake of the story.\n\nThe story issue of lack of depth in some cases applies to most of the game though, it does a lot but it doesn't do enough.\n\nNow the summary:\nGraphics - Great\nSound - Good\nGameplay - Average to Good, so Fun\nStory - Too good, I wanted more but didn't get it!\n\nI definitely recommend the game, not just to followers of the series but those new to it, you'll enjoy your time if you like story centric games.","January 9, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's an OK game, but it's a shootoff, not what one should consider an official installment.\n\nI can appreciate the work that the team put into developing it, and the boss-fights were at least well-thought-out. I had very low expectations going into it, but have since been pleasantly surprised.\n\nDo not go in expecting any similarities, other than superficial similarities to Lost Planet.\n\nThe gunplay is mostly decent, the enemy design is decent, but the weapons are somewhat bland, and it has lost any sense of outlandish caricatures of robotic weaponry that the previous games had. It is a cover shooter and a robot beat-em-up with some additional collection features.\n\nThe game does have its good points, though.\n-Attention to detail\n-Characters (other than the main character)\n-A sense of... coldness\n-Boss fights are engaging and well-designed for the team's level of development experience\n-Enemy design means you have to engage each one differently\n-RIG Combat is actually pretty fun (when you do fight against large Akrid)\n\nThe bad parts, however, plunge the game into mediocrity\n-Pacing in combat sections isn't very-well thought out for some instances\n-The game feels like a cover shooter that borrows many elements from other games without making them its own\n-The upgrade system for the weapons is shallow and wasn't explored deeply enough by the development team\n-It's not really Lost Planet other than names and lore\n-Some of the weapons (esp. the Pulse Rifle) feel clunky.\n-Some explorational/collection mechanics aren't explained very well\n\nI cannot recommend this game, however, due to how much of an offshoot it is from its predecessors, quirky and zany as they may have been.

Just look first at the way they are differently animated/captured.\nYougoslavian (Kovac) french and indian are just silly puppets without brain or balls, and the russian is just another insane/drunk weird thing. From asia? only (one) japanese of course. Who get killed first? : naturally the (only) black (women). The english ones? They are the real cool/serious guys.\n\nBUT it is not something rare or surprising, and so much other games made it worst. It is just the day to day reassuring hollywood-US point of view about our little world, like in Transformers or Armageddon movies. I feel in this game like in a US standard blockbuster. cool !\nSo, JFYI for the frenchman: someone who actually knows french language will have the impression that Laroche is not actually a frenchman but a stupid englishman with an inferiority complex who try to mimic a french. I actually met IRL some specimens from different english speaking -countries.. and it's quite realistic :-) Roumie is a good actor; my thanks to him for le accent de la france sur le café de paris mon ami! oui oui!\n\nApart from those bad news, the game is pretty cool and beautiful.

Completing missions often involves following guided points to a location, completing the objective, and then walking all the way back to base for the next mission. Returning back can take as much as 10-15 minutes sometimes. Getting fast travel at base helps this some, but does not completely deal with this problem. Combat is farily repetitive and enemies are rarely unique in form or attacks. Once a boss encounter occurs you often fight the same boss 2-4 times in a row to complete the objective. Rig battles consist of your character moving around in a mech without any guns. You claw, punch and drill enemies to kill them. The problem lies in the slowness of the mech unit with its attacks. Often times an enemy can get in 2 or 3 attacks before you can effectively get in a single blow. These battles often consist of QTE (quick time events) to beat the enemy which means you can't just pummel the enemy into submission despite having the tools to do so; it requires a certain repeatable pattern for each enemy type. I often found it easier to get out of the mech and fight on foot. I got this game for $0.25 as part of a bundle, but I wouldn't recommend it because it is too repetitive to get enjoyment out of.","May 26","false","16.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilbyAsh/recommended/226720/","TrilbyAsh","Ashguard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilbyAsh/","331 products in account","Just finished Lost Planet 3. Finally.\nI figure I ought to do a mini-review for this.\n\nGameplay: 3.5\nGraphics: 9.\nMusical Score: 6.\nAnimations: 4\nStoryline: 9.5\n\nThe game in itself is what you'd expect from the LP franchise. At least, it goes back to the foundations set down by LP 1, thankfully the whole affair didn't follow the lead of LP 2, and have the whole dang "Single Player" campaign be focused upon the Co-Op aspects, and "Objectives" for points. It's all focused on the story, not making your character look shiny, thankfully.\n\nThe first thing you'd notice about this is the graphics. Even on the lowest settings, the landscape is breathtaking, the cutscenes are incredibly lifelike, and the effects around you are very exceptional. The small downside that took the graphics down from a 10 to a 9, is that for the most part, the maps are nothing but snow snow snow, and looking at the inside of your Rig. Alright. Might not be a graphical qualm as such, but the impact of having flawless graphics like that, and then generally restricting you to looking at machinery and snow...Well. It's not the full potential, but it's still pretty damn fine.\n\nComing on from Graphics, Animations. I'm quite the mixed bag when it comes to these, to be fair. The animations from the actual gameplay side of this is fairly smooth. In the intense Rig-Combat parts, things get a little shaky. Animations will occasionally merge together, like you'll be swinging your arm at something, and it'll try and hit you back. It generates awkward situations where you hit them, they go backwards, and their arm'll go flying off backwards, but it'll then still hit you. There's times where the enemy will just lock up if certain animations try to occur at once, giving you a fairly simply time of firing them down. Had this on the last boss, and the animations bug there provided me with a fairly easy win, which was quite the let down.\nAlongside it, is the animations in the cutscenes. While some of the gestures the characters make in them seems perfectly fine and everything, there's quite a lot of gestures they do which seem to make no sense, and are incredibly robotic looking. They're nowhere near what I'd define as "Fluid", but more "Wooden". The Cinematics are a different story of course, but that's more in the region of CGI Graphics, than model animations.\n\nGameplay. Now...The gameplay has been rated so poorly, because 7/10ths of the game is tramping around the map, either in your rig or running around the "Hidden" offshoot areas of the maps. To begin with, this is perfectly fine. You're wandering around. You're stomping the indigenous wildlife (The Akrid). You're drilling down stalactites of ice to carry on your path. It's all good. But after a fair few hours of doing nothing but tramping from one place to the next, it gets incredibly tedious. There's points where you're told to go from your base, all the way to another area, only to have them send you tramping back the way you came, to go somewhere else. And as you dot his, you've gotta hop out your Rig, walk over to the place you're supposed to go, or the person you're meant to talk to, and then you've gotta turn around after a small cutscene and walk alllll the way back again. That gets old. Fast.\nThe on foot combat is the usual sort of thing you get from the LP series as well. Run about slowly, aim at the red "Weak" spots on the Akrid, rinse and repeat until all enemies are dead.\nFighting in your Rig is a different ballgame though. And not the good kind, really. To say you're in a giant robotic suit, kitted out with a crushing claw arm, and drill hand to start off with...You'd expect the combat to be good. Or at least the fast paced sort of thing you're used to in the LP series, with Vital Suits zipping about all over the place and whatnot. Nope. You tramp about, until some big Akrid shows up. Then it essentially comes down to a series of Quick Time Events (QTEs). Get close. Hit Q when prompted. Click your mouse to grab the Akrid. Click the right mouse button to drill away at it. Rinse and repeat until they're dead. It's as dull as it sounds.\nThe open world aspect of the game is a nice touch, when it comes to the diversity of the environments. But for the most part, the secondary objectives you receive feel utterly pointless, and really not worth their time suffering through the monotonous tramping, just for a few more points of T-Energy. This becomes quite excruciatingly clear towards the end of the game, where you get quite a large amount of side objectives to do...But all are completely unrewarding. They give you a few token things to do, like hunt rare albino akrid, to get "Buffs" to your character, like quicker reloading, HP regen, or an in-cover aiming reticule. But since you get them essentially two main storyline points before you get to the final stage, you're at that point where you just honestly can't be bothered spending an hour or even two, just tramping around to finish the objectives. Even the completionists out there might struggle to find the willpower to complete this to it's 100% state. What with the fast travelling system you get as well, you can just jump past those objectives without ever really feeling the pain of missing them.\n\nNow. Storyline in itself. Thankfully, this is where LP3 really shines. You can look past the extremely dull and monotonous gameplay. The wooden movements of the cutscenes. And the fact that despite it all, you essentially know how it turns out for Jim, the protagonist, right from the word go. What you don't know, is how he gets there.\nFor fans of the LP1 storyline, you'll love the storyline in LP3. It provides all the lore you'd ever need about the origins of the Snow Pirates, and what NEVEC are after. It gives you a deeper understanding of the planet as well. All in all, it fills in quite a lot of those questions you might have had after playing LP1. But that's not what the story focuses on. It focuses on Jim. A contractor from Earth, looking to make some cash to keep his family running back home on Earth. He's a family man, and that's brilliantly brought to life through the messages his wife sends him from time to time, and the messages he sends back. The little banter, the humour thrown into it all. It generates a very real and deep character from Jim. (And the messages certainly do help relieve the monotony of tramping around the wastes.) The messages are heartwarming, and full of the sort of things you'd expect a message to contain to someone working a long way from home.\nBut even the characters around you all have deep characteristics. They all seem quite real as well, rather than just broken archetypes thrown in for filler.\nAnd the story itself? There doesn't seem to be much of one when you begin the game. Heck, for the first half of the game, there's not a whole lot of "Story" going on. There's no goal. There's just Jim, working away to keep his wife and kid fed. The game does throw you a couple mysteries along the way, and it's evident there's something in the background. But everything still focuses on Jim carrying on with his life.\nBut then the story abruptly starts, and from there, it's got you hooked in. You want to push through the dull gameplay, just to find out what happens next. Again and again, it just keeps you going, like a book you daren't put down. "Just one more chapter. Just one more chapter." That's how it goes, more or less. All I can say about it is, if you loved the Storyline from LP1, then the Story from LP3 will make it worth the hefty price tag.\n\n\nOverall, the game in itself, isn't worth the price of it. You'd have to invest a lot of time and energy into going through with all the terrible gameplay, to draw out the rewards of the story. I would recommend it, but only for those that are aware that the gameplay in itself is tedium encarnate.\n\nOverall score: 4.5","April 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilbyAsh/recommended/226720/","TrilbyAsh","Ashguard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrilbyAsh/","331 products in account","Just finished Lost Planet 3. Finally.\nI figure I ought to do a mini-review for this.\n\nGameplay: 3.5\nGraphics: 9.\nMusical Score: 6.\nAnimations: 4\nStoryline: 9.5\n\nThe game in itself is what you'd expect from the LP franchise. At least, it goes back to the foundations set down by LP 1, thankfully the whole affair didn't follow the lead of LP 2, and have the whole dang "Single Player" campaign be focused upon the Co-Op aspects, and "Objectives" for points. It's all focused on the story, not making your character look shiny, thankfully.\n\nThe first thing you'd notice about this is the graphics. Even on the lowest settings, the landscape is breathtaking, the cutscenes are incredibly lifelike, and the effects around you are very exceptional. The small downside that took the graphics down from a 10 to a 9, is that for the most part, the maps are nothing but snow snow snow, and looking at the inside of your Rig. Alright. Might not be a graphical qualm as such, but the impact of having flawless graphics like that, and then generally restricting you to looking at machinery and snow...Well. It's not the full potential, but it's still pretty damn fine.\n\nComing on from Graphics, Animations. I'm quite the mixed bag when it comes to these, to be fair. The animations from the actual gameplay side of this is fairly smooth. In the intense Rig-Combat parts, things get a little shaky. Animations will occasionally merge together, like you'll be swinging your arm at something, and it'll try and hit you back. It generates awkward situations where you hit them, they go backwards, and their arm'll go flying off backwards, but it'll then still hit you. There's times where the enemy will just lock up if certain animations try to occur at once, giving you a fairly simply time of firing them down. Had this on the last boss, and the animations bug there provided me with a fairly easy win, which was quite the let down.\nAlongside it, is the animations in the cutscenes. While some of the gestures the characters make in them seems perfectly fine and everything, there's quite a lot of gestures they do which seem to make no sense, and are incredibly robotic looking. They're nowhere near what I'd define as "Fluid", but more "Wooden". The Cinematics are a different story of course, but that's more in the region of CGI Graphics, than model animations.\n\nGameplay. Now...The gameplay has been rated so poorly, because 7/10ths of the game is tramping around the map, either in your rig or running around the "Hidden" offshoot areas of the maps. To begin with, this is perfectly fine. You're wandering around. You're stomping the indigenous wildlife (The Akrid). You're drilling down stalactites of ice to carry on your path. It's all good. But after a fair few hours of doing nothing but tramping from one place to the next, it gets incredibly tedious. There's points where you're told to go from your base, all the way to another area, only to have them send you tramping back the way you came, to go somewhere else. And as you dot his, you've gotta hop out your Rig, walk over to the place you're supposed to go, or the person you're meant to talk to, and then you've gotta turn around after a small cutscene and walk alllll the way back again. That gets old. Fast.\nThe on foot combat is the usual sort of thing you get from the LP series as well. Run about slowly, aim at the red "Weak" spots on the Akrid, rinse and repeat until all enemies are dead.\nFighting in your Rig is a different ballgame though. And not the good kind, really. To say you're in a giant robotic suit, kitted out with a crushing claw arm, and drill hand to start off with...You'd expect the combat to be good. Or at least the fast paced sort of thing you're used to in the LP series, with Vital Suits zipping about all over the place and whatnot. Nope. You tramp about, until some big Akrid shows up. Then it essentially comes down to a series of Quick Time Events (QTEs). Get close. Hit Q when prompted. Click your mouse to grab the Akrid. Click the right mouse button to drill away at it. Rinse and repeat until they're dead. It's as dull as it sounds.\nThe open world aspect of the game is a nice touch, when it comes to the diversity of the environments. But for the most part, the secondary objectives you receive feel utterly pointless, and really not worth their time suffering through the monotonous tramping, just for a few more points of T-Energy. This becomes quite excruciatingly clear towards the end of the game, where you get quite a large amount of side objectives to do...But all are completely unrewarding. They give you a few token things to do, like hunt rare albino akrid, to get "Buffs" to your character, like quicker reloading, HP regen, or an in-cover aiming reticule. But since you get them essentially two main storyline points before you get to the final stage, you're at that point where you just honestly can't be bothered spending an hour or even two, just tramping around to finish the objectives. Even the completionists out there might struggle to find the willpower to complete this to it's 100% state. What with the fast travelling system you get as well, you can just jump past those objectives without ever really feeling the pain of missing them.\n\nNow. Storyline in itself. Thankfully, this is where LP3 really shines. You can look past the extremely dull and monotonous gameplay. The wooden movements of the cutscenes. And the fact that despite it all, you essentially know how it turns out for Jim, the protagonist, right from the word go. What you don't know, is how he gets there.\nFor fans of the LP1 storyline, you'll love the storyline in LP3. It provides all the lore you'd ever need about the origins of the Snow Pirates, and what NEVEC are after. It gives you a deeper understanding of the planet as well. All in all, it fills in quite a lot of those questions you might have had after playing LP1. But that's not what the story focuses on. It focuses on Jim. A contractor from Earth, looking to make some cash to keep his family running back home on Earth. He's a family man, and that's brilliantly brought to life through the messages his wife sends him from time to time, and the messages he sends back. The little banter, the humour thrown into it all. It generates a very real and deep character from Jim. (And the messages certainly do help relieve the monotony of tramping around the wastes.) The messages are heartwarming, and full of the sort of things you'd expect a message to contain to someone working a long way from home.\nBut even the characters around you all have deep characteristics. They all seem quite real as well, rather than just broken archetypes thrown in for filler.\nAnd the story itself? There doesn't seem to be much of one when you begin the game. Heck, for the first half of the game, there's not a whole lot of "Story" going on. There's no goal. There's just Jim, working away to keep his wife and kid fed. The game does throw you a couple mysteries along the way, and it's evident there's something in the background. But everything still focuses on Jim carrying on with his life.\nBut then the story abruptly starts, and from there, it's got you hooked in. You want to push through the dull gameplay, just to find out what happens next. Again and again, it just keeps you going, like a book you daren't put down. "Just one more chapter. Just one more chapter." That's how it goes, more or less. All I can say about it is, if you loved the Storyline from LP1, then the Story from LP3 will make it worth the hefty price tag.\n\n\nOverall, the game in itself, isn't worth the price of it. You'd have to invest a lot of time and energy into going through with all the terrible gameplay, to draw out the rewards of the story. I would recommend it, but only for those that are aware that the gameplay in itself is tedium encarnate.\n\nOverall score: 4.5","April 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played the first and the second Lost Planet games, and this one would have to take the cake as far as freedom to explore. Hopefully this isn't the end of the series, as there is still a lot the developers could do.

The graphics are stellar, the environment isn't very much like the other LPs but it is a welcome change for me. Mechs are fun, however I did enjoy the mech design from LP1 the most. Gunplay is easy to get used to, and much more makes this game a good buy! I've had my problems with this game to where I've spent a solid hour deleting, redownloading, verifying all the files that may or may not make it crash. I still have to play in windowed mode, which is not what I prefer but It's really not that big of a deal. I just started playing and I looked over at the clock and an hour and a half flew by in an instant. Personally, I think this game is worth the money. Get it on sale now though. Steam's Summer Sale has it at around 12 bucks so it's the best time right now! If you are reading this after, still spend the money on it! Fantastic game! PLEASE READ BELOW FOR CONS\n\n\n*NOTICE*:: In the beggining of my experience with this I had A LOT of problems with crashing. There were fixes online that helped and were detailed enough so someone that is not software gifted like myself could find it. I did run into crashing later in the game and there was no solution for it. It was on the first level but still. ALSO, my PC is not the best one ever. I have problems with it's stability. So, what I'm trying to say is that some problems may be on me. Research beyond Steam Reviews for the best opinion possible. REMEMBER!!! I have had problems with this port and still have problems! They are minor, like how I have to play in windowed mode, but otherwise, I see no reason not to buy this phenomenal game!","February 17, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Слишком мало разновидностей, а оригинальных для третьей части - хм, может 2-3.\nНекоторые акриды прячуться за ящиками.. герой прячется за ящиками... и начинается тир. ВЫ СЕРЬЕЗНО?\nВ первом Lost Planet были достаточно оригинальные боссы, здесь же - акрид-краб, акрид-скорпион, акрид-большой краб. Убьем краба еще с пяток раз. Брррр.\nСюжета в игре процентов 30, остальное - будни "шахтера" на ледяной планете. Пробури, установи, почини, забери...\nПопытка оживить персонажей с помощью диалогов и роликов на отвлеченные темы и личностные переживания... с таким уровнем анимации и монологами - ох.\nКонцовка шикарна, особенно, эпизод с женой г.г.\n\nРаботать, работать и работать, Spark.. Тройбан.","September 9, 2013","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a very story-oriented game, but the gameplay is solid. Piloting the RIG is a lot of fun and combat with the RIG is fun as well, but a learning experience. The game runs quite a bit differently than LP1 and LP2, but I don't mind-- didn't particularly like them.

The environment is great, the characters are believable, and there's plenty of action, especially if you're into button mashing.   The game play itself feels the weakest, as if they didn't do a particularly good job of making this game keyboard/mouse friendly.

Finally.\nI figure I ought to do a mini-review for this.\n\nGameplay: 3.5\nGraphics: 9.\nMusical Score: 6.\nAnimations: 4\nStoryline: 9.5\n\nThe game in itself is what you'd expect from the LP franchise. At least, it goes back to the foundations set down by LP 1, thankfully the whole affair didn't follow the lead of LP 2, and have the whole dang "Single Player" campaign be focused upon the Co-Op aspects, and "Objectives" for points. It's all focused on the story, not making your character look shiny, thankfully.\n\nThe first thing you'd notice about this is the graphics. Even on the lowest settings, the landscape is breathtaking, the cutscenes are incredibly lifelike, and the effects around you are very exceptional. The small downside that took the graphics down from a 10 to a 9, is that for the most part, the maps are nothing but snow snow snow, and looking at the inside of your Rig. Alright. Might not be a graphical qualm as such, but the impact of having flawless graphics like that, and then generally restricting you to looking at machinery and snow...Well. It's not the full potential, but it's still pretty damn fine.\n\nComing on from Graphics, Animations. I'm quite the mixed bag when it comes to these, to be fair. The animations from the actual gameplay side of this is fairly smooth. In the intense Rig-Combat parts, things get a little shaky. Animations will occasionally merge together, like you'll be swinging your arm at something, and it'll try and hit you back. It generates awkward situations where you hit them, they go backwards, and their arm'll go flying off backwards, but it'll then still hit you. There's times where the enemy will just lock up if certain animations try to occur at once, giving you a fairly simply time of firing them down. Had this on the last boss, and the animations bug there provided me with a fairly easy win, which was quite the let down.\nAlongside it, is the animations in the cutscenes. While some of the gestures the characters make in them seems perfectly fine and everything, there's quite a lot of gestures they do which seem to make no sense, and are incredibly robotic looking. They're nowhere near what I'd define as "Fluid", but more "Wooden". The Cinematics are a different story of course, but that's more in the region of CGI Graphics, than model animations.\n\nGameplay. Now...The gameplay has been rated so poorly, because 7/10ths of the game is tramping around the map, either in your rig or running around the "Hidden" offshoot areas of the maps. To begin with, this is perfectly fine. You're wandering around. You're stomping the indigenous wildlife (The Akrid). You're drilling down stalactites of ice to carry on your path. It's all good. But after a fair few hours of doing nothing but tramping from one place to the next, it gets incredibly tedious. There's points where you're told to go from your base, all the way to another area, only to have them send you tramping back the way you came, to go somewhere else. And as you dot his, you've gotta hop out your Rig, walk over to the place you're supposed to go, or the person you're meant to talk to, and then you've gotta turn around after a small cutscene and walk alllll the way back again. That gets old. Fast.\nThe on foot combat is the usual sort of thing you get from the LP series as well. Run about slowly, aim at the red "Weak" spots on the Akrid, rinse and repeat until all enemies are dead.\nFighting in your Rig is a different ballgame though. And not the good kind, really. To say you're in a giant robotic suit, kitted out with a crushing claw arm, and drill hand to start off with...You'd expect the combat to be good. Or at least the fast paced sort of thing you're used to in the LP series, with Vital Suits zipping about all over the place and whatnot. Nope. You tramp about, until some big Akrid shows up. Then it essentially comes down to a series of Quick Time Events (QTEs). Get close. Hit Q when prompted. Click your mouse to grab the Akrid. Click the right mouse button to drill away at it. Rinse and repeat until they're dead. It's as dull as it sounds.\nThe open world aspect of the game is a nice touch, when it comes to the diversity of the environments. But for the most part, the secondary objectives you receive feel utterly pointless, and really not worth their time suffering through the monotonous tramping, just for a few more points of T-Energy. This becomes quite excruciatingly clear towards the end of the game, where you get quite a large amount of side objectives to do...But all are completely unrewarding. They give you a few token things to do, like hunt rare albino akrid, to get "Buffs" to your character, like quicker reloading, HP regen, or an in-cover aiming reticule. But since you get them essentially two main storyline points before you get to the final stage, you're at that point where you just honestly can't be bothered spending an hour or even two, just tramping around to finish the objectives. Even the completionists out there might struggle to find the willpower to complete this to it's 100% state. What with the fast travelling system you get as well, you can just jump past those objectives without ever really feeling the pain of missing them.\n\nNow. Storyline in itself. Thankfully, this is where LP3 really shines. You can look past the extremely dull and monotonous gameplay. The wooden movements of the cutscenes. And the fact that despite it all, you essentially know how it turns out for Jim, the protagonist, right from the word go. What you don't know, is how he gets there.\nFor fans of the LP1 storyline, you'll love the storyline in LP3. It provides all the lore you'd ever need about the origins of the Snow Pirates, and what NEVEC are after. It gives you a deeper understanding of the planet as well. All in all, it fills in quite a lot of those questions you might have had after playing LP1. But that's not what the story focuses on. It focuses on Jim. A contractor from Earth, looking to make some cash to keep his family running back home on Earth. He's a family man, and that's brilliantly brought to life through the messages his wife sends him from time to time, and the messages he sends back. The little banter, the humour thrown into it all. It generates a very real and deep character from Jim. (And the messages certainly do help relieve the monotony of tramping around the wastes.) The messages are heartwarming, and full of the sort of things you'd expect a message to contain to someone working a long way from home.\nBut even the characters around you all have deep characteristics. They all seem quite real as well, rather than just broken archetypes thrown in for filler.\nAnd the story itself? There doesn't seem to be much of one when you begin the game. Heck, for the first half of the game, there's not a whole lot of "Story" going on. There's no goal. There's just Jim, working away to keep his wife and kid fed. The game does throw you a couple mysteries along the way, and it's evident there's something in the background. But everything still focuses on Jim carrying on with his life.\nBut then the story abruptly starts, and from there, it's got you hooked in. You want to push through the dull gameplay, just to find out what happens next. Again and again, it just keeps you going, like a book you daren't put down. "Just one more chapter. Just one more chapter." That's how it goes, more or less. All I can say about it is, if you loved the Storyline from LP1, then the Story from LP3 will make it worth the hefty price tag.\n\n\nOverall, the game in itself, isn't worth the price of it. You'd have to invest a lot of time and energy into going through with all the terrible gameplay, to draw out the rewards of the story. I would recommend it, but only for those that are aware that the gameplay in itself is tedium encarnate.\n\nOverall score: 4.5","April 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game starts with the main character being trapped under a tone with little time to escape, but then decides to tell a story that started 50 years ago. If he had enough time to tell such a story, he could have surely had enough time to save himself instead, but hey, this is just the first scene and it captures perfectly what's coming next: absurd situations, lots of cliche and gameplay flaws that makes you don't want to continue playing it. I'm not even considering the fact that the main character, gets just in time to replace someone who died on an accident (which is kinda odd, considering that the story is located on a planet very far away from earth, from where our hero travels from), because the game doesn't say anything about the mains of travel that he took, and that fact is so tiny compared to what's next, that I shouldn't even bothered in writing about it, but I only do it to set a point without spoiling much story ( all that I've said happens in the first minutes of gameplay). Maybe lines like "Have you been killed?", when a not so clear danger makes Jim Peyton, main character, make a seemingly overreacting escape jump to put himself in danger, and the whole character introductions, with those typical cliche characters, plus huge gameplay errors like, not telling you the controls when you need them, and not telling you when a mission needs to be completed in a certain period of time. Despite me playing only for an hour and a half, I felt I was overly merciful and tried not to focus in the game flaws to try to enjoy a gameplay that doesn't keep things exciting either.\nHaving infinite bullets, but taking so much to reload, is obnoxious.Hard sections doesn't feel challenging, but poorly designed. scary music sounds when you can't tell what the danger is. All of this, makes this game, that I had some hopes on, (maybe because of not having played the previous 2 releases) an entirely boring and disappointing game to play.

Everything very realistic and impressive BUT... the Akrids (the monsters) look like exactly the same as with LP1 and, that's awfull.\nThe introductory sequences are like to be watching a good sci-fi film and, it set your expectatives higher than the game delivers at the end.\nExcesive Keys, that could be resumed in way less keys (multi-functional, depending on context), make the actions more complex than needed.\nReaction time between you press a key and the character does the action is a tad high and, this delay is a mess when fighting against some of the Akrids and, very specially when you are surrounded of lots of them.\nI cannot understand why a game that has been HIGHLY enhanced respect of scenarios and detailed graphics, leaved the combat system and character's movements quite well the same as in LP1.\nI mean, why the character has no possibility to jump over obstactles, why cannot crouch, why cannot reach other high spots but only those that the engine highlights?.\nWhy the Akrids seem so out-of-dated compared with the rest of E.D.E.N. III world?.\nDON'T TAKE ME WRONG. IT'S A GREAT GAME BUT, IT COULD BE BETTER and, it's a pitty they didn't took this oportunity to do it.\nThis game, with the free-movement of the character that we can enjoy in games as Splinter Cell, Prince of Persia and alike would be the bomb.\nRespect of LP1,  you can evolve (a tad) your equipment and, for this, you need to do missions rewarded with some "credits" that you could use to improve your weapons and Mecha. This pinch of RPG is very well wellcome.\nYou are always accessing the "mission maps" with your Mecha, which is a very slow transporting way.\nEven that the unarmed Mecha is interesting during the few initial missions, I am really missing the fire power of those Mechas in LP1. Still playing so, I don't know by now if that will change.\nAnyway, difficulty is being increassed step by step and, new tasks to do are added in each mission and, new Akrids types are summing up after each one.\nNOT SO FRENETIC AS LP1, most of times but lot of fun, anyway.","September 27, 2013","true","27.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Somewhere along the way I downloaded a different version of bink32.dll (see the thread) but I'm not sure what version exactly because there are about 10 of them and I can't remember so you'll have to try all of them hahaha.   Which ultimately may not be necessary.\n\nSo where do you get the hd videos well I'll throw you a bone in the DLC section for this game.\n\nSo I played the intro about 20 times trying to figure out how to stop this crashing and annoyingly the autosave (only) saves at a point where you have to shoot a bunch of akrid before a cutscene.\n\nThe other annoying thing  is that it takes 1 minute 25 seconds to get through the splash screens alone and they can't be skipped.  You have to make a short cut with some parameter that I'm going to have to look up again.\n\nOnce you get through all that the game seems to be a relatively straightforward 'hold down your left mouse button and it will complete from start to finish' fps.

Great exploration and hidden caches of goodies for upgrading your weapons and rig. An overall excellent and enjoyable romp into a Dead Space/Red Faction Armageddon type ambiance world.

Sorry. Next time try to move closer to the microphone guys. Ten meters is probably not the right distance.\n\nGameplay? It's more like gaaaaameplaaaaaaay. Thiiiiiingsssss aaaaaaare slooooooow. Need to run? My great grand mother run quicker than Jim (and she died years ago).\n\nCover system? Cover system are nice during gunfights not when the ennemies are alien that rush into melee range. Nonetheless the cover system is, as most things in the game, badly designed. You'll be far more safe by "running" away and coming back slowly (quickly is not an option in that game).\n\nUI? Most of the time you don't have access to basic informations (ammos, grenades, cash, radar) because you're out of range of your rig. To open the menu you'll have to look at five seconds animations. Nice the first time. Then boring. Then you'll simply hate it.\n\nEven tutorials are screwed: "Use W/S/A/D to turn the valve". Know what? In fact you need to tap "F" (Oh yeah I love spamming a single key on my keyboard. It's sooooo fun).\n\nCheckpoints (no, no save for you)? Died fighting a boss? Where's the checkpoint? After that cinematic when the boss enter the arena? No sir! Before that cinematic? No sir! When Jim enter the arena? Please? No sir! The checkpoint is two minutes before that point. You'll be lucky enough to listen to the same monologue, see Jim crawls for more than one minute, then enter the arena, see the animation, be overjoyed when the camera will move by itself meaning you won't be able to evade the very first attack of the boss, followed by another and... yes back to the checkpoint!\n\nSeriously who would say anything bad about that game?","August 16, 2014","false","6.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","1"

The save points are automatic, and unfortunately that's the only way you can continue a game in the campaign, which brings me to the glitches. The game glitched at a point called "stay alive" where you fight these large preying mantis things, but the spawn endlessly populates them to a point where you cannot complete the mission, and because the save point dumps right where the mission starts. When I fought them, I counted 20 of them in the area. It became impossible to fight them in any conventional way. I did some searching online and apparently this is not supposed to happen. Every time I killed one 2 more spawned and eventually the map was flooded with them making it impossible to complete the game. I could go into further depth about the quality of the weapons (the only useful one is the shotgun, and the assault rifle is a bb gun and the pistol might as well be a water gun).","June 24, 2014","false","22.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You, a lone mercenary, are equipped with a basic weapon, survival suit, & bad controls. The opening to the game is extremely reminiscent of Dead Space 3, in fact, several parts of the game are pretty close. That said, there are some key differences between the two. In Dead Space, you get to make your own guns & upgrade them freely, in lost planet, theres a store where you buy weapons & a few upgrades for them such as scopes & extened magazines. In Dead Space, everything was compact, linear, & required little back tracking, in Lost world, you have a base of operation where you will return to after every sortie & which you can wander out of freely to do side mission. This gives it a sort of open world feel, but instead of it feeling like you can wander freely around, it feels like you have to go out for hours at a time since it takes so long to march back to base in either your boots or your giant mech that moves at about 3 mph. Combat is rigid at best, you are constantly swarmed by either waves upon waves of small weak enemies, or huge boss monsters that have very repettative patterns. Another huge difference between Dead space & this game is that Dead Space is a survival horror. You have a set health bar which you have to scavence to replenish, ammunition can be scarce depending what dificulty you play. In Lost Planet, you have regenerating health  & ammo is avaliable around every corner, or you can rely on your pistol which pulls infinite ammo from space & time. In other words, this game is extremley easy, even though I played through it on normal diffiulty. All in all, you have better uses for your money, but if you're just bored, this can be a c+ game","October 30, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm not going to write a story about that bug, i'm just gonna say that it makes further storyline impossible to go, you just stuck there. The game is not bad in general, it's catchy, it's dinamic, it's fun to play... sometimes. But the whole thing gets killed by 3 other things: environment, which is the same all the time, controls along with annoying saving system which are frustrating and bugs. Environment doesn't change. It's ice, pseudo-wide open spaces, some boring abandoned stations, always the same. Controls are just frustrating. There are many actions you can do but almost all of them can only be bound to different keys. It gets simply stupid. You can pick up stuff like videologs and ammo with "e" but you can't pick up other stuff with the same key. And this is pretty much for everything. Changing keybindings may cause (and caused in my case) some bad bugs and glitches. Playing on the hardest difficulty is quite ok when you're on feet, but it gets absolutely impossible, almost painfully unbearable to fight bosses when you are in rig, you get killed CONSTANTLY. And when you die, the game doesn't continue right before the boss fight starts, you gonna have to go for a long time just to come to a place where you will be forced to watch the cutscene again.

I would absolutely love to say that this is a great title, but I cannot even play it because I keep getting thrown back to the main menu when my internet decides to screw up (which is about 96% of the time), and it does not save in the right places, I'm only at the part where you set up your first T-Post, and the creature, I killed it, then BAM!, back to the main menu during the cutscene. Guess what I had to do again, from the beginning?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/damenblack/recommended/226720/","damenblack","Damen Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/damenblack/","214 products in account","I bought LP3 some time ago during a Steam sale, and I was excited to finally get a chance to play it having loved the original two games. I understood that this entry to the series was going for a new feel with a more Westernized "Dead Space" feel. This too sounded exciting.\n\nSo now you can understand my large dissapointment when I attempted to load the game several times only to experience crashing issues every single time. After a series of driver updates, forum checking, and etc. I couldn't find a working solution to fix the game. So I assumed that perhaps there would be a patch eventually, thus I left it sitting on the back burner for several months now.\n\nHere we are months later, and time to give this game another shot. It loads and runs! So I suppose that it was a problem on their end, but that all doesnt' matter now, its time to game! So apparently who ever was in charge of the keybinding section was a former ARMA developer, a keybinding for everything and each poorly placed. "Press P to pickup ammo". Seriously? I need to spam a key no the other side of the damn keyboard to get some ammo. Use the same damn key for my actions, E... like any other game with a competant keybinding. "But Damen, keybindings can be rebound! Stop complaining!" Sure they can, why should they need to be in the first place though? PC get the ♥♥♥♥ing 2nd hand treatment on this port too then? Didn't we learn from Borderlands?\n\nLets carry on. The sound in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing HORRIBLE. The voice acting is fine enough, but whoever did the levels really wanted you to know that the characters were talking. You can hear them over everything else in the world, disconecting you from it often. The monsters that you fight have roughly the same effect, almost making them annoyingly loud. Then there is the fact that you can still hear their shrill sounds and screaching while they are all dead and you're interacting with something.\n\nVisually the game is passable. The map layouts and the structures are impressive enough, but the textures are very telling of this ports true target market, the consoles. I'm damn upset that Capcom wouldn't have shelled out a few extra bucks to get some higher resolution textures and some decent controls for the PC. Their money comes from our investments, and they need to step up their game. No pun intended.\n\nBefore I leave off, I want to touch one more time on the controls. When interacting with certain objects like using the mechs "rigs" claw to turn a giant X item, it pops up with "rotate claw using [w][a][s][d]" which would make you assume that you need to use all the keys. This isn't the case, and in fact I ended up rapidly smashing the d key several times over to very very very slowly rotate the claw. Attempting any other combination or series of key presses awarded me with no rotation. Other times the game wouldn't pop up with the rotation hint and wouldn't accept the key input at all. Go go gadget programer.\n\nTL:DR ; ♥♥♥♥ this piece of poorly ported ♥♥♥♥. Do NOT buy this game, no matter the price. Watch a damn "lets play" on youtube to learn the story if it matters that much.","September 3, 2014","false","1.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

Yeah, I know, it's not like LP1 or 2. A sequel can take a series in new direction that's amazing like Max Payne 3. This is not the case with LP3. It's not the mundane, gritty, realistic story of Jim the offworld mecha heatminer that makes it boring. No, it's the on the rails "press E (and sometimes V,T,or P) to advance plot".\n\n"JIm, go here."\n"Jim, press mouse 1 here."\n"Jim, run back and forth to pad out game time."\n\nNothing in this game feels like a game. It feels like an interactive movie. Events don't have to necessarily advance the plot, but they should be engrossing. You should want to learn more about EDNIII, but picking up random audio logs and the already snails-pace at which the story goes along makes you want to just get it over with.\n\nThe on foot combat is boring and tedious compared with the earlier games. Roll, shoot, roll, shoot, roll shoot. It's Dark Souls in Akrid land. And what's with the vast number of game mechanics they keep trying to throw in? There is even cover based shooting, but you'll never use it because the Akrid are always up in your grill. There's a knife for melee, but it's useless so you end up just shooting everything while rolling and shooting. You get plenty of T-units from "quests" so why bother killing Akrid and collecting their blood? It's all busy work. Somehow giving the player grappling hook is also boring and rail-like. Everything feels like this. Too many different mechanics that don't fit well together.\n\nThe only redeeming factors for me so far is the "rig" segments and the hollywood level of voice acting and animation. You feel weighty, you feel powerful (sometimes), and it's just plain fun to navigate this world in it. But even then, no real weaponry early on makes it boring as ♥♥♥♥. The characters feel real and believable, although sometimes to a fault. We get it Jim, you miss your family. Please stop interrupting the main storyline with the constant ramblings of your wife. It's meant to connect the player with the protagonist, but they overdo it.\n\ntl;dr: You know what this feels like? Binary Domain, Dark Souls, and Dead Space mashed up in the Lost Planet universe, but without the gameplay that made those games fun and interesting.","June 23, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Or not being able to winch to a point unless you find some stupid, tiny little point to stand on.\n\nThe parts of the game that try to be horror are excessively unpleasant, rather then be scary, they provide nothing but frustration, as the enemies are simple, small things that die easily, but are always there and never startling, despite trying to be.\n\nOne particular moment that angered me was in a horror segment, I repaired a small turret, which was placed to help me defend whilst a door opens. The turret proceeded to shoot and kill ONE enemy, before spending the rest of the attack looking at different enemies, but not actually firing at them.\n\nIt also has a stupid amount of walking from place to place, and heaps of back tracking.\n\nAll in all, the game is a travesty, if you were after a Lost Planet game, you came to the wrong place.\n\n","January 4, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascilon/recommended/226720/","rascilon","Rascilon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascilon/","2159 products in account","Lost Planet 3 tells the story of Jim Peyton, a blue collar family man from Earth, sent to a remote colony on planet E.D.N. III, 50 years after the events of the first game.  As the story unfolds, Jim learns that mega-corp NEVEC has been up to no good, and that he is embroiled in a conspiracy a generation in the making.  The art, sound and voice direction in this game are truly top notch not only making the story line unfold like a feature length film, but giving nuance and style to the gameplay itself.  In addition to a third person shooter, Jim can take control a utility mech, giving the player some compelling puzzle solving and innovative combat along the way.  The game supports Steam Trading Cards, Widescreen modes as well as the Xbox controller, but unfortunately is lacking any Steam Achievements.  Barring that one minor flaw however, Lost Planet 3 is truly a game not to be missed by even casual fans of the sci-fi genre.  I highly recommend this game to almost anyone.","October 19, 2013","true","16.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Just no... This game is truly horrible compared to the previous titles.\nCombat is boring and the traveling is boring.\nThe mech is there only to give you means of travel, you get a minimap and proper hud when you are near it, but every mission takes you into such locations that you have to leave it behind striping you out of these advantages.\nThe grappling hook is suddenly something you can only use in certain places when in previous titles it was one of the funniest things to use.\n\nThe guns feel horribly underpowered atleast the guns I have found so far and that's most of them. There is a crossbow that fires exploding arrows and you would obviously expect it to be powerful weapon to use considering that it has a 1 shot clip, but no. It's horribly underpowered and thus useless.\nI found 3 different machineguns with one having a burst firemode, yet they all felt excatly the same and didn't seem to have any difference between damage either.\nAdd the underpowered guns with though, fast melee enemies that quickly swarm you and your ridiculously slow walking/sprinting speed the combat overall is quite horrible that only makes you want to quit playing games completely.\n\nIf someone came to me and told that this game is the first in the trilogy I would believe them considering how much they have removed and reduced compared to the previous games.\n\nOverall if you want to play Lost Planet game you're better off buying the first or the second game depending on if you like Single- or Multiplayer more.\nAll this game makes me do is thinking that I really should dig out my Lost Planet 2 and play something that I can actually enjoy.\nAlso one small thing that REALLY bothers me to ridiculous degrees is the main character not having anykind of headgear to protect him from the cold that can freeze a human in seconds.\nIt's explained in the story, but it's still complete bulls**t. It's because he has technology installed into the collar of his suit.\nExplanation that is on the same level as Magic, Nanomachines or Magical Nanomachines.\n","January 1, 2014","false","17.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Lost Planet 3 takes us trough a journey of Peyton, a mechanic hired by NEVEC (the company that wants to save the world...for profit) that hires Peyton for a remarkable contract to work on E.D.N. III, there's a energy crisis on earth and the criatures on E.D.N. III (The Akrid) can generate it's on energy called T-Energy, NEVEC sees this as an opportunity and establish a base in the planet to extract T-Energy. The game starts in the final moments of Peyton when "he confess his sins" to his grand daugther, actually he just tells her the story that you got to play. Game's pretty interesting, before i've started the game i've read some pretty negative reviews of it while the game in it's own way it's pretty fun actually, ambient it's set for a linear gameplay but you get to see the marvelous world of E.D.N. III, electric storms, gigant glaciers and a share of the main story that's pretty decent tho it's not really graping, the fact that it's not a bad game dosn't turn it into a good game either, but it's worth the try for a low price, i suggest to give it a chance if you DON'T had played the first 2 Lost Planet.\n\nMetascore: 68/100 "I hope this is the last time i have to visit that damn cold planet"","July 31, 2014","false","6.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This game is only enjoyable if you like country music, if you do not like country music you can disable the music, but then the world is so empty its like why bother playing at all.

The game has a good enough plot and a fantastic setting. The game has a few very stand out moments too. In particular the section on the abandoned ship which felt very 'alien' and had a slight horror vibe to it. The games mechanics were solid imo. Everything functioned well and I had no issue in the gameplay department. I guess I can understand the complaints about how the enemies were pretty much look for the orange weak points and shoot. Though, isn't this basically what Dead Space was? But no one complained about that. I also thought it was funny that in many revives the game was slated for just being a game about running around and fixing things...again that’s what all Dead Space seemed to be and funnily this game has much less of that.  If you generally like the sound of this game I’d definitely recommend you taking the plunge and just trying it. Heck get it in a sale?!

I didn't buy it day one though since I'm the type of person who waits for the price to drop. Needless to say I didn't read any reviews before picking this one up when it went on sale, and I'm glad I didn't because the game is nothing like many of the review say. It's an amazing experience and I loved it.\n\nIf I had known how much I would enjoy this I would've paid full price for it on release.\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to finish on medium difficulty, and I plan on going through it again on hard soon.\n\nIn this Lost Planet game you play as a man working for NEVEC away from his family on earth to support them. This game is before the events of Lost Planet 1 & 2 so it was before they started weaponizing their vehicles. This limitation didn't bother me since it fit the narrative, and I feel as though it was well executed. In any case I really enjoyed the story, and I hope they do a sequel to this game, but I can't count on it seeing how this one was received.\n\nAnyway I hope this review can help convince someone whos on the edge about picking them one up. It's well worth your time. :)","August 10, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is engaging, the characters are real, and the acting is largely superb, but the gameply doesn't really live up to it. The shooting is solid, and the Akrid provide an intense challege on Hard difficultly, but it's fairly mundane, particularly when the game pits you against human opponents. Likewise the RIG segments can be fun and unique, but traveling from one area to the next can be a bit of bore. But as a diehard fan of the Lost Planet 1 and 2, the story, setting, explanations, and throwbacks were more than enough to keep me hooked!\n\nFor fans of the Lost Planet series who want a deeper look into the mysteries E.D.N III, Lost Planet 3 WILL NOT DISSAPOINT.

You spend most of your time crawling through Alien infested areas listening to the sound of scratching violins and getting the same jump scares that are easily answered to with a shotgun. Heck one of the larger bosses even looks like it was taken directly from the final boss of dead space.\n\nThe story is similar to Aliens in that there is a coperation that hides information, and acts extremely corrupt.\n\nCombat is rather easy, with a "Press not to die" Dodge roll command that will side step any boss attack without much skill required, but despite the dodge roll being a universally useful means of defense, they still felt the need to have a chest high cover system that is bound to the same function. So there will be occasions where the player attempts to roll away from enemies, but instead finds themselves stuck to a wall.\n\nThe PC controls are uncomfortable, with some of the more Dire keys like Melee and right arm mech swings are set to keys that need to be reached for away from WASD. While these can be rebound the game is sensitive about keys being set to the same command, despite already having some commands listed to the same key.\n\nUltimately I stopped playing around about the time a game breaking glitch occured for me where a door would not open after only being partially repaired during an ambush. The repair option never became available again and both auto-saves were unusable. For something like that to of occured it was clear the game was not properly tested before release.\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 14, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get about 2-3 secs of targeting time, the mouse does not respond in the usual way, so trying to figure out which way is up or down is frustrating. I don't class this kind of keyboard tapping and mouse play as fun at all, because more often than not you end up dead and repeating in a time loop until you 'get it', I don't get it, don't like it and probably will have to program a macro to handle it.

The game has a good enough plot and a fantastic setting. The game has a few very stand out moments too. In particular the section on the abandoned ship which felt very 'alien' and had a slight horror vibe to it. The games mechanics were solid imo. Everything functioned well and I had no issue in the gameplay department. I guess I can understand the complaints about how the enemies were pretty much look for the orange weak points and shoot. Though, isn't this basically what Dead Space was? But no one complained about that. I also thought it was funny that in many revives the game was slated for just being a game about running around and fixing things...again that’s what all Dead Space seemed to be and funnily this game has much less of that.  If you generally like the sound of this game I’d definitely recommend you taking the plunge and just trying it. Heck get it in a sale?!

You die a lot learning the fights, but there are ample save points, so good so far.  And big boss like encounters happen after some scripted sequences, a usual staple of the genre.  The issue is this, for some unfathomable reason the boss save points are <before> the scripted parts, not after so to replay a boss fight takes quite a bit of time to get going as you go through the scripted sequence again and again and again..  perhaps if you like your games on easy this won't matter to you at all, but if you want a challenge then sitting and waiting around to fight is as much a a challenge to sit through as the fights themselves.

The controlls are an absolute mess!\nBe warned: the game cannot be played without a controller!!!\nYou can redefine your keys... or can you really? I mean I play with keyboard and the game lists R as the reload but the button does not work! Instead I had to press Shift-R to reload. I tried redefining reload to another key and then specifically back to R and now I was not able to reload the weapon at all. The defined R key would not work and neither would Shift-R. So I had to go back to the default configuration and after this I was afraid of changing anything else.\nThe game breaking bug however is very close to the start of the game. I was in the robo suit and had to close a valve. The game wrote on the screen that I had to rotate with WASD but nothing worked. Thankfully I have an XBox controller and tried using that. The game was saying that I just had to press the A button on the controller to rotate. Surprise! That did not work either... I finally managed to do it by rotating the left stick. This game port was clearly not tested with keyboard and mouse because the valve closing is a required checkpoint in the story line.\nThere are other control scheme oddities: you move with WASD and pick up items with P. Yep! you read it right P as in the complete opposite side of the keyboard from WASD.\nI bought this game for 1 dollar together with 3 more games on Humble Bundle and I am not surprised that it got to such a price.\nIt is a shame because the game looks decent, cutscenes are nice and the characters are very well acted. Too bad they did not have a competent team working on the interface. I mean this is like having a Porche... that can only be driven using your teeth.\nI only recommend this game at the price I bought it... maybe up to 3 EUR at most.","October 25, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/recommended/226720/","Freeze_25","Ice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freeze_25/","427 products in account","I have never played a Lost Planet® game before this one other than maybe a demo level for the first game on someone else's PC so I’m pretty new to the franchise.\n\nTL:DR - If you have never played a Lost Planet® you should get / try this one, it will make you want to play the other ones.\n\nIntro:\n\nKeeping that in mind this is the perfect game to start out on. Supposedly this one has worse game play than the other two (probably because the game is more focused on telling its beautiful story) but it’s not terrible or unplayable or anything. This game is a prequel to Lost Planet 1 and sets up the game. It really gave me a feeling of wanting more when I finished the game.\n\nStory:\n\nThe game's story is really polished. It does feel a bit rushed at the finale as everything gets really crazy and I do question the motives of characters. I think if the game had been longer and had more time it wouldn’t have been as harsh a transition but then a longer game would have made the story seem too drawn out. It’s a compromise and sadly it makes the ending feel rushed and not nearly as polished as the rest of the game.\n\nCharacters are good though sometimes they come off being a little robotic with animations and such. The game has a lot of colorful NPCs you can wander around and talk to or overhear throughout the game. Cut scenes are well done except for the moments where you have difficulty and die repeatedly having to watch one over and over again.\n\nGame play:\n\nThe guns all feel same-y. The only real different one is the grenade launcher and that’s just because it shoots grenades. There are like 3 rifle / SMG weapons, 2 sniper rifles and a shotgun. The pistol is like a mix between the rifle and the sniper as it has slower fire but more accuracy. The game will recommend you use a certain type of weapon to beat certain types of enemies but it really doesn’t matter. Each gun roughly operates the same so its just a matter of finding which ones you like.\n\nEach enemy is different but there are only like 12 types and that’s including bosses. You got swarmers, flyers, rollers, cat-like panthers, face-huggers and grenade like lobbing ones. They all kind of just swarm you. The game is like "why make harder enemies when we can just make more?" and I get it, it’s supposed to be an alien swarm attacking you but basically you just mow em all down. The panthers are the most strategy oriented.\n\nThe only enemy I didn’t list is these centipede crawlers that shoot bolts at you while others flank you. So you are forced to take cover but you can't because if you do another one comes and wrecks you.\n\nBosses are mostly lame. It’s basically a game of find out how to hit the glow-y spot enough. Most the time a new boss is fun but it’s when you fight it the 2nd or 3rd time that it gets old. Bosses are usually based on crabs and so it’s usually, dodge the pincer and shoot the arms and then the underbelly / back area.\n\nThe construction rig you get in the game is fun but it’s too slow. I’m pretty sure you can get out of it and run just as fast. It feels really tedious to walk from area to area in the game in this slow giant mech. The cool thing though is fighting bosses in the rig / giant construction mech. It makes a boss you have fought previously on the ground a whole lot more fun because you now get to fight a fair game size wise. Those pincers you had to shoot off before, now you can grab and just rip off like it was a real crab. It’s awesome.\n\nFinally, the entire game you fight Akrid (the lost planet alien bug/plant life things) but in the endgame of Lost Planet 3 you finally get to shoot other humans. Sadly they often times do not shoot back. I found most weapons take them down in 1-3 hits which for machine guns is really easy. The snipers in the game make even faster work of human enemies as 90% of the time a sniper rifle can kill them before they even notice you. Often time’s enemies would spawn and I'd wipe them out before the elevator / drop ship even left.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is good, I enjoyed it. It has some game play issues and some pacing issues with its tedious intro and the slow giant mech you have to pilot for the majority of the game. The combat is good, but way too easy and not varied enough sadly. The environments in the game are amazing and the story is fantastic. I would recommend getting it on those two points alone. If you have never played a Lost Planet® you should get / try this one, it will make you want to play the other ones.","October 26, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have around 300 hours on lost planet 2 just from its campaign because it was so fun and the other 200 were from its co-op battles that I would do with friends on xbox live.  Now onto lost planet 3, I started out thinking that this was going to be a mecha vs alien creature like game, because mechas were what made lost planet.  Well thats entirely false in this game because 80 percent of the gameplay was on foot miles away from your mech even though it is ESSENTIAL for most of your hud features.  Campaign in lost planet 2 was thrilling and made had so much fun in it, while in lost planet 3, it was a bore most of the time because you got boring weapons that are just average, no mech weapons or OP weapons.  Well the reason for the boring weapons is because mainly 80 percent of the enemies were 2 shootable with the pistol.  Remember collecting T-energy for some awesome stuff ingame?  Well now they are using for upgrades and thats it.  The only thing that I liked from this game was the backstory of Nevac and the story of Jim who was very likable.","June 18, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Roller akrids will stop aiming at you if you side dodge no matter how far away.\n-No jump button so you often have to take the long away around knee high rubble.\n-No crouch button, it happens automatically and takes away your ability to shoot to be "cinematic"\n-Can't use grapple hook whenever you want, only when prompted by QTE.\n-Can't fall off ledges or fall to your death, invisible walls everywhere.\n-Stupid random QTE sequences with generic enemies and environment that aren't fun.\n-Spaghetti space western atmosphere in how people talk and in the music. I hate that crap personally.\n-No "VS" to pilot, only the "rig" which is for QTE boss fights, environmental QTE and slooooow mandatory transportation.\n-Unnecessary hub at base and "open world" that's really not very open but just waste your time.\n-Screen jelly HP regen, T-Eng no longer keeps you alive, it's just a form of currency to buy stuff.\n-Characters are generic and unattractive. Lack of Japanese design philosophy shows and no one is iconic looking.\n-Akrids all look worse than previous games, once again, lack of Japanese design philosophy.\n-Story was giving off some Dead Space vibe but not sure if it elaborates on it or not since I quit playing.\n-No cool boss fights. I left the best for last because Lost Planet has always been known for awesome bosses.\n\nIn conclusion, I much prefer the Japanese developed LP1/LP2 which are quirky, imperfect but FUN and replayable. If you like Japanese game design more then you'll probably despise Lost Planet 3 with every fibre of your being. It abandons the arcade shooter roots, the cool boss fights, the over the top action and the cool mechs. This game is definitely aimed more toward the crowd who loves "narrative driven cinematic experiences" and doesn't mind having their hand held with mediocre gameplay. If you come into this game only caring about the story you'll probably have a good time judging by some of the positive reviews.","November 21, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take my words with this in mind and you'll probably see an at least decent and truthful review.\nATTENTION: FOR A TL;DR, SCROLL DOWN TO THE PROS AND CONS.\n\nSo, thanks to a friend of mine and Humble Bundle, I got my first game in this series that I had always thought of playing but never had the monies to buy this, as this wasn't really something I had a really big interest in to put it in top priority in my low amount of purchases.\n\nSo I decided to install it and give it a try. Here's what I got:\n\nSimple menu, few options, few graphical options (I have a really low-end gaming machine. How low is that? A first-gen i5 and a GeForce 9500GT, so the first thing I do when I start up a new game is set everything to low), and could even rebind every single control in the game.\n\nTime to dive in.\n\nGame starts, some interest sparks in me and I decide to even let the cinematics kick in and introduce me into the game. Not anything big happens, some strange stuff, old guy telling a story. Yeah, that sounds okay. Cinematics end, first mission. Run around the icy field, through aliens called "Akrid", to try to find a piece to repair the vehicle I'm in. Clichéd enough, a guy with a terrible french accent saves me in his giant mech. Woo. I do some more stuff and go to the base where the expedition is located.\n\nFirst thing I decide to do is wonder around the base. I find it to be quite big, but unnecessary to have three floors and to access each of them I had to take an elevator ride that puts me in a loading screen. And yeah, I saw an unnecessary amount of those during my 25 hours of gameplay. I do my stuff and get my first real mission, to get my "rig", which is basically a giant mech without any real weapons, and go outside the base to find out where the heck the guy that saved me in the start was, since he wasn't answering his radio. Of course he was having troubles. Of course I was going to be the hero since the first mission in the game, but actually, who cares? It's an AAA game anyways, so I was expecting that. That's how I get introduced in the gameplay. Walking around the snowy world in my rig (in first person!) felt really good for the couple of hours. I felt protected, I felt like nothing could stop me. Then I help the guy and shoot some aliens around. This leads to my first encounter with real animations, models and textures.\n\nEverything looks really great. Animations aren't all f*cked up or just plain bad, they're acceptable and I have nothing to complain about it. The models are quite detailed, each enemy type is quite well-detailed and has a unique feel to them, not like they were copy-pasted from eachother and just a few things added/removed. Textures? They look quite good too.\n\nSome hours in and I could already talk about the gameplay itself. I was thrown in an open-world, quite big levels with transitions from one to the other. Everything looks majestic and you feel like you're but an ant in there. What do I see? A lot of snow. It got me tired at some point but I couldn't complain about it because it really adds something to the atmosphere. And of course not everything was cold. But the landscapes... Wow. I was truly amazed by some of the stuff I saw and it really kept me going, so a point to level design.\n\nWhat about quests? Yeah, there are some. Just A VERY few to be honest. And they most of the time require traveling around (thank god they put some half-♥♥♥♥♥ quick travel) and seeing loads of loading screens. Yes, I will ♥♥♥♥♥ about loading screens throughout the review because really, there are just so many of them. From my total time, I bet you that AT VERY LEAST 2-3 hours were wasted summing up the loading screens. But some of them add up to the atmosphere and to the story. And they encourage two different things, exploration and hunting an specific type of enemy. At least a way of farming some money fast.\n\nAbout the action... Well, there are two types of action in this game: The third person one, which is always with your main character; and the First Person one, which is with your rig. Yeah, your rig doesn't have weapons but it has it's tools which you'll use to crush some aliens. The third person fights are quite okay. Not much different from other third person shooters, so there is cover-based shooting, enemies have armor and weakspots (most of them need to be hit in the weakspot to take damage), you feel progression and new ways of fighting with new weapons that are gradually introduced to the game, and the AI is quite good, REALLY good. The first person fights are... bad. They could have been MUCH better. You're in a friggin' mech and the only way of doing harm to most enemies you'll face in it is through quicktime events that are triggered by countering their attacks (basically press a key when the enemy is about to hit you to trigger it) and then doing something that you are supposed to find out by yourself. It took me more than 20 minutes of trying to kill one kind of enemy before figuring out I was supposed to press forward after grabbing him. How the heck was I supposed to know that? I needed to seriously button-mash to find out what I was supposed to do after countering him, which was a really big let down.\n\nThe story itself goes uphill as the game goes on. It starts off really slow, and then with every main quest it starts going up and then something kinda predictable happens in a very unpredictable moment, so yeah, the story starts taking off from there and it starts to get interesting. Then, later into the game there's another moment kinda like this that I really enjoyed. I was actually really surprised, but nothing much happens after that. If you want to know if I liked it, well, actually I did. It was fun(ny), just don't expect anything out of it and you might actually enjoy as much as I did.\n\nWhat did I not like about the game? I'm a b*tch for sounds. The Akrid have a lot of similar sounds to eachother, so you will not get that interested about them. The music is okay, there's even a small playlist for you to listen inside the rig, but I turned the music volume off after the first hours of gameplay and just put in some post-rock and shoegaze to feel better. Then we have the voice acting. The protagonist's voice is quite good, but the rest is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Basically all of the other guys have really stupid accents thrown in their voices, like that french accent I said earlier, a mix of "COD-like" russian and "generic german" in quite a few characters, some "asian" guy with bad lines. Most of the lines were quite bad and the game itself made fun of them in quite a few ways.\n\n\nSo, summing it all up:\nPROS:\nWalking around in a mech in first-person is really cool for some time.\nModels, textures and animations look really good.\nThe world itself, even if repetitive at times, shows some really beautiful landscapes and the level design is quite good.\nNo grinding.\nAI.\nDecent story.\nStupid yet funny lines.\nThe action is fun for most of the time.\nCONS\nLoading screens. LOTS of them.\nTravelling gets tiring after a while.\nFirst-person action is ridiculous.\nVoice acting is REALLY bad.\nTL;DR: I can surely recommend this game if you like normal games and if you feel that you won't be getting an amazing experience. Just think of this game as it had another name, like "Cold Space World" and you can even forget it's not a Lost Planet game and have some fun if you're a fanboy.","November 21, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mean the game give controller prompts when you're using a keyboard and mouse. I mean that the on screen prompt actually tells you to press they completely wrong key.\n\n--I have never seen such a bad autosave system in my life. Several times I loded my last save, only to discover four powerful enemies within five feet of me. Loading the save before, I was in the same situation. Luckily, you can load one of your manual saves. Just kidding! There are no manual saves, because this is an incredibly lazy console port.\n\n--The lighting is all over the place. Buildings and caves are so dark that I frequently had to adjust my gamma up to see. Upon leaving the area, I had to adjust the gamma back down because the world was blindingly bright.\n\n--Enemies are either so weak that using the handgun on them feels like overkill, or fast moving bullet sponges with powerful melee attacks. There is no middle ground.\n\n--The game has a completely useless cover system. There is only one enemy I encountered that taking cover would have helped against. That enemy can just race around your cover and slash you, or simply lean over it and strangle you.\n\n--Actually, I take it back. The cover is worse than useless. Half the time you just jump over it instead of sticking to it, leaving you out in the open in middle of a bunch of Akrid. If you do manage to stick to cover, rolling away from it to avoid melee attacks doesn't work half the time.\n\n--The Utility Rig, which should be one of the highlights of the game, is a joke. Most of the time you only use it to slowly trudge from one place to the next. Sometimes it functions as a glorified fetch quest, demanding that you run around pushing buttons to open the path for it.\n\n--When you finally do get to fight a giant monster with your rig, don't expect much. Giant Akrid fights are simply disguised QTEs. Tap a button to block, then tap another button to grab with your claw arm, then hold a third button to attack with your drill. Wait until the enemy attacks, then repeat. Giant robot combat has never been so boring.\n\n--You do a lot of pointless running around. Run to the TEng post to harvest it. Run to the lab to turn in a quest. Run up a mountain hitting buttons for your rig. Seriously, if you were looking for a winter hike simulator, you found it.\n\n--The characters. Oh, god, the characters. You play as "Mr. Gruff Space Enginner Who Left His Wife And Child Behind So He Could Go Into Space To Support Them". Because, you know, that's original. Along the way you meet several interesting and unique characters. There's "Base Commander Who Totally Isn't Hiding Anything", "Young, Socially Inept Genius Technician", "Arrogant But Brilliant Science Man" and "Frenchman". I'd love to tell you more about Frenchman, but his entire character seems to be that he's French. Oh, and there's also a few extras that seem like they got lost on their way to shooting a mildly racist Pocahontas film.\n\n--I won't "spoil" the "story" for you, but suffice to say that it is an incredibly generic, cliche riddled lump of turd. It's like someone had a copy of the scifi cliche handbook. And they didn't even paraphrase. They just tore pages out of the book, stapled them to a blank sheet of paper and called it a day. Phoning it in doesn't even cover it. The writers left a sticky note on the door that said, "Just watch SyFy for a couple hours and figure it out yourself." and never bothered to show up for work again. They probably didn't even spring for the name brand Post-Its. If you've seen more than two science fiction films, there are absolutely no surprises to be had here.\n\nI got this incredibly cheap in a Humble Capcom Bundle, and I still feel like I got ripped off. Also, that's probably the only time you're ever going to see the words "Humble" and "Capcom" in the same sentence.\n\nThere are some good things about Lost Planet 3. Well, there's at least one good thing ab out Lost Planet 3. All it takes to make the game better is pressing Alt+F4.","November 4, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be honest, I haven't played any of the previous installments of LOST PLANET, but this here feels so bland, so generic. It's really like having a boring job where you don't have to think. Just do the same routine over and over again.\nFirst of all, the LOST PLANET doesn't seem lost at all. What if certainly feels like is: extremely boring. In my five hours of playing, all I've experienced was: get an assignment, enter your rig, go somewhere, get attacked 2-3 times by the same half-dozen types of creatures, push some levers/retrieve some item, get attacked some more, go back, have coffee, etc.\nCombat in this game is mainly dodge and shoot, dodge and shoot, repeat ad nauseum until all creature are dead. As I said, I've played this game for five hours, which is about four more than I mildly enjoyed it. I continued hoping that something would happen that broke the endless continuum I was stuck in, but nothing ever did. And don't even get me started about the rig and the bizarre catch-and-drill combat mechanics involved with it and the fact that it can't even take a few blows from a significantly smaller creature but will auto-repair in a minute under the condition that you exit it.\n\nTo sum it up: I've had significantly more fun at playing ALIENS:COLONIAL MARINES than at this game. It's a pity because the graphics are nice and the main character is quite likeable; not your run-of-the-mill supersoldier dude. But the game has no sense of exploration or alienation and at no moment did I feel lost. What the game certainly transmits is the feeling of being a blue collar at work, listening to a simple man's country songs on the radio of your truck... uh... rig and getting his job done so he can go home.","November 26, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I had some fun, there were also several reasons why I cannot recommend this game.\n\n- You can't save the game yourself. Autosave is a nice feature, but if it is the only possibility it s*cks! You can only choose between the last checkpoint, the checkpoint before that and a new game.\n\n- Cutscenes: I couldn't skip them. And it is annoying to see a scene for the 6th time, because the boss killed you.\n\n- Interaction of badly placed checkpoints and cutscenes: some checkpoints are choosen very poorly! For example there was one in a cave, before a bossfight. Everytime a failed to kill the crab I had to walk trough a cavern, then enter the area where I had to place something, then I had to watch the cutscene and after I died I had to do this over and over again. Loading the checkpoint before that (in the attempt to switch my weapons) didn't work either, because it was only 30 seconds away.\n\n- Bugs! There are severall bugs in this version. Starting with wrong instructions (press WASD to rotate, though you have to hit F), akrid spawning out of nowhere, akrid standing around without doing anywith, problems with taking cover and so on.\n\n- Difficulty: except for some bossfights and very few situations the game is too easy, even on hard settings.\n\n- Multiplayer: there is one, but nobody is playing it.\n\n- The game ends with you having to press F very fast and very often.

It's plenty of fun, cool environments, interesting setting and story, interesting character.\nThere are a couple things that annoy me, though. One of which is the lack of realism on several fronts, for one your mech (utility rig) which is a big ♥♥♥ walking tank/bulldozer, can take less hits than you outside of it. That makes very little sense. Besides that, another weird unrealistic thing is that all characters have these fancy suits that protect them from all the cold and stuff but for some reason you never have any kind of headgear on. If this were real then your face would've been absolutely destroyed by frostbite and other hazards after half a mission. Seriously, at least give him some face coverage when he's outside in the cold wasteland.\n\nI can see that it could get repetitive, but so far it isn't to me.\nReally, though, that mech should be way stronger.\nAnother thing that kinda annoys me is some enemies that only have one or two weak spot(s), like just the mouth (and only when it is open) or just the tip of the tail, and it gets pretty hard to dodge some attacks and deal damage too. When they jump on you, you gotta play some kinda minigame with mashing the a button and then aiming your knife at their face, with the tigerlike akrids you only gotta do it three times but the weaker flying akrid takes way longer for some reason. Weird logic.\n\nAll in all my impression is quite positive thus far. I look forward to seeing what else the game has to offer.\n","October 25, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably not, it doesn't seem to have appealed to many people, but if you're like me and it does, then you'll find something to enjoy in this game.\nThe first problem is of course, that LP3 is very different from previous installments, it abandons the arcade score attack feel and takes a notably more "Western" approach to the gameplay and story. The third person shooting is very off-the-shelf, but it works well enough, character animations and models are especially nice, and a lot of attention has been given to the story and characters this time.\nI often felt lost in LP2, I didn't know who was trying to accomplish what or why, it was very confusing and disjointed, but the stellar gameplay and action held it up.\nLP3 kind of has the opposite problem, while the gameplay is good, it's nothing to write home about and would be at home in any third person shooter since Gears of War, but I feel that such special attention has been paid to the characters and story that these elements make LP3 noteworthy and elevate it above bargain bin cover shooters.\nJim is just so damn relatable, we all know someone like Jim, we identify with his goals and his attitude.\nWhere other games might make their protagonist a heroic space marine slaying aliens, Jim is just a contractor, and he sees his work as mostly routine and mundane.\nThis simple fact grounds the whole game and makes it so much more immersive and believable. Jim has keepsakes in the cab of his mech, he has favorite music tracks he likes to listen to, he sends video messages to his family, he's helpful but sarcastic bordering on passive-aggressive, and he just feels like a real fleshed out person who has a reason to exist beyond driving the plot.\nWe identify with Jim, we like Jim and we want Jim to succeed.\nThe story is well written and well acted, and it will keep you playing because you want to uncover the mystery, and I'll leave it at that so as to avoid spoilers.\nThe game borrows many design and gameplay elements from Dead Space 3, infact at times the inspiration borders on plagiarism, but LP3 never quite manages to reach the same technical and graphical competency. Not that the game looks bad, the graphics and animations are pretty nice, but it invites the comparisons to DS3 and just can't live up to them.\nIn short if you like Dead Space 3 you'll find a lot to like here too.\nThe game is just comfy, it's immersive, the thin layer of ice you see coating the windows of the mech contrasted with the steaming mug of coffee Jim is sipping, the way Jim's facial expressions will change during gameplay to reflect the tone, the attention to detail in the way your heavy machinery and equipment is operated, just all these small touches that come together to make you feel like you're really on EDN 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the gameplay is a downgrade to LP2, but if you give it a chance to immerse you, you'll find a very underappreciated story.\n","October 27, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most importantly having your HUD tied to you mobile but massive mech works, removing minor quality of life stuff when "going into the wild." The writing and performances are above par, though story itself is generic at best. Game looks great and there are a few really enjoyable weapons, but only a few of the enemies are properly enjoyable to fight against.\n\nMost impressively Lost Planet 3 is extremely close in succesfully having you "do a job" amongst the rest of the game without it being a chore. Lumbering around in your mech is great as is, and a lot of the writing really enhances the feel of you being there doing work along a long period of time, though most of what you do is actually story stuff. And yeah that doesn´t sound exiting, but Lost planet 3 is very close to pulling it off 100% and as is it´s still absolutely enjoyable to play through.\n\nIt´s a shame how close this games gets to greatness, seemingly without being given another chance.","October 17, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, I'd say most of the shooting is pretty subpar and boring the majority of the time, and the enemies are thrown at you over and over and over in terrible waves going from room to room. The core stuff is totally uninteresting.\n\nWhere the game is pretty cool is when it makes you feel like some future Canadian oil driller just trying to make it day to day. As you move from area to area you get to hear some future trucker country play on your radio. You start to get some nic nacs in your rig, and most of the characters you run into feel like a greater part of this independent drilling facility. The major problem is that the game never goes far enough in this direction, and later on most of these elements become shallow as it strips or waives your ability to participate in it, instead heavily focusing on funneling you down corridor after corridor and arena after arena of dull, uninspired combat.\n\nYou must know that you're making a bad game when you have the main character constantly complain about the level design, right? This is probably the reason Spark isn't doing so hot.\n\nDon't get this game if you're a fan of the past games, but if you're interested in seeing the "spark" of what could have been a comfy Canadian driller sim, then get it on a drastic sale. At the very least, the devs seemed to care enough to update the multiplayer to work over Steamworks when Gamespy shut down, which is at least a kind gesture, even if you will never find another person to play with.","July 19, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mean the game give controller prompts when you're using a keyboard and mouse. I mean that the on screen prompt actually tells you to press they completely wrong key.\n\n--I have never seen such a bad autosave system in my life. Several times I loded my last save, only to discover four powerful enemies within five feet of me. Loading the save before, I was in the same situation. Luckily, you can load one of your manual saves. Just kidding! There are no manual saves, because this is an incredibly lazy console port.\n\n--The lighting is all over the place. Buildings and caves are so dark that I frequently had to adjust my gamma up to see. Upon leaving the area, I had to adjust the gamma back down because the world was blindingly bright.\n\n--Enemies are either so weak that using the handgun on them feels like overkill, or fast moving bullet sponges with powerful melee attacks. There is no middle ground.\n\n--The game has a completely useless cover system. There is only one enemy I encountered that taking cover would have helped against. That enemy can just race around your cover and slash you, or simply lean over it and strangle you.\n\n--Actually, I take it back. The cover is worse than useless. Half the time you just jump over it instead of sticking to it, leaving you out in the open in middle of a bunch of Akrid. If you do manage to stick to cover, rolling away from it to avoid melee attacks doesn't work half the time.\n\n--The Utility Rig, which should be one of the highlights of the game, is a joke. Most of the time you only use it to slowly trudge from one place to the next. Sometimes it functions as a glorified fetch quest, demanding that you run around pushing buttons to open the path for it.\n\n--When you finally do get to fight a giant monster with your rig, don't expect much. Giant Akrid fights are simply disguised QTEs. Tap a button to block, then tap another button to grab with your claw arm, then hold a third button to attack with your drill. Wait until the enemy attacks, then repeat. Giant robot combat has never been so boring.\n\n--You do a lot of pointless running around. Run to the TEng post to harvest it. Run to the lab to turn in a quest. Run up a mountain hitting buttons for your rig. Seriously, if you were looking for a winter hike simulator, you found it.\n\n--The characters. Oh, god, the characters. You play as "Mr. Gruff Space Enginner Who Left His Wife And Child Behind So He Could Go Into Space To Support Them". Because, you know, that's original. Along the way you meet several interesting and unique characters. There's "Base Commander Who Totally Isn't Hiding Anything", "Young, Socially Inept Genius Technician", "Arrogant But Brilliant Science Man" and "Frenchman". I'd love to tell you more about Frenchman, but his entire character seems to be that he's French. Oh, and there's also a few extras that seem like they got lost on their way to shooting a mildly racist Pocahontas film.\n\n--I won't "spoil" the "story" for you, but suffice to say that it is an incredibly generic, cliche riddled lump of turd. It's like someone had a copy of the scifi cliche handbook. And they didn't even paraphrase. They just tore pages out of the book, stapled them to a blank sheet of paper and called it a day. Phoning it in doesn't even cover it. The writers left a sticky note on the door that said, "Just watch SyFy for a couple hours and figure it out yourself." and never bothered to show up for work again. They probably didn't even spring for the name brand Post-Its. If you've seen more than two science fiction films, there are absolutely no surprises to be had here.\n\nI got this incredibly cheap in a Humble Capcom Bundle, and I still feel like I got ripped off. Also, that's probably the only time you're ever going to see the words "Humble" and "Capcom" in the same sentence.\n\nThere are some good things about Lost Planet 3. Well, there's at least one good thing ab out Lost Planet 3. All it takes to make the game better is pressing Alt+F4.","November 4, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mean the game give controller prompts when you're using a keyboard and mouse. I mean that the on screen prompt actually tells you to press they completely wrong key.\n\n--I have never seen such a bad autosave system in my life. Several times I loded my last save, only to discover four powerful enemies within five feet of me. Loading the save before, I was in the same situation. Luckily, you can load one of your manual saves. Just kidding! There are no manual saves, because this is an incredibly lazy console port.\n\n--The lighting is all over the place. Buildings and caves are so dark that I frequently had to adjust my gamma up to see. Upon leaving the area, I had to adjust the gamma back down because the world was blindingly bright.\n\n--Enemies are either so weak that using the handgun on them feels like overkill, or fast moving bullet sponges with powerful melee attacks. There is no middle ground.\n\n--The game has a completely useless cover system. There is only one enemy I encountered that taking cover would have helped against. That enemy can just race around your cover and slash you, or simply lean over it and strangle you.\n\n--Actually, I take it back. The cover is worse than useless. Half the time you just jump over it instead of sticking to it, leaving you out in the open in middle of a bunch of Akrid. If you do manage to stick to cover, rolling away from it to avoid melee attacks doesn't work half the time.\n\n--The Utility Rig, which should be one of the highlights of the game, is a joke. Most of the time you only use it to slowly trudge from one place to the next. Sometimes it functions as a glorified fetch quest, demanding that you run around pushing buttons to open the path for it.\n\n--When you finally do get to fight a giant monster with your rig, don't expect much. Giant Akrid fights are simply disguised QTEs. Tap a button to block, then tap another button to grab with your claw arm, then hold a third button to attack with your drill. Wait until the enemy attacks, then repeat. Giant robot combat has never been so boring.\n\n--You do a lot of pointless running around. Run to the TEng post to harvest it. Run to the lab to turn in a quest. Run up a mountain hitting buttons for your rig. Seriously, if you were looking for a winter hike simulator, you found it.\n\n--The characters. Oh, god, the characters. You play as "Mr. Gruff Space Enginner Who Left His Wife And Child Behind So He Could Go Into Space To Support Them". Because, you know, that's original. Along the way you meet several interesting and unique characters. There's "Base Commander Who Totally Isn't Hiding Anything", "Young, Socially Inept Genius Technician", "Arrogant But Brilliant Science Man" and "Frenchman". I'd love to tell you more about Frenchman, but his entire character seems to be that he's French. Oh, and there's also a few extras that seem like they got lost on their way to shooting a mildly racist Pocahontas film.\n\n--I won't "spoil" the "story" for you, but suffice to say that it is an incredibly generic, cliche riddled lump of turd. It's like someone had a copy of the scifi cliche handbook. And they didn't even paraphrase. They just tore pages out of the book, stapled them to a blank sheet of paper and called it a day. Phoning it in doesn't even cover it. The writers left a sticky note on the door that said, "Just watch SyFy for a couple hours and figure it out yourself." and never bothered to show up for work again. They probably didn't even spring for the name brand Post-Its. If you've seen more than two science fiction films, there are absolutely no surprises to be had here.\n\nI got this incredibly cheap in a Humble Capcom Bundle, and I still feel like I got ripped off. Also, that's probably the only time you're ever going to see the words "Humble" and "Capcom" in the same sentence.\n\nThere are some good things about Lost Planet 3. Well, there's at least one good thing ab out Lost Planet 3. All it takes to make the game better is pressing Alt+F4.","November 4, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also didn't mind the slower pace of the game, and the concept of being a miner. The story started promising and I really enjoyed the characters and dialogue. I also really enjoyed gazing at the fantastic backgrounds as I walked through the snow in my mech.\nThen the first couple of hours ended.\nThis game is nothing but padding and bad design decisions. The gunplay is nowhere near as satisfying as the previous entries and the Akrid are turned into generic melee, ranged, tank, and mini enemies. They're nowhere near as interesting or dynamic as the previous games, also dismemberment is missing unless you're fighting bosses. About the first 2 hours in you'll soon realize this game wastes your time. Combat is drawn out, and enemies are bullet sponges. Thankfully you can run past most enemies, unless it's a wave based section. The mech is wasted. Combat is stiff and telling the distance between enemies is infuriating, especially against smaller enemies, such as the wasp-like Akrid. Boss fights are nothing more than quick time events. Requiring no skill and lacking the experimentation that was present in the other games. There is also the forced slow walking, slow mech walking speed, and others to waste your time. Thanks to all of this the story loses focus, and I lost total interest in it later. Later conversations with characters’ result in constant fetch quests, which brought constant groans and eye rolling from me.\n\nThe padding is so bad that I just can't even bring myself to finish the game. Avoid this one and buy Lost Planet 1 & 2 instead; they're FAR better games.","February 11","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's become a bit of a circlejerk, and a little unfair.\n\nI should start with agreeing with the main stigma against it, it's /not/ the same as the other two games in the series, that being said it's not a terrible game. It has it's flaws, but all things considered still quite enjoyable. Though, maybe not for the full price of £20.\n\nThe combat is fairly decent, a little buggy in moments, and the shotgun has this weird little delay after evading/reloading, but all in all, nothing's seriously awful and it gets the job done.\nThe music in the game is.. Well, decent. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's still an enjoyable listen. The Voice Acting, however, is absolute garbage, and you're probably going to want to turn that audio slider way down. The main character is decent, as with a few sides. But some of the key characters are just painful.\nStoryline is albiet, quite cliche, but again, not too awful. The intro sequence was definitely intriguing, and got me surprisingly well immersed.\nControl scheme is pretty janky, some keys just plain don't make sense. P, E, V and T are all different action keys, and it can get a little infuriating. They're rebindable, though. So all's good.\n\nHonestly, despite the big flaws as they are. It's a buggy game, for sure. But nothing game breaking. It's a fun little game to kill some time in, and I came out rather happy with it.\nI'd give it an honest 6/10.

Didn't try the multiplayer aspect and I think it's safe to assume that it's dead. As closure for this series, I don't think this game really did it justice. The game itself wasn't bad, and I found myself eager to continue through but there was almost no incentive to complete side missions (like the DNA tracker) and the general lack of those available being interesting was enough reason to forget most of it. For instance, in the story you are required to setup a thermal post, and about 2-3 missions later a quest opens up for you to collect the energy (2500) which is a fair amount of currency. However, unless you are buying weapons/upgrades from the quartermaster there is little reason to do this. The ease of defeating enemies makes varying your weapons near pointless....etc.\n\nMAYBE it's different on a harder difficulty level and perhaps then the "incentive" is there but for me personally unless the game is 30+ hours in length I see no reason to develop the world or my character when I wont be using it for long and can get through with base weapons. Play the game to complete the series, but remember it for what it is, a filler prequel milking off how good LP 1 and 2 was, and enjoy it for a day (or two).

Supposedly this one has worse game play than the other two (probably because the game is more focused on telling its beautiful story) but it’s not terrible or unplayable or anything. This game is a prequel to Lost Planet 1 and sets up the game. It really gave me a feeling of wanting more when I finished the game.\n\nStory:\n\nThe game's story is really polished. It does feel a bit rushed at the finale as everything gets really crazy and I do question the motives of characters. I think if the game had been longer and had more time it wouldn’t have been as harsh a transition but then a longer game would have made the story seem too drawn out. It’s a compromise and sadly it makes the ending feel rushed and not nearly as polished as the rest of the game.\n\nCharacters are good though sometimes they come off being a little robotic with animations and such. The game has a lot of colorful NPCs you can wander around and talk to or overhear throughout the game. Cut scenes are well done except for the moments where you have difficulty and die repeatedly having to watch one over and over again.\n\nGame play:\n\nThe guns all feel same-y. The only real different one is the grenade launcher and that’s just because it shoots grenades. There are like 3 rifle / SMG weapons, 2 sniper rifles and a shotgun. The pistol is like a mix between the rifle and the sniper as it has slower fire but more accuracy. The game will recommend you use a certain type of weapon to beat certain types of enemies but it really doesn’t matter. Each gun roughly operates the same so its just a matter of finding which ones you like.\n\nEach enemy is different but there are only like 12 types and that’s including bosses. You got swarmers, flyers, rollers, cat-like panthers, face-huggers and grenade like lobbing ones. They all kind of just swarm you. The game is like "why make harder enemies when we can just make more?" and I get it, it’s supposed to be an alien swarm attacking you but basically you just mow em all down. The panthers are the most strategy oriented.\n\nThe only enemy I didn’t list is these centipede crawlers that shoot bolts at you while others flank you. So you are forced to take cover but you can't because if you do another one comes and wrecks you.\n\nBosses are mostly lame. It’s basically a game of find out how to hit the glow-y spot enough. Most the time a new boss is fun but it’s when you fight it the 2nd or 3rd time that it gets old. Bosses are usually based on crabs and so it’s usually, dodge the pincer and shoot the arms and then the underbelly / back area.\n\nThe construction rig you get in the game is fun but it’s too slow. I’m pretty sure you can get out of it and run just as fast. It feels really tedious to walk from area to area in the game in this slow giant mech. The cool thing though is fighting bosses in the rig / giant construction mech. It makes a boss you have fought previously on the ground a whole lot more fun because you now get to fight a fair game size wise. Those pincers you had to shoot off before, now you can grab and just rip off like it was a real crab. It’s awesome.\n\nFinally, the entire game you fight Akrid (the lost planet alien bug/plant life things) but in the endgame of Lost Planet 3 you finally get to shoot other humans. Sadly they often times do not shoot back. I found most weapons take them down in 1-3 hits which for machine guns is really easy. The snipers in the game make even faster work of human enemies as 90% of the time a sniper rifle can kill them before they even notice you. Often time’s enemies would spawn and I'd wipe them out before the elevator / drop ship even left.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is good, I enjoyed it. It has some game play issues and some pacing issues with its tedious intro and the slow giant mech you have to pilot for the majority of the game. The combat is good, but way too easy and not varied enough sadly. The environments in the game are amazing and the story is fantastic. I would recommend getting it on those two points alone. If you have never played a Lost Planet® you should get / try this one, it will make you want to play the other ones.","October 26, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take my words with this in mind and you'll probably see an at least decent and truthful review.\nATTENTION: FOR A TL;DR, SCROLL DOWN TO THE PROS AND CONS.\n\nSo, thanks to a friend of mine and Humble Bundle, I got my first game in this series that I had always thought of playing but never had the monies to buy this, as this wasn't really something I had a really big interest in to put it in top priority in my low amount of purchases.\n\nSo I decided to install it and give it a try. Here's what I got:\n\nSimple menu, few options, few graphical options (I have a really low-end gaming machine. How low is that? A first-gen i5 and a GeForce 9500GT, so the first thing I do when I start up a new game is set everything to low), and could even rebind every single control in the game.\n\nTime to dive in.\n\nGame starts, some interest sparks in me and I decide to even let the cinematics kick in and introduce me into the game. Not anything big happens, some strange stuff, old guy telling a story. Yeah, that sounds okay. Cinematics end, first mission. Run around the icy field, through aliens called "Akrid", to try to find a piece to repair the vehicle I'm in. Clichéd enough, a guy with a terrible french accent saves me in his giant mech. Woo. I do some more stuff and go to the base where the expedition is located.\n\nFirst thing I decide to do is wonder around the base. I find it to be quite big, but unnecessary to have three floors and to access each of them I had to take an elevator ride that puts me in a loading screen. And yeah, I saw an unnecessary amount of those during my 25 hours of gameplay. I do my stuff and get my first real mission, to get my "rig", which is basically a giant mech without any real weapons, and go outside the base to find out where the heck the guy that saved me in the start was, since he wasn't answering his radio. Of course he was having troubles. Of course I was going to be the hero since the first mission in the game, but actually, who cares? It's an AAA game anyways, so I was expecting that. That's how I get introduced in the gameplay. Walking around the snowy world in my rig (in first person!) felt really good for the couple of hours. I felt protected, I felt like nothing could stop me. Then I help the guy and shoot some aliens around. This leads to my first encounter with real animations, models and textures.\n\nEverything looks really great. Animations aren't all f*cked up or just plain bad, they're acceptable and I have nothing to complain about it. The models are quite detailed, each enemy type is quite well-detailed and has a unique feel to them, not like they were copy-pasted from eachother and just a few things added/removed. Textures? They look quite good too.\n\nSome hours in and I could already talk about the gameplay itself. I was thrown in an open-world, quite big levels with transitions from one to the other. Everything looks majestic and you feel like you're but an ant in there. What do I see? A lot of snow. It got me tired at some point but I couldn't complain about it because it really adds something to the atmosphere. And of course not everything was cold. But the landscapes... Wow. I was truly amazed by some of the stuff I saw and it really kept me going, so a point to level design.\n\nWhat about quests? Yeah, there are some. Just A VERY few to be honest. And they most of the time require traveling around (thank god they put some half-♥♥♥♥♥ quick travel) and seeing loads of loading screens. Yes, I will ♥♥♥♥♥ about loading screens throughout the review because really, there are just so many of them. From my total time, I bet you that AT VERY LEAST 2-3 hours were wasted summing up the loading screens. But some of them add up to the atmosphere and to the story. And they encourage two different things, exploration and hunting an specific type of enemy. At least a way of farming some money fast.\n\nAbout the action... Well, there are two types of action in this game: The third person one, which is always with your main character; and the First Person one, which is with your rig. Yeah, your rig doesn't have weapons but it has it's tools which you'll use to crush some aliens. The third person fights are quite okay. Not much different from other third person shooters, so there is cover-based shooting, enemies have armor and weakspots (most of them need to be hit in the weakspot to take damage), you feel progression and new ways of fighting with new weapons that are gradually introduced to the game, and the AI is quite good, REALLY good. The first person fights are... bad. They could have been MUCH better. You're in a friggin' mech and the only way of doing harm to most enemies you'll face in it is through quicktime events that are triggered by countering their attacks (basically press a key when the enemy is about to hit you to trigger it) and then doing something that you are supposed to find out by yourself. It took me more than 20 minutes of trying to kill one kind of enemy before figuring out I was supposed to press forward after grabbing him. How the heck was I supposed to know that? I needed to seriously button-mash to find out what I was supposed to do after countering him, which was a really big let down.\n\nThe story itself goes uphill as the game goes on. It starts off really slow, and then with every main quest it starts going up and then something kinda predictable happens in a very unpredictable moment, so yeah, the story starts taking off from there and it starts to get interesting. Then, later into the game there's another moment kinda like this that I really enjoyed. I was actually really surprised, but nothing much happens after that. If you want to know if I liked it, well, actually I did. It was fun(ny), just don't expect anything out of it and you might actually enjoy as much as I did.\n\nWhat did I not like about the game? I'm a b*tch for sounds. The Akrid have a lot of similar sounds to eachother, so you will not get that interested about them. The music is okay, there's even a small playlist for you to listen inside the rig, but I turned the music volume off after the first hours of gameplay and just put in some post-rock and shoegaze to feel better. Then we have the voice acting. The protagonist's voice is quite good, but the rest is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Basically all of the other guys have really stupid accents thrown in their voices, like that french accent I said earlier, a mix of "COD-like" russian and "generic german" in quite a few characters, some "asian" guy with bad lines. Most of the lines were quite bad and the game itself made fun of them in quite a few ways.\n\n\nSo, summing it all up:\nPROS:\nWalking around in a mech in first-person is really cool for some time.\nModels, textures and animations look really good.\nThe world itself, even if repetitive at times, shows some really beautiful landscapes and the level design is quite good.\nNo grinding.\nAI.\nDecent story.\nStupid yet funny lines.\nThe action is fun for most of the time.\nCONS\nLoading screens. LOTS of them.\nTravelling gets tiring after a while.\nFirst-person action is ridiculous.\nVoice acting is REALLY bad.\nTL;DR: I can surely recommend this game if you like normal games and if you feel that you won't be getting an amazing experience. Just think of this game as it had another name, like "Cold Space World" and you can even forget it's not a Lost Planet game and have some fun if you're a fanboy.","November 21, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Roller akrids will stop aiming at you if you side dodge no matter how far away.\n-No jump button so you often have to take the long away around knee high rubble.\n-No crouch button, it happens automatically and takes away your ability to shoot to be "cinematic"\n-Can't use grapple hook whenever you want, only when prompted by QTE.\n-Can't fall off ledges or fall to your death, invisible walls everywhere.\n-Stupid random QTE sequences with generic enemies and environment that aren't fun.\n-Spaghetti space western atmosphere in how people talk and in the music. I hate that crap personally.\n-No "VS" to pilot, only the "rig" which is for QTE boss fights, environmental QTE and slooooow mandatory transportation.\n-Unnecessary hub at base and "open world" that's really not very open but just waste your time.\n-Screen jelly HP regen, T-Eng no longer keeps you alive, it's just a form of currency to buy stuff.\n-Characters are generic and unattractive. Lack of Japanese design philosophy shows and no one is iconic looking.\n-Akrids all look worse than previous games, once again, lack of Japanese design philosophy.\n-Story was giving off some Dead Space vibe but not sure if it elaborates on it or not since I quit playing.\n-No cool boss fights. I left the best for last because Lost Planet has always been known for awesome bosses.\n\nIn conclusion, I much prefer the Japanese developed LP1/LP2 which are quirky, imperfect but FUN and replayable. If you like Japanese game design more then you'll probably despise Lost Planet 3 with every fibre of your being. It abandons the arcade shooter roots, the cool boss fights, the over the top action and the cool mechs. This game is definitely aimed more toward the crowd who loves "narrative driven cinematic experiences" and doesn't mind having their hand held with mediocre gameplay. If you come into this game only caring about the story you'll probably have a good time judging by some of the positive reviews.","November 21, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You even have a music playlist in your rig! It's pretty sweet, you can probably check the soundtrack online.\n\nTo the story: the characters were interesting and not annoying, but the story is Avatar to a tee, except that the natives are japanese instead of native-americans.\n\nThe action is above lame most of the time, and then there is that one level that is way too difficult. It's a third person shooter that doesn't use cover often.\n\nThe segments in the mech suit are dragging for way too long, from the walking to the fighting.\n\nI've seen some glitchy oddities, but very minor.

If this game had been cut down to 5 or 6 hours, it would have been great, unfortunately it's twice that length, meaning almost everything gets stretched beyond enjoyability. Everything gets repeated over and over again in an MMO like grind. You fight a boss once, you'll fight him two more times. You drill a well, you'll drill three more. You fix one broken switch, five more await. All while being forced to stagger in your helpless Mech from location to location in excruciatingly slow fashion because fast travel doesn't open up until you're a few hours into the game, and even then it only works half of the time. And that is the real shame of this game, it wastes your time to such an insane degree that it becomes almost insulting; why do I need to take three different elevators to visit the labs? And the worst part is that, in truth, none of it was needed. The story was great, until the bad ending, the mechanics and gameplay were varied and enjoyable, the devs didn't need to inflate the run time. Paired with its multiplayer component, a shorter campaign would have been fine. Instead you have three, maybe four hours worth of quality gameplay and two-ish hours of cutscenes, stretched out to span twelve or so hours. Resulting in what could have been an amazing game, being rendered a complete waste of time.\n\nHere is my in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWu1PT-kHVk\n","February 26","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean; Jim Peyton is your main character; with his mannerisms and look you'll be reminded of your average cowboy hero. Which the inclusion of the soundtrack in your rig helps even more to solidify that.\nHowever; it goes without saying this game has some major issues, when you play Gears of Lost Planet 3; you'll notice that things like button prompts are faulty; even for the default button settings. Which is sad.\nAnother major issue is that near the end of the game; you stop doing the you vs. weird plant creatures. Instead it becomes a shooting gallery.\nAll in all; the game does some things well; atmosphere, story, the way it fleshes out characters. All very well done.\nThe actual game aspect of the game is a bit of a tragedy however; it treats you like an idiot, gives you the wrong prompts, and the mech battles themselves felt anything but satisfactory.","December 24, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cutscenes in the game are really grainy if you're playing at 1080p or above, so the HD videos will make a big difference.)\n\nAfter about 2 hours of playing Lost Planet 3, I was ready to uninstall it and move onto the next game. For some reason, I ended up putting in another 2 hours and I'm really glad I did! (I'm at 58 hours now, over two back-to-back playthroughs of the game.)\n\nIf you've played any of the previous Lost Planet games, the setting will be familiar. EDN III. Frozen wasteland filled with nasty bug-creatures called Akrid. You run around and shoot them, or occasionally crush them with your full-sized mech (not the mech-mini of the original game). The shooting and mech combat are both decent. They're not great, but they won't annoy you too much. (The mech battles might, until you get the hang of the controls.)\n\nBut don't worry about those details. The reason you should really play the game is for the story. The writing and voice acting are both superb, which makes for an amazing combination. You'll really start to care for all of the characters in the game, including some of the ones you never get to meet in person but only come to know from reading through the text and audio logs they left behind around the planet.\n\nIf you're a completionist, it's possible to collect everything and get all of the single-player achievements in your first playthrough (if you play on HARD), but I'd recommend playing through the game on normal first, and then doing a second run through on HARD. The pacing for a new player is really kind of rough, so it took me quite a while to really get into the game the first time through. But when you play through it agian (on HARD), you'll get to appreciate the game for how I believe the developers MEANT for you to experience it, which makes for a really great experience.\n\n","December 23, 2015","true","58.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also pretty ugly for a 2013 game, like Dead Space is very similar in desing as far as UI is concerned, LP3 does more or less the same things, but really bad. Like when you open the map for example, it's a holograph, but unlike dead space it's not in 3d, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overlay. There's also the same type of guiding system, but instead of the neat beam that lights the ground, it just markers, why bother when you have a minimap? Just make the minimap actually readable and you won't need that, just putting that out there. Same deal for graphics, it isn't really ugly, but it isn't 2008 either if you catch my meaning.\nThe worst of all must be the acting, sound desing and character desing. Can't think of a way to make the story and characters more cliché for starters, take generic bad sci-fi trying to copy Alien 3 but swf, and put a Nicolas Cage twist to it. Like, make it as garbage and soulless as possible, and you have the setting for LP3. Hell, the hero even looks like Nic Cage. The voice acting is all over the place: the obnoxious french guy that they couldn't bother to get voiced by an actual french guy (just say ouiii and ♥♥♥♥♥ all the time, amiright?), the strong black that doesn't have any substance (just say hell no and such all the time, you'll be fine), the fat guy supervisor that no one really respects but he signs the paychecks so yeah (Alien 3 again), etc...\nAnd the character design, just take ironic or exagerated cyber punk clothes in a serious context. Like take the armor in UT 2004, but in a serious sf setting with 2 deep 4 u plot, and there you have it.\nAnd to top it off, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, not even the cinematics look that good.\n\nTLDR: It's trash and you're better off playing LP2. Oh wait, it's a bad port too. ♥♥♥♥ Capcom / 20.","June 3","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
