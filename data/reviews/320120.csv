You have to complete tasks (click on your fairy at the right place during the right time of day or night), and was mostly spent waiting for the time of day to change so I could click on the fairy. This wouldn't be so bad if it was more beautiful. It's also not the kind of  thing I'm going to go back and play, as one play-through was more than enough. Also, upon completing the game I felt it wasn't very rewarding, and nothing really happened.","October 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","51","62","0","0"

There isn't really a lot to it on the surface. You basically fly around as a butterfly or something (who everybody is referring to as Navi lol) singing little butterfly songs and essentially unlocking stuff. Your song helps to create events which further the progress along. The story itself is a minimalist as can be. Basically it is really the representation of a short poem/musing about the limitless possibilities of dreams. You probably wont get that during the game itself necessarily, but the message will be conveyed to you in the end.\n\nOverall, not a bad hour long game, but there is also definitely not much in the way of replay value. Presently, the game is a buck on Steam. That seems to be the right price in my estimation. But it for a buck and enjoy. Spend more and you will likely regret your purchase a little bit.\n\nAll told, for what is basically concept art/poetry in game form, I give this a straight 6 out of 10. Worth your time, pleasant, but ultimately a one and done.","May 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","1"

But explore what? A tiny map of grassland and little glowing flowers.\nThe quests are not clear enough, all you seem to get is picture pages in a 'Grimore' book. (Which i thought was a spell book for dark magic...?)\nThe sound effects for the fariy gets really annoying after a while, especially when you start to click it in fury of trying to complete this game.\nYes, it is relaxing (The sound effects in the background are so calming and realistic) But it is way to complex for a sleepy game.\nThe so called 'Jigsaw pieces' are so transparent in the 'realistic lighting' they are actually invisible. It was really hard trying to find those little buggers, and it spent most of my time up completing the whole jigsaw.\nBut... It is a very cute, and sweet game, and it is almost like a 'poem'. I won't ruin the story, but it is a very cute ending. (If you get passed the first level.) And if you think about it long enough, the whole game is just a bundle of cute.\nSo if you want a small, complex but soothing game to aid you to slumber, this may just be the game for you.\n- 5/10","November 7, 2014","false","0.3"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/320120/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: Meadowland is an "artsy" exploration game with interesting but ultimately shallow game mechanics that rides with its dreamy expression.\n\nPlaced inside a dream, you are a faerie who can fly around and sing in the serene, mystical dreamland. What's going on? Game shows you and immediately gets to the action of finding out yourself.\n\nUser interface is minimal, only telling you how to move and how to sing. As there are no special maneuvers to attempt, the controls are sufficient for flying around: the faerie goes where you click and hold and then sings when you click the faerie.\n\nSinging is the main thing you want to do all the time. Singing at right places (and times) induces special events like e.g. rain or flower blooming. There's also a story that only progresses when you sing at the right place at the right time. Flow of time is seen in the celestial motion but all events nevertheless happen exactly at same times each day or night.\n\nUnfortunately "the song" gets old pretty fast. It is this echoing sigh sound and spamming it doesn't make it any better. On the other hand the music is nice enough not to be annoying but too forgettable to leave a lasting memory.\n\nIn addition to moving and singing you are only introduced to a huge book, the grimoire. It acts as both the menu (telling you e.g. that F is for fullscreen) and as the clue for progressing the story. You can read the whole (short) story at one time and then just come and refresh your memory when you are stuck and bored of exploring the world. Your job is to accomplish the story as depicted by the mysterious tome.\n\nStory is hard to explain without spoiling it, so at simplest it could be described as a love story. Your experience may vary as it can be interpreted as a tale of companionship or longing. All the same, it only takes about an hour to figure out the story to its end while looking for the other secrets. That is, if it works correctly for you: on my second try of playthrough I was unable to trigger the story events for whatever reason.\n\nWhile not necessarily partial to the story itself, the secrets are the hidden things to try and find while exploring the dreamworld, many of them worth an achievement. In addition to its namesake, the meadows, you can find ponds, trees, a mountain, a floating island and a sea as well as a couple of celestial and atmospheric features. It's fun to see what you can do and find the various secrets of the dreamland, that is, until you have found the few there are.\n\nThere's also a mysterious puzzle that took an additional hour of my platime, because I missed it in the first playthrough. These transparent pieces are floating in the air and disappear quickly if not grabbed immediately. For me looking for the puzzle pieces was a chore because they are difficult to notice and they appear only at random times. This being my second playthrough, the progression bug prevented me from experiencing the story for another go so I was even more bored just trying to stumble upon the pieces.\n\nMeadowland is a beautiful but short exploration game. It managed to evoke both happy and sad thoughts in me at the end in its presentation of the fleeting nature of dreams. While it's short and gets boring after a while if you can't figure out the way to progress, it's fortunately also very cheap: I'd recommend waiting for at least -50% sale and my recommendation of the game is partly based on the small price. After all, you'll probably get only 1-2 hours content of various quality out of it, less if you are not going for 100% completion.","August 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

You can make some cute effects happen by flying through things like grass and flowers. Sometimes barely visible puzzle pieces are laying around the place and you can fly over them to pick them up and add them to the puzzle. Day and night slowly cycle continuously. There's some stuff to look at, like the two people that live on islands in the sky. There's a picture book to look at as well.\n\nThe big question is: What the heck am I supposed to be doing here? There's no real goal or purpose. It's just a fairy on a small map with things happening. See the background to the logo at the top of the page? That's the whole map. The fairy is roughly the size of the star on the far left side. (That may actually be the fairy, since that's the starting point.)\n\nAlso, the visual effect during daytime makes my eyes lose focus to an extent that is physically uncomfortable.

As a walking simulator (though the player flies) the ambition I feel was to tell a simple visual story with the added elements of a puzzle game.  As a puzzle game the visual clues found in the book are a bit difficult to understand but the story is "age-old" of when a boy and a girl meet and fall in love.\n\nBiggest review complaint is about an achievement called "Tree of Dreams".  To gain this achievement the player must fly back and forth across the whole landscape (day and night) looking for semi-translucent puzzle pieces, a type of mini-game.  A bit tedious but doable.  No offense intended to Mr. Jonsson but I am glad he steered away from actual puzzle elements in his later games.  His later endeavors are still beautiful art pieces but focus more on the tale being told then gimmicky puzzles.  (Since I own all of this developer's work I do feel I have a little right to comment on an artist's growth in a difficult medium.)\n\nThe artwork is very pretty and the music soothing.  If one enjoys this artist's work Meadowland is must for the collection.","May 8","true","6.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Game can progress as quickly or slowly as you want.  A nice slow-paced relaxing game - the end is a little bubble bursting for my taste.

There's about 15-30 minutes of gameplay, and it's not entirely terrible, but if you want to get all the achievements, there are two that will prove difficult, if not impossible:\n\n1. Tree of Dreams. After you've played the game in its entirety, there are puzzle pieces that you have to find. The problem is that they appear randomly, vanish after several seconds, and are very hard to see. The main problem is the sheer amount of puzzle pieces. I have 2 hours in this game as of this review, and 20 minutes are from playing the game, and the rest are from flying back and forth, back and forth, back and forth looking for the pieces. For such a small game, there are WAY too many of these pieces. It's mind-numbing, and I still haven't even found all the pieces yet. I've collected maybe 30? 40? And it looks like I need about 10 more.\n\n2. The Star Creator. This achievement appears to be bugged in that it unlocks randomly for random people, on random nights of the game...if at all. I have yet to unlock it, despite performing the required action pretty much in every spot available.\n\nThere has been a discussion about this achievement in the community hub for months, but no signs of the dev updating the game. As it stands right now, the frustration of getting the puzzle pieces, and the bugged Star Creator achievement would make me advise achievement hunters against getting this game.","August 14, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
