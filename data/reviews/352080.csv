The classic Fantasy Flight CYOA books are certainly fun, but Tin Man's own work on the Gamebook Adventures series just blows them away.\n\nSo when Tin Man is up to write a Judge Dredd CYOA gamebook, well, I'm interested. And it's a fun ride.\n\nIt's well written, a non-stop action ride of you busting perps, shooting culprits, and sticking people in the iso cubes. I know nothing about Judge Dredd and I still slid right in to this crazy universe. Worth it if you like CYOA gamebooks. If you don't want to throw dice at punks all day, you may want to move elsewhere.\n\nThe dice rolling gets a little intense; the game ends up almost a survival run at times and a few hits of crappy rolls can put a damper on your law giving career. Still, you have all the bookmarks you need and can "nudge" the dice a bit here and there with the physics engine so it is certainly not difficult to clear at all.\n\nAlso every time you succeed on an Authority check, you are told "YOU ARE THE LAW."\n\nThe story itself is largely a day in the life of Judge Dredd. A non-stop series of crimes and situations to investigate crimes and arrest punks, ranging from the straightforward to the imaginative. A few overarching plots play out depending on the order you investigate and the final battle is always the same (Thankfully, all the parts you need to win the final battle are doled out relatively close to the end and are logically sound choices. None of the Forest of Doom style nonsense where going left or right locks you out of the ending.). And yet the writing is quite nice all the same.","April 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","36","47","6","0"

I am not a native english speaker so i need more time then average. This is very little content for the asked price. The gameplay mechanics are quite boring. The overall story is without spoilers just average. Nothing like the epicness of amazing Judge Dredd stories like 'The Cursed Earth' or Children of the Judge, Judge America, Block Wars, Apocalypse. I am not compelled to play it again, so it has no replay value for me at all. The RPG mechanics are just very light. Atmosphere I did not feel like being the dreadfull Judge Dredd on patrol in Mega-City One. More like a police cop in modern USA. The place should feel much bigger and intimidating. There are too few illustrations for a comic adaption. It could have been much better with more pictures to illustrate things going on.\n\nHave a nice day.","April 23, 2015","false","1.8"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","0"

The Judge Dredd. Out on a routine patrol. Well that’s what you thought though you quickly realize after you get your hands on the first ’Voices of Dredd’ something bigger is going on.\n\nAnd that’s as much as I’m gonna spoil the story. The story unfolds itself after every page and knowing too much about it would be the same as knowing to the story to a book you’re about to read.\n\nJudge Dredd: Countdown Sector 106 is a Gamebook Adventure meaning you won’t rush in with guns blazing and scream ’I am the Law!’. Well actually the latter will happen quite often which I greatly enjoy and I still chuckle a bit every now and then. But that might just be me.\nAnyway.\n\nSo you might wonder how in the world are you now supposed to bring Justice to the streets of Mega-City One?\nFear not! Justice will be served in form of D6!\n\nYes that’s right folks instead of shooting each and every Juve you have to roll dices. You have to make Authority, Shoot Out, Random Rolls and several others. Which actually make this game quite exciting since you never know what you’ll roll. Besides that you have to make decisions which will impact the further Story in one way or another.\nDid you decide to upgrade your Lawgiver, your trusty gun, or did you take a well deserved nap after your 72 hours shift? It’s choices like this that gives the game actually some replay value.\n\nDon’t forget it’s a Gamebook Adventure and that means lots of reading. Does that mean it’s bad? Well certainly not but it’s not a game for everyone. Also there’s a lot of decision making. You can play this game at your own pace and carefully decide which option would be best or if you’re a fan of the Judge and actually have some knowledge about the Comics you could go ahead and serve Justice like he would.\n\nDespite all your countless efforts of preparing and picking the right decisions at the right time you still have to face the big ol’ evil: RNG.\nThough the game gives you some base stats at the beginning and you’ll just have to add  your D6 rolls to your stats in order to either hit or get hit.\n\nAfter all you are Judge, Jury and Executioner.\n\nSo that’s pretty much it folks!\n\nIt’s now up to you to decide whether or not this game would be your cup of tea.\nAll I can say is despite going in blind and actually not thinking too highly of it ...\nI really enjoyed the game so far. It’s just something else and It really does deserve it’s place in this ever growing World.","May 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","25","33","0","2"

If you explore too much the timer in the game goes off and a nuke kills you\n\n-The writing is flimsy and there are a number of grammar mistakes throughout.\n\n-Being Judge Dredd I wanted to feel like a badass at times. You never really do.\n\n-Very little replay value.\n\n-Combat can be very annoying and repetitive, especially when you simply block their attack, they block yours,you block theirs, they block yours etc. One encounter took over 3 minutes to kill one person in melee.\n\nI did enjoy my time in Megacity One, and if this game was a little bit cheaper, maybe 5-7 dollars, it would be a very good pickup. But for the time and money you spend on this game, you're better off waiting for it to go on sale.","April 23, 2015","false","2.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qrter/recommended/352080/","qrter","qrter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qrter/","1702 products in account","I grew up in the early Nineties, on a steady diet of 2000 AD comics (breeding pit of the Judge Dredd universe) and various kinds of gamebooks, so this game certainly hits the sweet spot for me.\n\nBeyond obvious nostalgia, the game works on its own merits. There is no great, epic over-arching story here, but the game should be seen more as a collection of short stories - this form actually makes it perfect to present Mega City One as it was portrayed in the original comics: a chaotic mix of violence, insanity and over the top social commentary and parody.\n\nMechanically, it still is essentially a gamebook - lots of reading, dice rolls, and choices to make. If the idea of reading and playing a gamebook doesn't appeal to you, this game probably won't change your mind. The game ofcourse makes the dice rolls for you, and there are moments when the dice rolling can get a bit confusing (what number you're supposed to hit, for example, isn't always clear) - then again, the game handles all that stuff for you anyway.\n\nThe game isn't narrated, although Dredd does pipe up with a pithy one-liner now and then (mostly when arresting or killing a perp).\n\nI'd say the game works both as an introduction to the world of Dredd, and offers enough for those of us already familiar with it.","April 27, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoasterIX/recommended/352080/","CoasterIX","Coaster IX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoasterIX/","570 products in account","This game supremely succeeds at capturing the "attitude" of the classic AD2000 stories, and especially Judge Dredd himself. It is always satisfying to hand out ridiculous punishment for the slightest infractions. Really made me feel like "I Am The Law." Plus, it has a much larger supporting cast than you get with either movie, which gives you more insight into the depraved denizens of Mega City One, and why a man like Judge Dredd is necessary there.\n\nI know a lot of people sour on the idea of a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel as a game, but I have to say I really see it as an improvement over the original format. I used to play these games when they were printed in these outdated things called "books." It was terrible. You had to waste time looking for the right pages, there was the constant threat of spoilers if you saw something while flipping through, and you were always at risk of life-threatening paper cuts. This digital format eliminates all that and gets right to the storytelling.\nPlus it adds in ambient music to help enhance the mood over what you'd get from a book.\nOn top of that, gamebooks like this needed dice, and I always used to read them in a place that was unsuited for rolling dice, like my big comfy chair - so the dice never had anywhere to lie flat. With the digital format, that's no longer a concern. It's great.\nAdd onto there Steam achievements and trading cards, and you've got yourself a fun couple of hours.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Judge Dredd, cyperpunk worlds, choose-your-own-adventures, or just immersive writing.","May 14, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
