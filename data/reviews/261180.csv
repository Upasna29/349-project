"http://steamcommunity.com/id/y2f/recommended/261180/","y2f","YinYin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/y2f/","38 products in account","As a projectile fighting game Lethal Leagues core is simple: hit your opponent with a ball to score and ultimately win a match.\nYou can try a bare bones prototype on reptile games' website to see if you like that concept.\nLike many other recent small competitive games this one challenges the player with high risk&reward as a single hit from the ball is a knock out. Although if you or your team hit the ball last it won't harm you.\nThe intense fun of this game starts to kick in once you've hit the ball back and forth a few times, ever increasing its speed to ridiculously high levels (speedometer at the bottom on the boombox). Normal hits only increase the ball speed by 1, charged hits and smashes however double the speed. With more speed the hit lag will increase, the screen will shake, the background will change, intense visual effects will ripple across the screen and the characters will throw catchy phrases at each other as they hit the ball. Next to jumping and swinging you can also bunt the ball to slightly decrease the speed and carefuly set up your next attack.\nThe movement mechanics are very solid. You can move right and left as you jump, you can tap for a short hop or hold to jump higher and stay in the air longer as well as press down to fall faster.\nThe selectable characters two major mechanic differences are their method of gaining height (high jump, wall jump, double jump, wall ride, ...) and their special move, which can be activated with a full special bar (builds up by hitting the ball).\n\nNext to online and local multiplayer with up to 4 people there is also a single player challenge with 10 increasingly difficult stages to beat in sequence and in local multiplayer there are 7 levels of AI difficulty with the highest one still being a challenge even if you are already very good at the game - although not as engaging as a good human player will probably be.\n\nAnd it's a damn lot of fun.\nRaced to the top of my most played game ever list during beta testing.","August 27, 2014","true","672.6"," 419 of 445 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","419","445","6","7"

Only a few required minimal key binding.\nGameplay itself is of the "simple to pick up, hard to master" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of "epic moments" for all your friends to hype about.\nNot much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.\n\nI personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.\nBoss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.\n\nIf my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is "too simple", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.\n\nIn the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.\n\nIf I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.\n\n"I am terrible at this game.\n\n10/10  Would noob rage again."","August 29, 2014","true","98.0"," 119 of 126 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","119","126","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/261180/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","Lethal League is a 2D fighting game, but unlike traditional fighting games you don’t use fists or kicks or any kind of combat moves. You pick a character and hit an anti-gravity ball against your opponents to beat them, the ball speeds up and bounces harder off the walls with every hit it takes, reaching unbelievably fast speeds - particularly when one charges the hit. All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball. Once all your lives run out you’re done, and the round ends when there’s only one player left in the game.\n\n\nPros:\n++++ The game is good fast-paced fun, the latency is very comfortable.\n+++ The audio and visual aspects are very befitting of each other, especially the effects and art style.\n+++ Music is awesome, fits perfectly with the battle atmosphere.\n++++ Hitting the ball feels solid, firm – making for immersive projectile battles.\n++ Different modes: FFA, TEAM DEATHMATCH\n+++ Different characters make for different moves/special moves.\n+++++ ”No weak ♥♥♥♥.”\n\n\nBittersweet:\n-/+ Gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get good at, practice makes perfect and provides hours of fun.\n-/+ Speed cap for the ball is ridiculously high, might as well be infinite which makes for difficult but impressive moments.\n-/+ Limited player choice, however they are very stylish and have different colour schemes.\n-/+ Player base has cool people, but it’s not very big.\n\n\nCons:\n-Not really anything negative about the game, if I had to name something it would be the lack of characters and small community.\n\n\n\nFinal Opinion:\nAll in all this game is addictive, exhilarating and a massive amount of fun. It’s as if Super Smash Bros, Pong, and whichever traditional 2D fighting game you can think of had a baby. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Art style, music and gameplay go perfectly well together for an amazing fighting experience.","March 14, 2015","true","2.7"," 103 of 110 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","103","110","3","2"

While it was certainly that, I never expected to get so deep into (what I deemed as) a "party game."\n\nThe online community is fantastically rich- Just hop in the group chat, and you're bound to find a match with someone of whatever skill you're looking for, or someone to help practice a specific tactic, or just some casual FFA fun. There are tournaments hosted every weekend, and virtually everyone in the community is a blast to talk to.\n\nBut the game itself has a depth I have never seen before- I have over 100 hours logged of high-skill matches and tournaments, and I am still finding new strategies and mechanics to use. My current repertoire is even missing two mechanics that I know, and with those two, there are plenty of uses I haven't even thought of.\n\nThe depth is incredible. The community is great.

It's like being put in a racquetball room with dodgeball rules. The ball can get to ludicrous speeds! But if there is any lag at all whatsoever, it will be difficult to achieve.\n\nThere's a baller OST (not many songs though), a nice variety of stages, mostly aesthetic, but still provide a variety in size and significant difference with candyman's special--and a handful of characters with subtle but important differences in their traits.\n\nI highly recommend this game as it is online play, amazing with friends and absurdly addicting for such short matches!\n\nI hope there will be a way to chat with opponents in the game, at LEAST in the lobby. You can not communicate to them not to start a match because you are waiting for more people or if you want them to ready up for the game.\n\n9/10","November 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 73 of 75 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","73","75","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzu51/recommended/261180/","uzu51","Uzu [Idling]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzu51/","1304 products in account","This game is the perfect example of how you simplify a fighting game to its roots while maintaining all the depth and metagame intact.\n\nLethal League is a 3 button game (Hit, jump, stall/counter) where your goal is to hit your opponent with a ball, the ball builds speed with each hit and you have to be in the proper position to hit it back to your opponent while trying to not get hit by it.\n\nThere's a limited roster of characters but all of them are very unique, no character plays exactly the same which makes every matchup very fun.\n\nThis game also has a superb sountrack and an amazing netcode (GGPO) with up to 4 player online multiplayer.\n\nThis is one of the most fun games i've played in a really long time, however there is a huge con to all of this, the game's asking price is $13.99 USD...\n\nSure, that isn't much, right? it's the price of "X" or "Y" so it's not a big deal yadda yadda. However the game is truly lacking on the SP content, there's only a mode where you play against the CPU and a pretty barebones "Challenge mode" (Arcade mode) so there really isn't much outside of playing it against other people and even thought that's the main point of fighting games there's so many other games (Skullgirls, KOF) that at least cover a bare minimum of a Story Mode and a proper Arcade mode while also having very good tutorials (Skullgirls) and really good challenge modes (KOF Trials) both which have been in multiple sales for less than half the price of this game.\n\nThe game is virtually dead on arrival, very much like Divekick (Even though Lethal League is incredibly better on every single aspect). It's almost impossible to find an online match because no one really is playing it and the price tag does not help the situation and it's a HUGE shame, because this could've been a smash hit that everyone would be talking about.\n\nBottom line, this is one of the best fighting games you could ever play if you're either a veteran or a beginner, but i can't recommend this to everybody because the current price tag is not really justified, wait for a sale and buy it, maybe then more people will be playing it after they discover how amazing this game is.","September 2, 2014","true","7.2"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","6"

Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKblaXVby5A&feature=youtu.be\n\nHISTORY\n\nReleased in August 2014 and developed by Team Reptile and based off the flash game prototype bearing the same name, it’s Lethal League!\nAs of this review the game is on version 1.07.12\n\nSTORY AND WHAT YOU DO\n\nIn Lethal League with no real context or story, you play as up to 6 different playable characters who face off against each other in an arena in up 4 players at once, the goal simply being to hit the ball at one another to knock them out.\n\nWith each consecutive hit to the ball, it gains speed, which can make things very interesting, very fast.\n\nThe game also has a number of different modes from online, to versus, to an extra menu with different things such as a tutorial, training mode, as well as the challenge mode which basically acts as the core single player aspect to the game itself.\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n-Quick and easy to pick up and play gameplay\n-Addicting\n-Different game modes and options to choose from\n-Competitive and great multiplayer\n\nRight off the BAT pun intended, one of the best aspects to Lethal League is the pick up and play nature of the game itself, it’s easy to learn and you’ll be smashing your opponents in no time flat, the game features an easy to learn tutorial to help new comers out, but the concept itself is pretty easy to wrap your head around.\n\nIt’s also extremely addicting, the first time me and my friends started playing this together we couldn’t stop, the quick matches and nature of the game itself lends to the addiction factor big time and it works beautifully.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly unique, almost reminding of pong on steroids with a gorgeous art style and blazing soundtrack to boast its intensity, the game is easy to play, but definitely takes some serious skill and good timing to master it.\n\nBut easily the BEST aspect to Lethal League is the online multiplayer, whether you’re in a team or free for all, Lethal League truly shines when you’re pitted against your friends as you battle it out and make the ball reach absolute insane levels of speed.\n\nYou’ve also got access to a variety of different game options if you’re hosting, from changing the speed of the ball itself when you hit it, to a big ball mode, team versus matches, free for all, and a mode where you basically have to hit the opposing team’s target at each end of the map to gain points.\n\nThe character roster as well all have their own unique abilities as well to mix things up, and you unlock different skins for them as you progress the game and earn “experience” allowing you to level up and unlock the different skins for them and overall really adds to the addictive nature and replayability of the game.\n\nOver all, we had TONS of fun playing this for hours on end and is easily one of the best competitive games I’ve played in recent memory.\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n-Few core game modes to choose from (not much content) *Minor*\n\nHonestly I don’t have much to talk about here, Lethal League does what it does very well, I had no major issues or never felt something was unfair or over powered and the game is very well balanced.\n\nProbably the only issue I have is the lack of content, despite just talking about the different game modes to choose from, Lethal League outside of what I mentioned doesn’t offer much for core game modes.\n\nIf you’re looking for some beefy single player content, you won’t really find it here, sure you’ve got a versus mode where you can pit yourself against the PC at different difficulty settings, as well as a challenge mode that you can beat with each character to gain some achievements but honestly this felt nowhere near as compelling or interesting as the multiplayer.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, once you’ve played as each specific character, and played the different maps and fiddled around with the match settings a bit, you’ve pretty much seen everything this game has to offer you.\nBut to be honest, this is all pretty minor and I can easily see myself coming back to play this.\n\n\n\nTHE UGLY\n-Not graphically impressive, it’s quite literally based off a flash game after all\n-What it lacks in graphical fidelity it more than makes up for it in art style\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-Odd game crash during multiplayer\n\nWhere we discuss the graphics, soundtrack, and technical aspect of the game.\nLethal League won’t wow you in the sense with amazing textures and particle effects like some games might, which is obvious considering the game looks like something you could find on Newgrounds.\n\nBut what it will wow you with is the fabulous art style it boasts, from the different scenic backgrounds, to the character models and general presentation, what Lethal League lacks in big budget impressive graphics, it more than makes up for in its amazing art style and presentation.\nAnd one thing that really adds to this is the AMAZING soundtrack, this is easily one of the best sound tracks I’ve listened to in a game in a long time, the art style and soundtrack over all give me almost a Jet Set Radio vibe, and I love it.\n\nHowever, not everything is perfect, we did have our fair number of freezing issues during online matches, as well as the odd game crash or two in my 5 or so hours I’ve spent with Lethal League, but overall the gameplay itself was bug free during our experience and most of the crashes and freezing were during the online match making.\n\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAs I said earlier this is probably the most fun I’ve had yet so far with any indie game and I highly recommend you give Lethal League a try if you’ve got some friends looking for a fun, unique, and competitive game, despite some minor technical issues we had, playing this was an absolute blast.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 10, 2015","true","5.3"," 44 of 56

Very fun to play with friends or on local co-op. Gets more and more intense as the round goes on and both parties are screaming their asses off as the balls pierces the fabric of the earth\n\nEXPLENATION: Its a fighting game where the player chooses their select character each with its own special ability that is more or less balanced. The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at. All while a kickass soundtrack plays in the background. Definetly a fun game although I wish more people played online :(","December 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","28","32","3","0"

Every time you hit the ball it will increase it's speed/velocity, and hitting it in a certain way doubles the speed, so it will become more and more challenging and hard to hit the ball.\n\nAlso, this deserves a notice of its own, the online playing is amazingly smooth, just fantastic. Hard to notice any lag.\n\nPersonally, I'm loving the game, and i think it's well worth it, but it's basically match after match playing against 1 to 3 other opponents. there is a ladder challenge single player mode which will get harder and harder the more levels you finish, with some changes like going against a huge boss character, or the ball being huge. That's what's in the game, and if you think that's not enough to make you jump and get the game, then wait for a sale, but if you want to go by my opinion, i think it's well worth it for the fun and challenging experience you will get from it.\n\nMore info here[www.ksalue.com]","August 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garganator/recommended/261180/","garganator","Kejmur - AFK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garganator/","3691 products in account","There are many games which have multiplayer mode and only a number of them ends up as global hits which are played by lots of players and in which connection issues are rarity or aren't issues at all. While this game isn't this kind of title yet, I need to say this game is a little gem which should shine really bright in near future. But let's start from the beginning.\n\nLethal League is a game where your main goal is to control ball and hit it as hard as possible to hurt your opponents and knock them down, while also using unique techniques limited to each of playable characters. Sounds simple, right ? But I assure you it's not that easy, especially when the movement with which ball move after few hits may reach RIDICULOUS speed and hitting the ball itself (or counter it by pressing X which is a kind of a block which stops the movement of it) may be a really tough challenge. This game will test your dexterity, reaction time and timing, which are really crucial here. So in other words I would call this title easy to learn (it's literally jump, hit and block buttons), but hard to fully master.\n\nGraphics are as simple as in screenshots, but I need to say they are still estethic and look nice with bright colors mixed in (I also like in overall the style game brings with interesting characters). And I need to mention one more thing, which is really, REALLY crucial - music. My gosh, music in this one is one of the best things I heard in gaming history. Electronic climates created by really talented artists like Grillo, zeroSCAR or Klaus Veen fits the climate of the game perfectly, while being perfectly well made. I would say music alone in this game make this game worth to purchase, it's THAT good.\n\nTo sum it up game is really well made flash-like game with incredible competitive potential. Game basics are simple to learn, but this game has this crucial element, which make it fun, challenging and mostly work like some sort of a drug, which forces you to play it as much as you can. I give it 9,5/10 as I feel 5 characters is kind of a small numbers of possible options if you ask me. But I assure you - this one will become one of the best gaming hits ever. At least it has great potential to become one.","August 29, 2014","true","35.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MentalFly/recommended/261180/","MentalFly","Shffl | N64","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MentalFly/","322 products in account","Game is fun!\n\nI've seen many call this game "Smash Brothers meets Pong" and that's roughly correct. Lethal League is similar to Smash titles in its ease of access (being pretty simple to understand and play) and its competitive depth. Its similar to Pong in being focused around the ball, the one lethal element of the game. You and your opponent(s) are striving to hit this ball, tagging it to yourself and making it lethal to your opponent until they successfully hit it back (or miss, get hit, and die). The ball will steadily speed up after every hit as long as players remain alive, ramping up the intensity. Continue this until all but one player have lost all their lives, and only the champion remains!\n\nLocal and online multiplayer are supported, with 2-4 players. You can play 1v1, FFA, teams, or strikers (similar to soccer) modes. There are a couple different ball types you can try as well to mix things up, along with general options (stock count, time limit, etc.) There is matchmaking, but it's not skill-based (the community isn't large enough to support skill-based matchmaking anyways).\n\nThe game is great if you want to just hit buttons and peg your friends with baseballs, and also great if you're looking for something with competitive depth. While the execution barrier is fairly low, you have a lot of freedom of movement/options, and the smarter and more experienced player is still favored to win. Regardless, the game does a great job of hypeing the player up, as hits take progressively longer to complete as the ballspeed increases (giving the feeling of them putting more and more force into the ball), and the screen starts to shake, the background changes, 'impact distortions' occur, all the colors go negative, characters get speed afterimages, and finally the stage goes completely white if you get the ballspeed up enough. Each notch of this progressively makes things more intense, especially the first time you see them!\n\nThe only drawbacks to me of this game is the playerbase size and occasional crashes. This game has seen occasional boons in playerbase (usually following sales), but on average there's about 60-100 people playing at a time. Games go fairly quick, and you usually won't be waiting more than a minute in quickmatch queue (at least during peak EU and NA hours), but you may run into the same people multiple times. What you don't have in quantity, though, you do have in quality. There's almost always a few people in the group chat willing to play, and many are experienced players who are welcoming and helpful. The competitive LL community is, overall, one of the best communities I've been in.\n\nThe other drawback is a recurring crash that can occur in multiplayer games of more than 2 people. This only occurs maybe once every 6-7 games, but it can get annoying fairly quick. Fortunately, the game loads almost instantly, so getting back in the action is fast. It's annoying but manageable.\n\nI highly suggest you try this game out, especially if you have friends to play it with. $15 may be a bit expensive for some (it was well worth it for me, 450 hours of play and counting), but I would definitely recommend this to anyone at $10 or less.","December 30, 2014","true","876.9"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","0"

Excellent sense of depth hidden in simple mechanics. When you start out it seems fairly simple like the prototype, but the bunts, supers, and character movement really make the game engaging as time goes on.\nFor example Sonata feels extremely weak early on because of her slow hitting motion and jumps. These are offset by the best early super which is you can get easily while staying high in the air and getting free hits in. Candyman's strengths are obvious with his portal super grabbing easy games off of weaker players but tends to not be as powerful as players get better. Raptor has solid movement and has one of the best late game supers by (fully?) removing the hit stop animation making it sometimes impossible to hit back. Switch seems to be a mid game character with fast movement and his super which redirects the ball. His super has some good potential to net kills fast but becomes much harder to use later in the game. Latch is an all game character with the most broken super which can almost always guarantee kills after 128 speed.\nThe only problem is the online which suffers from is lack of players for non-American/European people. The entire time spent writing this review I have been sitting in queue and still haven't found a game. If you don't have local friends to play with or a tournament scene for this you might not have the best time with this game.","August 30, 2014","true","4.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.\n\nThe gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.\n\nThat long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.\n\nTeam Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that…specialness.\n\nFrom a developer’s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it. So get it, you won’t be disappointed.\n\n3 / 3 Worth Playing\n\n-C\n","August 31, 2014","true","5.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Perhaps dodgeball? Or baseball? No doubt they would take things to a new extreme, with smashes that break the laws of physics and reaction speeds at mere fractions of milliseconds.\n\nLethal League is a little like that. Imagine Super Smash Brothers but on PC and instead of fighting, you're essentially playing dodgeball in a fairly small arena. Things can get real chaotic, but boy is it fun!\n\nGameplayLethal League combines sport, with a highly competitive and slightly strategic game that requires you to have good timing, or a good understanding of angles. This does not mean it's a math or physics game. It simply means Lethal League has an extremely high skill ceiling whilst having a very low barrier to entry. Anyone can pick this up with their friends or play vs bots and have a really great time, and those with the best reaction times can duke it out for the top spots.\n\nYour goal is to eliminate all your opponents, by hitting the ball into them. The standard game mode allows you to tag the ball which puts it in your colour and makes it pass through you (so that you don't hit yourself). You can also disable ball tagging for a much more challenging experience. Each time you hit the ball, it goes a little faster. You can hit it up or down depending on whether you are in the air or on the ground. If you smash a ball (air hit) the ball speed is doubled. Now this is where the real fun comes in. If you manage to get 3 or more smashes in, the ball speed is going to ramp up so fast that it quickly becomes a blur of lines in various angles. This is where a knowledge of angles can help you to overcome your opponent.\n\nThe maximum speed seems to be capped at 1 million. As you break through known speed limits, your hits gradually have a longer delay but the ball speed is so fast that it becomes ALMOST impossible to react to it. You're likely going to struggle with this until you learn the timing windows for various hits, and it is oh so satisfying to counter a ball ping-ponging across the room at over 100,000 (whatever the speed measurement is) into your opponent.\n\nYou can also bunt the ball in various directions, temporarily slowing it down and allowing you to regain control and possibly change its direction. This is used in combination with regular hits to quickly rack up speed or pull off an unexpectedly fast smash, because bunting a ball reduces the delay on a hit (even the insanely fast ones that require 2-4 seconds of delay) to almost nothing.\n\nCharacters\nThere are 6 characters to choose from and each of them have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Some of them can jump higher than others, some can jump off walls indefinitely etc. This alone would make it fun, however the devs decided this is not enough so they added special abilities. Where do I even begin? Special abilities can drastically change the course of a match in an instant! By hitting the ball you gain charges of your special meter. At 4 charges you can use the ability by double tapping the regular hitting button. Each character has their own unique move that you'll discover on your own, and it adds so much more fun to the game along with previously mentioned elements.\n\nVisualsThe visual style of this game is unique, but still quite simple. Characters have some lovely color variations and stages are fairly well designed.\n\nAudioI absolutely love the music in this game, as well as the other assorted sounds in the game. When you break the sound barrier, the hit sounds are so impactful and sound like rockets or small bombs going off.\n\nOther ThoughtsRunning at 60 FPS is pretty much required to be able to learn your timings properly. The first time I ran the game, it had some very weird frame drops that may have been an issue on my side, but it initially turned me off from the game. However subsequent play sessions did not have that issue, so it must have been some other unrelated issue. The game is very lightweight and runs flawlessly.\n\nI would have liked to see more characters in the game, as 6 is hardly a roster of characters compared to other games in this kind of genre. I mean not even the Scout from TF2? That's an iconic character that would have been perfect here.\n\nSummaryLethal League is the type of game you can pick up at any time and play with friends. Even as a solo player, you'll find that the bots are quite challenging, and there's enough single player content to keep you interested for even a couple days. The gamplay is fun and rewarding, and is definitely worth checking out if you're interested in a fun, fast, sport-action game.\n\n8/10 - The game that destroys friendships\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets.\n\nWhat sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of "Oh ♥♥♥♥!" moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.\n\nThrow in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.\n\nWould reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun.","August 29, 2014","true","13.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The music is set to a single, level-specific track, but the playlist is pretty good and matches the atmosphere of the game. The special effects are fantastic, and the background will even turn completely white once you achieve ball speeds nearing 1 million.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn, but mastering them will take a bit of time. The practice is great for getting you familiarized with the gameplay mechanics, and there are many well-written guides available to teach you the advanced techniques. You can play with a controller, and I personally prefer this over the keyboard. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, the most challenging thing being how quickly you can understand the timing mechanic.\n\nThe main goal in Lethal League is to hit your opponent with the ball. By default setting, you cannot get hit by the ball if you've hit it last (indicated by the ball's outline matching your assigned color). If a ball is "tagged" with your color, it will pass through you and any allies, however, you can also hit it again. Each time you hit the ball, it's speed will increase and your special gauge will fill up by one bar (to a total of 4). Bunting the ball and hitting it before it touches a surface will fill your special meter by 2 (and serves other purposes). A bunted ball will have a pinkish outline, indicating that it is a "free" ball - anyone can hit it, and it is not hostile to any player until it is hit. When a burst (round) is over, the first player to have been knocked out in the previous round will have possession of the ball, indicated by a matching outline around it. After a few seconds, however, it will lose it's outline, allowing anyone to hit it.\n\nAt higher speeds, hitting the ball will cause a hit lag animation, where your character will stay in one spot to charge up, then release the ball. During this time, all other characters can move around to try to position to hit or dodge the ball. There is a mirrored ball-release gauge at the bottom center of the screen, which is a critical tool to use - it will show you how long you have before the ball is released from the hit lag animation. Traditionally, at slow speeds, the gauge will fill up super fast. Bunting is important because a successful hit following one will shorten the ball-release gauge time. The different characters telegraph their moves, so bunting during a long rally (back-and-forth hits) can really help you throw off people's reaction time if they're expecting you to hit a ball immediately back at them.\n\nEach character has a unique special, and many of them allow you to do things like bypass the ball-release gauge time (causing the ball to be released regardless of the gauge status), redirect the ball's trajectory (especially dangerous when people have positioned in an angle to catch the ball), or even curve the ball (super awesome trick shot potential). One character has a special that allows the ball to phase through the map (so instead of bouncing, it will continue through and appear on the opposite side). The characters also differ in playstyle, and you will notice things like quicker hits for some, higher jumps, longer hit range, etc. One character, Sonata, can double jump. Raptor, who cannot double jump and has a fairly short vertical range, compensates for this by being able to wall hang and wall jump. Latch can, well, latch onto the wall, moving up and down freely.\n\nIf you and an opponent swing at each other at the same time, you will clash, pushing each other backwards and stun-locking you for a few seconds. This is especially dangerous if you are stun-locked by an opponent who just finished hitting the ball forward because it will instantly hit you. This game really rewards skill and patience - if you just spam the hit/bunt button, you will get hit by the fall often because it takes time for each character to recover from the hit/bunt animation, leaving you vulnerable. You can even do something as face the wrong way, and will meet a sudden (temporary) death.\n\nThere is a singleplayer challenge mode you can do, which has the same opponents regardless of which character you pick, and a unique boss match. The game's AI is fairly challenging, and at times seems to randomly turn up to a "destroy all hope in the human opponent" rating. There are other variants to play, like a score attack (versus stock), and a team scoring game where you have to hit a target on the opposite side (you cannot hit each other in this mode).\n\nOverall, the game is extremely fun, and will be enjoyed by people who like projectile-based fighting.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","December 6, 2014","true","12.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Sounds too simple to be fun, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nMy friend and I bought this game as a bit of a joke but ended up playing it for hours. I had raw fun while playing this, the kind that you experience only rarely in quality indie titles like Hotline Miami, Skullgirls, etc.\n\nWith 2-3 different game modes, 6 characters, and 7 maps this game is quite small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in strength. The characters are unique, with mildly entertaining special moves for each of them. The maps each have their own music (The music is surprisingly good in this game). The most interesting aspect of the game is the D-pad+Y shout out. You can taunt, or interact, with your opponent by stating,"Oops", "Wow", "Nice", and "Bring it on". The tricky part of the game is the ball speed. As you paddle back and forth the ball speed will increase and you'll have to be much more instinctive about your response times. I saw an achievement for 1,000,000 ball speed. My friend and I have only gotten to 1,000.\n\nIs it a good game? Yes. Is it worth $10-$14?

Welp. This game is GREAT. Lethal League is a unique fighting time that's pretty much based on timing. You must hit the ball in time so your opponent doesn't kill you. You're basically playing ball tag with your opponent. You try to hit the ball to each other and whoever hits too early or doesn't pay attention will get hit and die. I'm kinda bad at explaining this so maybe it doesn't sound like the funnest game, but trust me ITS FUN! You know one thing I really like about this game? Call me a f*cking casualist if you want, but, ya know, it takes more Rythm than skill. This game you can ACTUALLY WIN without hours and hours of experience. Unlike Skullgirls, where you need to watch sh*t to learn combos or take hours to learn on your own or even been born in the 80s playing fighters at da arcade. The thing is about Skullgirls, if you go in online with a couple hours of play, you'll get the sh*t beat out of you. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not really a fan of arcade fighters. My issue with dem arcade fighters is the crazy ♥♥♥ combos you have to make to do powerful attacks. But, anyway yea. BUY LETHAL LEAGUE!!!

Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.\n\nThis simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.\n\nIf I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.\n\nThis games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).

He points his stout towards the object, knowing that he's going to smash this into my cold, yellow face. Not today, Latch. Not today.\n\nThe ball materializes and we rush towards it. My cane is already extended for an over the head smash to hit the reptilian foe below me. Time seems to stop as I connect with the latent power resting within the ball. The crocodile was quick to react and seemed to stop all momentum I had with my initial hit with one tap of his nose. The ball soared over me, and before I connected with the ground the crocodile was already rallying the ball against a wall, hoping to power up another devastating blow.\n\nI rush to intervene in his sadistic wall-ball ritual, tapping the ball out of his rhythm at an upwards angle. Furious, Latch's eyes glowed red towards the cane that brought an end to his games. He claws the wall in front of him and begins to climb up its structure to catch up to the ball. Flipping outwards, he catches the ball in his mouth and my world goes dark. All I can see is the crocodile's burning descent from the wall, his eyes reflecting my helpless yellow face.\n\nI jump upwards to dodge the assult, but Latch releases the saliva-covered ball angled with precision towards my jump peak. The counter at the bottom reads into the hundreds, and I know that reflecting this is going to take all the luck in my thin smiley-faced bones. My cane relexively reaches in defense, and this was all the luck I needed. The ball's momentum is reversed right at the crocodile's pointed nose. But what stops him from doing exactly what I just did?\n\nI try to land a second hit and throw Latch off his prediction. He sees this and attempts to outsmart my own moves. We negate each other's attacks with a twang of cane and stout, the ball landing just behind Latch. I see it bounce off the corners of the rotting arena with bliding speed, and I process that it's coming right back at me. Cane out, I bunt the ball directly downwards into where the crocodile attempts another intervention. His tail whips around, but he is too early.\n\nThe ball lightly bounces off the top of his scaly skull, and he's sent below the arena.\n\nBURST 2, BEGIN!","August 31, 2014","true","11.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabata2/recommended/261180/","sabata2","sabata2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabata2/","243 products in account","Verdict: BUY. THIS. NOW.\nOverviewI'm not one for Fighting games. I never could get those complicated button combos down.\nI liked Super Smash Bros. in the first two iterations, but from Brawl on it just felt like... something was missing.\nAnd while I like the simplicity of games like Dive Kick, the limitations on the controls limit my interaction with the game itself and thus my investment.\n\nThis game is like all three rolled up into one perfect dodgeball.\nThe mind games and opponent prediction of a fighting game is all there, and immensely gratifying.\nThe controls are simple move, jump, hit, and bunt, which are easy to learn but hard to master.\nEach fighter has their own special move and strike ranges, some of which are easier to pick up than others, but everyone has a ridiculous skill ceiling to reach. (Don't believe me? Play a few online matches and you'll see what I mean)\nAnd the chaos. Oh my GOD the chaos. Imagine Smash, but you're fighting 100 people at once, all of which with reflectable projectiles that one hit KO. There are hilarious times, frustrating times, intense times, but most of all fun times.\n\nThis game is essentially Pong, where your paddle has to swing, and can move around the entire map, losing a point only when it's struck.\nIt doesn't sound like much, but *everything* in this game is executed perfectly.\n\nI have roughly 5 games that I will recommend whole heartedly, because I believe they are perfect experiences.\nThis game has been in my library for about half a month, and it has been newly added to that list.\n\nMusicThe sound design, just force-feeds you adrenaline. Once the ball starts reaching hundreds of miles per hour you can feel the strength behind each swing with the crashing sound effects alone.\nEach stage has a unique song that just gets your heart pumping. Even in the oddball case of Candyman's "Ordinary Days", you focus a lot more simply because of the music and quite simply play better.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics look like something from the early 2000s.\nBut don't let that take away from the visual design. No it's not using 4k 2440p "oh my god I can see his nose mole" realistic graphics. It doesn't need them, and it is better for it. Each map is based around a character and provides a little more insight into their background WITH the background. And god forbid you reach ball speeds above the thousands... Let's just say, that's a trip.\n\nPlot(As of my writing this) There isn't much (if any) story presented to you through the multiplayer or the Challenge mode (though there is a final boss), but this game really doesn't need one.\nYou're playing this game to smack around your friends and strangers with thousand mile per hour dodge balls.\nReally, does it matter if there is no cosmic threat you have to defeat, or evil artifact you have to obtain? Hell no. Even if there was, you'd still smash their face in with the dodge ball all the same.\n\n\nFinal WordsWhy are you still reading this?

Great party game, simple yet deep gameplay, and great potential for mindgames and trickery at high levels of play once all the mechanics have been mastered. Be warned however, if you do not live in North America, South America or Europe you might struggle to find a game that isn't laggy if you venture into online multiplayer. If the lag passes a certain threshold, then a crash to the main menu is all but guaranteed. Trying to play too far outside of your continent's peak time (seems to be 8-10pm here in Europe) is an exercise in futility.\n\nPros:\n- Perfect controller support\n- Engaging, simple and deep gameplay.\n- The community is eager to teach each other tricks, timings, openers, etc, making the learning curve much easier if you ask for help.\n- Low skill floor, high skill ceiling.\n- Very challenging singleplayer challenge mode.\n- Singleplayer, multiplayer and local multiplayer modes.\n\nCons:\n- Lag can become a serious issue if playing with people from a different continent.\n- Tutorial leaves a lot to be desired. It misses one of the most important aspects of counter-play (the parry).\n- Does not allow you to set a resolution in windowed mode (my biggest gripe with the game).\n- Bots lack any non-essential movement (hitting corpses, moving back and forth to add extra visual noise, pre-positioning), making fights against them feel very static compared to players.\n- Matchmaking in its current incarnation does not put you into a lobby that has already played a game and has no 2v2 option, making organizing games via steam community chat much better than the "quick match" button.\n- No text chat in the lobby, making using the steam community chat even more vital.","September 1, 2014","true","93.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The longer you survive the more ridiculous it gets, to the point where I'm pretty sure I was hitting the ball at light speed. It was terrifying and hilarious. Especially since faster hits have weird visual effects on maps (like, on one map all the windows break, an eclipse happens, and rioting mobs appear.) that then vanish when the ball is no longer being hit. Its like youre ripping into an alternate dimension.\nI should mention that my first (and so far only) play session lasted two whole hours, but felt closer to 30 mins.\nSo, overall, pretty damn great.

(It's okay to suck, you'll just suck less next time!)\n- The game runs smoothly consistently; ie: no sudden frame drops, no visual tearing, etc.\n\nOne of the only bad things I've found about this game so far is how long it can take to get a matchmaking game sometimes, but the gameplay definitely overwhelms that con so it all works out in the end.\n\nI give this game an honest 10/10, it's really a great game but sadly doesn't have as much of a player following as I wish it did.","May 11","true","70.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Each character has a automatic modifier on the ball after hitting the ball 4 times. Dont play against bots because they are crappy and cheap to play against, they should remove the achivments for it and really fix them so they are more human-like on the reactions. ie. Following the ball and always hitting it the split second its near them. If you ever get stuck hitting the ball back to eachother when standing next to the harder level bot they will ALWAYS hit it the second the ball starts to move so its almost impossible to win, if you put a high level bot v bot in that situation the game wouldn't end.)","October 1, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The ball picks up speed. BIG TIME.\nThere are 5 characters, and each have their own special abilities and characteristics.\nSome can cling to walls, Double jump, Skate along the ceiling, Wall jump, etc.\n\nThey also have a special meter that builds up after 4 sucessful hits, allowing your\ncharacter of choice to unleash their own unique special move.\n\nThe animation is fluid and the environments are well done,\nand each stage comes with a pretty sick sound track.\n\nBut back to the speed. The game picks up insanely quickly, and you can easily\nlose focus and get frustrated amidst all the chaos. (I had one friend who was turned away from this\ngame just because it was way too fast paced for him)\n\nIt's not for the weak. Haha.\n\nIt's easy to master the timing, but I can also see how some people would\nthink the game lacks depth beyond just hitting a ball.\n\nI personally find great satisfaction going up against another person who can keep up.\n\nThe matches are extremely exciting, and this is a GREAT party game to play locally.\nHours upon hours of fun if you're competitve, and love getting hyped up during intense moments.\n\nHighly recommended...

While it's at its best in multiplayer, this gem of a game will be able to keep any player enveloped for a good amount of time after they start playing. Playing as a sort of cross between Super Smash Brothers and Pong, Lethal League employs up to 4 player in a fight to the death where the only means of downing an opponent is to bat an anti-gravity baseball into them. The characters, while limited at the moment, are all a joy to control and all have interesting designs, my personal favorite of the bunch being Candyman.

I don't share this opinion, the game isn't really all that expensive and while the content may be limited, there is just a lot of fun to be had with it. However, I still strongly urge anyone who considers buying Lethal League to get some friends to play this game with and buy a 2 or a 4-pack and split the price. The multipacks are pretty good deals, and the game is the most fun when you are playing it with a friend anyway.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about why you should buy this game, because you absolutely should.\n\nLethal League is a projectile based 2-D fighter with an interesting, kind of jet-set-like style to it. It features a surprisingly good soundtrack that really complements the gameplay as well as the overall feel of the game. Lethal League actually has very few mechanics, yet still provides a decent amount of depth, so it is pretty easy to pick up while being able to entertain and challenge you for a long amount of time.\n\nBasically, the goal in this game is to hit your opponent with an anti-gravity-ball which will cause them to lose one life instantly. You can hit or bunt the ball in various fashions to make it reach ludicrious speeds and bounce around in crazy patterns, and believe me, it's just mad fun. The sheer insanity of the gameplay paired with the incredible soundtrack and cool visual just makes it a blast to watch or play.\n\nThere are currently six characters which differ in mobility and special moves, as well as the angles they can make the ball travel at.\nThe game doesn't really offer all that interesting offline modes, but it's most enjoyable in multyplayer anyway. You can play free for alls, team fights and 1v1s. Lethal League, just like Skullgirls, uses GGPO and it results in super smooth feeling online play.\n\nSo, if the concept sounds at least a bit appealing to you and you have someone to play it with, you really owe yourself to pick it up, especially since there are not much games that are able to offer you a similar expierence out there.","December 1, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourwind/recommended/261180/","fourwind","Fourwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourwind/","303 products in account","The best way to describe Lethal League is as a simplification of the fighter genre mixed with a projectile game.\n\nDivekick did that in that fact that instead of having complicated moves, it became more about timing and mind games.\n\nLethal League does that in your positioning, your timing (although its pretty easy to get good at that), and your ability to change things up enough to freak out the opponent. If you don't mess with their head, and you're both good at the timing and positioning, the game can go on for a long time.\n\nIt's a lot about making less mistakes than the other person. In fact, that's pretty much how you win.\n\nBut enough about that, why should you play this game?\n\nPROS:\n- Easy to just play, easy to get good at, but relatively hard to get REALLY good at\n- Can keep you busy with just the singleplayer, but has a decent online matchmaking system, as well as local and online 4 player, similar to smash bros\n- Good at not frustrating the player, the most fun way to play if the best way to win\n- Gameplay that manages to be fast but also slow??? It works, trust me\n- Awesome music\n- Funky art\n- No weak ♥♥♥♥\n\nCONS:\n- Small character roster (Also a pro because it's easier to learn everything)\n- Much lower skill cap than other fighters (doesn't mean it can't be competetive)\n- Really grindy level up system (at least you get rewards for every level in the form of colour palletes and different balls which change up gameplay)\n\nIn short, if you like unique fighters, or Jet Set Radio, or both (like me), this game should be appealing to you.\nAlso a good party game.

While it's at its best in multiplayer, this gem of a game will be able to keep any player enveloped for a good amount of time after they start playing. Playing as a sort of cross between Super Smash Brothers and Pong, Lethal League employs up to 4 player in a fight to the death where the only means of downing an opponent is to bat an anti-gravity baseball into them. The characters, while limited at the moment, are all a joy to control and all have interesting designs, my personal favorite of the bunch being Candyman. Lethal League really is a blast to play, and is my personal pick for Indie Game of the Year. If you ever pick it, chances are that you won't be putting it down for a very long while.","November 8, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/decorativelamp/recommended/261180/","decorativelamp","Lamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/decorativelamp/","235 products in account","TL;DR Buy this game.\n\n\nThis game is simple yet very entertaining, a game in which you hit a ball and try to get it to hit your opponent.\n\nThe game utilizes a very simple control scheme consisting of the following: Up, Down, Left, and Right, Attack, Jump, and Bunt.\n\nU/D/L/R Does exactly what you think it does, but can also be used for aiming the ball when hitting it.\nAttack will swing your character's tool of choice after a tiny delay (swing up time) in either the direction you are facing, or Down/Up if you aimed it.\nBunting will significantly slow the ball down for a brief amount of time, making the ball act more like a real ball (following gravity until it gets hit or touches a wall)\nJumping is self-explanatory, however if you do a down attack on the ball while jumping, you will double the ball speed.\n\nThe ball does not follow the laws of physics, and instead acts more like you'd expect a ball from pong to do.\n\nThere's a slight catch when hitting the ball however, as when it gets faster, there will be a delay between when you make contact with the ball and when the ball gets released, indicated by a 'power' bar near the speedometer. This is essential for timing some of the faster balls (i.e. ball speeds in the 20000+ range as at that point you cannot rely on reaction times, as the ball is now more like a laser beam) and adds to the game's mechanics a bit more. This is called hit-lag. If you bunt the ball then hit it while it is still purple, the ball will instantly launch with no hit-lag. Some powerups can circumvent hitlag as well. During hit-lag, you are immobile.\n\nDuring hit-lag, the non attacking player can wait for the ball to near the end of hit-lag, jump up, and use the timer to time hitting the ball. To combat this, the player that is hit-lagged can use the bunt ability to shield the ball near the end of the hit-lag. This will prevent players from hitting it right after it comes out of hit-lag, and will severly punish them as once they do hit it, they will be knocked back and most likely get hit by it. Avoid using this with friends, as they may regard it as cheap.\n\nThe stages are roomy but not too big as to feel unfair. All stages have a consistent size. More on stages later.\n\nWith the mechanics out of the way, it's time to get to the characters. I'm going to summarize them in my own words, as the developer's words can be found on their website.\n\nYou got Raptor. Sporty baseball kid, his tool of choice is a baseball bat. He can hop off of walls to gain more height, and his special move is to hit the ball twice, which is activated simply by double tapping the attack button. When he does this action, he can change the direction of the ball, and also it circumvents hit-lag.\n\nThen you have Switch, a rebellious skateboarding robot who hits the ball with his skateboard. He can ride up walls (and on the ceiling), and his special ability is being able to hit the ball if it is under him, which is activated by hitting jump while already in the air. His ability ignores hit-lag.\n\nNext, candyman. A tap dancing dandy with a big yellow ball of candy as a head, he uses his cane to hit the ball, and his special ability allows the ball to go through walls and appear on the other side of the level. Activated by attacking twice when hitting the ball. His jump is very high.\n\nAlso, you have Sonata. A very strong girl who wields a powerful bass-hammer just to show off her strength. She can double jump, and her special ability allows her to control and change the ball's direction three times after activating it by attacking twice. Good for either making the ball dodge the enemy player's swings, or getting the ball in a hard to hit place (i.e. at the very bottom, or just a little bit above headlevel).\n\nFinally, you have Latch. Genetically modified crocodile, he can grab onto and climb walls and he uses his tail to smack the ball. His special ability is the ability to store the ball in his mouth, allowing him to move while under the effects of hitlag, and also be extremely confusing as to what position he will release the ball in.\n\nSoon, there will be an additional charcter (DICE) and I'll have to update this.\n\n\nNow, onto stages.\nThere are 6 stages.\n\nA purple-ish desert (seen in the title card)\nAn almost empty pool with a futuristic backdrop\nA sewer\nA padded cell\nA train, that moves across futuristic buildings\nAnd a dark street near an APC type vehicle.\n\nAll of these have a seperate and appropriate banging tune to go along with the action.\nI find myself often listening to the music outside of the game, as the soundtrack is really solid, and in my opinion without it the game would be a lot worse.\n\nAll in all, this game is easily my GOTY. I've already gotten almost 20 hours of enjoyment out of it so far, and I've yet to get anywhere near bored of the game. And it's only ~$25 after tax for a two pack, so grab one for yourself and a friend and fight.\n\nThe controls are all really solid, no matter if it's a keyboard or a controller or a weird gamepad from 2005 that lacks analog sticks. The game handles well with all controls.\n\nNetworking is pretty solid as well, with you being able to choose smooth visuals with an input delay (if latency is high) or a slowed down game with no input delay. I prefer the former, as it's far easier to adapt to.\n\nThe only thing that I don't like about the game is the current lack of variety in stages/characters, as you can blow through all stages and characters pretty quickly. But obviously in the future this won't be true (hopefully)\n\nIn summary,\n\nPROS:\n*Simple control scheme that leads to intense gameplay\n*Solid networking\n*Amazing art direction and soundtrack\n*Good cast of characters\n*No weak ♥♥♥♥\n\nCONS:\n*Lack of variety","October 12, 2014","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is easy to learn but hard to master, and has a pretty high skill cap.\n\nPros: Memorable catchy house music.\nA unique concept of pong/baseball/fighting all combined into one game that is really blood-pumping and may cause some screaming if you're playing a LAN.\nSolid mechanics\nThe controls are tight\n6 different characters you can choose from with different abilities (and hit angles).\nYou can play in quick short bursts, maybe when you're queuing for a Dota 2 game, CSGO, anything really.\nThe art is unique.\nThe animations are very smooth.\nThe voice acting isn't cringe-worthy and is very well done.\nPlaying with lag is somewhat manageable, unlike in some FPS and other games where lag is very important to not have.\nHardly any bugs.\nCons: Current playerbase isn't too big so actually finding a game is sometimes impossible. You can check on SteamDB[steamdb.info] to see how many players are playing at the moment so you can actually find an opponent.\nPrice is a bit too expensive for some people.\nRare crashes.\nThat's all I could think of for cons, really.\n\nWishlistThe things I wish was in the game\nMore characters\nA cheaper price to increase the playerbase\nFINAL VERDICT:85/100\n\nThis game is really different to most other fighting games, if you can afford it, buy it when it is on sale, usually it's around $5, so get it!","December 14, 2015","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

This unique "fighting" game still has me on the edge of my seat, with intense high-speed battles.\n\nLethal League plays a bit differently than other fighting games, since you have little effect on your opponent directly. Instead, to knock them out, you must hit a levitating ball and land a direct hit, while your opponent tries to do the same to you. Mind-games come into play as you can hit the ball under an angle up and down, which causes it to bounce rapidly around the stage!\n\nOther features: Sweet music and high moddability (Sprites, music, UI).\n\nWhile the GGPO connection actually works great (A high ping player will bring down any game, really) once the match has started, there are some issues when starting the match, occasionally locking up the game. The devs seem to want to try to fix this issue currently, so hopefully this (pretty big) flaw will be sorted out soon.","January 10","true","486.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lethal League is a projectile fighting game which starts off easy to learn, then quickly scales into either a chaotic mess of fun to be had with your friends or a very interesting competitive experience. With a gameplay system that's much deeper than it would seem at a glance, Lethal League provides fun to whoever is willing to give it a shot, and I'd highly recommend you fork out a few bucks for the game that keeps on giving.\n\nIt being a multiplayer game, it does suffer from the usual lack of opponents issue when you want to play against someone in less than ideal circumstances. The art of the game certainly isn't particularly striking or unique in any way, just enough so to serve its purpose. Lethal League also suffers from a lack of diverse content, but that's forgivable as what content there is has been polished to a mirror shine.\n\nEvery shortcoming listed is easily ignored in favor of a Higher Fun, and you should definitely get in on the chaos everyone's talking about!","October 13, 2014","true","32.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/261180/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Lethal League is a fantastic fighting game that shines at its brightest with friends due to its accessibility, complexity, and consistency in providing incredible moments during matches. It plays like a fast-paced and dangerous game of ping pong and dodgeball where the ball will knock the stuffing out of you if you're hit.\n\nThe accessibility comes from the simple concept of hitting the ball is good while being hit by the ball is bad. The tutorial  (located in EXTRAS) will take you through the basics and teach you enough to start smacking the ball around in different directions in different ways. You'll be exposed to the basic attack which adds only one speed to the ball, a charge up attack which can add up to x2 the current speed of the ball, and the down smash which always doubles the speed of the ball. You'll also be introduced to bunting which pops the ball up into the air no matter how fast it's going, your special which is usually the attack button during hit lag/pause (that freezing moment before you release the ball), and the jump button. You can also taunt or taunt + direction to emote.\n\nThe complexity comes from all the subtleties found within the game. Each character has their own special moveset in regards to how they move, jump, and control their special. For example, Sonata has a double jump, Candyman have a floaty jump that reaches the top of the screen, while Latch can jump onto and then climb up and down walls. You can clash with other players resulting in one or both being stunned, bunt attacks, bunt bunts, control the direction of bunts, adjust your attacking angles, reduce the hitlag/pause by bunting before performing an air down smash or a charge attack so your opponent can't counter easily, and so on to the point that there are some helpful guides in the Community Hub that can improve your game once you're ready.\n\nAs for moments, there are so many. One of my favorites happen to be this one match where I exchanged a ball going at 1,000,000 speed several times with a worthy opponent. Keep in mind the ball starts off at a default speed of 8 unless you change the settings. Here's a video showing some three player gameplay with different settings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zexKK2TYI-Y\n\nFinally, I'll mention the settings because you can drastically change the approach of how to play depending on what you choose. The game has two modes that I know of, stocks (think SSB) and points. Stocks rewards the player who's able to stay alive. Points rewards the player that can attain the most kills/knockouts. Ball tagging on means you don't have to fear the ball you just hit while turning it off means it's a danger to everyone at all times. You can also change the ball if you're at a high enough level. So far I've only played with the Big Ball which seems to have a bigger hitbox and a longer hit lag. You can also set the time limit or turn it off if in case you want to play for the most kills in five minutes or first to twelve kills.\n\nP.S. Play with friends or people. It's much, much less fun to play against the AI. You can use the in-game matchmaking or peeking in the Community Hub chat to find pick-up games if you don't have a group of friends for ball smashing.","November 26, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics to this fighter are straightforward and very easy to understand. Two to four characters hit a baseball around an arena, trying to hit the other players with it. If a player hits the ball back, the speed of the ball increases. You can “bunt” the ball, temporarily knocking it straight up, but once it’s hit again or touches the ground it will resume its previous velocity. If a player manages to hit the ball four times, they can do a special move that varies by character.\n\nIt sounds simplistic on paper, but the ball velocity gets so high that your only view of it is as a straight line bisection the arena. Timing is critical, strategy vital, and seat-of-your-pants tactics (wild panic works too) all combine into a high-octane fight unlike anything I’ve seen before. In a very strange, oblique way, it reminds me of high-level play in Rockstar’s Table Tennis. Lethal League has even replaced Soul Calibur as my favorite fighting game.\n\nIf you’re curious about the game, you can play the original prototype of Lethal League here: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ - it’s not quite the same as the full game, but it’s enough to give you a good impression.","September 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/261180/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Lethal League is like a glorified Pong with a Smash Bros. skin. The basic objective is to knock your opponent(s) out using a ball that you keep knocking back and forth in between each other. Sound simple, yeah? But the catch is the more the ball gets smacked around, the faster it goes. Soon enough it reaches insane speeds to where you can barely keep up with it. The enviornment even changes as the speed gets faster and faster.\n\n\nThe game is played in "Bursts", or rounds, and the ball's speed resets every round. The use of bursts make every round very intense and heart-pounding when the ball reaches the incredible speeds. Dare I say you may even be on the edge of your seat.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is great, too. Definitely fitting for the game, having nice funky tunes with you. Take a listen sometime.\n\nThe characters are pretty unique in their own right. They each have a distinct character design and personality that you can easily recognize. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. Also, each of them have special abilities that have different effects on the ball, such as Candyman's ability to make the ball phase through the walls.\n\nIn short, Lethal League is a fast paced, blood pumping action fest that you'll surely get a kick out of. I highly recommend it.","September 23, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play "Walligator" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank.\nall in all it's a good game\nsolid sound track\na "challenge" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.\nart style isnt much at first but it grows on you\nminor connection issues in online multiplayer\nlocal multiplayer as well as online\neasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)\n-basics\n- swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]\n- bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]\n- once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground\n- parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]\n- slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)\nspecials and traits\n-candyman\n- ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again\n- candyman has no heavy falling\n- candyman has the sharpest slam angle\n- sonata\n- special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points\n- has a double jump\n- latch\n- can climb walls\n- largest hitbox\n- special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught\n- switch\n- can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)\n- upward aim goes behind him\n- special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter)\n- Raptor\n- smallest hitbox\n- can bunt if ball is above him\n- fastest hit\n- special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release","September 18, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics to this fighter are straightforward and very easy to understand. Two to four characters hit a baseball around an arena, trying to hit the other players with it. If a player hits the ball back, the speed of the ball increases. You can “bunt” the ball, temporarily knocking it straight up, but once it’s hit again or touches the ground it will resume its previous velocity. If a player manages to hit the ball four times, they can do a special move that varies by character.\n\nIt sounds simplistic on paper, but the ball velocity gets so high that your only view of it is as a straight line bisection the arena. Timing is critical, strategy vital, and seat-of-your-pants tactics (wild panic works too) all combine into a high-octane fight unlike anything I’ve seen before. In a very strange, oblique way, it reminds me of high-level play in Rockstar’s Table Tennis. Lethal League has even replaced Soul Calibur as my favorite fighting game.\n\nIf you’re curious about the game, you can play the original prototype of Lethal League here: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ - it’s not quite the same as the full game, but it’s enough to give you a good impression.","September 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main idea is you and up to 3 other players hit a small ball that seems to lack gravity or air resistance inbetween each other. When you hit the ball it get's 'tagged' with your color, and if someone gets hit with the ball when it's not tagged their color they're out.\n\nThere's a lot more to it than that, like stage sizes and hit angles, but if you want a fun little game you ca jump into whenever and mess around with friends, or compete in actual tournaments, this game is for you.\n\nIt's also a very chaotic game, however. At times you and someone else will end up getting one of you out, then thinking 'What the hell just happened?' And usually it can be a bit jarrring, especially at higher ball speeds when the screen starts shaking and you have to factor in hit lag.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 10/10. Really.

It looks bad, but don't let that stop you. Netplay is fairly good (!).

It's as exerrating as hotline miami is where you get hit once and get knocked out, and inbetween getting hit and not getting hit is a addreline pumping rush of trying to trick your opponents with your skills or time your hits better then your opponent.  it's gets even more tenseful as the ball gets FASTER *..even to the point where the ball hits 1 million MPH(?...correct me if that's not the correct speed measurement in the game XD) so it gets hard trying to spot the ball, and how the enviroment reacts to the speed is a grand delight to the icing on the cake.  if there's a sequal i'd suggest making the ball seem more faster as i've...think i've noticed that about 50,000-1 million the ball speed animation SEEMS the same...then again maybe my eyes can't catch the ball moving at 1 million MPH...then again how the hell did i hit one million!? HOW THE F*** DID HE HIT UNTIL 1 MILL WITH ME!?!?!? it's like this game helped me reach a level of zen where my subconsious knows when to hit\n\nagain GREAT GAME","January 22, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/recommended/261180/","spacebowser","SpaceBowser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/","357 products in account","Lethal League knocks it out of the park, without even trying. The mechanics to this fighter are straightforward and very easy to understand. Two to four characters hit a baseball around an arena, trying to hit the other players with it. If a player hits the ball back, the speed of the ball increases. You can “bunt” the ball, temporarily knocking it straight up, but once it’s hit again or touches the ground it will resume its previous velocity. If a player manages to hit the ball four times, they can do a special move that varies by character.\n\nIt sounds simplistic on paper, but the ball velocity gets so high that your only view of it is as a straight line bisection the arena. Timing is critical, strategy vital, and seat-of-your-pants tactics (wild panic works too) all combine into a high-octane fight unlike anything I’ve seen before. In a very strange, oblique way, it reminds me of high-level play in Rockstar’s Table Tennis. Lethal League has even replaced Soul Calibur as my favorite fighting game.\n\nIf you’re curious about the game, you can play the original prototype of Lethal League here: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ - it’s not quite the same as the full game, but it’s enough to give you a good impression.","September 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are well done and varying in style and moves. Visuals are toony/cellshaded but still very meature and the soundtrack is headbangaren(heh) and gets me thinking of Jet Set Radio.\nA aspect i really love about this game is that you can play for long or short periods. A (1v1) game takes about 2-4 minutes, so if you're in a hurry, you can still play a game. And if you got time, then just play more games.\nOther than the online mode there is a arcade mode where you have to battle through the characters for those of you who like that. Then theres also offline play if you got friends at your house.\n\nSo i really recommend this game and its one of my favourites at the moment, although what could be seen as my little play time.","December 30, 2014","true","37.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

My brother pointed it out to me and claimed how much he wanted the game, so I figured I might as well install it and give it a whirl. And boy, am I glad I did. This game is like Super Smash Bros, plus Jet Set Radio Future, minus the graffiti, plus baseball and a lot of attitude. My first night playing, the game got me so hyper and hopped up on adrenaline, it was crazy. (Not to mention I was playing on the highest ball speed and four level 7 computers within five minutes of playing.)  The game is easy to learn, yet a little hard to master. (Took me about two hours to be able to hold my own against four level 7's, but that doesn't mean I'm able to beat them hands down.)\n\nI love the fact that it has local multiplayer capabilities, so my brother can join me while playing, until he gets his own copy of the game. It's best with a controller in my opinion, and my crappy laptop that gets 2 FPS at most while playing modern games can handle this game with no problem. Great soundtrack, too.\n\nThe only downside I see with this game, is the fact that it gets repetitive after a few hours. I'd love a few new characters as well, but other than that, this game is amazing.

It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we?\n\nIntro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.\n\nMusic: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!\n\nGraphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes!\n\nConclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time!\n\nRating: 9/10","August 29, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The aim is to K.O. your enemies by hitting an anti-gravity baseball into them while not being hit by it yourself. There is also a multi-player mode where instead, the objective is to hit the other team's target to accumulate points. If you want a different kind of challenge then don't fret, there's a mode for that too. In this mode, you have to work your way through a series of battles against CPU. If you want to brush up your skills there's also training mode. The game is currently lacking in characters and stages, but the developers are definitely planning to add more in future updates. Overall, if you want a challenging, competitive and fast-paced indie game to play with your friends, then have a go at this.","November 17, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, if you don't have friends, maybe you shouldn't pick this one up, as the BOTs are fun, but not near as fun as playing with someone you know. While playing with my friend, with other people watching, I heard many "dude that was awesome"s or histarical laughter as someone gets hit by a super easy ball. The gameplay consists of hitting a ball back and forth between 1-3 other players, if you hit the ball last, it is outlined in your color and is lethal if it touches the other player. The other player has to hit the ball back to make it their color and to try and get you. This simple gameplay leads to hilarious moments where people get lucky shots and send the ball back even faster to the next player. The ball speed is really fast and sometimes hard to predict when you first pick up the game, so you can feel a real sense of getting better as you play the game. Super fun game, the AI is good, but not outstanding, pick it up if you have friends to play it with.","August 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you like fighting games that have nothing to do with fighting?\n\nLethal league is an amazing skill-based game. The idea is to take out your opponents by hitting them with a ball which speeds up to insane velocities. It gets to the point where you just can't see the ball and react with enough time, you must figure out where it's going and time your hit correctly. The game has multiple characters, each with their own abilities, movement characteristics and angles at which they respond the ball which keeps the matches varied. The music is good, but the art is amazing. The scenary and the colours change as a match gets more hectic. There are also a couple of play modes. Death mach, team death match and some goalkeeping game. The only problem is that sometimes finding a match takes a while.\n\nI fully recommend this game.

In the most basic game, you hit a ball back and forth; if it hits you, you're out for the round. And it gains speed at every swing. So pretty simple, really. And hilarious. You can play local multiplayer or online multiplayer, and there's also a single player mode ("challenge mode") which is a set amount of matches against set characters and combinations. The game modes are free-for-all (just hitting the ball until only one player remains), team play (works best for four players, obviously) and strikers (hit the other team's goal instead of its players).\n\nThe problem with this game is that if you're playing alone, there really isn't much to do besides challenge mode - which, honestly, I didn't find it as fun as multiplayer. You can try to search for matches online, but most of the time it's just unfruitful, and the online mode has quite a few connectivity issues, especially if the match has more than two players. The game also gets repetitive quite fast, and while leveling up does unlock new things, they're mostly skins for the characters (there are 6 different in the game) which are purely cosmetic and honestly not that rewarding.\n\nStill, if you have a couple friends willing to engage in some pong-esque shenanigans, maybe over a skype call or even some pizza at your house, I can recommend getting a multi-pack of this game and bash away.","June 24, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I reccomend everyone get this game.\n\nIt seems simple at first, just hit the ball to your opponent with dodgeball-esqe rules, and the speed of the ball increases over time. 3 controls; hit, jump and bunt. What most people don't realise until they buy the game and play it for 10 minutes, is that this game has so much depth and strategy. You can perform combos to fill up your special meter, you can parry shots with presice timing to throw your opponent off guard, you can bunt the ball whilst travelling one million pixels per frame to surprise other players, you can blahdy blahdy blah. You get the picture.\n\nThere are only 5 characters, and they seem to all be the same at first, but they all have different angles when hitting the ball and they can interact with the environment in different ways. These may seem suttle, but have a large effect on the gameplay. Each character has a special move unique to them also, and when used correctly, can have a devastating effect on your adversarys.\n\nWhat the hell are you doing. Stop reading this and buy the game so I have more people to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't buy it, i'll murder you in your sleep.

Lethal League is extremely fun in it's current state, however the developers seem to be of the mindset that what has been released is enough, and in my opinion, that is far from correct. More maps, more characters, and the option to add AI controlled bots to private matches is needed to keep the game interesting all around.

It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we?\n\nIntro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.\n\nMusic: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!\n\nGraphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes!\n\nConclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time!\n\nRating: 9/10","August 29, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we?\n\nIntro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.\n\nMusic: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!\n\nGraphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes!\n\nConclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time!\n\nRating: 9/10","August 29, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.\n\nI remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.\n\nAll in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.","February 27","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we?\n\nIntro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.\n\nMusic: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!\n\nGraphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes!\n\nConclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time!\n\nRating: 9/10","August 29, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I think I have decided that once every nine or ten days I think I am going to play a game of my own choosing, in order to balance out the reviews, and to keep me from going crazy.  So I figure the best way to start off my ‘player’s choice’ series would be Lethal League, a multiplayer smash fest from Team Reptile.  Now, I admitted earlier that I really wasn’t that big on fighting games, and in fact often just pounded the controller like I was asking for another beer at a crowded bar hoping the other guy walked into my punches.  I confess now that there was one unmentioned exception to that statement, and that was the classic Nintendo 64 version of smash brothers.  I actually spent a significant amount of time refining my skill in that game, partially because it was a fighting game I was actually fairly decent at, but more because it was oodles of fun, and a great game to play with friends.\n\nFast forward a decade and change, and we have Lethal League, which is a rehashing of the typical multiplayer chaos on the screen everyone pounding controllers while jumping up and down and ‘accidentally’ kicking each other while playing sort of game, only this time with the added fun of dodgeball rules added in.  See, instead of simply smashing each other directly, players instead knock a little color coded ball back and forth with the goal of hitting someone else, knocking them out until the next serve.  Difficulty is added as the ball’s speed increases every time it is hit, giving players a reward for timing over button mashing.  Each character even has their own special move, from Dice’s occasional arcing of the ball over everyone's’ heads to candyman’s wall-looping trick, each character has a way to frustrate everyone else playing.  And with both online and local multiplayer modes possible, this game will give you enough play value to make it worth any amount of money, and eventual frustration over whoever picks Latch.  Can’t recommend this one enough, folks.  Have fun!\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept.  Also installed on the laptop.  Never know when you want another round\nBuy/No Buy: Buy.  Heck, Buy a multipack and send it to all your friends.","February 4","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That description is spot. Lethal League is a ton of fun though. Once you got used to how the game works the ridiculous amount of things that can happen are endless. The game offers three different game modes; free for all, team, and strikers. Free for all is exactually what you would expect up to for people all trying to knock eachother out by hitting the ball. Team is the same way other than being able to work with your teammate to control the pace of the game. Stirikers is basically soccer where each team is trying to hit the ball into the other teams goal while also trying to protect your own. For free for all I would reccomend three people because with four people the game gets to hectic for me personally. Also the soundtrack in this game is sweet! Overall though I would highly recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. I would give this game a solid 8/10 with the only thing holding it back being the replay value since it relies so much on one type of gameplay some people may get bored fairly quickly.","February 19, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lethal League is pretty simple overall, but is just perfect. Its controls involve just three buttons; not "Divekick" excessive simplicity, but enough that people won't shy away from picking up the third or fourth controller. Even so, there's definitely enough variety of play at work. There's also a great tactile feel to mashing a ball around at each other,\n\nI've been bringing a laptop loaded with this game to a local bar, and people were very quick to pick up on it; several people there are probably better than I'll ever be already.

The deadliest game of Pong is the must-own game of 2014, in my book. If you like fighting games at all, and remember the hype of the UFGT 9 Finals match, then you really should try Lethal League in its Steam form. The music is extremely bangin', and you can easily find the tracks in the music folder, to rock out to whenever. No weak ****. No complex move lists. No johns. Just insane, adrenaline-pumping, lethal and unadulterated madness.\n\nJust play it.

You can just jump in and begin playing.\n\nIt's a very fun game with a refreshing mechanic, it's essentially Super Smash Bros meets dodgeball. Much like the aformentioned game, it becomes so much more enjoyable with friends.\n\nThe single player is a disaster and not really worth your time. It has "challenges" mode which is essentially classic mode from SSB, but the CPU feel either too good, or not good enough. There's no inbetween. There's modes that require a certain amount of kills (8) where you play against two cpu players.

While it is somewhat lacking in depth of mechanics and focuses more on memorization of trajectories, this game is certainly enjoyable to pick up with some friends. The art in the game is nice, albeit unpolished, but if you are going to play the game for longer than a few hours I would recommend muting it, as the sounds made by the characters are infuriatingly awful. I would recommend this game if you are looking for something inspired by Super Smash Bros but don't want an actual fighting platformer like Rivals of Aether.","February 3","true","22.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can just jump in and begin playing.\n\nIt's a very fun game with a refreshing mechanic, it's essentially Super Smash Bros meets dodgeball. Much like the aformentioned game, it becomes so much more enjoyable with friends.\n\nThe single player is a disaster and not really worth your time. It has "challenges" mode which is essentially classic mode from SSB, but the CPU feel either too good, or not good enough. There's no inbetween. There's modes that require a certain amount of kills (8) where you play against two cpu players. You feel completely cheated if you fail on one of these stages all because the cpu are essentially farming points on each other... but the game makes up for it with fun, easy to jump in and play multiplayer.\n\nMaybe not worth full price, but at 33% off or above I'd recommend it.

I played the original flash prototype a while back, and they have taken that concept and expanded it into a great game. The controls are crisp and responsive and they've balanced it in a way that creates hype moments without feeling like they game is just spiralling out of control. You can have the ball zipping really fast and still make plays. There's now ball control, bunting, character specific abilites, and a lot more good stuff. The online experience has worked flawlessly so far up to 150ms lag 1v1. I'm hoping to eventually find more 4 player free-for-alls and 2v2s in the mix.\n\nSoundtrack is mad tight.\n\nIf you've played the original and said "this could be fun but..." give this one a try.

It tends to not even connect to online matches or sometimes it's really laggy even when searching with close range. Other than that, it's one of my favorite games. But I hope the developers fix this multiplayer issue quick.","October 10, 2014","true","66.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Heck, buy the four-pack and get some friends in on the action.  You'll have a blast.\n\nThis game is an odd mashup of things like Tekken, Super Smash Bros, Pong, and a bit of Dragonball Z mixed in for good measure.  If you get a couple of friends and all play together, this game is one of the best times you'll collectively have.  I haven't played in the open multiplayer so I can't vouch for the online community, but playing against friends is simply fantastic.  The online multiplayer will occasionally desyncronize when starting a match, but it only takes about 10 seconds to exit the game, restart it, host a new lobby, invite your friends into it, and restart.  The desync error also is not particularly common, certainly less than 10% of matches will have this issue.  Not a serious detraction from the overall game.\n\nThere are, however, two things missing: a replay system and a spectator mode.  There are many situations where it would be nice to have a replay so you can answer questions like "How did that shot hit me?" or "That was an awesome move, can I see that again?"  I hope the devs will eventually include some form of replay management.  The inclusion of a spectator mode would make this game viable for some tournaments and casting.  I doubt it'll rival things like LoL or DOTA for popularity, but at some events it would be great to have a Lethal League tournament going on as a side-attraction or something.","December 24, 2014","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am not an expert at this game, far from it. But the games' mechanics are very easy to learn, infact the tutorial is ~2 minutes long. That being said, I am going to continue playing this game for quite a while, it feels absolutely WONDERFUL to smack the ball around, especially the faster it gets, and you start shouting at the screen to get it.\nThe price point is imo too high, 14 isn't pocket change, considering how much the game actually has inside. I got super hyped and bought it anyway, but that decision is up to you.\nThe online connection is phenomenal, very very few cases when it felt off or jumpy. If I didn't know I was alone, I couldn't tell that the players weren't right next to me. One big probelem though is that if it desyncs, then it's just about over for that room. But i've only had that happen once in the ~16 games I've played as of writing this.\nNow, if they added Local Play, this game would be completely worth the price, hopefully they add that feature. If you're worried about dumping the cash to pick this up, wait till it goes on sale. Even 10 would be good imo, but I also thought 14 was an acceptable loss","August 27, 2014","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While each character has a special move and the ability to attack one another, the only way to knock out your opponent is by smashing an oversized baseball into them. A deceptively simple premise that turns out to be a lot harder than it sounds, the ball will continue to move faster with each hit making it harder to predict and counter.\n\nPros\n-Shockingly addicting\n-Great Sound track\n-Decent number of game mods with up to four players (1v1, team battle, ffa, stock/point etc)\n-ggpo netcode\n\nCons\n-Not much of a single player (granted it is a fighter)\n\nDefinitely worth a buy if you're looking for a quirky fighter to play online or with friends.","August 27, 2014","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The simplicity, the visceral feedback, and the mindgames are what really make this game special. You can learn all the mechanics there is to learn in about 2 minutes, but what really takes a long time is learning how to read your opponent, what they're going to do and how to prepare for you. TotalBiscuit criticised the art style, but I have to disagree with him - The Boombox culture of south central los Angeles personified in cartoon form is a really fresh direction for a game to take. Maybe the palette has been exaggerated and might be a bit noisy, but I'll be damned if every single hit, every single return of the ball with the little flash particle animations isn't an instant dopamine hit.\n\nTL;Dr - simple game with a lot of strategic depth, great music, fresh art, solid mechanics.

The simplicity, the visceral feedback, and the mindgames are what really make this game special. You can learn all the mechanics there is to learn in about 2 minutes, but what really takes a long time is learning how to read your opponent, what they're going to do and how to prepare for you. TotalBiscuit criticised the art style, but I have to disagree with him - The Boombox culture of south central los Angeles personified in cartoon form is a really fresh direction for a game to take. Maybe the palette has been exaggerated and might be a bit noisy, but I'll be damned if every single hit, every single return of the ball with the little flash particle animations isn't an instant dopamine hit.\n\nTL;Dr - simple game with a lot of strategic depth, great music, fresh art, solid mechanics. Recommend to everybody, I hope the guys at Reptile make millions of dollars.","August 27, 2014","true","57.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is the first exception I have found.\n\nLethal league involves hitting a ball into other players. The ball gradually speeds up until it gets to insane high speeds. Unlike most arcade fighter games movement in incredibly important and memorising combos is unnecessary.\n\nYou have three skills, hitting the ball, bunting the ball (which stops the balls movement, and a special attack cast by double hitting the hit button after scoring four previous hits on the ball. Each character has a different special attack.\n\nLethal league is graphically and musically stylish and appealing as well as insanely fun.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","November 19, 2014","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the seeming simplicity, as the game is elegantly complex.  Take "Pong" & add Handball / Dodgeball elements with a cartoon twist of intense speed madcap & you essentially get "Lethal League."  The graphics has have a mid-90s "Street Fighter" look & feel to them, which is quite suitable.  Seeing the ball is important & this works well for gameplay.  The voice acting is good & actually quite funny at times.  A well timed taught can really mess with your local competitors just as much as a well met swing sending the ball spinning.  The music is cool.  Even people not used to playing video games can get a kick out of this one.  Recommended as easy to pick-up and play, yet challenging to master.   I would love to see an expansion with more characters, or a sequel, but the game is near perfect as is.

I held off on a review, because I would have thumbs-downed it. Why does this title have overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam?!\n\nIt must be played with controllers on a couch with local multiplayer. This is where this game shines. There is alot of screaming and shouting and laughing. Lots of twitching. Great fun.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent concept - bringing such a fresh breath of life to stale fighting games\n+Brilliantly simple controls - no tedious combos to memorize\n+Characters each have their own specialties - it seems subtle, though\n+Music is pretty good\n\nCons:\n-While this game is crazy fun, there is wasted potential at this point IMO, I really think there is TONS of room for expansion, such as:\n-Needs more playable characters\n-Needs better artwork, IMO\n-Needs more playable levels\n-Needs more gameplay modes (only 3 right now)\n\nOverall, the fun factor is pretty much through the roof with this title. If you have couch coop opportunities, this is a no brainer.","June 7, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I tend to wait until I've either finished the game or played a large enough portion before getting bored with it to come to a valid conclusion.\n\nWhat I've seen of Lethal League so far indicates that it's a supremely addictive game. Simple mechanics are coupled with a very high skill ceiling and lots of challenge, which over the course of each match escalates to ludicrous heights. Each character has a very different set of abilities beyond simply tossing the ball around and the combination of a variety of characters make on-the-fly strategizing against them very entertaining. Overall I'd give Lethal League a big recommendation on that front.\n\nHowever, the connection issues are what absolutely kill this game for me at the moment. Every other match doesn't load properly and I've had plenty of disconnects even with players in my own region. Mind you that I have a 15MB/s (that's Megabyte, not Megabit) connection where my PC is connected via Ethernet cable and not Wi-Fi, so my connection is about as solid as you can get, and yet it still fails around 50% of the time. I won't cry about connection times since I realize that they're mostly down to the amount of active players, but once a connection is established, it's amazing how bad the game manages to function. Not to mention that when the game does actually hang up and never starts the next match, you can't simply get out again by pressing Escape or any other keys. You have to terminate the application with Alt+F4 every single time this happens, and it can get very annoying.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have bought the game with the recent Humble Monthly, so it cost me around $1.2, or 90% less than what's asked for here on Steam, which is why I'll keep the game and give it a mild pass in order to see if the issues get resolved in the future. But for the record, had I paid full price, I'd have refunded this broken mess immediately. Which is unfortunate, a game with solid mechanics and the potential for hours of fun is shot in the kneecaps by terrible connection issues.\n\nIf the issues get resolved, I will edit this review to reflect any future changes made here.","November 7, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","4"

Only 3 buttons jump, strike, and punt but using good timing and learning angels with these tools you will be striking your opponent out while you're running home on a Grand Slam R.B.I.\n\nheres my full written review\nLethal league is a game where the hype never stops  and neither does the ball. the core game is like combat pong  or dodge ball but there is a lot of nuance moves and tricks the make this game competitive and really fun.play with your friends. even if you don't have any, GO ONLINE and play against some other online warriors, don't want to get rekt. the challenge mode will keep you busy the fun never stops with a myriad of different stages and retro music that will remind you of jet set radio- always a good thing. the game is by team reptile the same people behind megabyte punch which came out august of 2013.after making megabyte punch the games developers were showing off a new kind of fighting game at major competitions the game was praised and so lethal league was born.\n\nthe gameplay of lethal league is simple you can't really do much you can jump strike and punt. only 3 buttons but the maneuvers you can string together using these 3 buttons are essential to mastering the game. each one of your moves jump, strike, and  punt all have a different functionality depending on the situation and character.each character has a unique jump mechanic such as wall jump double jump ect. all characters have a downward strike will jumping. and all characters have a special move after hitting something 4 times.there are 5 characters so far. switch,raptor,sonata,candyman and latch. learning your characters move set, mobility, and strengths is key to knowing what to do in each situation and really adds depth to the game. my 2 favorite character so far are switch and sonta, switch  can ride on the walls and has a pretty horizontal swing. on the other hand sonata has a double jump and had a pretty vertical swing . each character differences do add some subtly to the game and doesn't change the core gameplay. unlike other fighting game where u have to know each character's inputs and timing this game is all about timing so u can hope on any character pretty much and still be competent. the moment to moment gameplay can look a little daunting to new players but the simple mechanics make it easy to hop in the game and just play and once you start to learn how to predict the ball then thats when you'll really get into the deep nuance  of this game. the developers did a good job of showing you the basic of the gameplay in their tutorial while still giving you the opportunity to discover new game mechanics on your own. overall the gameplay is simple yet hard to master and thats what u want ina competitive game\n\ngetting into a game online is really easy its been a good number of people playing everytime i how on must i had to wait for a game was 1-2 minutes but most happen withen 30 secs. im on the west coast so your milage may vary\n\nthe gameplay is great and all but what i think really deserves praise is the music and art tim and dion did a great job with a game art the style of the art really fits the game a sorta pixel art of future streetscapes and urban environments really adds to the feel of the games atmosphere\nthe music gets me pumped to play so lethal league. i can listen to the music without the game. thats the sign of good music. a sorta mix sounds like the music for the jet set series with a modern twist\nim having fun with lethal league and even though it won't be my go to competitive game i'm glad i have it in my library and i can hop in anytime and play the best version of pong there is :D\n7/10\nslightly abouve wolfstien the new oder\n\nVideo Impressions http://youtu.be/TbEABoE1uIQ\nvideo review http://youtu.be/9ZICgMztSRM","August 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","0"

Since the ball can be hit in any angle you want there are a lot of factors to consider on how and when to hit it or if you want to slow the ball down with a punt to smash it more acurrately.\n\nCurrently there are 5 playable characters available, which for a launch line-up is okay, but I hope that more characters will be added soon. Each character has its own special ability which you can use when your power meter(I haven't heard an official name for that yet) is full. You can fill your power meter by hitting the ball and when it's full you can release your special ability by pressing the hit button again while you are hitting the ball. What is quite notable as well is that each character has special movment and jumping capabilities. For example, Candyman cannot walljump, therefore he is able to jump higher.\n\nThere are also 6 levels, but here are some weakpoints the game has in my opinion. The levels are just backgrounds, there is no real interaction with what is going on in the front. For example there is a level where you are on a street. In the background you see a tank(at least it looks like one to me) and buildings. Wouldn't it be awesome, if these elements would come into play, for example the tank shoots one of the buildings and rubble is coming down and affects the ball or makes you go away from certain areas? At least I would like that.\n\nAnother thing is that the graphical fidelity leaves a lot to be desired. While I dig the artstyle that looks like jet-set radio in 2D, the backgrounds just don't really look that good.\nWhat is great though is the animations quality which give you a nice feel of the velocity of the ball and let the controlls feel really good. It also has to be noted that the stop motion moments when hitting a very fast ball are extremely funny and change depending on what level you are currently at.\n\nThe game also features a progression system which lets you unlock new colouring for the playable characters.\n\nLast, but not least, let's talk about the soundeffects and the soundtrack. The soundeffects are quite nice and there is a nice variety on sound cues available. The soundtrack itself features different artists. To be honest, it is not my style of music, but I found it really fitting and enjoyable at times.\n\nHaving not tried the multiplayer yet, there is one big component missing, but from what I've heard, the netcode is working fine, only disconnects seem to make big trouble.\n\nNow to the conclusion: Is the game worth it? In my opinion there is a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had in this game, especially when you have 3 other to people to play and talk with in Skype or Teamspeak. It is easy to learn, but hard to master(I normally hate these sayings, but when it's true I can't help it). So even if you are not that good at the game, you might be able to get your enjoyment out of it.\nThe only thing, people might be turned off by is the graphics, but in my opinion this game is a case of gameplay beating graphics in terms of making a joyful experience.\nThe price is 12€ or your regional equivalent. Buying a 4 or a 2 pack is even more recommended, because of the reasons that are stated above.","August 27, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","0"

It sounds simple enough, but you have to time your hits.. just right, and online play can be a bit rough. It does seem to be pretty active, even late at night with online play. Log on at 1AM find a match, during the day, find a match, so on and so forth. Downside to this game is it allows people that can be way outside of your region to join which can make the games sometimes laggy.\n\nOnline play, Offline Multiplayer, andd. Challenge mode! Got it all for $5, and although there is better games out there.. this is the only one that I am aware of that plays the way it does. It's unique, and definitely worth it to get it during a sale price.\n\nGoodluck and have fun if you decide to get it :)\n\nUpdate: Game is fun yes, but after playing more there is way too many laggers, too much game crashing, and the people on the forums are rather condescending to those stating facts. Heck. Even some long-time players agree that hte game crashes way too much. Not exactly promising it would get fixed. Also, gets a bit repetitive. It's fun.. but not fun enough for a thumbs up anymore. I'll still play it on occasion, but meh.\n\nSide note: Being taunted by laggers in games is kind of annoying too. It's like. "Hey, you're bad but in reality i'm the lagger that can't get a good connection." and no, i'm not referring to those that are not even close to your region, i'm talking those in the same area as you that somehow have a ridic ping.","January 6","false","11.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

In the early days there was Windjammers. A discthrowing 1v1 pong-like game in a form of a fightinggame with different specialmoves and characters.\nThis game on the other hand takes those Ideas and give them a new look and feel and resembles one of the most unique games of this decade.\n\n\n#### What are we doing exactly? #####\nThe goal of the game is getting a ball to hit your opponents. You can hit the ball in many directions and the ball is bouncing of the walls. There are different attacks and specials you can do to speed up the ball or causing it to change directions.\n\n####### Gameplay ######\nSmooth as butter. Easy to learn, hard to master. You can get relatively far with just playing with feel and a little bit random button presses. But if you learn how to combo, parry and reducing your hitlag, you can get constant wins.\n\n####### Graphics #######\nThe graphics are completely 2D. It looks like it was done by MS Paint, but it has its own funky style. The graphics are snappy and look good. Especially the effects when you hit the ball as it reaches the speeds of  max 1000000pixel/s (I think thats the speedindex)\n\n####### Balance ########\nThe game seems to be well balanced. Every character is different and has a specialattack and peculiarities like walljump, doublejump, wallclinging and driving across the ceiling with a skateboard. Also the angles, in which the ball flies after a hit, are different aswell. Because it is more about how you handle the ball, i don't think there will be overpowered characters.\n\n####### Network ########\nThe netcode is powered by ggpo. You can feel how good the netcode is.. even with 4 players it's smooth as hell. There are some hickups, witch result in disconnects, but considering the age of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if the game got some updates to fix this. After all it's just a little annoyance, which is forgotten after you desperately try to reconnect to the massive fun. (which is fast anyway)\n\n###### Conclusion ######\nThe game is a must-have. The fun we had in just 6 hours was tremendous. The game is best played with 4 players, in a 2v2 teammatch.","August 27, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
