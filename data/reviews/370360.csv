You will *love* TIS-100. Yes, you will type CODE in this game. Easy code, but it's code nonetheless, like MOV and SWP and SAV and so on.\n\nBecause you're trying to "test" this machine with bazillion little processors... by writing little programs in little CPUs, and the little CPUs have to talk to each other. Instead of rotating shapes and link atoms, you're moving numbers and popping registers and moving them through ports.\n\nAnd yes, this is intentionally looking like messing with the 80 column text days, And before you ask, yes, there's a meta game... you're trying to figure out the origin of this piece of hardware... by unlocking more bits of the little CPUs, dump the microcode, and solve the mystery...\n\nIf you understand the concept of registers (and it's rather simple to visualize, but there's always a debugger to help you), then this game is a lot of fun. Though being Early Access, this doesn't have the solution site like SpaceChem but it's probably getting there soon.\n\nAnd this is VERY good exercise for people who intend to get into computer hardware engineering.\n\nHighly recommended... if you dig this genre.","June 5, 2015","true","265.9"," 257 of 262 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","257","262","20","5"

In TIS-100, you're managing data flow: you get a pre-connected network of computing nodes (that look remarkably like a downscale version of  a 1980s Transputer[en.wikipedia.org]) that can be programmed using 13 simple commands (assembler opcodes). Each node has space for 15 commands and two pieces of data, which isn't a lot. (There's a stack memory node later.) You typically get a list of input data provided to your network, and there's a list of output data it must generate, usually based on some simple rules. For example, the input data might be groups of numbers separated by zeroes, and you need to send the sum of each group to one output and size of it to another. There's also a storyline included, but who cares.\n\nMy theory is that TIS-100 stands for tis-ioo, or tease you, because that's what it does: as in Spacechem, you don't just solve the problems and move on, but you can optimize them for speed, code size, and node count, and compare your performance to your friends or general statistics.\n\nProgrammers take to this game like a duck to water. If you have no prior programming experience, this game is probably going to be quite tough, and Spacechem might be a better game for you. (If you've already played Spacechem, that counts as programming experience. ;-)\n\n\n\n-------------------------\nP.S.: On TIS-100 as a learning tool (from one of my forum posts):\n\nBranching, loops or repetition or data storage are the tools you need to learn imperative programming concepts, and TIS-100 and SpaceChem have them. TIS-100 even has a stack as a generic data container, and both games have synchronous data transfers.\n\nWhat I mean to say, when I recommend this for people who want to learn programming, I have more in mind than just the logical thinking - you need more than that to be a good programmer. I tutor programming courses, and I have seen people who didn't have programming experience struggle with these concepts, get familiar with them, and become able to design simple algorithms and implement them correctly. They don't just struggle with the language or the logic: they struggle with branches and loops and data storage, and experience with these (while having the brain turned on) helped them get better.\n\nYou won't be an ace programmer after completing TIS-100, but I'm certain playing it teaches quite a lot of central programming concepts.","July 26, 2015","true","51.0"," 249 of 255 people (98%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","98","249","255","12","13"

Unfortunately much of the operating system’s code is corrupted — despite your late uncle’s best efforts to repair it — rendering the computer's origin and purpose a mystery.  Now that your curiosity has been piqued, will you be able to finish his work and figure out the reason for its existence?\n\nIf the synopsis doesn't intimidate you then the game’s front end probably will.  It is an assembly language programming interface and you must come up with the code required to solve the conundrums it presents.  These problems often seem deceptively simple to resolve, and initially they are, but thanks to the limited number of instructions available on such an archaic system — not to mention the limited space to enter code — they quickly become very challenging.  As far as puzzle games go, TIS-100 makes Sudoku look about as threatening as noughts and crosses... but that is not a criticism; the complexity is what makes it so good.\n\nYou just have to understand before buying that it gets very hard very quickly, and any satisfaction comes out of learning new concepts and solving the problems yourself.  This sometimes involves spending considerable time making notes and devising solutions on paper because the mental gymnastics required of you occasionally get too much.  Yes, it can be frustrating, but it’s a fantastic feeling when the solution finally hits you.  I even had a couple of great Scott[i.imgur.com] moments while taking a bath and ended up rushing — stark-naked and dripping-wet — to my untrusty TIS-100 for that much sought-after rush.\n\nObviously this game will appeal to programmers more than most, but such credentials aren't essential.  You’re just as likely to enjoy it if you got good grades in maths and are partial to number puzzles.  On the other hand, I’ve come across users who don't fit this profile and love the game, but for this type of person I think the initial purchase will always be a gamble.\n\nConsequently, I give TIS-100 a glowing recommendation but with the caveat that it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea.","February 9","true","43.8"," 147 of 150 people (98%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","98","147","150","16","4"

Once you start the game, you actually just virtually start up the TIS-100 machine (e.g. you'll get a boot screen and the like).\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, the game is entirely text-based, but the beauty of the game lies in what happens in your mind. Zachtronics managed to keep things interesting from the outset, hinting at a mystery lying somewhere in the machine and prompting you to print out the manual as first thing (something I truly encourage, too).\n\nThe TIS-100 architecture is made up of several different nodes (small square panels). You generally get some values as input and you have to handle/modify them in order to obtain the required output. As in SpaceChem, there are of course several limitations which will hamper your task: each node can contain up to 16 lines of code, you must synchronize the communication over the port between nodes... you get the picture.\n\nI played through 6 levels, and things are beginning to get spicy. I'm perfectly aware that this game "isn't for everyone" but what Zachtronics game was? If you liked SpaceChem and are interested in low level programming, you'll fall in love with this game. If you haven't tried SpaceChem and are unsure if pure programming might appeal to you in the long run, I would suggest starting off with SpaceChem or Infinifactory, before moving on to TIS-100, because they probably feel more "fun" in the traditional sense of the word.\n\nTL;DR If you are interested in low level/assembly programming, this game will probably be a great way to have fun with it. :)","June 2, 2015","true","24.4"," 101 of 104 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","101","104","4","4"

Looking at the first screenshot here on Steam should show you the level SEQUENCE COUNTER. In the upper left corner you have your task. The 12 squares that take almost all of the screen are "nodes", independent CPUs that you can program freely with up to 15 instructions each. The arrows between them are "ports" that allow you to move data between nodes. There are also input and output ports at the top and at the bottom of the screen, respectively. Your program has to stand four tests, three with predefined inputs and one with random values. You can see the given inputs and expected outputs on the left in the screenshot.\n\nThe programming language used is some very basic form of assembler consisting of just 13 opcodes (compared to the several hundred of a real Intel x86) . If you got prior programming experience or even worked with assembler, then this should be quite intuitive. For me it was definitly easier than the geometric approach of SpaceChem, Zach's previous game. Without any knowledge of programming the learning curve might be a bit steep as there is no tutorial, just a short manual. However, this should in no way discourage you. Pressing F1 brings up a quick reference of all opcodes and this game might actually enable you to understand the inner workings of a computer on a basic level so the educational value is immense.\n\nThere is another aspect to this game, beyond merely completing the tasks: Of course you can solve a level in many different ways but the real challenge is to find the "best" way to do it. This is where your wet OCD dreams come true. Each solution gets a score consisting of the number of CPU cycles your program took to complete, the number of CPUs you used, and the length of your program. The game keeps track of the minimum you achieved in each of the three categories separatly. So naturally you start coding up optimised solutions for each category. This is where the only shortfalls of the game become apparent. First, you cannot really see the exact world records (it's a histogram view) so you cannot tell if your solution is already best possible. Second, you can only save three programs per level. With three variables to optimise this leaves you no space to try out new things. The first issue is remedied by a reddit thread (see https://www.reddit.com/r/tis100/comments/391heb/table_of_lowest_cyclesnodesinstructions/) and the second can be worked around with manually copying and renaming solutions. But honestly, it's 2015 not the nineties, this shouldn't be necessary anymore.","August 11, 2015","true","651.0"," 62 of 62 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","62","62","5","0"

Therefore, I will primarily address the few remaining issues.\n\nYes, it is implemented well. Yes, the puzzles are chosen well across a good range of difficulty. No, the developer is not running a scam or otherwise objectionable.\n\n* Specifically, it does have more jump instructions than strictly necessary, both subtraction and negation, and some pseudoports. These improve the optimization possibilities drastically and the "power" of the language quite slightly. It also has comments, labels, and human-readable names for instructions and ports because it's an exercise in cleverness, not cruelty.\n\nAccessibility: The game has no time pressure ever. The interface uses both the keyboard and a pointer. The interface doesn't require great precision with the pointer, but it does require entering a fair bit of text. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Only the puzzles involving the graphics module rely solely on color for identification; specfically, there's a single shade of red in addition to white, black, and two greys. It's visible in one of the screenshots on the store page. As a non-expert, I see only minor problems except for the blind, who could only possibly play with both an OCR-capable screenreader and immense patience.","June 12, 2015","true","19.2"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","63","65","5","0"

It's a parallel assembly language programming puzzle game on a fictional tiled CPU retrocomputer with simple (and limited) instruction set and IO resources.  The tutorial is a link to the (awesome) reference manual for the TIS-100.  The controls are little editor windows to type your assembly language programs into.  There is much fun to be had.\n\nThe instruction set is stylistically similar to real machines, but clearly chosen to be as minimally daunting as possible.  The focus is on simple arithmetic operations, basic flow control, and IO with adjacent CPU nodes or peripherals.  Amusingly, this simplicity may make it more challenging for people with actual assembly programming background in that solving these puzzles can involve approaching things in ways very different from how one might on a "real" computer.\n\nIt's probably most easily enjoyed by someone with a bit of programming experience, but the system is straightforward enough that someone interested in figuring out how things work should have a reasonable chance of doing so.\n\nBe sure to read the manual.  Really.\n\nAfter 20 hours of game time I've managed to solve all 20 of the original puzzles (a few of them are incredibly evil) and the secret puzzle that definitely was not added in the June 4th update.

SpaceChem and Infinifactory are among my favourite games of all time, and TIS-100 distills the SpaceChem formula into its most basic structure. It is a very basic looking game, considering its Assembly theme, but even with its limited focus, there is an incredibly diverse set of challenges here that will leave you scratching your head and forget about time while you work your programs bit by bit (pun alert) towards the the goal you need to achieve.\n\nThese games are challenging and trial and error wont get you far.

There is no addressable memory in this game. Each node has a space for you to put code in, an accumulator (ACC), and a single register (BAK, which cannot be addressed directly) to save and swap to. Storing and moving data around consists mostly of passing it between nodes using the MOV command and the "LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN" keywords, which can get incredibly complex and confusing later on, but it's the primary challenge of the game.\n\nAnyone who wants a unique, interesting, and difficult challenge will likely be satisfied with this game, especially those who have some experience or interest in programming.

Did you know you can hit escape to get a menu screen?  Well, it's not like the game tells you that or has a button to click that does that.

The .pdf even has a couple of sample programs to show how they're structured for those that are completely unfamiliar with it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can print the .pdf, staple the pages together, and leave it on your desk if you want to look like a genius to people who enjoy nosing through your stuff.\n\n"Hey man, what's this I found on your desk?" They ask curiously.\n\n"Oh, that old thing? That's just the reference manual for the tesselated intelligence system, I've already written sequence generator and signal multiplexer software for it. It's no big deal," You reply as you slick your hair back.\n\n"Wow dude, you're so smart. Here's a large bag of currency."\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's definitely not a game for everybody.

This game is taking my life over.\n\nIt started off with curiosity, turned into confusion and now into an obsession. I've gone to bed trying to work solutions out in my head.\n\nIf you've played SpaceChem you can grasp how difficult(but simple) this game can be. There's no single way to solve a puzzle, though you're compared to everyone else that plays the game, so you might realize your code isn't as efficient as other people's and it may make the obsession greater.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's just a basic coding with a proprietary language. You are given objectives and need to manipulate inputs to achieve a proper output.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand at all. Don't get frustrated though, it's got a learning curve, but it's worth doing.\n\nThe game comes with a PDF of a reference manual, if you've ever done any coding with proprietary languages, you've seen these. It's a neat little booklet that gives you all the commands and what they do. If you've never done any kind of programming, this will also seem pretty intense.\n\nPrint it out and keep it on your lap until you know how every function works.\n\nStorywise: It's there, I'm not far enough to go into too much detail, but your uncle picked this weird computer up at a swap meet and he's been tinkering with it trying to figure out how it works. He ends up dying and the reference manual ends up in your lap and you begin messing with it.\n\nOn the manual itself there's little notes and scribbles from your uncle as he was trying to figure it out, and there's some flavor text if you read it all.\n\nIn the game itself the stories are 'hidden' in corrupted cores of the program itself. You click "DEBUG" on these, and you'll see a journal entry from your uncle that gives some idea as to what's going on.\n\n\nThis game is a definite buy. Just stick with it, it's challenging but it's incredibly rewarding once you figure out how to solve the puzzle.\n\nIf you've ever been interested in learning how to program, this won't teach you anything immediately applicable. But it will put you into a decent mindset of how you have to think to write programs.\n\nEither way, buy it.\n\nEDIT: It's 3:30 in the morning, the last time i looked it was just after midnight. I just thought uncle Randy was neurotic and obsessive, but no there's something here....something calling to me....\n\nI need to sleep but I'm sure I can figure out what this machine is for, I seem to have accidentally tampered with the machine in some way, the instructions are scrambled...but I'm sure I've almost solved it....I'm so close....sleep later\n\nJust one more line of code","August 2, 2015","true","15.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

It's basically a puzzle game where you have to solve them. Let me now give you an overview of this game.\n\nThe storyYou play a guy that has recieved the TIS-100 system along with a reference manual from the aunt of another person, who has bought it from a dealer. There is not much information given about it. The manual states that it's suited for tasks such as financial trading and other interesting ones. The guy you play now tries to get familiar with the system.\n\nThe TIS-100 systemThe system consists of multiple interconnected segments. It's your job to fix broken segments. Each segment consists of multiple interconnected nodes. Each node can be connected to up to four other neighbour nodes (top, bottom, left, right). Each node can contain a program code which is limited to a small amount of lines. One or more nodes of a segment can be damaged and therefore not be used. There is a debug-button on a broken node, so far if I clicked on it a text with further story information appeared. The program code is machine code (low level, assembly). The instruction set is rather small, but enough. You can use registers to store data, but you can also store data to other nodes and then request them again. There is a TIS-100 reference manual provided which you can use to learn more about the system architecture. You can also debug your code e.g. by steping into, setting breakpoints and follow the transfer process. The instruction set consists of data movement, arithmethical, conditional and unconditional commands. You have three registers for storage (for each node), which have differences in terms of usage and other nodes can be accessed (read/write) via ports (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP). The reference manual states the exist of so called "Stack Memory Nodes", which behave like a stack you might know from Intel/AMDs FPU.\n\nThe puzzlesAs stated above you need to fix broken segments. The job you have to do is stated in the segment description. So far I had to perform input to output transfers whereby certain conditions might need to be fulfilled. There can be multiple possible solutions. If you solved a puzzle then at the end it shows you certain statistics such as how fast the program did run. So far you can develop up to three programs for each segment. It seems that you can also create own puzzles (refered as "specifications"), which are defined via Lua.\n\nDifficultyWell, this depends on the player. If you are a software developer in the manner of programming then this might be rather easy for you. Better, if you code good enough in assembly then this will be very easy for you. The game instruction set is rather minimalistic so you surely will start solving the puzzles after a very short amount of time.\nIf you are new to programming and stuff then you might need longer to start solving puzzles because you first need to get an understandment of how you do stuff.\nI personally do reverse engineering, programming in assembly and C++ (and some more stuff), so I've started solving the puzzles after a very, very tiny amount of time.\nFor the difficulty of the puzzles I've to say that I've only tried the first four puzzles so far, but I guess they will be harder each time so try it out yourself. ;-)\n\nEducational impactI would suggest this game also for educational purposes. It can help you to get a feeling how low-level programming works due to the nature of computer systems. Also tricky puzzles can definitely be considered as congitive training like other games (e.g. Sudoku).\n\nConclusionI definitely recommend this game especially for people who are involved into computer science. But I also recommend it to "common players" who seek for challenges.\n\nHave fun playing this game! :-)","August 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

What most programming languages can accomplish in a single line of code (e.g. multiplication, division) may require two-to-three dozen instructions in this game. On its face, this concept sounds quite dull, but after working through the first few puzzles, you will find that it is pure magic. Each task stretches the brain immensely, and indeed, some of the later tasks may take several hours of thinking, programming, and debugging to solve. This perseverance ultimately rewards you with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound insight into the lowest-level workings of a computer.\n\nTo break much of the tedium of programming for hours on end, the game supplies an intriguing backstory into the nature of the TIS-100 computer system, communicated through several journaled entries by the previous owner of the fictional machine. My only gripe is that this story, despite all of its potential, simply does not provide enough depth to be satisfying. Whereas well-developed stories weave into the game seamlessly, motivating the player to continue playing in order to reveal more of the plot, this one seems more like a sideshow or distraction. Fortunately, the problems themselves are enticing enough to make TIS-100 a time-worthy game.\n\nAlthough programmers may have an easier time adjusting to the practice of writing pseudo-assembly code, those without coding experience need not be intimidated by the game. Zachtronics did an excellent job keeping the language itself as simple as possible, while still crafting complex problems with multiple possible solutions. I would genuinely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles that require deep thinking, programmers with an interest in low-level code, and individuals who revel in finding more efficient solutions to problems they have already solved.","March 1","true","38.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

However, you don't need to know programming to understand the game. It certainly helps, but this game is less about writing code and more about the logic processes involved in building a solution. If you have a logical mind and enjoy puzzles, this game may be for you. If you enjoy programming, this game is most definitely for you.\n\nThe game uses a fictional implementation of an assembly type language. You get a manual in PDF form. Yes, you have to read a manual. It's not complicated though, as there are only a handful of operations available to you. There's enough to allow for interesting solutions yet limited enough to make the game challenging. A very good balance between the two, I'd say.\n\nRegarding the puzzle aspect, you're expected to work with nodes, each only allowing a limited number of lines and containing two memory registers (no addressable memory!), only one of which can be actively accessed for read/write operations. As a result, you need to structure your program around these limitations, perhaps by breaking it down into various components.\n\nThe problems are varied and quite grounded in real-world applications (sequence peak detector, histogram, etc.). The game is simplistic and doesn't hold your hand, but the problems are organized such that there's a clear difficulty curve as you progress. The curve should be quite manageable for those with prior experience in programming.\n\nThere are also leaderboards so you can compare how efficient your solution was compared to your friends, because who doesn't like improving?\n\nWholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who loves programming.","January 1","true","10.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I feel that the assembly language can be very limiting at times (only 15 lines allowed), and I'm used to using way more than 2 registers (only one of which can be directly accessed) in real assembly programming, so it's pretty challenging. But, it's challenging in a pretty fun way, and the way the computing nodes work mean that you can use other nodes as extra registers, caches or for more complex architectural things like pipelining (instruction-level parallel processing) or a multiprocessor system (albeit a very limited one).\n\nGame is pretty short, but still worth the money in my opinion.","November 4, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Programming has always been my weak point, due to its seemingly impermeable complexity; I don't think like a computer, and real programming language's mnemonics often make very little sense without researching and understanding a much deeper and intricate reason.\n\nThis game is, simply put, QUITE AWESOME. It takes an extremely limited set of assembly mnemonics, and gives you an extremely limited, highly multithreaded enviromnet, and offers a clearly defined objective to achieve. The puzzles are not easy; in fact, these are some of the hardest puzzles I've had the pleasure of solving. The difficulty doesn't arise from the complexity of the task or obfuscation of the methods; no, it comes from the fact that you have such limited resources to achieve the goals. A normally simple and trivial multiplication program can easily become extremely challenging when you can only add, subtract, a stack memory (automatically pushes and pops), and a handful of conditionals. VERY fun and engaging!\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to be able to break that initial impermeable layer of programming. Make no mistake, it will not teach you programming, at least, not in the normal sense; but it will help you to wrap your mind around the methods and semantics of programming within an extremely limited set of resources.\n\nA++ all around!","August 21, 2015","true","31.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The learning curve does have a little bit of a sharp turn on node 6, but it does continue to build on what you've learned before that and introduce more complexity as the game continues. The language is wonderfully simple, containing only the most basic of required assembly instructions. The limited program space in each processor contributes significantly to the difficulty of more complex programs, requiring the use of multiple processors to implement an algorithm and thus encouraging the use or parallel processing for increased speed. The display of statistics relative to other players after each successful run really inspired me to revisit completed nodes to improve efficiency, either of processor cycles or total instructions - definitely encouraging the traditional hacking mindset!

So let's pay 7 bucks and buy a game where you have to learn a new assembler language to solve friggin' signal processing problems. Of course no one asked for this game. Of course I don't want to code after a long day. Why would I buy this game? If I want a coding challenge I can actually just go and work.\n\nSo, naturally I bought the game. What am I doing with my life? Well, here goes nothing...\n\nI have a TIS-100 type model which is a complete mystery. It comes with a 14-page instruction manual which is surprisingly immersive, no mentioning that this is a game and all. The manual explains what's going down and how to code on the nodes, adding some handwritten notes from my dead uncle Randy. Too bad, he was a cool guy, I guess. Of course there are references to works that explain the architecture in more detail. Sadly those documents are not supplied so I'm left guessing on that end.\n\nThe language is super easy. It emulates a very low-spec version of an assembly language. It has a total of 13 instructions involving simple conditionals, arithmetics and I/O operations. You even have some labels to build loops and gotos inside a node (although the ability to push to more than one node offers cool loop mechanisms, too). You even get a rudimentary debugger (breaking points and cycle-wise forwarding) that makes bugfixing easy.\n\nMy job is to repair corrupted segments of code in the machine to unlock... more segments. In each level there is a themed puzzle (first creating simple things like sequencers, then you detect signals from noise and later you are actually decrypting stuff). Puzzles are solved by writing machine code that solves a given objective. Feels like first semester home work all over again. Yay. All the segments come with debugging messages that have nothing to do with debugging (they are flavor texts revealing some background info about the meta game) and in the end I got a great reveal what the fuzz was all about.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with writing code this game will probably drive you crazy (no tutorial but the manual). If you have a basic idea how assembly works you are fine. If you are coding on a daily basis and buy this game... you're probably insane.\n\nOther than that I think the idea of the game is kind of cool, although it's very short for 7 bucks. A few additional puzzles would've been great, it was surprisingly entertaining solving them. I would talk about graphics but there are none. I should talk about sound but there's a total of 4 different sounds in the game, so... Yeah, sound's cool. I recommend listening to death metal while playing it.","June 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As someone who has programmed in assembler for work and hobbies, The instruction set it pretty tiny and with them only an F1 popup away, easy to get used to. I like the scoreboards too to see how you did in terms of cycles executed, number of instructions and cores used. Reminds me of the Portal 2 challenege stats.\n\nIf you have zero programming experience you're probably going to have a hard time. (That's probably obvious with a programming game) If you're good at logic puzzles and can figure out how perform various math using only adding and subtracting, you'll probably be able to pick up on it fairly quick.\n\nI wish there was an ncurses version of this so I could run it in a real terminal window (something I could SSH to).\n\nIt definately makes me appriciate machines with multiple addressible registers though. It would be nice if I didn't have to manually open the PDF (Linux specific thing? xdg-open $filepath).

If however you are interested in learning new things and tackling challenges, go ahead.\nI'm not sure if I can recommend it to anyone who's not interested in programming though. But if you are, and are even remotely interested in a really nerdy game (not some pseudo-hacking like Uplink, which is a great game), pick this up, you won't regret it.\n\nAbout the gameThis game is about programming. Forget your HTML and Unity, this here is ASM, better known as assembler or machine code. Well, sort of.\nThe game begins with telling you to read the manual, which you should, even when you already know ASM. The game has some specific rules bound to the machine it's simulating. So you take 20min and read the manual, and after that you go through the panels in the game one by one and figure out solutions.\nIt's built like a puzzle game. You get certain tasks, you need to program the solution with the limited resources you're provided with. To ensure the solution is correct it's got a lot of test cases for every task. Only when all test cases succeed it's considered a success. Just your everyday programming stuff.\n\nStill not sure?The tasks start relatively easy, but pick up the difficulty quite quickly.\nHere's an easy one:\nYou have two inputs and two outputs. Send Input A - Input B to Output A; send Input B - Input A to Output B. You move some values around, you subtract, no big deal, easy fun times.\nHere's a little more difficult one:\nYou have one input and one output. A series of values is sent through the input. Whenever the current value is at least 10 away from the previous value, send 1 to output, else send 0 to output. This one took me a while, but I felt like a boss when I got it. I dare to say most people who are not into programming will never find the solution.\nYou have multiple nodes for developing solutions, each node can contain 15 lines of ASM instructions, each node has two places for memory. You can move values through the registers, you can set jump points, you can react if a value is less than 0, equals 0, or is greater than 0, you can negate values. That's about it.\nBy now you should know if this game is for you.\n\nThe VerdictI'm a programmer myself, but on high level languages. I've taken a look at ASM before, but when you don't implement it a couple of times you'll just have trouble imagening what it could be used for, and how. This game gives you plenty of examples. I have tons of fun with it, even though I just stare at the screen and think for 10min at times. This game is something else, you won't find this very often. I'm very glad it exists, because it teaches me a few things.","July 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Other than that, you are given no other direction on how to play. There are currently 20 programs that you must write, starting with fairly simply MOV operations to sequence counters to sequence detection, etc. Each program has a short list of instructions that you must follow to complete the program and move on.\n\nI've spent about a good afternoon straight playing and gotten to level 11. The program difficulty is increasing significantly with each passing level, so I have no doubt that it will take quite a bit longer to beat.\n\nAnyway, I fully encourage any programmer to give this game a try.

A word of caution though: it is not for the faint of heart, and there is definitely a learning curve with respect to some of the operations and behaviors, even (and perhaps especially?) for players with some experience.

Without that irritating business value -thing that haunts you all day long!\n\nTIS-100 provides just what it promises (with a guaranteed Zachtronics quality) - nothing major hidden suprises there (apart from the story). Just the wonderful tickle of satisfaction when you see your hard worked solution finally working! With those ridiculous constraints! Worth every penny even when not on sale.\n\nIf you look at this and think you might want it - yeah, you definitely want it!\nFor the wider audience, propably not so much.

If that sounds strange to you, then you may want to stay away from this one...\n\nThe TIS-100 architecture is easy to learn, but hard to master. The puzzles are well designed, rewarding, and they will reveal a mysterious sub-plot as you progress. After successfully completing a puzzle you will see metrics on your code (resources used, efficiency, etc), and you can compare your stats to other players. There is a slight learning curve, and the difficulty seems to increase endlessly, so you don't have to worry about running out of challenges.\n\nI may never complete all the puzzles, but that won't stop me from firing up this game and hacking away at some difficult puzzles to kill some time. If you get tired of trying new puzzles, you can always go back to your old sequences and challenge yourself to see how much you can optimize them by rewriting their code.","November 30, 2015","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A word of caution though: it is not for the faint of heart, and there is definitely a learning curve with respect to some of the operations and behaviors, even (and perhaps especially?) for players with some experience.

Overall community statistics are provided for each puzzle.\n+ The grades above provide plenty of replayability: there's always a way to shave off a few more cycles!\n+ The parallel CPU architecture provides a unique twist on typical assembly programming.\n+ It's very satisfying and rewarding to solve the complicated puzzles.\n+ Since when were engineers given black-and-white software requirements?\n\nCons:\n- Steep learning curve, particularly if you have no programming experience.\n- For the nerds: the program memory implementation is rather annoying, even whitespace, labels, and comments (ha!) use up valuable memory. I would enjoy the game much more if you were limited by the number of instructions instead. Have fun with your wall of unformatted code in some puzzles!\n\nFor the nerds:\nI'd highly recommend this game if you have a passion for programming. You likely won't have any issues  conceptualizing the overall puzzle solutions. Your challenge will be optimizing those solutions or figuring out how to implement them on the limited/unique CPU architecture.\n\nI never thought I'd work with something that makes 1980s era microcontrollers look powerful. You're in for a treat when you realize you only have one addressible working register available per CPU core! I died a little on the inside when I found myself repurposing cores as primitive RAM/register modules...\n\nFor the less nerdy:\nThis game will have a steep learning curve if you aren't familiar with basic programming concepts. With that said, the game has a simplified model and anyone with a logical mind could pick this up. The puzzles almost always have simple (albeit naive from a programming standpoint) solutions available. I'd recommend the game as long as you're willing to learn, the struggle will be rewarding.","December 27, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

TIS-100 takes this a step further: it is precisely parallel programming, and in an assembly language, no less. It's the purest of puzzle games.\n\nA game like this is necessarily rather narrowly targeted. I had, myself, created a little limited virtual machine (though not parallel) for playing with fake assembly before, so TIS-100 was just the thing for me. Programming in assembly can be a very fun challenge, since it requires you to really look at the very basic steps of a problem in order to orchestrate a solution.\n\nIf studying a puzzle under a microscope and writing a solution following fairly harsh restrictions sounds like fun, then you'll probably enjoy TIS-100. I certainly do. If that sounds like mindbending drudgery to you, then I suggest looking elsewhere.","June 15, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game takes no resources or graphics power, so a great game to just leave open as a fun distraction between (things).\n\nThe pacing is rather good once you get you grasp the UI and get your first basic application running.

SpaceChem and Infinifactory work you into the idea of solving complex temporal and spatial puzzles through a sequence of simple motions, and TIS-100 steps it up a notch by introducing textual syntax to it and adding additional layers.\n\nI've been working in assembly for a few years now and these puzzles will still make you swear, think and celebrate when you solve them. Given only a single directly accessible register is really the magic to this game, as even the most simple actions require multiple nodes to complete.\n\nThe progression is gradual enough to introduce people interested in the concept to what they are getting into, but ultimately the target audience are people who have some background in programming.","June 10, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, in order to justify its cost the puzzles have to be great.\n\nAnd they are, indeed. They are satisfyingly tough (much like SpaceChem) and unlike eachother, so each time is a new challenge.\n\nYet there are 3 flaws of the game, you are advised to know these before buying TIS-100.\n* The game is a little too short as of now. Hope it'll be extended until release.\n* No graphic interface means the mechanics of the game are much less intuitive. You need to rely on your memory. Not good if you want to take a break for a few months then come back, as you'll have to re-learn a lot of the stuff.\n* There are no intro levels and the manual isn't well designed for a person with no coding background, like me.

Especially if you've ever touched hex-code...*shudders*\n\nYou DONT need ANY programming experience whatsoever to enjoy this.\n\nThere are a handful of instructions that you can input to a node and you'll have memorised those by the end of the third puzzle. You will however need to play with them a bit to fully understand how the nodes cycle and what will cause a halt. I must say, despite being rather authentic, the manual doesn't really serve the same function a real manual for a machine of this type. There just isn't enough information about data flow and cyclic processes. This doesn't matter though, a few trial and error attempts at the first tricksy little puzzleses and you'll break through that wall.\n\nThis game will get into your head. Because the language is  so natural and simple, you'll start devising programs and sequences while you're at your real job, doing real work, with real code. Just to finish that puzzle that stumped you the evening before.\n\nI must reiterate that this is something anyone can play. You might be scratching your head by the 6th puzzle, but just keep your wits about you and you'll be able to do it. The payoff is a fantastic feeling of satisfaction we often don't get anymore. If you're unsure about how computers actually work and process information, this is a very good starting point to understand it, too!\n\nTwo thumbs up to the devs, stirling job.\n\nWish List!\n-Ambent fan and HDD noise, display hum? (preferably related to programs running)\n-'Retro' visual effects like curvature, scan and flicker (optional!)\n-More puzzles!\n-More Instructions\n-More Alternate output and input types (get inventive :D)","December 8, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've always thought of writing assembly as a type of puzzle game, so I consider this very fitting.\n\nZachtronics has created a new assembly language, consisting of 15 instructions, for TIS-100. The instruction set has some neat features but also includes severe limitations to make the puzzles more challenging. You don't have any bit shift, multiplication, division, or return jumps, but the puzzles are designed such that the absence of such features makes the puzzles challenging without feeling crippling.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the game pretends to have a story, but does not have a story. It teases you with elements of a narrative that are very cleverly composed and will have you itching to learn more, but at the end you are rewarded with _absolutely nothing_. One component of the ending is flashed to you once for a split second and then you are NEVER ALLOWED TO VIEW IT AGAIN, but you can look it up online to see it is nothing. There is also a secret level that rewards you with more nothing upon completion. It seems that Zachtronics excel at game design, but really need to hire a writer.","January 18","true","24.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this is an Early Access title, it certainly feels complete to me. I have nearly 7 hours in as of this review, and haven't finished half of it. This is another example of how completely engrossing video games can be made with almost no graphics (i.e. Sanctuary RPG).\n\nAs soon as you boot up this 'game', you are encouraged to print out a PDF 'manual' for this mysterious microcomputer found on your (recently deceased) uncle's workbench. You really do need to print it out, mind you. This manual reads exactly like the cliff notes for a simplified programming language - it is essentially the tutorial for the game. It has charming hand-written notes and highlights that your uncle made. It really builds mystery in an elegant way.\n\nProtip: If you take the plunge with this title, be sure to stay away from the forums - the best part is figuring out the puzzles for yourself!\n\nDon't get it twisted - this game is hella hard! It will make your brain twist in ways you didn't think possible. The only way I would not recommend it is if you have had previous experience with programming, and really hated it.\n\nSo do the indie gaming industry, and yourself, a favor - purchase this right away to support a great developer and get yourself an absolutely fantastic game. I very much look forward to whatever else is in store for this title!","June 7, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I can´t recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more.\nDon´t get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches it´s limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible.\nAnd what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to it´s mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.\n\nSo what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module.\nHaving to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.\n\nNow maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it:\nYou appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it.\nYou will have fun and enjoy the game but if you´re looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...\n\nPS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it.\nPSS: If you´re looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if you´re a non beginner). Just message me that you´re interested and we work out the details.\nThis offer only counts for Java.","July 27, 2015","false","3.9"," 58 of 120 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","58","120","0","11"

Unfortunately, there are a few major flaws that detract from the overall experience and turned "fun" into "frustration."\nFirst and foremost would be the lack of any tutorial. The game relies on you taking time to read the manual and if you try jumping right in, you will be lost. Unfortunately, the manual relies heavily on the reader having some experience with programming and is often needlessly opaque in its language. Essentially, it's a chore to read. The first couple of levels get progressively harder, which is a great way to get acquainted with what the game wants you to do. Unfortunately, as I said before, not everything is well explained in the manual so you may find yourself "missing" key commands you need to get through a puzzle.\nSecond problem (at least in my opinion) was the format of the game itself. You have fifteen puzzles to solve, and you unlock more as you complete the prior ones. Although this concept itself doesn't bother me, the way the game is set up doesn't give me much replay value. It relies heavily on you going through later and optomizing your code, something that I am ambivalent to. I do not hate optomizing code, but it's not something I enjoy, and certainly not what I want all of the replay value of the game to consist of.\nThe story is interesting, and I do like the way it is integrated into the gameplay. I also like that you have blocks that you can't use and have to work around, unfortunately these two things could not salvage the experience for me. It all boils down to a boring manual, little replay value (for myself), and little opportunity to create your own stuff with the code (as what you are given is very limited in scope).\nThis is by no means a bad game, but unfortunately, it just wasn't the game for me and as such, I cannot recommend it.","December 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","2"

It's not really looking for what's wrong with exisiting code.  Since you're just writing programs to do things, why not just actually make programs that do actual things?\n\nI'll play a bit more and later update my review if my ideas change, but like all Zachtronic games so far, it seems more like work than a puzzle to me, because it just requires you to do increasingly complicated things, not to be clever.","December 7, 2015","false","12.7"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","10","25","2","6"

I suppose it's in early access so more puzzles should be coming later.\n\nSome of the remaining puzzles are pretty hard, and I didn't feel inclined to solve them because:\n\nThere is no space to write any comments.  There should be space on every single line to write a comment.  I'd walk away to get something to eat and come back and it would take a while to remember what I was trying to do.\n\nJust trying to swap 2 numbers to solve e.g. the sorting puzzle is next to impossible because of the very limited instruction set.  An insert sort can be done in 3 lines of C code, but forget trying to do an insert sort on a TIS-100.\n\nThe multiple CPUs running in parallel is interesting although you only ever get to use 12 at most.  Most of those 12 will be running idle though because in many cases you will be using them merely as memory storage, since there are no OP codes to access RAM.  So in the end you only ever write 1 or maybe 2 threaded programs that can only use a couple of variables,  There are real computers out there with a similar architecture to the TIS-100 (e.g. Adapteva Epiphany) and solving the given puzzles on one of those would be a lot easier, and you'd be learning a real computer instead of a fake one.","June 13, 2015","false","10.6"," 104 of 253 people (41%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","41","104","253","20","18"

You should be warned that you need to type out what you want to do to solve a problem. That means you need to watch out for your syntax. It is difficult, there is a steep learning curve to newcomers to programming. Don't let that discourage you, this could be an amazing learning experience.\n\nStory: There is a cute little story line that runs through the puzzles. It adds flair to what may seem to be a pretty bleak interface. But that bleakness, along with the story add to the charm of the style of the game.\n\nVisualization: It is a seriously fun game if you are interested in programming in any way. And while it may seem to be a "game" only for programmers, after a while you will begin to see the flow of information and realize that there is some great graphical elements that give you feedback. But you need to look for them in how the nodes communicate, and what is in the node at any given time.\n\nReplayability: I've nearly beat the main part of the game. And at first it seems like everything goes fast, but the challenges grow. If you worry about replayability, there is options for optimizing your puzzle solutions in 3 different ways. Then you can compare your solutions performance to your friends. I think this game is best played with a friend to talk about it with and push you to work harder. Not only that but there is a whole second set of puzzles available, which I've not even touched on yet. There is also some fun challenges through achievements that in some cases require a bit of creativity.\n\nTeachers should probably assign this game as homework. Better yet, classwork.\n\nTL;DR: Loved it. Great for problem solvers.","November 3, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The manual is short (14 pages, some with only a few lines of text) but a little bit of a memorization grind until I went back and read things a couple times and really thought about the code examples they were showing.\n\nMajor props for them making the "manual" a game artifact though, with the notes and highlighted portions - that actually really helped make it feel less like a chore.\n\nIf you've never touched a line of code in your life, I'm not sure the manual alone is enough.

TIS-100 is an exception to this rule. Yes it has a rudamentary graphical interface which is styled in the command line aesthetic, but it's not trying to be visually appealing like undertale or terraria. It's functional, and that's all that it's really there for. TIS-100 is therefore unusual because the pure and distilled form of a game; that is: something that has rules and a winning condition.\n\nThe rules are simple, and well laid out in the manual which accompanies the game. They are simple commands that can be used to manipulate data in a certain way. I have no background in programming or coding and I could quite easily understand them.\n\nThe goals are also simple, you have to take input(s) and turn them into output(s) using the commands laid out in the rules.\n\nThe solutions however, are anything but simple. You have to think through problems to use simple logic to come up with ingenious solutions to the problems. However, after the first few puzzles, you will likely be left scratching your head for a bit. But this is the best part of the game! You keep at it untill you find the solution and a glorious stream of numbers are spat out from your code indicating that you have successfully achieved the goal. The feeling of reward when this happens is larger than i've felt in a game for a long time. The lack of hand holding in this game does make it difficult, but it only amplifies the rewards at the end of a puzzle because you'll have solved it all on your own. The puzzles themselves are varied, and the developer has clearly spent a long time devising them. There is also much replayability, as you can see how many commands and steps it took others to solve the puzzles, so you can try to optimise your own code to be like the best of them.\n\nUltimately, it's a game of pure logic. If that sort of thing floats your boat then I whole heartedly reccomend it. If you're more of a non stop action kind of gamer, or someone who just loves a good story, then you probably won't like it. Horses for courses, or courses for horses; which ever way round the saying goes.\n\n9/10","February 8","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how the complexity of executing the tasks in the puzzles are not hard themselves( most of the time) but the difficulty comes from the simplicity of the code and the confinement of the node. Since you only have 15 lines per node, you must use them wisely and since the code is very simple, you need to make shortcuts to move things around efficiently and correctly. There are 2 folders of puzzles and a steep increase in difficulty so you can be working for hours at a time. This game is really good at making you feel good when you fix a bug but not too demotivated when your code doesn't work properly. It even has a pretty cool story and really awesome secrets. Highly recommend to anybody, but especially if you have an interest in programming or you are really good at math.\n\nBtw, if you do but it, remember to read the manual VERY thoroughly(it will only help you in the future)\n\n15/10 PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL OR SOMETHING\nAnd would buy again and again and again","February 7","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One TIS-100 program includes code for each different "node" within the system. Regular processing nodes can pass data between them using registers, and each node has just two internal registers not used for passing values. There are also memory nodes wchich store data in a stack.\nThe format of numbers within the TIS-100 is very strange: values are from -999 to 999, which must require at least 12 bits but wastes one bit. It is impossible to do bitwise operations on these values. Additionally, there is no support for input or output of text characters within programs, but the OS does this somehow.","June 18, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zachtronics consistantly pumps out awesome super-open-ended puzzlers that aren't unlike programming machines. It started with The Bureau of Steam Engineering, KOHCTPYKTOP, and The Codex of Alchemical Engineering. All three are free flash games you can find on his site. Next came Spacechem, a true gem. Then came Infinifactory, which is not unlike Spacechem in 3D.\n\nNow we have TIS-100. This one is his first "literal programming" entry. Using somewhat-basic programming, your goal is to build a program out of commands that look similar to Assembly in order to take certain input numbers, manipulate them in some way, then output them. As a basic example, you might add two inputs together and output the sum.\n\nThe game is certainly built with a programmer in mind, and it uses a bunch of mini-environments rather than the usual single environment. As such, I would not recommend it to someone unfamiliar with programming, especially if you're looking to learn programming. However, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with programming experience, even if it's only a little experience.

Kind of reminiscent of A. K. Dewdney's Core War[en.wikipedia.org] I think.  If you've ever done any assembly language programming, or ever been interested in it, this game is a neat thing to play around with.  If you've never done any programming, you might want to google "assembly language programming" before buying this game.  This game will not be for everyone, but it's affordable, and worth a look.  I think this would be a nice educational tool for schools also.\n\nI think it visualizes what is happening in the debugger pretty well.  Some people have problems picturing registers, memory locations and so on, but the user interface here depicts how some of these kinds of things work well enough for an interested newbie to figure out.  I'm not an assembly guru, but I've had a bit of experience with Z80 and MC68HC11 years ago, and was able to get through the first three puzzles pretty quickly here.  To an oldtimer like me from the eighties, this game brings back some memories!\n\nIt also seems to have a little espionage/murder mystery element to it:  the manual pdf that is included has some background story, and clicking on the debug buttons in malfunctioning nodes appears to pull up some clues to the meta game aspect, although I haven't gotten far in that direction yet.\n\nFor a little flavor of the old days, check out The Story of Mel[www.catb.org]\n\nI recommend this game to anyone with an interest in computer programming.","June 10, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The debugger is quite useful and the limited architecture can make even simple tasks complex, which suits a puzzle game just fine. It also forces you to think in parallel if you want to get the best cycle times. Sometimes you can make a change that you think should improve times significantly only to see them go up because of a bottleneck you didn't notice. Sometimes you'll just be optimizing for size and stumble on something that speeds it up as well.\n\nAs far as the arch goes for real world applications, it does leave some stuff to be desired, there's several very simple tweaks that could be done to make things more efficient without adding much more silicon. However, since it's a game and not meant to be used for serious tasks, that's OK. Hopefully the experience with this will help teach people how they could use chips like the GA144 and various Tilera processors, if they are ever so inclined.","August 2, 2015","true","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TIS-100 is a programming-themed puzzle game of the same ilk, by which I mean it gives you a goal and tools and lets you figure out how you want to solve it. Will you go for least number of cycles spent, making your solution the most time/resource efficient? Or will you go for the solution that uses the fewest lines? Maybe you'd rather a more balanced solution? If you liked SpaceChem, chances are very good you'll like this.\n\nOne thing I like about TIS-100 is that instead of feeding you story in between levels, it's hidden in the manual and "corrupted" nodes for you to suss out as you go along. It really adds to the exploratory feeling you get from their recommendation that you print out the manual and the note on the front of the manual that sets the game up as being you tinkering with a dead relative's unfinished computer project.\n\nI'm really happy with this game.","August 7, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally prefer my games of this style to be more gamified(or obfuscated), meaning straight up using a limited programming language to build puzzles around doesn´t really work for me. I have done some programming before(really random training stuff) and as such TIS-100 very much felt like stuff I have done before, as opposed to Spacechem or Infinifactory that feel fresh.\n\nNow that said TIS-100 was plenty fun enough to (mostly)go through escpecially thanks to the early learning curve with the manual and such. But this was the first and last game that, for me, gets away with just using a simplified programming language for math puzzles. I know I have been and will continue to ignore Human Resource Machine because of this for example. If you have played that one prior you might still get quite a bit out of TIS-100 since this is a significantly harder game(from what I have seen), but be aware that the early/mid game stuff is going to be a whole lot of the same/similar math problems.","March 2","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely not a game for everyone. People who are into math and/or programming will appreciate it, but the rest might struggle with it. So be prepared to use the refund function in case it's simply not your kind of game.\n\nAnyway, TIS-100 is a game about writing ASM-like (Assembly) code to restore the TIS-100 system to it's former glory. The first thing it tells you to do when you open it is to RTFM, and trust me, you really, really want to do that. If you want a CTRL+Fable version, check out the Steam guide version available  here . For some people this might be a major turn off. Reading is hard, I guess. That said, a bit more in terms of an in-game tutorial would go a long way, and would help people get into the game, as they will have a better idea of what's actually happening. After that you get some easy levels to get you acquinted to the system and off you go, doing puzzles that are harder than the previous ones.\n\nThe code writing portion happens in a screen with 29x15(?) boxes, all of which operate as seperate "CPU cores". They have one data register and one backup register that can't be directly accessed (you need to swap values with the accessable register). This creates most of the challenge, as fitting code into that small amount of space is actually really damn challenging (and part of the challenge). Once you run the program, it will count the amount of cycles (or actions) it took to finish the tests, and that will be your score for your leaderboards (so you can compete with your friends for the most optimised algorithm I guess.). Less code does not always mean that it will be the fastest solution around because of how this game works. There are plenty of puzzles to be solved, and you can also make your own puzzles (in Lua). You can also find puzzles created by others on the internet, though, it seems that places you can find some are few in number.\n\nAnyway for things like graphics - what you see in the screenshots is what you get. The sounds also consist of a few beeps and the like, there's nothing much to it, so you can play it on a toaster (considering the Internet of Things trend, that's probably a thing that can be done). That said it does get boring after a while, but that might be just me. The feeling you get when you solve a puzzle is pretty amazing though, have to say.\n\nIn the end I would very much recommend this game, but only if you're into programming.\n\n\nI wonder if I can put "Can write TIS-100's ASM" on my resume...","March 7","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You should be warned that you need to type out what you want to do to solve a problem. That means you need to watch out for your syntax. It is difficult, there is a steep learning curve to newcomers to programming. Don't let that discourage you, this could be an amazing learning experience.\n\nStory: There is a cute little story line that runs through the puzzles. It adds flair to what may seem to be a pretty bleak interface. But that bleakness, along with the story add to the charm of the style of the game.\n\nVisualization: It is a seriously fun game if you are interested in programming in any way. And while it may seem to be a "game" only for programmers, after a while you will begin to see the flow of information and realize that there is some great graphical elements that give you feedback. But you need to look for them in how the nodes communicate, and what is in the node at any given time.\n\nReplayability: I've nearly beat the main part of the game. And at first it seems like everything goes fast, but the challenges grow. If you worry about replayability, there is options for optimizing your puzzle solutions in 3 different ways. Then you can compare your solutions performance to your friends. I think this game is best played with a friend to talk about it with and push you to work harder. Not only that but there is a whole second set of puzzles available, which I've not even touched on yet. There is also some fun challenges through achievements that in some cases require a bit of creativity.\n\nTeachers should probably assign this game as homework. Better yet, classwork.\n\nTL;DR: Loved it. Great for problem solvers.","November 3, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of the best I've played. I'm no assembly programmer; hell, I barely ever even write in C. This was all new to me, and it is extremely challenging. The reward from accomplishing the challenge is immeasurable. Maybe it's just me, but that is what I love about programming, and this one goes in all the way, allowing you to rethink your code, optimizing it for higher scores. Writing a comparater in assembly is something that is far more difficult than what I would normally do, but just learning a method to do it based on the manual is exhilirating. Naturally, this game is not for everyone, if you can't read a brief documentation manual while you play, or can't stomach programming, I honestly can't recommend this, you won't enjoy it. However, if you feel rewarded by completing something you previously did not understand, I highly recommend this.

In fact, the only thing keeping this game from being released already is just more puzzles -- note, this doesn't mean there isn't enough content to purchase the game already; the puzzles are not easy puzzles that can be completed within a few minutes. In order to play through this game, thinking is crucial. While many other puzzle games strive for this, TIS-100 is the only puzzle game that I can say truly forces you to think outside the box. Although this game might not be for you if you're not a fan of hard-thinking, concentration, and patience, it's really great fun for people looking for a challenging puzzle game that will have them stumped on every level. The developers have taken a very minimalist concept and created a fantastic game out of it. Throughout the game you'll find yourself trying to figure out how you've botched up the current level, only to realize that you completely overthought the entire problem and that the solution was right under your nose all along, which leaves you with a wonderful feeling of success as soon as you've finished it.\n\nFor you programmers out there: I cannot recommend this game enough.

Buy it and play it, it is worth it.\n\nThis is from an email I sent to someone recomending they buy this game.\n\nThis game is amazing, don't read too much into it or even really watch what it is about before I purchased it.\nThe experience of discovering it unspoiled is fantastic (that is if you enjoy puzzle logic games).\nI found out about it because I recieved an email (newsletter I think) from zachtronics, didn't read anything\nabout the game before I purchased it, and I have to say, I am glad I didn't\n\nJust a quick spoiler free description of the game:\nA relative recently passed away, his wife sent you a letter about a computer that was on his work bench (presumably the last thing he had been working on)\nThe computer is labeled TIS-100 (Tessaleted Intelligence Systems).\nThe TIS-100 contains a CPU that is massively parallel.\n\nEach level you are given a challenge to complete, you then program the separate cores in the cpu using a very simplified assembly language to achieve the specified goal.\nThe task is made difficult by each core only having 2 registers with only 1 accessable at a time. this promotes parallelisation in program design compounded by the fact that each core can only hold a certain (small) number of instructions.\nThis is where the puzzle aspect of the game emerges, tying together arrays of nodes to complete a seemingly simple task.\n\nIt is highly entertaining and gets quite challenging in the later levels. It is a good test of logic and very fun to see a simple program do complex tasks (and watching each cpu run is strangely hypnotising).\n\nIt gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you tie together a bunch of simple programs together to achieve a complex goal.\nEven simple goals give a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nas a side note, I spent around 4+ hours on one of the later levels and I still haven't completed the game.\nIt is one of those games that you put down and think about during the day and come back to later with an idea that could possibly work, usually you find out that the idea wont work because of the constraints (in this case the amount of instructions and the topological layout of the cores).","June 9, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sure is mine.  As a straight up warning, if logic puzzles aren't your thing, this game will be a drag for you.\n\nYou will need to read the manual.  There's no tutorial, and there is no in-game help.   Knowledge of actual assembler is helpful, but not required.  The ability to think logically and enjoy stepping through your program to see exactly what it's doing are requirements, however.\n\nFor each challenge, you are given your problem statement: take in data in this format, perform this operation, output this result.  You are given sample input data, and the expected output you would need to provide.  When you feel your program is ready, you run it, it's given the sample input data, and the output is checked against the expected.  If your program produces correct output, you pass -- if it produces incorrect output, the discrepancies are noted and you'll have to fix your program.\n\nThe challenge comes from the fact that the computer ostensibly running your program is laughably limited: 12 nodes, each of which has 2 registers (ACC and BAK) and can only contain 15 lines of code.  Op codes are exceedingly primitive as well: you only get 13 (no operation, move data, swap data, save data, add, subtract, negate, jump, jump if equal to zero, jump if greater than zero, jump if less than zero, and jump a number of lines).  At the higher levels, synchronizing communication between the nodes becomes an additional difficulty.\n\nIf the idea of implementing multiplication within these limitations intrigues you, you just might like this game.\n\nFinally, your program is graded on three criteria: number of nodes used, number of instructions used, and number of cycles used.  When it completes successfully, you'll be compared against the aggregate of those before you, which means even after you complete a problem successfully, you can be inspired to figure out smaller, faster ways of doing the task.\n\nThere's a minor backstory that's given in the flavor of the manual, and with most of the puzzles, but it's very small.\n","July 28, 2015","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One TIS-100 program includes code for each different "node" within the system. Regular processing nodes can pass data between them using registers, and each node has just two internal registers not used for passing values. There are also memory nodes wchich store data in a stack.\nThe format of numbers within the TIS-100 is very strange: values are from -999 to 999, which must require at least 12 bits but wastes one bit. It is impossible to do bitwise operations on these values. Additionally, there is no support for input or output of text characters within programs, but the OS does this somehow.","June 18, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zachtronics consistantly pumps out awesome super-open-ended puzzlers that aren't unlike programming machines.

Then came Infinifactory, which is not unlike Spacechem in 3D.\n\nNow we have TIS-100. This one is his first "literal programming" entry. Using somewhat-basic programming, your goal is to build a program out of commands that look similar to Assembly in order to take certain input numbers, manipulate them in some way, then output them. As a basic example, you might add two inputs together and output the sum.\n\nThe game is certainly built with a programmer in mind, and it uses a bunch of mini-environments rather than the usual single environment. As such, I would not recommend it to someone unfamiliar with programming, especially if you're looking to learn programming.

It's obviously inpired by programming for old processors like the Z-80. But there are a few things that make this something very different than a Z-80 simulator.\n\n1. The instruction set is *very* limited, mainly because there's no numeric "representation". So no rotates or shifts; no bitwise instructions. It's all just adding and subtracting integers.\n2. There are just two registers that you can store values in -- and one of these you can only access indirectly. Not a lot to keep track of.\n3. The machine consists of multiple processors that send numbers to each other in a very simple way. So a lot of the problems are ways of making numbers flow around. I feel like I'm only starting to grasp how this can be exploited to solve the problems.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that I'd like to be able to see some kind of global leaderboards or metrics, so I'd know if my solutions were decent.

Both the pain of learning to do *anything* with very little, and the joy of getting so much more done with even less. I think this is what the greybeards reminisce about when they talk about squeezing every last drop of utility out of a system.\n\nThere's a strong feeling of nostolgia, of being a 10 year old in front of an inscrutible console and nothing but an afternoon to kill. I'm not old enough to remember the old terminals, but I did have a 286 with just the DOS command prompt and no manual or clue in the world; the TIS-100 recreates that feeling of intellectual exploration. Where a task looks insurmountable or impassible and you just don't have enough memory, or space for code, or just the wrong node is broken... But you know it can be solved. Or if the solution is obvious, you know it could be *better* - faster, smaller, simpler.\n\nSo you just tinker with it, test ideas, and a solution forms. And then you refine it, and try newer ideas. Break things up, reinvent a few wheels. And while the computer cycles through your program watch what each algorithm does (espcially if nodes feed back to each other - you can literally watch execution bounce between chunks of code)!","September 1, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is sort of like SpaceChem in a programming-like wrapper.  To be clear, though, for those programmers out there: this game is a puzzle game first and an assembly language simulator second. Many features you might expect from an assembly language are absent here. That's not a bad thing, however. This makes the game more approachable for those who haven't programmed in assembly, or are relatively new to programming in general. I'd imagine that even non-programmers could figure this out without much trouble if they come at it with the same mindset as SpaceChem. Those who have some experience in assembly should feel right at home.\n\nLike SpaceChem, this game encourages an almost obsessive drive to optimize to reduce cycle counts, part usages, etc. The manual that is included (and that it suggests you print out) is probably the nerdiest thing ever, and I love it! It reminds me of some manuals like the Apple 1 and 6502 manuals from the 70s-80s. The manual is quite a bit sparse, though, with several pages left almost completely blank except for a brief header. I'm not sure if these are pages are left to take notes on or if they're going to be filled out more as the game leaves early-access. There are also far fewer puzzles than SpaceChem at the time of writing. There are tools for users to create their own puzzles, but I hope that more puzzles are added as the game develops. If you like SpaceChem, or techy puzzle games at all, this $7 game is well worth the price.","July 8, 2015","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are very challenging and the sandboxes are nice...\n\nWhat really hits me, though, is how genius the TIS-100 architecture is. Even though the game is still in Early Access, I can already see its potential in a simple dev board/kit kind of deal... Moving data in a spacial manner (left,down instead of core no. n) is IMO a very smart way of managing parallel data across many cores.\nTIS-100 is a great teaching aid in the pitfalls of multithreaded programming.. You know a race condition and a deadlock when you see one.\nSeriously, a TIS-style chip on the market could simplify many of the problems electronics hobbyists face...\n\nAlthough i'm already a programmer (and have done Assembly in the past), the language quickly sinks in. The simple interface makes it easy to debug and see what's going on the the cores.\n\nGreat and fun crash course for any programmer, or those aspiring to become one... ;)","July 8, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both the pain of learning to do *anything* with very little, and the joy of getting so much more done with even less. I think this is what the greybeards reminisce about when they talk about squeezing every last drop of utility out of a system.\n\nThere's a strong feeling of nostolgia, of being a 10 year old in front of an inscrutible console and nothing but an afternoon to kill. I'm not old enough to remember the old terminals, but I did have a 286 with just the DOS command prompt and no manual or clue in the world; the TIS-100 recreates that feeling of intellectual exploration. Where a task looks insurmountable or impassible and you just don't have enough memory, or space for code, or just the wrong node is broken... But you know it can be solved. Or if the solution is obvious, you know it could be *better* - faster, smaller, simpler.\n\nSo you just tinker with it, test ideas, and a solution forms. And then you refine it, and try newer ideas. Break things up, reinvent a few wheels. And while the computer cycles through your program watch what each algorithm does (espcially if nodes feed back to each other - you can literally watch execution bounce between chunks of code)!","September 1, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obviously inpired by programming for old processors like the Z-80. But there are a few things that make this something very different than a Z-80 simulator.\n\n1. The instruction set is *very* limited, mainly because there's no numeric "representation". So no rotates or shifts; no bitwise instructions. It's all just adding and subtracting integers.\n2. There are just two registers that you can store values in -- and one of these you can only access indirectly. Not a lot to keep track of.\n3. The machine consists of multiple processors that send numbers to each other in a very simple way. So a lot of the problems are ways of making numbers flow around. I feel like I'm only starting to grasp how this can be exploited to solve the problems.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that I'd like to be able to see some kind of global leaderboards or metrics, so I'd know if my solutions were decent. The leaderboards in the game apparently include Steam friends, but if you don't have a lot of friends that are into this kind of thing, it's kind of lonely ;).","June 12, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone who's spent their fair share of time writing code for 6502, 6809, and 68000 based machines, I felt right at home playing this one. The TIS architecture is extremely barebones, making the game interesting even if you're a veteran of many other CPU platforms. Problem difficulty curves nicely, starting out with problems which introduce the architecture of the machine and ramping up from there to some rather tricky puzzles. In addtion to the gameplay, the little bits of story and 80s esque manual are a nice touch to the rather barebones presentation. My only gripe is that the game locks up occasionally. I own a Mac, and do not know whether or not the game does this on other platforms.

It just has to do with how someones brain is wired and the way it goes about solving a problem.\n\nWith that in mind..... If you are one of those who can get through a basic programming class or two without scratching your head figuring out what a variable is and you enjoyed that programming then this game may be for you. It is a fun little program that runs you through several challenges that verry quickly increase in difficulty. Your purpose is generally to take a input and perform some sort of function or a series of functions upon it so you can find a output. The catch is you have a limited amount of space to write code. you can only store 1 or two varriables at a time, and moving varriables is verry limited. The ultimate purpose is to reach the output with the least amount of cycles (or turns), code, and nodes. If that is something you enjoy then come play with us nerds.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you like strange logic puzzles or if you love programming weird algorithms, buy it.

It's something that could have been made in the 80's, if we had fundamentally different assumptions about hardware design. Luxuries like multiple registers and programs more than 15 lines long are discarded in favor of easy visual debugging and a baffling degree of parallelism. Tasks that are trivial on reasonble hardware take careful consideration and lateral thinking on the TIS-100.\n\nThis is the best puzzle game i've played in years.

This game is about writing small assembly language programs in a tiny instruction set with a minuscule amount of memory.  Making a working program is not too hard for most of the puzzles, but optimizing them is extremely hard.  I've apparently played this 171 hours, and I haven't finished all the puzzles yet, let alone optimized them, so there is an enormous amount of value.\n\nThis is similar to Human Resource Machine, but quite a bit harder, much much longer, less visually produced (though still very attractive), and with somewhat different instruction sets and restrictions on memory use that make programs quite a bit different.\n\nTIS-100's main difference from standard assembly, other than the restrictions, is its quasi-parallel programming focus.  This is the game's chief conceit and it does play a huge role in the programs.  You will learn the main strategies for getting the twelve processors to work together, and to send data and signals between them, by playing the first several levels.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys programming.

I can happily say that this game is all logic. If you've spent the last 5 years playing nothing but CoD, your reactions will be great, but that won't matter at all in this game. This game is all about thinking through a situation (often step-by-step).\n\nSo, for the people that don't know, the game is about writing lines of their simplified version of assembly inside of (relative to modern machines) tiny nodes with specific objectives for every 'segment' which you can call a level, I suppose. The objectives for each level range from easy to head-banging-into-keyboard hard. The game does have a story, but to be honest, I haven't payed on ounce of attention to it, although I've heard it's at least decent, so there's that.\n\nThe main thing that makes me want to review this game so well, is that it's challenging in an interesting way. Dark Souls, for example, is challenging for multiple reasons (one being the game just hates you) primarily revolving around reacting quickly. I'm not saying that this is an inferior skill to have, I'm just saying the thrill is immediately taken away when you go to try again, and you know what's going to happen, because it already happened. This game is completely different. If you fail at a level, you still haven't figured out the logic required to solve the (often real world related) problem. You can't just try once, fail, get the answer, succeed. To succeed in this game you need to apply logic, which, as any programmer will tell you, is essential.\n\nNow, I'll say this now: I haven't finished the game... Yet\nI did say it's difficult. I'm an experienced programmer, but have only touched real assembly about 4 or so times. I imagine someone who has written assembly for 80+ years, helped invent the language, and practices it every morning in the mirror, might not have too much trouble with these problems, but what the rest of us are left with is an excellent, difficult, educational, 'puzzle' problem solving programming game.\n\nIt's hard to write a 'review' of this game because it knows exactly which crowd of people it wants to advertise to, and if you jumped at the though of a game where you write a basic version of assembly, you are in that crowd.\n\nTL:DR\nDifficult, educational, and completely logic oriented game that anyone interested in programming should pickup, and those people should try Python (language) too!","December 30, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obviously inpired by programming for old processors like the Z-80. But there are a few things that make this something very different than a Z-80 simulator.\n\n1. The instruction set is *very* limited, mainly because there's no numeric "representation". So no rotates or shifts; no bitwise instructions. It's all just adding and subtracting integers.\n2. There are just two registers that you can store values in -- and one of these you can only access indirectly. Not a lot to keep track of.\n3. The machine consists of multiple processors that send numbers to each other in a very simple way. So a lot of the problems are ways of making numbers flow around. I feel like I'm only starting to grasp how this can be exploited to solve the problems.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that I'd like to be able to see some kind of global leaderboards or metrics, so I'd know if my solutions were decent. The leaderboards in the game apparently include Steam friends, but if you don't have a lot of friends that are into this kind of thing, it's kind of lonely ;).","June 12, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, the only thing keeping this game from being released already is just more puzzles -- note, this doesn't mean there isn't enough content to purchase the game already; the puzzles are not easy puzzles that can be completed within a few minutes. In order to play through this game, thinking is crucial. While many other puzzle games strive for this, TIS-100 is the only puzzle game that I can say truly forces you to think outside the box. Although this game might not be for you if you're not a fan of hard-thinking, concentration, and patience, it's really great fun for people looking for a challenging puzzle game that will have them stumped on every level. The developers have taken a very minimalist concept and created a fantastic game out of it. Throughout the game you'll find yourself trying to figure out how you've botched up the current level, only to realize that you completely overthought the entire problem and that the solution was right under your nose all along, which leaves you with a wonderful feeling of success as soon as you've finished it.\n\nFor you programmers out there: I cannot recommend this game enough. It teaches you great debugging skills and complex logic, as well as how to hack the crap out of such a simple machine.","June 8, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a good test of logic and very fun to see a simple program do complex tasks (and watching each cpu run is strangely hypnotising).\n\nIt gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you tie together a bunch of simple programs together to achieve a complex goal.\nEven simple goals give a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nas a side note, I spent around 4+ hours on one of the later levels and I still haven't completed the game.\nIt is one of those games that you put down and think about during the day and come back to later with an idea that could possibly work, usually you find out that the idea wont work because of the constraints (in this case the amount of instructions and the topological layout of the cores).","June 9, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you can make a change that you think should improve times significantly only to see them go up because of a bottleneck you didn't notice. Sometimes you'll just be optimizing for size and stumble on something that speeds it up as well.\n\nAs far as the arch goes for real world applications, it does leave some stuff to be desired, there's several very simple tweaks that could be done to make things more efficient without adding much more silicon.

I can happily say that this game is all logic. If you've spent the last 5 years playing nothing but CoD, your reactions will be great, but that won't matter at all in this game. This game is all about thinking through a situation (often step-by-step).\n\nSo, for the people that don't know, the game is about writing lines of their simplified version of assembly inside of (relative to modern machines) tiny nodes with specific objectives for every 'segment' which you can call a level, I suppose. The objectives for each level range from easy to head-banging-into-keyboard hard. The game does have a story, but to be honest, I haven't payed on ounce of attention to it, although I've heard it's at least decent, so there's that.\n\nThe main thing that makes me want to review this game so well, is that it's challenging in an interesting way. Dark Souls, for example, is challenging for multiple reasons (one being the game just hates you) primarily revolving around reacting quickly. I'm not saying that this is an inferior skill to have, I'm just saying the thrill is immediately taken away when you go to try again, and you know what's going to happen, because it already happened. This game is completely different. If you fail at a level, you still haven't figured out the logic required to solve the (often real world related) problem. You can't just try once, fail, get the answer, succeed. To succeed in this game you need to apply logic, which, as any programmer will tell you, is essential.\n\nNow, I'll say this now: I haven't finished the game... Yet\nI did say it's difficult. I'm an experienced programmer, but have only touched real assembly about 4 or so times. I imagine someone who has written assembly for 80+ years, helped invent the language, and practices it every morning in the mirror, might not have too much trouble with these problems, but what the rest of us are left with is an excellent, difficult, educational, 'puzzle' problem solving programming game.\n\nIt's hard to write a 'review' of this game because it knows exactly which crowd of people it wants to advertise to, and if you jumped at the though of a game where you write a basic version of assembly, you are in that crowd.\n\nTL:DR\nDifficult, educational, and completely logic oriented game that anyone interested in programming should pickup, and those people should try Python (language) too!","December 30, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I glanced through and didnt understand anything I was reading. I skipped the manual and jumped right into this "game", ignorant to everything I still attempted to go on. Clicking here clicking there typing this typing that, I was lost, I couldn't even beat the first level.\nThis wasnt a game, this was serious stuff. Maybe I should start looking to pursue a different career; I couldnt figure it out and I never will. After many failing attempts, I scavenged around online looking at assembly code examples until I finally understood a bit how it worked. I beat the first level. A big smile appeared on my face as I watched my little creation of code come out one side and go through another beating the level. I advanced on to level 2, a bit confusing at first, but I didnt give up, i managed to beat level 2. I played through more and more of the level's finding the problem and coming up with a solution, each one more challenging than the last, I loved it. Watching your code work after many failed attempts will surely put a smile on your face. Programming is about finding a problem and writing a code to fix the problem or make it easier for you and thats what you do in this addicting, challenging game, TIS-100.  Must buy for avid programmers.\n\nMy dream of becoming a programmer lives on, thanks TIS-100. (10/10)","December 28, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely not a game for everyone. People who are into math and/or programming will appreciate it, but the rest might struggle with it. So be prepared to use the refund function in case it's simply not your kind of game.\n\nAnyway, TIS-100 is a game about writing ASM-like (Assembly) code to restore the TIS-100 system to it's former glory. The first thing it tells you to do when you open it is to RTFM, and trust me, you really, really want to do that. If you want a CTRL+Fable version, check out the Steam guide version available  here . For some people this might be a major turn off. Reading is hard, I guess. That said, a bit more in terms of an in-game tutorial would go a long way, and would help people get into the game, as they will have a better idea of what's actually happening. After that you get some easy levels to get you acquinted to the system and off you go, doing puzzles that are harder than the previous ones.\n\nThe code writing portion happens in a screen with 29x15(?) boxes, all of which operate as seperate "CPU cores". They have one data register and one backup register that can't be directly accessed (you need to swap values with the accessable register). This creates most of the challenge, as fitting code into that small amount of space is actually really damn challenging (and part of the challenge). Once you run the program, it will count the amount of cycles (or actions) it took to finish the tests, and that will be your score for your leaderboards (so you can compete with your friends for the most optimised algorithm I guess.). Less code does not always mean that it will be the fastest solution around because of how this game works. There are plenty of puzzles to be solved, and you can also make your own puzzles (in Lua). You can also find puzzles created by others on the internet, though, it seems that places you can find some are few in number.\n\nAnyway for things like graphics - what you see in the screenshots is what you get. The sounds also consist of a few beeps and the like, there's nothing much to it, so you can play it on a toaster (considering the Internet of Things trend, that's probably a thing that can be done). That said it does get boring after a while, but that might be just me. The feeling you get when you solve a puzzle is pretty amazing though, have to say.\n\nIn the end I would very much recommend this game, but only if you're into programming.\n\n\nI wonder if I can put "Can write TIS-100's ASM" on my resume...","March 7","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It says "Your programming skills suck. Why are you even here? LOL NOOB!"\n\nIt's really hard, especially once the game hands you a Stack Memory and expects you to be able to use it. But the TIS-100's weird architecture with its very limited registers and limited code length per core makes for very compelling puzzles that are challenging even if you already have a basic grasp of assembler. Once you solved a puzzle, you get compared to other players and can optimize your code for various goals: least number of code lines, least number of CPU cycles for test run, least number of cores used. Often, you need different approaches for either goal.\n\nI now kinda want a real TIS-100, no matter what a huge clusterf*ck its architecture is.

If you like Spacechem (which I loved) then this is a nobrainer. It's very similar, but instead of everything being visual you learn a very simplified fake programming language. It's not daunting, and you don't have to know anything about coding. A detailed manual is included that will get you started, and after that it's just a bunch of logic puzzles basically. An interesting story seems to be unfolding via "notes" left in the system debugger by the previous owner. Right from the start you get the impression that there is something really intriguing about the history of the TIS-100 and you'll want to keep solving puzzles to find the next note and see how it all unfolds.\n\nIf you like lo-fi indie gaming, logic puzzles, and cold war mysteries this game is a must buy, and I'm saying this within the first hour of playing it. I have a feeling I'm going to be spending A LOT of time with the TIS-100 over the next few days (or weeks, I have no idea how many puzzles there are). 10/10.\n\nEDIT: Now that I'm thinking about it there is one minor annoyance: no soundtrack. The sound effects are good, but sparce. A nice ambient soundtrack of some kind would be a welcome addition, but whatever, it's not exactly like there is a lack of music options that can be alt-tabbed to...","December 25, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is sort of like SpaceChem in a programming-like wrapper.  To be clear, though, for those programmers out there: this game is a puzzle game first and an assembly language simulator second. Many features you might expect from an assembly language are absent here. That's not a bad thing, however. This makes the game more approachable for those who haven't programmed in assembly, or are relatively new to programming in general. I'd imagine that even non-programmers could figure this out without much trouble if they come at it with the same mindset as SpaceChem. Those who have some experience in assembly should feel right at home.\n\nLike SpaceChem, this game encourages an almost obsessive drive to optimize to reduce cycle counts, part usages, etc. The manual that is included (and that it suggests you print out) is probably the nerdiest thing ever, and I love it! It reminds me of some manuals like the Apple 1 and 6502 manuals from the 70s-80s. The manual is quite a bit sparse, though, with several pages left almost completely blank except for a brief header. I'm not sure if these are pages are left to take notes on or if they're going to be filled out more as the game leaves early-access. There are also far fewer puzzles than SpaceChem at the time of writing. There are tools for users to create their own puzzles, but I hope that more puzzles are added as the game develops. If you like SpaceChem, or techy puzzle games at all, this $7 game is well worth the price.","July 8, 2015","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are very challenging and the sandboxes are nice...\n\nWhat really hits me, though, is how genius the TIS-100 architecture is. Even though the game is still in Early Access, I can already see its potential in a simple dev board/kit kind of deal... Moving data in a spacial manner (left,down instead of core no. n) is IMO a very smart way of managing parallel data across many cores.\nTIS-100 is a great teaching aid in the pitfalls of multithreaded programming.. You know a race condition and a deadlock when you see one.\nSeriously, a TIS-style chip on the market could simplify many of the problems electronics hobbyists face...\n\nAlthough i'm already a programmer (and have done Assembly in the past), the language quickly sinks in. The simple interface makes it easy to debug and see what's going on the the cores.\n\nGreat and fun crash course for any programmer, or those aspiring to become one... ;)","July 8, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its an extremely enjoyable experience. One thing that would be nice is for people to add-on components to the game, like different functions, syntax, etc, and/or add-on levels designed by other users, then voted on, kinda of like the multi-player levels in Starcraft, that way the game would be ever expanding. Maybe implement Steam Workshop for adding RAM, encryption, more advanced machine, more accurate assembly language modules, etc. This game is fun as it is, but it has an amazing potential, that would be great sequels, or even dlc. Absolutely a must purchase.\n\nAfter Release: Even better. Now you can compare results with friends, there is another addition, which I believe is sharing of net files, idk, haven't compeleted enough levels yet. Secret level works great, and fun to do. Achievements, are good, and give you hints on whats better, or high scores, or secrets. Plus, it now checks your code with 3 random passes, and its nearly impossible to cheat a level now, so that's good. The scores you see, are pretty legitamate.","June 30, 2015","true","96.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, note that it's a quick REFERENCE, so reading the manual is still highly recommended unless you've worked with assembler languages before. At the time of playing this, I was already dabbling in x86 a little, but I did still need the manual for an explanation of the system architecture and how execution works. It wasn't really long of a read for me, and I did my first few exercises within maybe half an hour.\n\n\nI can see myself completing this game, but if I'm being honest, I doubt I'm going to go back and optomize my code segments. I hate going back to older work, and I especially hate going back just to make it better unless it was something special or personal to me. Bad habit for me to have in this day of bad code, working on it, but for a game, I wouldn't go back and optomize my segments as "replay value". Nevertheless, let it be known that this game is the most notable benchmark today of a programming game retailed at a reasonable price to the public. A few programming games of the past come to my mind (Colobot in particular, I highly recommend that especially since it's free and oriented towards C++/Java), but I have not found one so easily obtained, installed, and got running as this one, for lower level assembler languages.\n\n\n\nI recommend this game to people curious about computer science on an embedded level (meaning, closer to the hardware, not as abstracted), but really anyone interested in programming, tech, or problem/puzzle solving could benefit and enjoy this if they don't mind needing to refer to a manual now and then when the F1 reference doesn't cut it. However, for those of you looking for a wide variety of provided puzzles and solving/programming that isn't on such a literal level like writing actual "code", this game might not be your cup of coffee. I would really like to see more games like this exposing gamers to programming on a more literal level, instead of just the "mindset"... something more PRACTICAL!

I personally prefer my games of this style to be more gamified(or obfuscated), meaning straight up using a limited programming language to build puzzles around doesn´t really work for me. I have done some programming before(really random training stuff) and as such TIS-100 very much felt like stuff I have done before, as opposed to Spacechem or Infinifactory that feel fresh.\n\nNow that said TIS-100 was plenty fun enough to (mostly)go through escpecially thanks to the early learning curve with the manual and such. But this was the first and last game that, for me, gets away with just using a simplified programming language for math puzzles. I know I have been and will continue to ignore Human Resource Machine because of this for example. If you have played that one prior you might still get quite a bit out of TIS-100 since this is a significantly harder game(from what I have seen), but be aware that the early/mid game stuff is going to be a whole lot of the same/similar math problems.","March 2","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's something that could have been made in the 80's, if we had fundamentally different assumptions about hardware design. Luxuries like multiple registers and programs more than 15 lines long are discarded in favor of easy visual debugging and a baffling degree of parallelism.

You should be warned that you need to type out what you want to do to solve a problem. That means you need to watch out for your syntax. It is difficult, there is a steep learning curve to newcomers to programming. Don't let that discourage you, this could be an amazing learning experience.\n\nStory: There is a cute little story line that runs through the puzzles. It adds flair to what may seem to be a pretty bleak interface. But that bleakness, along with the story add to the charm of the style of the game.\n\nVisualization: It is a seriously fun game if you are interested in programming in any way. And while it may seem to be a "game" only for programmers, after a while you will begin to see the flow of information and realize that there is some great graphical elements that give you feedback. But you need to look for them in how the nodes communicate, and what is in the node at any given time.\n\nReplayability: I've nearly beat the main part of the game. And at first it seems like everything goes fast, but the challenges grow. If you worry about replayability, there is options for optimizing your puzzle solutions in 3 different ways. Then you can compare your solutions performance to your friends. I think this game is best played with a friend to talk about it with and push you to work harder. Not only that but there is a whole second set of puzzles available, which I've not even touched on yet. There is also some fun challenges through achievements that in some cases require a bit of creativity.\n\nTeachers should probably assign this game as homework. Better yet, classwork.\n\nTL;DR: Loved it. Great for problem solvers.","November 3, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally prefer my games of this style to be more gamified(or obfuscated), meaning straight up using a limited programming language to build puzzles around doesn´t really work for me. I have done some programming before(really random training stuff) and as such TIS-100 very much felt like stuff I have done before, as opposed to Spacechem or Infinifactory that feel fresh.\n\nNow that said TIS-100 was plenty fun enough to (mostly)go through escpecially thanks to the early learning curve with the manual and such. But this was the first and last game that, for me, gets away with just using a simplified programming language for math puzzles. I know I have been and will continue to ignore Human Resource Machine because of this for example. If you have played that one prior you might still get quite a bit out of TIS-100 since this is a significantly harder game(from what I have seen), but be aware that the early/mid game stuff is going to be a whole lot of the same/similar math problems.","March 2","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is extremely fun to play and the puzzles are very complex while also simple.\nThis game is a good pass-time for programmers and people even people who are good with logic and numbers. I love how the complexity of executing the tasks in the puzzles are not hard themselves( most of the time) but the difficulty comes from the simplicity of the code and the confinement of the node. Since you only have 15 lines per node, you must use them wisely and since the code is very simple, you need to make shortcuts to move things around efficiently and correctly. There are 2 folders of puzzles and a steep increase in difficulty so you can be working for hours at a time. This game is really good at making you feel good when you fix a bug but not too demotivated when your code doesn't work properly. It even has a pretty cool story and really awesome secrets. Highly recommend to anybody, but especially if you have an interest in programming or you are really good at math.\n\nBtw, if you do but it, remember to read the manual VERY thoroughly(it will only help you in the future)\n\n15/10 PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL OR SOMETHING\nAnd would buy again and again and again","February 7","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TIS-100 is an exception to this rule. Yes it has a rudamentary graphical interface which is styled in the command line aesthetic, but it's not trying to be visually appealing like undertale or terraria. It's functional, and that's all that it's really there for. TIS-100 is therefore unusual because the pure and distilled form of a game; that is: something that has rules and a winning condition.\n\nThe rules are simple, and well laid out in the manual which accompanies the game. They are simple commands that can be used to manipulate data in a certain way. I have no background in programming or coding and I could quite easily understand them.\n\nThe goals are also simple, you have to take input(s) and turn them into output(s) using the commands laid out in the rules.\n\nThe solutions however, are anything but simple. You have to think through problems to use simple logic to come up with ingenious solutions to the problems. However, after the first few puzzles, you will likely be left scratching your head for a bit. But this is the best part of the game! You keep at it untill you find the solution and a glorious stream of numbers are spat out from your code indicating that you have successfully achieved the goal. The feeling of reward when this happens is larger than i've felt in a game for a long time. The lack of hand holding in this game does make it difficult, but it only amplifies the rewards at the end of a puzzle because you'll have solved it all on your own. The puzzles themselves are varied, and the developer has clearly spent a long time devising them. There is also much replayability, as you can see how many commands and steps it took others to solve the puzzles, so you can try to optimise your own code to be like the best of them.\n\nUltimately, it's a game of pure logic. If that sort of thing floats your boat then I whole heartedly reccomend it. If you're more of a non stop action kind of gamer, or someone who just loves a good story, then you probably won't like it. Horses for courses, or courses for horses; which ever way round the saying goes.\n\n9/10","February 8","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, note that it's a quick REFERENCE, so reading the manual is still highly recommended unless you've worked with assembler languages before. At the time of playing this, I was already dabbling in x86 a little, but I did still need the manual for an explanation of the system architecture and how execution works. It wasn't really long of a read for me, and I did my first few exercises within maybe half an hour.\n\n\nI can see myself completing this game, but if I'm being honest, I doubt I'm going to go back and optomize my code segments. I hate going back to older work, and I especially hate going back just to make it better unless it was something special or personal to me. Bad habit for me to have in this day of bad code, working on it, but for a game, I wouldn't go back and optomize my segments as "replay value". Nevertheless, let it be known that this game is the most notable benchmark today of a programming game retailed at a reasonable price to the public. A few programming games of the past come to my mind (Colobot in particular, I highly recommend that especially since it's free and oriented towards C++/Java), but I have not found one so easily obtained, installed, and got running as this one, for lower level assembler languages.\n\n\n\nI recommend this game to people curious about computer science on an embedded level (meaning, closer to the hardware, not as abstracted), but really anyone interested in programming, tech, or problem/puzzle solving could benefit and enjoy this if they don't mind needing to refer to a manual now and then when the F1 reference doesn't cut it. However, for those of you looking for a wide variety of provided puzzles and solving/programming that isn't on such a literal level like writing actual "code", this game might not be your cup of coffee. I would really like to see more games like this exposing gamers to programming on a more literal level, instead of just the "mindset"... something more PRACTICAL!

TIS-100 is an exception to this rule. Yes it has a rudamentary graphical interface which is styled in the command line aesthetic, but it's not trying to be visually appealing like undertale or terraria. It's functional, and that's all that it's really there for. TIS-100 is therefore unusual because the pure and distilled form of a game; that is: something that has rules and a winning condition.\n\nThe rules are simple, and well laid out in the manual which accompanies the game. They are simple commands that can be used to manipulate data in a certain way. I have no background in programming or coding and I could quite easily understand them.\n\nThe goals are also simple, you have to take input(s) and turn them into output(s) using the commands laid out in the rules.\n\nThe solutions however, are anything but simple. You have to think through problems to use simple logic to come up with ingenious solutions to the problems. However, after the first few puzzles, you will likely be left scratching your head for a bit. But this is the best part of the game! You keep at it untill you find the solution and a glorious stream of numbers are spat out from your code indicating that you have successfully achieved the goal. The feeling of reward when this happens is larger than i've felt in a game for a long time. The lack of hand holding in this game does make it difficult, but it only amplifies the rewards at the end of a puzzle because you'll have solved it all on your own. The puzzles themselves are varied, and the developer has clearly spent a long time devising them. There is also much replayability, as you can see how many commands and steps it took others to solve the puzzles, so you can try to optimise your own code to be like the best of them.\n\nUltimately, it's a game of pure logic. If that sort of thing floats your boat then I whole heartedly reccomend it. If you're more of a non stop action kind of gamer, or someone who just loves a good story, then you probably won't like it. Horses for courses, or courses for horses; which ever way round the saying goes.\n\n9/10","February 8","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

TIS-100 emulates a fictional machine with an interesting architecture. It contains a 4x3 grid of modular parallel processors, each of which is a processing unit or a stack-based memory unit. Each node can communicate with the surrounding four nodes. The goal is to solve puzzles that require you to implement various simple operations using a preconfigured grid of TIS nodes, reading numbers from input ports at the top of the grid and writing the numbers to output ports on the bottom. A "visualization module" also exists for converting an output stream to a color image, and some puzzles require you to produce a particular image. The processors are programmed using a simple assembly language. The arrangement of the nodes and their types constrain the communication possibilities, and some nodes are simply damaged and must be routed around.\n\nThe puzzle solutions would be very simple to implement on a real computer, but the TIS processors are extremely limited - far more limited than any real processor would ever be. Each TIS processor has only a single general purpose register and can contain at most 15 instructions. The instruction set has only 12 operations and lacks many instructions that you would expect a processor to have, requiring multiple instructions to do very simple operations. There's no RAM, but by combining processors in clever ways you can build small memory controllers. Thankfully, the TIS-100 has a rudimentary built-in debugger that supports breakpoints and single-step execution, and displays all data in the machine simultaneously.\n\nThe puzzles start out simple, but even a seasoned low-level programmer will be challenged by some of them. The game comes with 25 puzzles and you can build your own puzzles and share them with others by writing simple text files in Lua. Completing the built-in puzzles unlocks access to a network of puzzles written by others. Upon completing each puzzle, the game shows you a histogram of the speeds, sizes, and organizational complexities of users' solutions, along with marks for where yours fits in, allowing you to see how you stack up against other programmers. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you'll probably be surprised at how fast some people's solutions are compared to your first attempts, giving motivation to go back and try to do better.\n\nThe game also includes a cryptic and very simple story told through bits of text encoded into the damaged nodes of the various puzzles. There's also a secret instruction and a secret puzzle to find.\n\nIf you think the idea of learning a miniature assembly language and trying to write programs on an extremely constrained parallel computing architecture sounds fun, then you'd probably enjoy TIS-100. Otherwise, you probably won't like it.","November 26, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
