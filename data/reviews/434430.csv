You spend about 10 minutes exploring a dark pathway followed by some sinister catacombs.  Along the way you are followed by the creepy bald fellow who you periodically converse with and you have a torch that you use to light the way.  The environment is very immersive, I just hope they improve the flame effect since it looks a bit flat compared to everything else.","April 23","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Graphics are wonderful and well worth a download. If its not too pricey i will defo think about buying this one (if its not too short).\nYou maybe able to sort this one in settings, but i found it a little too dark, to the point where it started showing the limitations of the vive headset a little. As soon as there is a fire to light the surroundings, all is good again. Might be worth turning up the light levels one notch to stop you seeing the black vive screen so easily, which takes you out of the experiance a little.\n\nAlso the torch you are holding that is on fire does not flow like fire when you move your hand. The fire it rigid upright even if you wiggle your hand. With a little physics added to this it would also be much more realistic.","April 23","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got legit creeped out at first, but I grew comfortable with him after a bit.\nThe overall environment is quite nice, with some areas that made me feel like I was standing some crazy location that would fit in LoTRs, which was great.\n\nCons:\n-Overall, this was too short to have much of a story, so the story you get is pretty underwhelming.\n-The torch is absolutely terrible, completely breaks the immersion.  I'd prefer a simple torch model with fire particles, instead we get to see the Vive controller with a bad, flat plane with fire animation.  I ended up holding it out of sight for most of the experience.","April 21","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I like these slow paced narrative-based games, and the progression is done fairly well here. The lighting is interesting, although it shows off some of the headset artifacting pretty badly. The 2d sprites have to go, and the teleportation mechanic feels quite wrong. But first entering the catacombs where you stand on the ledge, and the spookiness of the cliffhanger make me want more.\n\nCritique for the developer:\n* torch looks terrible, and at my natural pose it is kind of in my face and I cant see anything through it. maybe tone down the size of the flame\n* some of the lighting and mist effects cause artifacts in the headset, try to tone them down\n* I prefer the arc-aiming teleport systems (the lab, budget cuts) to the weird glowing spots going on here. you could still limit the jumps to spaces in a grid. the glowing spots, being IN the environment rather than attached to my hand, take me out of the experience","April 13","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with 4x4 metre play space, I felt confined.\n\nSome of the games assets are stunning. The old man is brilliant, his eyes very very lifelike and follow you. The environment (especially the tunnels) are so interesting, I wanted to keep walking... but oh no, there's a wall. Walk back, teleport... repeat. Just using the teleport alone felt more like playing mist then an amazing 3D game.\n\nI would love to see some form of locomotion option for those who can stomach it. I want to be able to walk on the spot, and appear like i'm walking in the game.\n\nFor anyone with a Vive, absolutely download this demo.\n\nP.S. devs, the fire looks terrible compared with everything else. Also the lighting coming off the fire is really not very good when compared with the lighting of other games, such as the lab. Many of the assets don't react to the light, which makes it feel less realistic. Also I don't want to see the HTC controllers, I want to see a burning torch or something similar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scalarr/recommended/434430/","scalarr","Scalarr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scalarr/","45 products in account","A short but nice little demo. The game starts up in a classic Eye of the Beholder dungeon crawler manner where we slowly move (teleports) towards the entrance of the catacombs. Then we get to explore the beginning of it and light up brazers along the way with our torch. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and at some points there are slits in the walls where one can sense that there are rooms behind. Not sure its intentional, but it offers a new sense of depth that I've never seen in games before before and spurs curiosity. The somewhat creepy follower manages to position himself awkwardly close every step of the jurney. He is very life-like albeit a bit creepy as he mostly just stands there and observes.\n\nIn any case this was well worth experienceing with the Vive VR set and I'm looking forward to see how it develops.\n\nSome feedback: There is an issue of floating in the air as the chaperone box don't quite fit stairs, slopes and steps in the ground. Being able to find e.g. loose rocks and interact more with the environment would make it way more interesting. Dripping water, a small fountain and other chilly sounds, skulls and rodents might further enhance the catacomb experience. I sense that the future of dungeon crawling is near - so think a bit about what that means when one can spend just one hour to move some 30 feet. It will be truly amazing!","April 28","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very cool VR demo, but not much there. Basically teleport down into a crypt and a minor jump scare at the end.\n\nDevs--you need to adjust the sensitivity of the chaperone. I'll admit that I don't have the largest room-scale (2.2m X 2.1m) but because of the whole blink and lack of things to do once you blinked somewhere, I wasn't moving that much but the chaperone was lighting up more than a foot away which really broke the immersion. I haven't seen any other titles have such a big buffer for the chaperone although it might be that due to the very dark nature of your demo it made the chaperone really stand out, Although when I think about it, Brookhaven Experiment is just as dark and I was able to hold up my gun much closer to the boundary before the chaperone would light up. Overall, though, this was a cool (albeit short) demo and I'm excited to get the full experience.
