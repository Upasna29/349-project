I\nshould probably mention that I pretty much only play the fantastic mod "The Authentic\nColonization" which fixes a lot of issues with the base game and makes it more\nchallenging, but I'll try to keep the review on the actual base game (but the modding\ncommunity is amazing).\n\n+Great graphics, way more detailed than Civ 4 and even Civ 5..which is kind of odd.\n+Good soundtrack, not quite as great as the original (♫ Jine the calvary♫) or as good as\nCiv 4 (Baba yetu~)\n+The early game is way more active than Civ 4, you have to sail around the new world\nlooking for good land, the Natives will be angry if you settle to close to them and you\ncan't settle near Europeans at all, this adds a great deal of planning and strategy.\n+The new leaderheads for the Europeans/Native Americans are fantastic, very well animated and full of personality and character, I personally think Cunhambebe has the best animations out of them all.\n+Getting soldiers/scouts/pioneers (workers) is way more realistic, instead of training a unit, you actually have to equip a civilian with tools/horses/guns, and newly equipped soldiers will be weaker than battle hardened ones, it's a great system that really makes every military unit matter.\n+Native variety is good, it features the Iroquois, Cherokee, Apache, Sioux, Aztecs, Mayans, Arawak, Incas and the Tupi, it could use more Amazonian tribes but other then that it's pretty good, some mods add way more such as the Inuits, Shuar, Comanche, Blackfoot, Shoshone etc.\n+Awesome mods, my favorites are "The Authentic Colonization", "Colonization 2071" and "The age of Discovery II".\n\n+/- The amount of Colonies is pretty small, just the English, French, Dutch and Spanish, all have two leaders but are pretty well balanced. Mods add a lot more leaders, such as Russians, Chinese, Danes, Portuguese etc.\n+/- The game gets a little boring once you find great land and found a few cities and start to get a decent economy, but gets going again in the "mid-game" when Natives start to get ticked off at other colonies and start New World War 1.\n\n-The warfare system stinks, it's like Civ 4 but with way less actual unit variety and can be very easy to sack enemy cities in the first few turns.\n-All natives have the same unit type called "Braves" and use the same model, yes the Incas, Aztecs, Cherokee and ARAWAK look the same and the model they use is very generic looking, luckily most mods fix that and give really cool custom models for each Native.\n-Game feels a bit rushed, especially is the "final battle" against your home country, just basically boils down to the king bum rushing your cities and you just kill a few of his soldiers and you win.\n","December 4, 2014","true","48.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","29","32","5","2"

It has been made with the engine of Civilization 4. I like it way better than civ4. The game tells the story of the colonization of the new world: America! You can randomize the continent as much as you want to make each game very different! The game can be challenging if you want and for those who remember the old colonization game, you will like it alot because its basically the same, but much improved in every way. The strategy is pretty deep and its of course like civilization, a civ buidling game!\nThere is also a fantastic mod out there that adds a crapload of new civilizations (like the russians! hahaha in america!) and a lots of twiddling with the game features to make it even more fun than the basic game already is!\nThis game is a 2 thumbs up!","December 2, 2013","true","132.7"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","26","36","0","0"

This game follows through with so many of the things that made the original great.  Choose your own European country to start from.  Find a place to create a new town in the New World and survive surrounded by natives, hostile European competitors and hopefully a Revolution against your home country.  This game is very difficult, if you plan to beat it that is.  The trading system is great, the strategical choices make the game vastly different and overall it mostly copies a winning formula from the original game.  Add to that a great graphical upgrade and an even better musical score, and you can't disappoint the old timers or the newcomers to the game.  Also, you definitely can't complain about the removal of Gamespy and the addition of Steam multiplayer.  This simplifies everything and it works smoothly.  Thumbs up to Firaxis for upgrading all their old games, including Civilization 3 to continue being played.\n\nThere are, however, some issues.  A few bugs here and there, though not game breaking, and I just found that natives really lacking in this game compared to the original game.  They are there, but they are just too friendly and too easy going.  The European AI does not know where to build cities, nor do they really know how to place their individual population into jobs that produce money and supplies.  It just seems that the AI didn't get a revamp, nor a carbon copy from the original.\n\nAll in all though, a great classic made even more classic with this latest revision.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ket_/recommended/16810/","ket_","ket_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ket_/","150 products in account","A remake of a classic, Civ IV: Colonization could be considered Civ 'Light´. It´s also really worth giving a shot.\n\nThe game has you colonizing the New World by founding settlements. These settlements are more than just dots to cover the maps with. Rather, each individual settlement is important and needs careful resource and population management. As you expand, you will have to deal with the natives and, more importantly, the royals back home. Although it´s one route you can take, you can do much more with the natives than just smash their heads in - in fact, choosing for cooperation probably provides you with a more worthwhile experience, as these are anything but Civ´s standard barbarians. As for your royals, their demands increasingly test your economy and your colonists' patience over time. This mechanic has been done so well that you really feel you have a good reason to fight when the war for independence finally rolls around -- and winning this war feels all the more rewarding for it. It also means that the pacing of the game is done really well: each stage feels meaningful, not too easy or hard and never a grind.\n\nThe game tends to be shorter than your average Civ game and can often be finished within a few hours. That makes it an ideal game for a quiet evening or a rainy afternoon. The game has also been around for quite a few years, but still looks just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.","September 6, 2011","true","59.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The mechanics for movement and combat are the same, but barring that, things change quite a bit; more micro, less macro. Your units are taken straight from the population of cities, and while in cities they work either tiles or production buildings -- taking raw materials and refining them into finished products. All of your citizens also have a profession attached to them, this affects their yields or combat modifiers; of course in addition to the promotions that they can earn through combat. Money management and trade routes to deliver the raw materials and finished products are a huge part of the game, and constructing buildings are based off of having a supply of wood, with citizens working the lumber mills.\n\nI really enjoyed the way that the micro managing was handled, and I wish that a Civ V variant -- mainly for the hex and single unit tile occupation mechanics -- would be made.","December 25, 2015","true","22.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

A lot of the elements common to all Civ games are here; city placement, resource and commerce management and, of course, war and combat.\n\nThe addition of 'Founding Fathers' adds a new element. 'Founding Fathers' are individuals that join your colony throughout the game and give colony wide bonuses. They replace the 'Wonders' mechanic found in the base game. Some 'Founding Fathers' are clearly better than others and obtaining or failing to obtain certain key 'Founding Fathers' can make or break your game. Victory conditions are narrower here than in most Civ games. Military victory is the only way to win. Due to the limited victory conditions, some leaders are objectively better than others (one of the Dutch colonial leaders has a 25% bonus to production that puts him above all the other leaders no matter what strategy you are using.)\n\nThis is a fun and challenging game, but lacks the replayability of the base game due to fewer victory conditions, less leaders to choose from and almost no single player content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunaCalx/recommended/16810/","LunaCalx","LunaCalx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunaCalx/","85 products in account","A Game that truely fails to live up to the expectations of its predicessor...\nI wanted to like this game I really did. I was and still am a big fan of alot of the Sid Meier's titles but as of late its seems like they are just churning out crap in a shameless cash grab (surpise surprise). But that isn't the only reason why I don't care for this game and will go into detail.\n\nGameplay and Other Issues\nAlot of games out there are capable of setting up and churning out a re-release on a regular basis while still being relatively sound. This one not so much.... It lack the intuitive and simplistic controls that I enjoyed and loved from the predicessor this is just a reskin of Civilization just with European powers duking it out on some land mass. Which would be fine except for a few things.\nThe gameplay and HUD lacks serious flow which makes the game hard to play and unappetizing\nNone rewarding game play styles. I was a pirate in Colonization and my actions greatly damage my rivals and hampered there growth. I didn't get that its like all the work I did was for nothing in fact it seem to excellerate their growth in early games and I was a fast growing player.\nI didn't feel challenged. For some this may no be a problem but, if the game 'Banished', which has no enemies mind you, can do it and this cannot I help but feel that there is something seriously wrong with the set up of this game.\nIt feels un-original yes it is suppose to be a re-release but, at least they should have put some effort into making the new features appealing and intergrated into the system. Not this 'lipstick on a cow kind of deal'.\nUniqueness to the game.... What stood out to me in the original Sid Meier's Colonization was the fact that you had the option to run around in the New World, or a truely free and customizable world. They litterally riped the one feature of this game out that made is just a hit and unique with the first one.  But just as in the title is is just a fancy Civ reskining.\nDid they get anything right?\nAs little as this game appeals to me yes they did, but that list is small and its achievements are relatively meagar comparatively.\nVarious options for leaders as well as your exsisting benifits to your country choice. As in the old game you picked one of the four major European powers to play as each with there own nationality bonus (I liked the French for cooperation and quick trade relations I could set up with the natives). The leaders you select are designed to accomidate your play style.\nGraphics & Basics. Now I don't often think graphics are a big deal and noramally it isn't but, to see your cities living and breathing on a map and no excessive convolution to the hit boxes on things it is pleasing and makes the game run smoother. This doesn't mean it is forgiven. However with advance graphic cards now a days you can really see the age of a game now and many may find it rather distracting and jarring. But it helps clear up mis-understandings on the map too. Which make it easier to not do an accidental settling in a play you didn't want to settle.\nInterface shinanagins! Playing the original v. this one. They did do alot of things right when dealing with the pop-up menu system.  DOS was a weird and strange time, people. So menu bars and pop-up where clunky and you see that even more so with the steam edition of the original coloinzation, which I honestly think is a combination of the struggle to port and DOS is an ever fickle beast I still have a running laptop that functions using that.\nIn conclusion I don't recommend it is wouldn't be worth the risk to purchase even if you have a 50/50 chance. It would be a love/hate relationship. It would be a you love it or love to hate it and want a refund and to be honest if I could I would get a refund and I have yet to desire that, other than one other game, I purchased have though that. Do yourself a favor, play the old one its cheaper and has a very intersting concept or just 'bail-out' on this and just stick to the other true-blooded civilazation games. My heart is with Civs 1-2, and Civ 2 test of time, with Civ 3 and Civ 5 managing to nudge a tiny hand hold onto my heart. Just being honest.\n","April 6","false","7.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The AI is so bad its laughable. It cheats like no other. Yes, that not the worst thing I’ve seen in gaming, but let me put it to you this way… you have to declare independence from Europe to win. As you increase the demand for liberty and thus independence in your colonies’ cities, your home nation basically shuts down your trade with them, crippling your economy. Not the end of the world, as there are still Native Americans to trade with and other European colonist. But guess what, they don’t get this penalty. Have fun beating the game with that.\n\nPS as you need to gear up to fight the large military power of your mother country, you focus shifts from trade to solider training and weapon-smithing. This gets tricky when you have to have you entire colonies’ population at enough liberty sentiment to rebel, which by-the-way is only produced with units taking up food or other valuable space in your cities.\n\nWhy Sid why did you make this game so bad?! 35% in my book\n","January 1, 2014","false","16.5"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","20","42","0","0"

Rather than focusing on your army and it's compossition, placement and what not, Colonization puts in the role of governer, not general. Micromanaging a number of towns and exploiting the new world's natural resources and dealing with those bloody natives, either peacefully or by blowing their brains out with your supior technology. The overarching goal is to declare independance from Europe, but if you fail to complete the goal in time you still get a score victory for your efforts.\n\nAs for combat, you have an overly simplified % chance of victory. Though you can't actually take an entire town in a single turn like you can in Total War. Conflict lasts over several years. But unlike vanila Civ4 (And here comes one of the biggest preferences to Col over Civ) unit production is quite involved, so you wont end up having a single conflict over a single city last over a few decades or even centuries.\n\nSo in a nutshell: War game meets Colony Simulator :p","January 26, 2013","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Review: I never played the original. Vanilla Civ 4 Colonization is okay. But the TAC mod makes it one of the greatest games ever made. It's well designed and the modders on CivFanatics are apparently still around for support, so I highly recommend this game with the TAC (The Authentic Colonization) mod.\n\nIt has been months maybe a year since I played vanilla, so I'm operating off of memory, but in that game, you had to be careful with the amount of liberty bells your towns generated so that the King's army isn't ridiculously large in the end and thus invincible. How to do that was nebulous. So I focused on just building up my colony. Which was fun for a while. It's fun managing everything and making everything run efficiently, but eventually that wears off and you start looking at how to finish the game. And seeing that declaring independence will result in the inability to trade the goods I'm producing and make the infrastructure I've built pointless, the goal of the game is unappealing.\n\nIn TAC, the goal is more clear. Unlike vanilla, you're not self-sufficient from the beginning. You need the King. Even if you're playing nice guy the natives and other colonies will beat up on you. And you need to buy the King's stuff to keep from being wiped out. After a while, you can become completely self-sufficient. And this is one of the things that makes it so great. I'm a huge fan of the Tropico series, but one of my complaints going back to T1, is that you have this island generating wealth and it should be self-sufficient, but in the game, it's all useless without money from the outside world. In TAC, it's not useless. Just like the real world, if you need to build a palace, you need wood, metal, and silver. That's what buildings are made of. They're not actually made of paper money.\n\nSo in TAC, once you realize the money is only useful for buying experts, wood, ore, and tools from the King and you're generating all of that stuff yourself, you start thinking "I don't need this jerk". So all of his snide remarks and haughty behavior in the game, make him less of a nuisance and more of a contemptible character that you can't wait to stick it to.\n\nSo the vanilla version of Civ 4 Colonization is a good but forgettable game. But with TAC, it becomes a masterpiece. So I highly recommend buying it and getting the TAC mod. I don't think this game has  a Steam workshop. But I got TAC from CivFanatics and it was easy to install.","July 18, 2015","true","378.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, it's still the only civilization PC game in recent history (+10 years) that has a rather different set-up.\n\nYes, you still work tiles for yields, and yes, you still build units and buildings. But citizens are soldiers, and soldiers citizens. Unlike other civilization games, the population is not just a bunch of numbers you push around to make yields and tiles, but rather are physical units you can move from one city to another, and they become soldiers, workers (pioneers in this game), etc.\n\nIt's a fun formula, for the most part. You can really specialize cities, with one city doing nothing but gaining food to grow a new citizen that you can then remove and put in another city that does nothing but harvest wood and work a lumber mill to produce boats. And you can manually use wagon trains and boats to carry food, lumber, etc. all over the map.\n\n---------------\n\nBut it's not a perfect formula. For one, while you do this your king will begin raising taxes on you, meaning that what you ship back to Europe to sell will start making less and less money. Hence, this is one of the few civilization games (probably the only one) where as your economy gets rolling, it suddenly becomes weaker at seemingly random moments. And if you don't accept the raise in taxes, then one of your precious exports is no longer able to be sold to Europe (it at least tells you which one will be the victim).\n\nSecondly, because of this system, a rather tedious micro-management system begins wherein you build wagon trains like crazy and put valuables in them to avoid them being targetted for the victim-export should you say no to a tax increase.  It is not at all hyperbole to say that I often spend probably 15 minutes over the course of a whole game in which I am just shuffling wagon-trains, loading them up, and parking them (or leaving them parked in the city that originally built them in order to send out elsewhere at when need). Of all the civilization games, this one has the most micro-management of all, even more than Civ V which requires individual units to be moved (as there are no more stacks in that game).\n\nLastly, the war-aspect of the game is pretty weak. The other three colonies (there are only three other colonies no matter map size, though native settlements do exist and sometimes attack you) are often not interested in attacking at all unless you settle right next to them. And the end-game, when you revolt against your king, is basically a tower-defense phase where units sail from Europe and attack the nearest city no matter how unrealistic their odds are of taking it.\n\n-------------------\n\nI really enjoy this game these days. I was not a fan when it first came out, and it has some issues with excessive micro-management of rather mundane stuff, but it's a good amount of fun.\n\nMy suggestion is to play Marathon games with this one. I never play Marathon on the other civ games, but here it's practically required in order to have a well-rounded experience. When you play on Marathon, it just qualitatively feels like you get longer before tax increases become excessive and play havok with what you carefully built up.\n\nAgain, not a perfect game, but if you own Civilization IV and skipped this when it first came out thanks to backlash, then I'd say to pick it up. It's really cheap now, which helps, and is just a great change of pace. I enjoy it more than Civ:BE at the moment, and have played it more and more while waiting for Civ:BE to get its vital first expansion.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a 7/10. Certainly not the most epic Civ game ever, but it's fun to play for a Marathon game every so often, and is a nice change-of-pace from the relatively old formula, now, of the others in the series.","July 20, 2015","true","583.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it seemed that the only war to prepare for would be with your homeland troops, as fighting other nations is just a waste of resources.","March 2","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me give you few examples:\n- my privateer (basically a pirate ship which ignores any territory) visited a coastal indian village in a foreign territory. When I tried to move out a few turns later, what a surprise, I could not, I had to declare war to Dutch colonies, because the rules for privateers do not apply when you leave a settlement.\n- few professions can be aquired only via indian villages (sugar planter), BUT because map is randomized, there is a chance there won't be any village you can learn such profession!\n- export/import simply does not work. It usually leads to one city having too much imported resource so it starts to throw it away and other cities have no resource. Brilliant.\n- if you start with generation of independence bells too soon, you are going to have a tough time with insanely huge royal expedition forces. And because there is no limitation of units per tile, they can easily create huge stacks of doom (especially roayal man-of-war ships). But if you don't generate them and you have some neighbors (hello, Dutch!), the others will do and they will automatically take your tiles. What a great game concept!\n- there is no map of America! You can either start a caribbean region or a random map. Argh!\n\nTL;DR\nPlay the good old colonization. This one has more issues than the original one.","February 10","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

For best results, download TAC (The Authentic Colonization Mod) which is basically like the last patch that the developers should have made (it plays very true to the original), restoring some features from the 90s original.\n\nTIP:  Unlike Civilization, where it's often better to expand and expand, in Colonization, you want to setup a tight colony economy that you can defend, and declare independence as soon as possible.   A spread out colony is easy pickings for the King's Army.","April 9","true","193.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 1994 Colonization was a classic and one of my all-time favourites, and this version with the RaR mod installed is a vastly improvement over that. This game offers you gameplay that feel quite unique and fresh even when compared to Civilization 4 and 5. The resource gathering and crafting elements of the game are very important, entertaining and at a moderate level of trickiness that keep you engaged and interested, while not overwhelming you. Exploration is fun with the tribes you meet, and backtracking to keep the treasures you discover safe on the return trip to the colonies with docks. The immigration mechanics are very cool, and the trade system is deep and rewarding. Combat is maybe the most civlizationesque part of the game, while the above mentioned elements are very different from the traditional Civ gameplay, but that is not a problem since it is solid and engaging as it is. Diplomacy is also quite ordinary Civ.\n\nConclusion: Definitely recommend this game (with the RaR mod installed), it is absolutely brilliant. Man, I love this game. The score is 10 out of 10.","May 15","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
