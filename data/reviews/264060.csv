Granted, it did not invent absolute novelty in the old genre. Instead, it used a different approach to it. There is a quote floating out there, "metroidvania with boars". I guess you can say so, because FB features a lot of exploration aspects and freedom of movement. And more than that, a lot of puzzles with less platforming. You aren't forced to solve them (many of them are optional), but the way these placed and designed - simply attracts you like a butterfly to the light. What could be hard in simple box moving and dirt digging..?\n\nDon't even get me started on puzzles, these are simply fantastic. They make so much sense that by the end of figuring out another one you will feel like a pure genius. They deliver insane amount of feel of accomplishment. Soon you will realize it is not about the gem or a secret you want to get or discover, it is about solving the damn puzzle that taunts you. And the most interesting part is that none of the puzzles require from you any special ability or an item - it is all knowledge and experience. The way blocks and boxes work or interact with each other and your understanding of this mechanism is the key to solve all the puzzles.\n\nBut hey, a fun gameplay is not the only thing FullBore can be proud of. Quite lovely and pretty 2D graphics with awesome lighting and "fake" 3D effect will catch your attention at once. They fit the game surprisingly well, just like an amazing soundtrack by "The Adjective Plural Noun". But this is something you'd better to experience yourself, rather then read about in in a sloppy review.\n\nLong story short - FullBore was quite pleasant surprise of 2013 for me (The First Dig, part 1 of the game, was released earlier; Steam version features full game). It came out of nowhere and since then I fell in love with it. Really, how could you not love these adorable little boars?\n\n\nYou won't get bored with Full Bore.","May 2, 2014","true","60.7"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","63","73","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/264060/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","I got Full Bore as part of some bundle or other, and to be honest I wasn't really all that psyched to own it. From the images and video provided, it looked boring. Okay, you're a boar and you dig. Great.\n\nI'm more than pleased to report that Full Bore may have honestly been the best game I received in that bundle.\n\nFull Bore is a game that is both cute and dark. You have boars who are also miners and say cute boar miner things and are named things like Hamm. You also have experimentation, possession, and sacrifice. The dark stuff never gets overly dark, though, and the worst bits are described in historical texts and frozen computer monitors, and never in any horrific detail.\n\nThe game begins with Hildi or Frederick (your choice) slumbering in a meadow. After chasing some butterflies into a minefield, they are blown up and fall many, many stories below ground. They are then revived by some strange technology, and spend some time getting acquainted with the controls and bashing their head into things. Then they're launched in a rocket, through the bottom of a vault.\n\nYour preferred swine arrives just after some mysterious masked boar runs off, leaving you behind to take the blame for the vault's missing contents. Turns out, this vault belongs to the owner of the Full Bore mining company, and he's not about to let you off the hook with his riches vanished. You're pushed into another pit and sent off to recover the gem hoard.\n\nThere are two main aspects of this game: puzzle solving and exploration. If you're a fan of both, then this may be the game for you! Puzzles tend to consist primarily of the destruction and manipulation of blocks. All sorts of blocks. Dirt, sand, crates, levitating, weird colored blocks that all phase in or out of existence if you destroy any one of them... Gems are found inside blocks, and puzzles often revolve around finding ways to reach these gem blocks, and finding ways to destroy the gem blocks. Discovering and reaching doors is another huge part, as you'll have to first get to the rooms containing the gems. And you'll find that there are more than a few mysterious secrets buried beneath the world's crust.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty varies as you go. Obviously the general difficulty raises some as you get further, but you'll find puzzles of all difficulties throughout. It's understandable if you get stuck and look up some help, though this is definitely the type of game where it helps to step away for a few hours, or overnight. As you delve further, it's natural to start burning out after several rooms. I had numerous occasions where I just couldn't find any possible solution, then came back the next day and solved it in seconds.\n\nDifferent areas have different gimmicks to their puzzles. The toughest area of the game is filled almost entirely with things that will break as you step off of them, leading to some very unique challenges. It's honestly pretty impressive how much variety this game's puzzles contain, considering that everything is just digging and pushing and stomping.\n\nThere's a nice, rewarding feeling when you accomplish something, too. Even a simpler challenge leaves you pretty proud of yourself. Collecting a gem and seeing your PigBoar Color's gem counter tick up one is great, but honestly most everything you do gives you a satisfying feeling of progress. Part of this is due to the obviously Fez-inspired map system, which tells you if there are any gems, doors, lore, or mysteries left in any given room. As you collect gems, they'll stack up, 1:1, in the previously emptied vault. Lore fills in the pieces of the plot, if you're into that. The mysteries... do what they do. And often, when you do some puzzling to reach a new door, upon your return you'll find that the room has undergone a subtle change to facilitate future passage to the door. Scaffolding will appear, dirt will disappear, crates will shift, all because the devs understood that nobody wants to have to solve that darn thing again in order to get back to a room that they had difficulty with the first time.\n\nI mentioned Fez, there. The game has a few inspirations that aren't entirely obvious, at first. I am full-on bragging when I say that I noticed these three early on into the game. The first thing I noticed was a bit of a Metroid-esque feel (but without the upgrades), along with those Prime-style digital and ancient lore logs. Then the very clear Fez map and the pool puzzles (bonus points for the fox/dog that occupies the room where you learn how those work) and a certain room named "Vision" (which I actually think is slightly cleverer than Fez's counterpart). And I was thinking it was probably because I'd just recently replayed Escape Goat, but the game reminded me of that at times, as well. Lo and behold, then, when I stumbled upon direct references to each of the above! So if you're a fan of those three games/series, then once again, this may be the game for you!\n\nThere are a few endgame-type-deals which will drop you back to the title screen. You can always continue your game after these, picking up after your credit-causing conquests. You should never find yourself in a position where 100% is impossible.\n\nI know it's a puzzle game, but there are times where you'll need to be quick. It never asks the impossible, but you will be thankful for the rewind feature when you find yourself racing the character you didn't pick at the beginning, or desperately running from exploding purple... stuff. Or fighting the final/only boss, which is tricky in its first part, rough in its second, and downright tedious and not very fun at all in its last.\n\nI understand if the visuals don't appeal to you right off the bat, but you'll enjoy them more and more as you go. The lighting is done well, and the game can be rather pretty when it wants to. The soundtrack is cool, too, providing something to dig on while you dig on. Lots of distorted guitars laying down fitting grooves to keep you focused and immersed.\n\nIf I have to come up with a complaint that nagged at me over the course of the game, it's the camera. Generally it's centered on you, but you can also use the right analog stick (assuming you're using a controller) to look around. I assume this is just remapped keyboard keys, though, as the camera does not register the sensitivity of your tilt. This means that you can't just move the camera slightly to view an entire puzzle. The camera will shift as far as it can - up to something like a full screen's length away - and sit there. If I'm trying to see at a distance, that's fine. But when I want a better look at the puzzle I'm working on, I have to keep shifting the camera up and back and up and back instead of just looking slightly up and taking it all in. Also, on a few occasions the camera just wigged out on me. It didn't happen often, but on the few occasions that it did, it could be pretty screwy on the eyes.\n\nI really, really enjoyed Full Bore. Far more than I ever expected to. It has good design, enjoyable writing, and most of all it has heart. It's not stuffed with references, but there are a small handful, along with bits of inspiration seeped in from strong sources and in all the right ways. Plus, wow, I got around 20+ hours out of this, and I didn't get tired of the game once through all that (okay, maybe a little bit in the Scrapyard). That's excellent for a block-manipulation indie puzzle game. If all that sounds as delightful to you as it does to me, then this is definitely the game for you.\n\nI'll leave you with one piece of closing wisdom: remember that, in that moment before a block falls, when it's hovering Wile E. Coyote-style in the air, you can actually hop onto it and use it as a platform. Knowing this ahead of time would have spared me one big headache.","February 3, 2015","true","23.6"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/recommended/264060/","blaxpirit","BlaXpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/","516 products in account","After playing Toki Tori and Blocks That Matter I started to think that I dislike such games... but now I realize that Full Bore is simply the first good tile-based puzzler that I've played. And all the competition pales in comparison.\n\nNotice that I didn't use the word "platformer". Well, that's because I associate the word with jumping, action, reflexes, etc. And that's not what Full Bore is about, don't be fooled by the trailers. Sure, there are a few places that require quick action, but you don't need any of the qualities required by typical platformers. The stop time+rewind feature mitigates this even more. Oh, and... you actually can't jump.\nFull Bore is quite a pure puzzle game. Everything, including the character, is always aligned to the tile grid. And the puzzles... they are extremely well designed and all very different. It's just hard to imagine how someone could come up with such a variety of puzzles, while keeping the set of concepts limited and so elegant.\nTo be clear here, Full Bore is a difficult game, but never too difficult. To me the difficulty always seemed just perfect. Every puzzle felt rewarding. And I never got stuck for too long (taking a break always helped).\n\nAbout the open world thing... The world map is a lot like the one you see in FEZ. But all the rooms also have "thumbnails", and connections between them are shown very clearly. Rooms where there is nothing left to do are indicated as well. A portal system prevents travel from being tedious.\nAnd since I started this whole FEZ topic... It is clear that some inspiration is drawn from it, and yes, there are secrets in Full Bore. But finding them, and eventually completing the game 100% is something actually doable. Without guides, that is. All the secrets have good hints for them, and there definitely are no obscure and outright impossible to find secrets (unlike in FEZ).\n\nFull Bore can easily give you 25 hours of gameplay (this is about the minimal time that you need to explore everything, if you don't look up solutions, of course). Since I knew right away that I was going for full completion, I don't really know how much time it would take to just complete the story, while mostly ignoring optional tasks. Maybe 5 hours, maybe 10. There is even a "preliminary" ending that may let you consider the game completed, if you so choose.\n\nWhat is also very nice, you can never lock yourself out of something; no location, secret, ending or achievement is missable (well, to be honest, one achievement does explicitly require a separate playthrough, but don't concern yourself with this). Explore freely without worry.\n\nControls are simple. Redefinable. No problems with them.\nSoundtrack is great.\nGraphics are immaculate.\n\nFull Bore deserves so much more love than it gets. Really is a hidden gem (haha).\n\n★★★★★★★★★★","August 25, 2014","true","28.8"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

The game was Kickstarted just over a year ago to the tune of $16,383.Full Bore has lovely 2d 16 bit pixelated graphics that not only add a retro feel, but add a degree of both humour and charm to the title. Environments look great with some really well designed levels, nice use of lighting. Levels are colourful and vibrant and the whole game is easy to look at. The soundtrack of the game is also wonderful created by Miguel Acuña and the Adjective Plural Noun. It boasts a great variety of tracks that range from happy go lucky to dark and atmospheric.\n\nThe games controls are simple and easy to use, movement is controlled with WASD. The space bar is used to make the boar stomp, which is used for crumbling loose blocks of ground and for moving certain blocks. Sadly there’s no jump feature which on one hand is necessary for the way the game is designed but I personally would have liked one. One thing I like is that you get all the abilities you need in the game at the start, as levels increase in difficulty its all about using your brain rather than just using in game abilities.\n\nFull Bore has three main elements to it's gameplay, puzzles, platforming and exploration. Full Bore isn't just a level by level platformer, you have a world to explore. By entering different doors and entrances you can go to different locations. To manage where you are and find your way around you have the handy tool of having a world map so you can track you way back should you need to. As you explore you'll come across computer control panels, books and characters, all of which you can interact with which will progress the games story, offer information and some funny jokes.\n\nFull Bore is a highly polished indie title that is packed full of character, humour and a bloody good challenge. It brings back memories of playing Fez for the first time and I would certainly argue that its up there with Fez in terms of indie titles in the puzzle platforming genre. All in all if your a fan of puzzle platformers or just charming indie titles in general I would certainly recommend picking Full Bore up, there’s plenty here to get your monies worth and you'll get a laugh or two out of it.","May 5, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

It's like the honor-roll love child of Cave Story, Castlevania SOTN, and Adventures of Lolo, with maybe a streak of Portal. Simply fantastic.\n\nI don't have enough good things to say about this game. If you are on the fence, just buy it. Even if you don't like it, the devs deserve your money. I feel like I need to spread the word about this game, so more people will buy it. This is a sleeper for sure, and it's a real tragedy it didn't sell like hotcakes.\n\nI guess I'll write a short summary about why I liked it so much. The game is an open world block puzzler. That may not sound like the greatest thing ever, but the world the devs have created oozes mystery and begs you to explore every nook and cranny to find both it's arcane secrets, and to find more puzzles to solve simply for the sake of solving more. The exploration has the same sense of wonder that SOTN or Dark Souls has, but without any real enemies to speak of. And without the stress of Dark Souls constant deaths. And when you finally do find all the pieces, the story is quite compelling, well thought out, and plotted at a masterful pace (despite the occasional typo or misspelling). The pixel art is sometimes amazing, and sometimes just ok, but they do some kind of 2D normal mapping or something to have this neat dynamic lighting. It looks great sometimes, but sometimes it looks like prerendered graphics from late 16bit early 32bit era stuff. The music is also amazing. Good tunes that are appropriate to the scene when they need to be, and entertaining when you are working out puzzles.\n\nThings I didn't like...Not much. The occasional puzzle stumped me, but that's cause I'm too dumb. I ended up having to look up 2 of the puzzles on Youtube, which I'm fine with. Most of the time when I got stuck I would put the game down and come back later and something would pop out at me. The time rewind mechanic was helpful, but it often didn't go where you wnated it to go, and that was annoying. The race can suck it, the control just isn't built for it, and I frankly didn't find it fun. But those are totally forgiveable complaints in the grand scheme of how amazing this is.\n\nProbably in my top 20 gmes of all-time.\n\nBUY IT!\n\nDevs: I liked Full Bore on FB, but you guys don't have a developer page. I'd love to be able to follow you so at least I can keep abreast of any new projects.","June 7, 2015","true","29.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/264060/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","At first glance, Full Bore might look like a mix of Toki Tori and SteamWorld Dig. It is indeed a block puzzler with digging, but what really sets it apart from similar games is the exploration aspect, the non-linearity and the lore.\n\nThe gameplay consists of solving puzzles to progress through a vast underground world. Since you can only move by running, falling or leaping diagonally, many puzzles revolve around clearing a path or building steps to reach exits. Because of the large variation in materials you can dig through, or make crumble or fall by stomping, and the many different kinds of crates, no two puzzles in the game feel the same. At least one puzzle even have an additional solution to uncover a secret passage. And as far as puzzle games go, I've played none other with such a huge amount of secrets and collectibles.\n\nFull Bore has a metroidvania-esque map, where collectible gems and lore, along with passages and mysteries are marked. The map is similar to that of FEZ with lines connecting all the discovered passages and completed rooms being marked in yellow. New rooms are added to the map as you discover them and are displayed as a small preview, annotated with anything left to discover. This is handy both for figuring out which way you should take to progress the story and is great for completionists.\n\nThe game is full of references to games that likely inspired the creators. I caught references to Metroid, Offspring Fling!, Escape Goat and FEZ, but I'm sure I also missed many. The Escape Goat and FEZ references are both elegantly incorporated into the game as puzzles that works well alongside its other puzzles, while still being true to their inspirations. The FEZ puzzle especially being a nice throwback to the more meta puzzles of the indie classic.\n\nThis unique game already has a place among my absolute favourites. It says something about this game that I've played it almost compulsively for a total of more than 30 hours the past week without experiencing any of the fatigue that I normally associate with puzzle games.","June 19, 2014","true","41.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/recommended/264060/","slowacki","Slowacki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/","1605 products in account","The action of Full Bore takes place in a post-apocalyptic world(?), where a new sentient race of boarkind (and a few more animals) is ruling. It's a puzzle platformer in which the player controls Hildi, a boar that is accused of stealing gems from a vault of a digging company owner. As a punishment, it's sent into the mines to retrieve all the stolen treasures.\n\nGameplay & Level Design\nThe game is a puzzle platformer, which means the (almost) only gameplay is solving environmental puzzles with your own hands (hooves?). The player has the access to a map that allows to check, if there is still something left to explore in each location, which saves the time greatly and indicates the general direction of where should one proceed. To solve the puzzles, one usually needs to dig through or move some blocks. If mistakes were made, it's always possible to "rewind time" to specific moments, so that it's possible to take off where the last right step was made. On your way down (or up), more and more secrets are discovered that put the story into context. The game is an open-world one - there's no requirement to explore many of the maps, but they often hold some additional information about the past of the world or extra gems. Moving throughout the locations and maps takes some time, but a mechanism of fast travel makes it pretty convenient.\n\nThe puzzle solving is actually really absorbing and fun. First puzzles are rather straightforward, but the game gets progressively harder with new locations. There seems to be a big spike in difficulty at one point towards the end, where puzzles get really challenging and it wasn't unusual for me to spend up to half an hour solving one problem.\n\nThe controls are smooth and reactive, which is really important for a platformer. The only issue I had was with jumping down from blocks, where the boar is somewhat hesitant to do so, which costs some extra time, so much needed in many scenarios. Another thing that I found a bit disappointing is that, there seems to be no use for gems and most of the items. I mean, I wouldn't really like to see collecting those a requirement to finish the game, but an additional incentive would be ever so nice. Because of that, the last few maps, I just went straight to where I needed to go, without caring much about clearing the locations thoroughly.\n\nGraphics\nI found the pixel graphics in the game very appealing. Surface is nice, cheerful and green, while digging deeper and exploring lower maps brings some darker and more volcanic colours into play. The main characters are made carefully and look really pretty (like the shaman), their animations and also animations in general are also nice and smooth. Overall, I found the graphical design really charming and detailed enough to be able to keep my attention, but not too crowded to obscure the view of the objectives.\n\nStory\nAs I've already mentioned, at some point I've noticed that going for gems and collectibles is not too rewarding, however, I kept on exploring. The reason for that is the story or more like - the history. The story itself is pretty straightforward and could be probably written down on one page of paper. Still, throughout the game, it's possible to find notes and terminal data that introduces the player to what actually happened before the current game world existed. Maybe, it's just me being a fun of post-apocalyptic settings, but after completing the game, I've spent some time reading the other players' theories on the in-game history, just out of curiosity.\n\nMusic and Sound\nThe background music is quite catchy and I never felt the urge to mute it, as I sometimes do in many games. It changes from location to location, each one has its own tune. Changing maps also changes the music sometimes to a different variation on a theme. It definitely wasn't a kind of a music I'd listen on a daily basis or while commuting to work, but it was really fitting to the game and just sounded nice and right.\n\nContent\nIt took me almost 10h to beat the game, but if one wants to be really thorough and get all of the collectibles, I think there would be somewhat 20-30 hours of playing there. Shame that except for achievements there's little incentive to go for it all. Still, I believe this is a really decent amount of content and fun for a cheap little game. It kept me interested and it was always fun to try and solve the puzzles to get some more diamonds or reach more lore secrets and that's what's important to me.\n\nOverall\nFull Bore is a really solid indie game, all pieces just fall right into place. The puzzles are just challenging enough to keep one entertained and thinking, but not too hard, discovering the lore is actually quite interesting, the graphics are all nice and charming and the music just completes the image of a well-made game. I probably wouldn't pay the full price for it, but it's a great catch if it's bundled or on a discount. So, if it's discounted somewhere and you want to put your brain to some work, grab it - you won't regret it (probably).","February 26","true","7.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Full bore has a charming and rather untalkative main character. You can either play as Frederick or Hildi through the story. It starts with your "crash" into the vault of Gullinbursti who then accuses you of theft and forces you to recollect his valued gems. Although this goal will be set aside after clearing the first of the five areas (Workings, Deep Dive, Bhudevi, Scrapyard and the sleepless sea all with different style and desgin) of the game and the real story will unfold from there.\n\nAnd here I will state the most important aspect of the game (as I see it). The game heavily relies on your urge to explore, to search, to figure out:\n- for the story: It tells you sometimes where you can find some story characters but gives you no explicit directions. You have to run around searching for them. To understand the story itself you need discover and read the various terminals spread through the different areas\n- for the gameplay: It tells you how to stomp, how to climb and that you can dig. But how the different blocks behave you have to figure out yourself.\nFor you not to run around in circles too much and to reduce unnecessary backtracking a bit there are two "systems" implemented. The first one is that every puzzle is solvable the moment you discover it. If you can't solve it than only because you are unable to figure out the solution not because you are missing equipment. The second it that on the map at the bottom of every room there is listed if you can still discover something in said room.\n\nThe difficulty in the puzzles differs from very very easy to hard where the harder puzzles are mostly related to the "second ending" of the game or obtaining gems. Also the puzzle change from area to area. So the scrapyard plays differently then Bhudevi for example.\n\nAll of this is rounded up with a nice soundtrack. So if you have an explorative nature (up to 20+ hours of gameplay), you like the graphic style and you like puzzle platformers (and adore boars) I can only recommand  Full bore to you.\n\n\nPS: If you have any questions regarding the game, ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them.","October 4, 2014","true","26.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I enjoyed the puzzles, and the unfolding story. Reminds me of Toki Tori 2+ (though more similar graphics to the original toki tori), another game I have sunk many hours into.\n\nInitial gameplay can be a bit confusing - while the controls are easy and the puzzles are easy enough initially, growing in difficulty as you progress - the open worldness of the map tends to make you feel rather lost. If you can ignore the fact your digging randomly deeper into the unknown without a clue as to where you are heading, you eventually gain your bearings and the navigation isn't too bad after that. There is a teleport feature to help you get back to previous explored regions as well, which comes in handy when you are going back to solve those puzzles you couldn't figure out first time.\n\nThe simple story of gathering gems and rescuing the miners can be done very fast avoiding most maps areas and puzzles but you can go back to regions and complete afterwards, with new conversations and a more complete ending (roll the credits a second time when you are done).\n\nOnly complaint are the two 'boss' type levels. There is one race which takes quite a bit of skill to win (though you don't need to win for storyline), and the 'dark sun' level which is frustratingly difficult and requires a bit of rewinding to get it done. Also didn't feel the game was complete until I had managed this though, as it gave the full ending. Felt out of place with the rest of the puzzles you could stop and think about, rather than dashing around unable to stay still for more than 2 seconds!\n\nSo anyone buying needs to be aware there is a high-speed element to the game, but mostly just logical puzzle solving that's heaps of fun! Almost didn't finish the boss levels, but with some determination I managed and was def worth it :)","January 6","true","33.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

But...\n\n"Full Bore" is an open-world 2D puzzle-platformer where you assume the role of a boar that has to, well, bore around. There's no intro, you're just thrown into an adventure where you gradually discover the story as you explore. The game doesn't hold your hand. Beside the most basic of commands, you're given no explanations or hints, but are instead left to figure it all out for yourself. The visuals and audio are likewise very nice.\n\nHowever... the game was simply... boring. The core gameplay consists of digging through the Earth, solving a series of block puzzles in order to progress and collect gems. Each puzzle is solvable as soon as you chance upon it, and there are no hidden abilities, or power-ups, or unlockables of any kind. Your only ability is a time-rewind function, which is really just an implementation of an undo button. You can't run out of the rewind power, like with the sands of time in "Prince of Persia", for example. Not even enemies exist here, not in the usual form, at least. In "Full Bore" you just kind of go, and dig.\n\nSo, why explore the world and solve puzzles as all? To collect gems and unravel the story. The story, while certainly promising, isn't THAT good. The gems themselves don't seem to give you anything tangible other than the satisfaction of having collected them. The visuals get a bit confusing here. Because of the 2D sometimes it's hard to distinguish what's the foreground and what's the background. With some timed puzzles and/or mini-games, it'll be a source of frustration.\n\nIn the end, whether you like or dislike "Full Bore" all boils down to the the question of how much do you like puzzles for the sake of puzzles?\n\nPersonally, I'm not much of a fan. If you're different in that regard, then "Full Bore" should be a no-brainer.","September 22, 2015","false","1.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sillythings/recommended/264060/","sillythings","sillythings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sillythings/","718 products in account","Full Bore is awesome. Here's a few reasons why:\n\nIt's challenging. In all the best ways.\nSeriously, there are some absolutely devilish brain teasers to be found in here. But they are incredibly fun to figure out, in large part probably due to the great rewind function that lets you undo and redo moves, helping you get to the solution. Plus, the puzzles in this game offer a big range of difficulty levels. There is no fixed progression here, and you can solve puzzles in whatever order you desire. Each area in the game comes with it's own set of blocks, and therefore it's own set of rules you'll need to figure out in order to succeed. There is a LOT of variety in the gameplay, and it's as impressive as it's fun.\n\nIt's big. Wonderfully so.\nI'll be honest, the game didn't immediately click for me, and I think this is one of the reasons. The size of the game and the fact you are free to explore in whatever order you want (you ARE given loose objectives, but it's somewhat easy to lose track of them imo) can be daunting. There are warp hubs, but you can't get to specific rooms (they usually are fast and easy to get to from the warp area, though). But once you figure out how to work with the in-game map, the game's size becomes something wonderful. The atmospheric graphics and huge variety in puzzles make sure you're exploring for the sake of exploration, not just to complete every room (which is a satisfying feeling too, though).\nMy one complaint would be that in some areas of the game, once you're trying to go for a 100% completion, you may have to solve certain puzzles again to get to where you want to go. This is a bit annoying, but rare enough to not be an issue. Still, it should be mentioned.\n\nIt's adorable, and atmospheric.\nThe character sprites? So freaking cute. The lighting effects and environments? So effective at truly making this world a joy to explore. It can be pretty creepy at times, and that's a great achievement. The artist did a truly wonderful job, and the music and sound design compliments the visuals nicely, too. (For what it's worth, at times the music feels a bit repetetive, but never to the point where it made me want to turn it off)\nLastly, the story - it's mostly told through you finding logs and books and stuff, so it's not a very direct way of storytelling (which honestly, I think is a good thing here, the puzzles can take some time to solve, and this passive storytelling fits the gameplay's pace). It took a while for me to feel involved and really get a sense of curiosity for the world and it's characters, but once I did, I thought it was a really interesting and engaging tale.\n\nTo sum it up, grab this if you like your puzzle platformers to be more puzzle than platformer. At it's core there is extremely fun and solid gameplay, and rounding everything out are gorgeous production values. Full Bore is a true gem deserving of way more attention.","June 20, 2014","true","24.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blazelol/recommended/264060/","blazelol","Blazephlozard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blazelol/","255 products in account","Full Bore is the greatest block-based puzzle platformer I've ever played. It has fantastic graphics, fantastic music, but more importantly, a huge amount of very well-made puzzles that are fun and satisfying to complete.\n\nYou start with all abilities required to 100% the game; there is never a need to come back later with more moves to solve a puzzle. Your moveset is also quite simple. Basically, you can move, push, dig, and stomp. This simplicity of what you as a character can do allows you to have a perfect understanding of what you need to accomplish the puzzle; "It is absolutely impossible for me to get that gem unless I have a 3-block high stack here." I like that certainty in a puzzle game, as it allows you to set a goal, and then figure out how to accomplish it.\n\nComplexity in the puzzles comes from the different block types, and how they interact with your moves, the world, and the other blocks. The different areas all introduce new block types, such as the Scrapyard's blocks that get destroyed if you walk off of them, and Bhudevi's switch blocks. It never gets ridiculously hard, though. I never had to look up a puzzle solution, and never got completely stumped for long.\n\nAnother thing I like is the map. It is extremely helpful and detailed, like Fez's map. It tells you exactly what you have remaining to get in every room. When it comes to "did I even get everything?", there's no question, and I like that a lot. It's a sharp contrast from, say, Super Metroid, where if you want every single missile expansion, you're going to have to use a whole lot of random super bombs, or look it up. In this, you'd never have to look up WHERE a puzzle is.\n\nOne complaint I have is that, as far as I know, there is absolutely no purpose for gems. I don't think any gems are needed to reach the final boss, or to get the secret ending. Yet, they're the main collectible; most of the puzzles are to get a gem. I don't really mind this though; I was going for 100%, and I didn't care about what I get for it. Having fun doing the puzzles is reward enough. It also has very low replay value, being a puzzle game and all. I've gotten a lot more hours of it because I decided to start doing speedruns, but, for most people, there's no reason to play it more after getting 100%.\n\nOne last note, the length. It took me about 20 hours to 100%, which is damn good for a little indie puzzle game I'd say. Braid only takes a couple hours, Fez is probably close to 10. This has a TON of content, a TON of puzzles, and they're all fantastic.\n\nI am not good at writing reviews, I don't know if this will convince anyone to buy, but, basically, IT'S AMAZING. I have played Braid, and Fez, and Toki Tori 1 and 2, and Blocks That Matter, and Antichamber, and The Swapper. This is better than all of those. If you enjoyed any of those games, you will enjoy this.","September 25, 2014","true","44.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's just a joy to play.\n\nThings I particularly like about this game:\nSimple, smooth controls. There's not a whole lot you can do, but you can do all of it from the very beginning, and your boar handles very well, even in tight-timing precision situations (of which there are thankfully not too many).\n\nThe puzzles are all totally discrete. There are never any puzzles that do not fit on a single screen, even within larger rooms, which allows both for easy visual review and contemplation and nice "chunking" of gameplay -- you get potential break or stopping points every 5-10 minutes, as opposed to a gotta-find-the-next-checkpoint urgency.\n\nThe puzzles are good. I'm about halfway through (I think?), and I've been very impressed both with the difficulty level of each puzzle -- the vast majority make me feel stupid when I start and brilliant when I finish, thanks to being built around "a ha!" moments -- and with the difficulty curve, which raises smoothly and naturally, through harder puzzles rather than introducing new gimmicks.\n\nThe art direction is really, really solid. The actual art assets aren't anything to write home about -- the visuals are simple, and the soundtrack is a bit repetitive if nicely funky -- but both are used to great effect, and work together to build a real sense of unease and mystery.\n\nThe story is revealed nicely. It was obvious very early on that this is somehow a post-human society, and the humans vanished after doing something stupid with science, but the characterization of the scientists through their emails and computer logs is surprisingly full of personality, and also the story slowly but confidently gets weirder and creepier in unexpected ways...\n\nThis is a great game to play for an hour or so at a time. Usually after that much time, my brain needs a break, but then tomorrow I'm eager to jump back in and explore more and solve more puzzles. I don't have time for big, story-heavy games right now, but this has been fantastic to get a little gaming and mental workout into my evenings.\n\nYou're a boar. That's great. You meet a giant golden boar named Gullinbursti. That's fantastic.

If you liked FEZ, you should like this game too.\n\nThe only thing I don't like are levels where you have to race someone or something - the character movement is tile based and it feels like the moving animation is slightly longer than the actual movement. I keep moving further than I want and it takes time to go back. I usually have to switch to keyboard for these parts for a more precise control.\n\nHowever there is an amazing time warping system, very similar to the one in Braid. You can either stop time to think if you really need to save some of it, or reverse any action you've done back to the latest checkpoint or the beginning of current level.\n\n8/10 so far, I can't think of anything that would not deserve such rating in this game.

You have to go through various linked caves and rooms made up of blocks to obtain plot related items (in this game, one of them is gems). The game, similar to the aforementioned games, does not have you obtaining upgrades (at least to where I am 50% in), and while you may at certain points need a key, the majority of the game is about learning about how to use what you are given from the start, and how to interact with the world to solve puzzles.\n\nAn important note, is that you can't actually jump; only hop up diagonally. This makes getting around an important part of the puzzling, as you not only need to think about how to get a block someplace else, but also whether or not you'll still be able to get where you need to be. Of course, the meat of the game is the puzzling and the exploration, and both are done well. The puzzles have an appropriate difficulty curve, and there is a vast amount of gems and other items hidden throughout in secret rooms, which also have their own puzzles often times.\n\nAnother positive note (in my opinion), there is no consequence to making a mistake, as not only does a room reset when you exit it, but you can rewind  to previous states to fix mistakes. You can go as many moves back as you need, whenever you need it, with no consequence, giving you full reign to try out whatever you can to solve a puzzle without frustration. Even better; when you solve a puzzle to access an area, the map changes the next time you enter it so that there is an easier way through to where you had to solve to (sometimes simply just leaving the puzzle as solved, and changing everything else back). As for the exploration, similarly to fez, the game will tell you when you have missed something in an area, but it is up to you to locate it.\n\nI haven't completed the game yet, but I'm only 50% of the way through (on total completion), and yet I've racked up about 9 hours (removing 1 for away time, that is still 8 hours). I'll likely edit this review later on once I've completed it, incase I've missed anything.\n\nI fully reccomend this game.","December 2, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One that tells a captivating story and ushers you to seek out the answers.\n\nFull Bore is one of the best puzzle/adventure games I've ever played, and is a joy to play from start to finish. Truely, one of the few games that I wanted to finish. FB is built very solid with few oversights and no exploitations that I could find. It continues to feel new and unique in every new area of the game and rarely feels taxing on the player. Interestingly, the game features many referances to the explorative player...\n\nI recommend this to everyone that enjoys puzzle platformers or puzzle adventure games","September 23, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Featuring tremendous sprite-work and some of the most catchy music in recent memory, Full Bore is a game that will instantly hit home with the Cave Story and Spelunky loving indie crowd. This, of course, is for good reason as Full Bore manages to keep the player engaged throughout the game thanks to its easy to master controls, interesting story and intelligence-challenging puzzles."\n\nRead the full review here[www.entertainmentbuddha.com]","May 6, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's a puzzle game, which was described by some as a "metroidvania with boars", but that is entirely incorrect. It has an open world with rooms full of puzzles, but there are no ability unlocks at all. Your abilities are moving, digging and stomping, and that's it, from start to end. You roam around, collect gems, search for secret rooms and advance the main quest at your leisure. All of it involves puzzles of the digging and timing kind, though the timing aspect is not critical. It's much more about understanding how the elements interact and planning ahead than the execution itself.\n\nSo yeah, it's a semi-hardcore puzzle game about the cutest boar ever going on an adventure and you all should totally check it out. Really a hidden gem, I give it four out of four boars.","May 16, 2014","true","27.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not a platformer, you see, as there is no platforming, and you cannot even jump. But a puzzle game with the occassional action-demanding section.\nAnd it's really, really good. Like, wow. The puzzle variety throughout the game is astounding, every puzzle felt unique and interesting. And the difficulty curve was smooth, too; as I got better at understanding the game's logic, the puzzles got more demanding themselves, so the entire way through, the game was certainly a challenge, but never an unfair one, and never too easy. The game world's design, as well, is really great; there are 5 main areas to the game, each pretty self-contained, but each is pretty expansive as well. The game is made up of puzzle rooms connected by doors, some rooms large with multiple puzzles, some rooms small with only a single puzzles, and plenty of rooms outright hidden by puzzles in other rooms. You can go through the entire game seeing less than 10% of what there is to see (if, well, you know exactly where to go, but yes) yet the game never feels too long because the puzzles remain enjoyable the whole way through.\nThe presentation is also great, the game is pixelated, yes, but it has a distinctly modern look to it, one that makes every main area look different, one that almost never has any visual confusion, and one that's just a joy to look at. The soundtrack is also very interesting too, I don't know exactly how to describe it but it fits almost too well. The story is pretty interesting though mostly conveyed through logs (that you don't *have* to read, either, and many of them are hidden... but let's be honest, why are you playing this game if you aren't going to attempt to find everything there is to see?)\nI guess. There are a few puzzles that can be a bit tedious to solve, but they aren't common. The game's never too demanding action-wise, either, and the puzzles are tight and focused, maybe with the occasional red herring thrown in for good measure.\nI don't really have much to say against this game... I enjoyed it from beginning to end, it's just a really enjoyable experience and you should buy it.","April 11, 2015","true","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's virtually impossible to determine areas where you're able to drop down to lower areas, so you'll spend a lot of time frustrated in an area where there's no apparent way to proceed, only to accidentally press down and drop through the floor.\n\nOther irritations- the game doesn't really tell you what type of materials you can dig into.. dirt, okay. stone- apparently?? I spent way too much time stuck in one area only to find that I could dig through solid rock. Apparently not metal though, or thin beams. I just doesn't make any sense and the game doesn't help you understand whats going on (either through color coding, highlighting, or even a frickin tutorial).\n\nThe last major flaw is the ham fisted time-rewind mechanic that seems to exist solely to correct other design flaws (the fact that you can get stuck in the first place). It's not like Braid where it's crucial to solving puzzles, it's just there as an "undo button" which is pretty lame.\n\nAs a side note and unrelated to my overall experience of the game (because I turned it off), the music was god awful. sounded like a couple of kids 'jamming' in the garage. Just.. awful.\n\nAnyway, if it's on sale and you're curious go for it.. otherwise save your money.","July 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

The puzzles are nicely designed and often have several solutions leading to different areas or secrets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/264060/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","Block-pushing, dirt-digging, gem-collecting puzzles with no jump button.\n\nI didn't do a lot of research before trying this game, so I was basically expecting a different flavor of Steamworld Dig.\n\nFull Bore is, at its core, a series of increasingly complex block puzzles, but the puzzles are strung together to form a somewhat open world. It's kinda like Fez in that several of the puzzles are actually your travel route between areas, and other puzzles are optional for collection of treasure. On the plus side, it provides a nice cohesive framework instead of just giving you a typical puzzle game menu where you choose your next puzzle from a list. The downside is that backtracking can be a pain, although there is a warp system.\n\nThe actual puzzles generally involve a combination of digging and pushing. You can't jump. Different types of tiles behave differently: Some are suspended in place unless you dig through, some are unbreakable, some are fragile and will break just from the shock of you using the Stomp command from a close distance. Also, there's no jumping.\n\nDid I mention you can't jump? For the uninitiated, this is extremely disorienting. You can hop up one tile height increment at a time (like stairs) by holding down a particular button (It's actually the same button that causes you to dig out the tile directly above you, which was very confusing to me when I came back to play months after doing just the tutorial).\n\nThere are no player "lives", but there are checkpoints in pretty much all of the active puzzle areas, and there is a somewhat Braid-esque rewind function. If you get stuck, you can rewind incrementally or all the way back to the checkpoint (or the door you came through, if you haven't touched a checkpoint since then). The downside to combining the open-world format and the checkpoint system is that if you get stuck on a puzzle [after touching a checkpoint] and you just can't figure it out, you pretty much have to quit to the main menu and reload your file in order to access a different route. With very few exceptions, you can follow any path you want. There are no incremental powerups that you need to unlock in order to access The Next Area. If you can find a puzzle or a secret, you have the means to solve it. I got stuck a lot in the early stages because I didn't understand the different tiles & their properties, but getting stuck in later stages led to a lot of "a-ha!" moments.\n\nSome of the puzzles have time-sensitive elements, but the majority of them are pretty generous about giving you plenty of time to make your moves. The rewind function is a great asset, especially during the more complex multi-stage puzzles. Using time controls feels a little clumsy at times, I guess due to how it decides which points to remember. It's not that it smoothly rewinds playback (a la Braid), but it jumps back from point to point based on when it decides you made a significant-enough movement or action.\n\nI'm going to talk about the racing segment now.\n\nThere is an extremely frustrating race against an NPC. You're required to do it, but you don't have to win to progress. You don't have to win it at all, as long as you don't care about getting 100%. In order to win, you essentially have to have flawless control of your boar through a really long obstacle course. Since the majority of the game is a series of low-stakes thoughtful non-time-sensitive puzzle solving, a high-speed high-precision segment is extremely frustrating, and the hit-or-miss nature of the rewind system means you might do more harm than good by trying to rewind partway.\n\nThere's a lot of atmosphere in this game, and I'll admit I was a little put off by the aesthetic in some areas, which is not to say that it isn't well-crafted! It's grungy, punky, and bluesy all at the same time. The sights and sounds definitely contribute to the mood and feeling in a major way. It's easy for me to imagine how different the game would feel if the exact same maps had been skinned and scored differently. The lore is interesting and ominous, and builds up very slowly. The other characters that you meet aren't especially deep, but I can easily forgive that since so much of the game involves being isolated.\n\nI definitely recommend Full Bore to anybody who likes tough-but-possible puzzle games, or who wants to have more games starring boars.\n\nDark Sun / 10","September 12, 2015","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal of the game is to complete the story and be the hero of boarkind, but exploration and treasure-hunting are other goals.  In order to progress through the game, the player must solve puzzles.  As one progresses farther into the game, the more complex and difficult the puzzles become.  The mysteries unfold as the player reads lore from many years ago, enters another dimension, and explores 5 different regions of the world.\nThe game is usually paced at whatever speed the player wants, allowing for think time to figure out the puzzle.  A few levels are high-speed action levels, in which making a mistake can be deadly.  Thankfully, a handy rewind feature can help solve the trickier puzzles, and the world map keeps track of which areas have been completed and which areas have not.\nThe world also contains a handful of non-player-characters that the player can chat with, gaining more information about the world of Full Bore.\nThe levels themselves tell stories--blast marks, skeletons and broken trusses tell the stories of what people did long ago.  The background music is very catchy and I love hearing it over and over.  The game designers did a good job of giving levels atmosphere, some levels I feel at home in, others creep me out. The game map can be explored freely and at the player's pace, and a warp system allows the player to teleport from one region to another very quickly.  In most cases, if you get stuck on one puzzle, there are plenty more to figure out.\nEven after game completion, there is still stuff your boar can do--find hidden rooms, talk to NPCs, or try to solve the puzzles again!\n\nGood Game!I liked this game--a thinking game with a great story beneath it.   This game is good for people that like logic puzzles and working out their brain.  If you love good stories, this might also be the game for you.  Depending on how easily you solve puzzles, this game may take anywhere between a few hours to a few days or more to solve.\nI would recommend this game for anyone who wants to stretch their mind, learn a good story, wander aimlessly underground, race through a mineshaft, or just have fun in general.","May 18","true","50.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The central concept of the game is solving puzzles while you explore the game's world. Along the way you collect gems and read about the lore of the events that happened leading up to the present time within the game. Because of some excellent puzzle design and well paced introduction of new puzzle mechanics the game never felt boring to me. Full Bore also features a time travel mechanic that lets you undo the last number of things you've done as well as soft resetting the current puzzle you are working on. This alone helped make what would have been frustrating and tedious puzzle solving into fun and difficult puzzle solving. Only major gripes with the game are that you have to re-solve a number of puzzles when you go through a previously explored area for some, but not all areas. This is exacerbated by the lack of a clear map and very conservative fast travel locations, which make traveling to certain locations to clear out the map a bit of a pain. Overall I quite enjoyed Full Bore.","June 1","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
