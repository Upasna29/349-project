It may be a 21 year old series, but it was worth the wait.\n\nOriginally released in 1997 for the PS1 in Japan, Umihara Kawase Shun is the sequel to the phenominal 1994 Super Famicom game Umihara Kawase where you play as Umihara Kawase, a 20 something Japanese sushi chef who uses her reliable fishing rod to get aross levels by flinging, propelling and grappling around, over and under plenty of platforms and walking fish enemies with the occasional boss fight or two depending on the path you take.\n\nHere's a little more history. There were a few versions/ports of Shun. The PSP version, aplty titled "Umihara Kawase Portable", was going to be the first entry of the series to have a North American release back in 2008, and it was going to be titled "Yumi's Odd Odyssey", but it didn't happen since this version of the game had a lot of bugs and it was impossible to complete at times thus people consider it the black sheep of the series (when Sayonara came out in the US in 2013 on the 3DS eshop it was titled Yumis Odd Odyssey).\nAnother notable version of Shun, the DS port titled "Umihara Kawase Shun ~second edition~ Kanzenban" from 2009 was a compilation of the first two games with extra stuff like more levels and other stuff.\n\nAs for the actual game, the presentation has more to offer than in the original game. This time, 3D was incorporated into  the graphics so the fields themselves are more lively and the layouts more complex. All the sprites appear to be hand drawn too. This time around, the fishing line is a bit shorter, but more elastic and springy so it might be easier for someone to traverse levels.\n\nMusic is still nice like the rest of the games in the series.\n\nAfter playing the 1st and 3rd games using keyboard controls for several weeks, I can say that it's doable once you get used to it. Probably best to use a controller since all 3 have controller support but it's up to you :^)\n\nNot much else I can think of now so here comes the closing statement. Whether you're a veteran gamer or just getting into it, this game is challenging regardless. Anyone can pick up and play this game, but it takes skill to get far and master it. It's Umihara Kawase Shun.","November 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

Like the other games, prepare to absolutely master the controls if you want to get anywhere, because the stage design gets brutal fast.\n\nBarebones port, but the visuals hold up really nicely without any tweaking, and the continues and practice mode functions added are nice.","November 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The using of fishing rod to fling yourself across the environment, while awkward at first, is a bunch of fun once you get a handle of the controls. Now the PC port has a lot of rough edges with the UI and the lack of reasonable bindable keys for the keyboard, but performance is good. Speedrunners will appreciate this type of game because mastering the environments (which have good level design) will cut off seconds on run time and they'll definitely appreciate it. While the game may have been a cult classic in Japan, it's definitely worth your time with the solid gameplay and change up of the platforming formula. Just don't expect any HD textures or any music that doesn't sound like it was of the SNES/Playstation 1 era.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9yeNmNxJFo\n\nLists:\n+:\nPhysics-based gameplay is fun, and when you get a handle of the controls. Speedrunners will appreciate this game as you can cut off seconds here and there very easily. Did I mention the physics based platforming being fun? It's fun.\nHas an addictive nature to it, especially in the score progression element.\nLevel progression and difficulty curve work rather well. No huge jumps. Good level design all over the place in fact.\nLike the loading screens of tutorials via visuals. Can help in teaching mechanics that you need to get through the levels.\nCollectable and branching paths help add to some variety into gameplay.\nPC performance is pretty good. One little thing with picking up a specific enemy or two, but other then that, great.\n-:\nPlayers who want to use the keyboard only will be disappointed here. WHY ARE TWO NEEDED KEYS PAGE UP AND PAGE DOWN. You can only bind the key to a specific equivalent to the button on the controller, you can't change the key itself.\nThe UI/score/time locations are always in the middle of the screen. Why?\nDoesn't save settings like the full screen option.\nWish I could use the control stick on the controller instead of the DPAD.","November 24, 2015","true","5.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","12","23","3","0"

Playing this game was quite fun but very challenging and often found myself swearing frequently in my head. Compared to Sayonara UmiharaKawase the buttons for controller are back to ‘normal’ with A being accept and B being back. Whereas before it was B to accept and A to back out XD\n\nThe platforming is very unique in that you use a fishing rod as a hook and can pull yourself up walls and dangle down. It almost feels like Splinter Cell Kawase. I do have a video of my first 15 minutes or so, feel free to check it out.\n\nWould I recommend this to anyone?\n\nI feel the unique system of rapelling yourself using the fishing rod is awesome and quite challenging as well as the funny enemies (fish) located around the map are quite amusing and made me laugh. The steep difficulty curve is very interesting too.\n\nI would avoid this game however if you're looking for a fresher (newer) looking platformer as obviously this one is quite dated or feels like (mostly because of the 70s japanese vibe to it). I would also avoid if you're wanting an easy casual platformer or looking for some adrenaline blood rushing action.\n\nThanks, feel free to let me know if I need to add more to this.\n","November 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","15","30","3","0"

This "Steam Edition" doesn't have changes in graphics or interface. No mouse support, no key mapping. In the options you can assign commands to said buttons A B X Y R1/R2 L1/L2, even though you're not informed of what joypad you're supposed to use to play this game. If you don't use a joypad, you eventually find out you are stuck with the keyboard arrows and the keys A and Z. If you want a different mapping, you'll have to download a virtual joystick driver.","November 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","2"
