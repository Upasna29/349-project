Enjoy. :)\nhttp://youtu.be/oZORo_I03rM\n\nCosmic DJ is game where you create and play using music beats much like on a beat pad app or similar grid sequence music software.\nThis is a game that if you enjoy making music and having a good time then you will love this. But don't think you will be making professional music. This is really to just have fun and enjoy the game experience and the trippy graphics. Also, the game narrator rocks! He is the best part of the game.\n\nThe game is really about making your own music through beat pade and a grid sequencer using their beats and tunes which they give you a good selection to choose from. But it's up to you how you mix it up. :)\nBut what I really like is that you can save your tunes as an MP3 file on your PC to show off and listen to later on. That's awesome.\nOverall, for the price, this is a good game experience to try out. :)","May 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","3"

Vibrant Psychedelic Art Direction\n2. Catchy Electro Music\n3. Lasers, Rainbows, Cosmos, and Beats!\n4. Good Vibes\n\nS Y N O P S I S:\nCosmic DJ is a short romp through a wild story about keeping the good vibes flowing through electronic music. Its gameplay revolves around 'jamming' to a preset back track and layering instruments and melodies to move onto the next stage. Don't expect much flexibility in terms of music creation. All the tracks are set to a specific key signature, measure, and tempo. There is also a limited number of instruments to play with for each track; all of which are set to a specific chord progression. These limitations, however, don't detract from the simple fun of jamming along and freestyling the sequence of melodies and instruments. The story is humorous and engaging enough for players to plow through the short 1 hour plot (give or take a few minutes depending on how much the player extends each jam session). Some players may think this is too short without enough content. I'd say that the length of the game is appropriate for the context of this title. The experience will leave a smile on your face once it's through and you'll wish there was more. Luckily, there is some replayability in a Quickplay mode that lets you choose sets of instruments to jam with and create new tunes. One of the best features of the game is its ability to export your jam sessions to MP3s, complete with cover art that you make within the game itself, using the various crazy visuals and stickers they provide. All in all, this is a great indie title for anyone who enjoys rhythm games and quirky, offbeat humor with pop art visuals.

By simply pressing four keys at different intervals, you can generate simple 2-measure sequences of electronic music in 4/4.  It sounds basic, but with its variety of different instruments (drum kits, synthesizers, vocoders, odd samples, and many others), grid-based editing, and post-play remixes, anyone can make a song that can range anywhere between decent to amazing.\n\nThe presentation style is absurd and comical.  The vivid colors, animations, and effects can probably be described better by video gameplay rather than this review.  I found the dialogue to be humorous, but could be considered strange or obnoxious.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to a general audience, but it does have a very strong recommendation to anyone who likes electronic music, unique atmospheres, or just something completely different.","May 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

It's not really a game, but it's not really a creative software. This might sound bad on paper, but the execution is done surprisingly well.\n\nSo what do we do in this game?\nYou enter a level and you get 5-6 different instruments which you can use to make some qoute-unqoute "Sweet Jams". Each instruments have four notes or sounds (depending if it is a melodic instrument or percussions or something). Here you can either choose to put it in a grid or you can map them to the computer keyboard to play the instruments live. You have 8 tacts that loop to fill out, each split into 4 different quarter tacts, totalling a total of 32 places to place the sound. So with 5 instruments, 4 notes, and 32 places to play, you can make a total of 640 different versions per song... kinda. The song you make is in actuality just a part of the song, and you need to make 4 parts of the song in total, making the total of different versions totalling 2560.\nAfter making a song, the game will mix it and make a minute and twenty seconds long single out of it, and you will get the option to make an album cover of said single.\n\nHow many songs are there?\n5,5-ish. I know that's a silly answer, but it will make sense when you play.\n\nIs it fun?\nYES! Yes, it is, although I can't shake the feeling that there really is no way to make a bad song, unless you're actually trying to. You don't actually make the song totally from scratch. There is always some background music, which is basically the same for every song, as it turns out, and then you map out the five instruments and they kind of drown out in each other a bit, so it's actually hard to hear if what you've made is a substantial piece.\nBut honestly, that doesn't matter. You're really not supposed to feel good about the songs afterwards, this is a game, where you will be having a blast WHILE MAKING the song. Yeah, afterwards the song may not be that good in hinsight, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it you were grooving the hell out when mixing it.\nAlso the option to either use the grid sequenser or the tabs is a good choice. The more somber perfectionistic type will probably be loving the grid, while the more bombastic person, who may or may not play live instruments, will probably like to groove out with the tabs.\nIt also helps that the more instruments and the more music you put into your jams, the wilder the background music gets.\nAs a game, there is no real way of losing, and it is not really challenging at all, but the game is not about that.\n\nUhmm... this is probably a stupid question, but is there a story?\nSurprisingly, yes. You are the Cosmic DJ, and you send groovy jams and good vibes throughout all of the galaxies, but the annoying STEVE4 is sending bad vibes, and you must stop him. It is an incredibly non-sensical story, filled with humor and it doesn't warrant to be taken seriously.\n\nIs the price fair?\nHmm... yeah, I think so. The main game is only an hour and half long, but there is a lot of replay value picking the "Quickplay" menu, and then just make a neat little groove every now and then. 6€ (or whatever it is in dollars or pounds) is not much and you will have fun with the game every now and then.\n\nThis game is approved.","May 18, 2014","true","4.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

(If you actually expect to make your own music maybe you should be looking for a DAW or some actual sequencer software instead.) Cosmic DJ comes with some really good and groovy baseline beats that you can jam along to, and it's a lot of good old casual fun. Highly recommended if you need a musical break from the more conventional games or just want to chill out and mess around a little.\n\nActually, I imagine this game could do pretty well hooked up to a good stereo and a projector at a party.

If you're looking for a more serious music game or sequencer, move along for now.\n\nBasically, you're given the option of a Story Mode or Quickplay.\n\nStory Mode: You're taken on a short journey in a futuristic cyberworld thats sweet jams have been taken over by a buzzkill.  Your quest is to repair 5 "Jamtennas" in order to bring bands and groups of people (and one puppy) back together, then take the city back.  Each Jamtenna consists of 4 or 5 segments that tell a story, and each segment forms a different part of the song.  Each part of the song gives you 4 or 5 different instruments, a background track, and a 2-bar loop to program in.  Each instrument gives you 4 different pitches (or sounds depending on the instrument).  Once the Jamtenna has been repaired, the game then crafts your segments into one sweet song and gives you the option to export to MP3.\n\nQuick Play: You're randomly given 4 or 5 different instruments and a shuffle button to swap all of the instruments (there is currently no way to manually select the instruments, or the hold onto the ones you don't want to shuffle in).  You're then given a background track selected at random, and are allowed to go to town on it.  I haven't spent much time with this feature yet.\n\nAll in all, it's currently a super basic music sequencer with a cute story attached to it.  If you only do one playthrough, you could probably beat it in about 1 or 2 hours, and other than the patterns you throw down, you can't really deviate from what you're given (in terms of notes and instruments).\n\nAs far as I can tell from reading the discussion, there's a lot more coming with this game as the developer works on it.  MTCS is a pretty solid guy - he's very active in the discussion boards and listening to what we all have to say.\n\nAs stated in the tl;dr: If you're looking for a fun, quick, casual music "game" it's worth it.

Basically, imagine a tiny music sequencer, simplify it until a three year old can use it, populate it with a weird and weirdly entertaining collection of samples (dog-bark syntesizers anyone?), add some fascinatingly odd visuals and a trippy story, mix it all up with acid and make the head of an utterly crazy yet completely adorable corgi drive it into space. Get the idea? No? I don't blame you, I wouldn't have believed that this could possibly work as a game either.\n\nThe campaign is admittedly very short but makes up for it by offering you one of the most ridiculously awesome stories you could have never imagined. And after you've recovered from that experience, you're still left with the quick play, a super simplified but surprisingly fun little sequencer that is there for you every time you need a 15-minute boost of joy in your day. If you like the idea of fiddling with music and beats, even if you've never tried anything like this before, you need to give this little marvel a go. Fear not your musical incompetence, I am persuaded that the game is rigged to make whatever odd things you create sound brilliant despite your worse efforts.\n\nCosmic DJ is not a game, it is the perfect cheer-me-up machine, the cheapest happy pill on the market. For some strange reason I have a stupid smile plastered on my face every time I fire it up, and every time without exception I feel like hugging the devs afterwards. If it also gave me the munchies I'd be surprised it was legal. ;)","August 5, 2014","true","6.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

I find it delightful when I make a beat that just sounds pretty damn good, and if you enjoy what you made, you have the option to save the music so you can listen to it later. Also, the number of levels are few, but each are fun and offer a unique style that would most likely intrigue you, whether it be the rocket corgis or the flailing puppets.\n\nMoving on to what I have to say about the graphics, I must say, they are charming and I enjoy the retro feel of it all. The game is bright and colorful, and the levels offer different styles to keep things wacky and strange, which I enjoy about this game. It's quirkiness and humor is enjoyable.\n\nThe audio, oh, the audio. Being that this is a rhythm game, the music features catchy techno tunes that will have you bobbing your head as you create your music. Also, the narrator, a funky shaped fellow, has an... how should I say... enticing voice.\n\nOverall, this is a game that should be played if you enjoy music, want to create it, and want to experience the quirky world that is Cosmic DJ.

AND the story line is short but really funny. the narrator is hilarious and the levels have some what imature but funny graphics. if you actually put time in to making some good music then it will work. some of the bad reviews are based on the fact that 1. the music sounds bad 2. the levels have no challenge. Both of these are true if you SUCK AT IT. yes the levels are easy but you are missing the point of the game. you negetive people spam the z x c v buttons while the more talented people who try to make good music actually use the board in which you can make proper notes. the game is fun and quirky and i would recomend it to people under 18.

The developers could have stretched out the levels, and made more. But unfortunately there are only 5 levels, including the "boss battle". The reason I list this is because there was so much potential in creating bonds between the player and the characters, but just as soon as it happens, the game is over. Also, if you paid for a game that's 3 dollars, wouldn't you want a bit longer experience? That's 5 cents for every minute you play of the storyline.\n\nInstrument quality...\nSome of the instruments sound really wierd and choppy, while others are pretty good, this is a bit bad because free play, from what I have seen (don't quote me on this but I didn't see the feature), is that you cannot choose what instruments to use, they are always randomized, could it inspire interesting sounds and songs? Yeah, but you should def have more control over what you get to use in freeplay.\n\nFailure to explain some mechanics\nNow this one is questionable, because the main mechanic is making music, and filling the jam meter. But every once in a while, after I finish inserting the notes for a instrument, an explosive like tile floats across the screen to the right, and apparently if you click on it, it explodes or something, idk because the game didn't really tell me.\n\nFlashing Lights\nI noticed that some of the lights in this game were actually a bit intense, not that I am epileptic, but if you are, you may want to consider not playing and I would stamp a warning on this game somewhere if it truely can trigger an epileptic seizure. I guess this one is debatable.\n\nAlright, now for the Pros\n\nPros\nEngaging and interesting visuals...\nYou like space? You like dogs? You like interactive backgrounds while you play? I sure do, and I did playing this game.\n\nGood music...\nThis is questionable, obviously, as you are the one making the music, but if you know at least a little bit of what you are doing, then the beats will get pretty epic.\n\nExporting your music...\nYes, you can actually export your music, I plan on uploading mine to soundcloud because my mixtape is pretty fire, not gonna lie. But yeah, you can get a mp3 file of the song you just made, pretty cool.\n\nInnocent and charming atmosphere...\nMany a times I found myself laughing at how cute and charming the characters were, I guess you could say that they charmed me ''WITH THE POWER OF MUSIC!!!!'\nBut if you really like this game, buy it when it's for sale, so put it in your wishlist, and wait for the next sale, I got it for $0.74, which I feel was worth every penny. Honestly you could buy it for $3 and still feel content.\n","May 7","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is kooky,\nbut irrelevant.  The game is about building and creating your own music. There\nisn't a score system, and no real failure state; instead the game is about laying\ndown a "sick" beat and melody.  You are limited to what tones are provided to you,\nwhich limits  the player from creating something truly unique to the player.  It\nmissed the mark a bit there, because the mechanics to provide this are there, they\njust don't allow more freedom to the player.\n\nOne fun feature is the availability to use the music any way you want, with\nno copyright issues, you can download it onto your computer to listen to at your\nleisure.  For the price point, this game is easy to recommend.  It is simplistic\nyet goofy and fun, even if its a little short.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to\nwatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 15, 2014","true","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It doesn't offer a particularly featureful or powerful step sequencer. I doubt I'll touch it again.\n\nThis is a gamified tutorial for using a step sequencer. If the game was far longer and introduced more and more features from major step sequencers and itself had a fully featured one built in, it'd be better. It'd be nice if you could reach the point where this produces results similar to what you can achieve with something like Hydrogen. As it is though, there are only a few builtin song structures, your sequences are limited to 8 bars, and there is no kind of song editor nor any kind of automation for mixing or effects.\n\nThe content of this game is pretty much clean, so it might be good if you have kids.","February 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","1"

Play value? Not so much, sadly. I watched the trailer and it was very hyped up - more than it intends. So unless you are into this sort of thing; of somewhat limited sequencing and having a creative mind but lacking proper music creation skills, this is definitely for you. Personally I just find it far too limiting and repetitive. You press a block, it plays a note - you press more blocks, it plays more notes. Again, for the price, extremely worth it. But for play value, you will get bored in no more than 30 minutes if you aren't into simplicity.","July 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even the tutorial had me bopping my head to the beat I created! All you have to do is put different sound effects in at a choice of 4 separate notes. Although 4 isn't much in retrospect, it didn't seem like I had fewer options, rather it seemed like the whole thing was simpler. There's also the added bonus of re-playing the same level many times and making completely different beats each time through. There are several songs you must apply beats to, and at the end of every level it combines all the songs into one *cosmic jam* for you to listen to! The story is light and doesn't get too deep into anything, and always manages to have a little humor sprinkled here and there.

The problem is that success is basically guaranteed just by putting a lot of notes in. It also seems to be the case that you _have_ to put lots of notes in, even if you think it sounds better with fewer in, and it does sound better with fewer in because you don't start out with silence to begin with: there are sounds going on before you even add anything yourself.\n\nAlso any melodic instruments only have 4 possible positions so that limits any tunes you might want to play","September 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The creativity allows for players to customize a jam that they like. This is where the review turns sweet-n-sour; when making a jam and recording the track, you get no say as to how the track is made: you can sequence the basic sounds and stuff, but can't arrange what, where, and how your sequences go into the track, which sort of sucks from a music making perspective. The storyline is somewhat cheesy, with many uses of hippy terminology such as "maaaaaaan" (feel free to add or subtract any number of a's), but it adds to the atmosphere, or "vibes", of the game. Then there's the overly corny theme that everything can be resloved through, and I quote, "THE POWER OF MUSIC!!!!". It's a fun and creative game, not intended for hardcore music producers, or people into deep, serious storylines.

The sequencer mechanic is simple but still allows for a ton of personal variation, the combinations of sounds sometimes sound a bit disparate, but tend to work well together and the fact that there is any attempt at a "story", yet still pulls it off is impressive.  The "remix" at the end can be a bit boring since they tend to all sound the same, but hopefully it'll will expand and add some variation as it matures.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faqyocouch/recommended/297110/","faqyocouch","Ejaculate Jockey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faqyocouch/","223 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCosmic DJ is a musical game, much like Audiosurf and Symphony, but this time, you make your OWN music using a sequencer or what I like to call the "tap cymbals". You can switch and use them interchangably at any time. Unlike Audiosurf and Symphony, however, you cannot USE your own music for gameplay, as this is a creation game.\n\nThere's a tiny bit of storyline to this game. Basically, some cosmic cube is in charge of jamming out the cosmos and he decided to teach you how to jam out with him and make your own music. But, while you're hosting this rad party, some other dude comes in and starts to rudely broadcast his music instead. The controls are easy as well as the difficulty, as even my dog could probably make good music by stepping all over my keyboard. As for the audio, it's basically the entire game and it's awesome. The graphics are pretty stellar, too.\n\nMy experience with Cosmic DJ was awesome. Shortlived, but awesome. At first, it seemed like a stupid game that should just be on the mobile store and that's all there was to it. But, as I played, it turned out to be easy to control with the mouse and ZXCV keys. I personally thought it was very cute. The sequencer was used--as I found out--for more accurate tunes whereas the Tap Cymbals were more for "Press random keys and hope for the best" kind of deal. I actually really wanted to see how far the story went, so I decided to finish it in one runthrough. It took me exactly 58 minutes to finish, which was disappointing, but then I remembered seeing the "Quick Play" Option in the menu and\ntried that out for a while, which was not disappointing.\n\nFrom the realistic puppet bros to the assembling of a jetpack corgi, Cosmic DJ was a great game. Although early access, it still was complete with no bugs that I saw my entire runthrough and the game is basically finished. Though there's music programs out there that can do the same thing Cosmic DJ can do, if you can't sequence or even put together a great track with something like Fruity Loops Studio, Cosmic DJ will take the random input you put in the Sequencer or the Tap Cymbals and make it sound like magic.\n\nWhat I would've liked to have seen, however, was a bit more storyline gameplay. But, for $6 and running on Unity, this game is amazing. The only trouble I potentially had with it was if I was running something in the background, the dialogue audio by that Cosmic Cube would skip a little bit. It wasn't really much of a pain as you'd think, so don't let that stop you from checking this game out.\n\nI would reccommend this to just about anyone. It's a great game and definitely is worth the $6 I paid for it. If you were on the fence about buying this game previously, just do it and don't look back. It's not as bad as you'd expect. Plus, with that hilarious trailer, why wouldn't you?","August 3, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Course," in this case, being a series of scenarios that the game's "story" lays out. The narrative of the game consists of you, the Cosmic DJ, repairing "Jamtennas" so that the galaxy can be filled with good vibes again. It's actually pretty great to see the game almost lampoon its own culture--the visuals are psychadelic, the audio consists of the EDM music you help construct (much of the base track has already been laid out for you), and it generally feels like a fun, at times silly process to create these songs.\n\nMy favorite part of Cosmic DJ is the way it mixes the song portions you create into an MP3 track that is ready to play instantly. While these tracks aren't really all that long, it's still fun to go over your creations and try to outdo yourself. And who knows, maybe this game will get you into buying more expensive but more robust software with which to create and mix your own songs. I kind of wish this game would allow for something on that level, but if that were the case then it probably wouldn't be selling for $6.","July 31, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You bring home a sense of accomplishment you don’t often find in other games. Cosmic DJ is one good example of this type of game.\n\nYou are the cosmic DJ\n\nYou, a floating no face protagonist, are deemed the cosmic DJ by STEVE3, the cosmic conductor of the universe. After learning how to create your own beats and making everyone in the party rock to your groove, STEVE4 crashes the city with bad vibes. It is now up to you to fix the jamtennas with some sweet tracks.\n\nGameplay\n\nCalling Cosmic DJ a game may not be entirely appropriate. This isn’t like dance revolution or guitar hero where you need to correctly follow a certain QTE like sequence in order to play the tracks correctly. There are also no game overs or consequence to be had here (except for some ear damaging music).\n\nIn Cosmic DJ, you play out a scene which is separated into four parts. You select which instruments to play during these parts. You are then presented with a sequencer to input the notes of the instruments. Once you filled in enough notes (regardless of sequence), you are given the option of adding a new instrument to play during a part of the scene. In order to advance to the next part of the scene, you need to fill the “joy” bar by adding enough notes to play the instruments.\n\nOnce you finish a scene, you can save the track you created as an MP3 file. While the game encodes the track, you can create the cover art which will be attached to the file you are creating. The game allows you to save your MP3 in any folder in your hard drive.\n\nPresentation\nThe art style of the game is something straight out of the 80s. From the neon colours to the 3D pixel characters, everything fits the theme of Cosmic DJ. When an instrument plays, you get a visual cue of it playing at the top part of the screen.\n\nMy thoughts\nOne major flaw of Cosmic DJ is its limitation of options in creating your own music track. You create about 60% of the music track where the notes you inserted plays along with the main sequence of the track. There aren’t any other options to help you customise your music to your liking such as controlling the tempo. Since this is just an early access game, gl33k might add more options and sequences for the full retail version.\n\nAfter creating three tracks, I thought anyone can just mash buttons in order to create a decent track. Turns out this isn’t the case.\nHere is one of the good ones I made:\n\nhttp://picosong.com/c5eX/\n\nHere is the intended bad one (decrease your volume. You have been warned)\n\nhttp://picosong.com/c5eF/\n\nOverall, this is one worthwhile game to add to your library. There is nothing like showing off an mp3 to people you know and say you made this yourself with Cosmic DJ.\n\nhttp://gwiser.kinja.com/the-cosmic-power-of-your-own-music-1614624880?rev=1406940712605","August 1, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kind of reminded me of if the Toonami guy had a run in with the Mooninites from Aqua Teens.\n\nThis game is basically a sequencer with animations of corgis and a plot. You sequence your instruments one by one, then the games mixes it for you in to an exportable track when you're finished playing around. The game puts a strong emphasis on experimenting, with zero emphasis on actually keeping up with a rhythm. You can't lose at all.\n\nThere's no challenge factor here - just a fun factor. And it's short. Took me about an hour and a half to get through all the levels.\n\nIs it worth the $5.99? Possibly, especially if you enjoy electronic dance music, puppets, corgis, and cheeseburgers. But if you're looking for a rhythm game,  something more akin to DJ HERO or Beatmania, then this isn't the game for you.","August 1, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I paid around £0.69 for it and for that price it both entertained and annoyed me for a while.\n\nThe game has 5 pros I can think of.\n\nCut Scenes\nI think the cut scenes are the best thing about the game and they had me laughing quite a few times. Steve3 is what made the cut scenes entertaining.\n\nMusic\nThe backing tracks in the levels are actually really good as standalone tracks.\n\nSliders\nI really like the fact there were volume sliders, that I did not expect and they were great for muting unwanted instruments.\n\nExporting\nAnything you create can be exported as an mp3 which is great.\n\nPrice\nIt was very cheap when I bought it and I think it was a fair price, I don't think I would pay full price for it though.\n\nThere are 4 main cons when it comes to gameplay.\n\nInstruments\nI was limited to a only a handful of different instruments to choose from and though the majority were nice sounds some of them would not fit into anything that was playing so I just ended up muting them. Each stage used slight variations of the exact same instruments which got very repetitive.\n\nNotation\nI could not make my own melodies or basslines, instead I was limited to 4 predetermined notes/hits which sometimes clashed with the backing track. Because the backing tracks were basically full tracks already they could end up sounding far too busy when your own notes/hits were added.\n\nMandatory number of notes\nI did not like having to have a mandatory number of notes in the sequencer to be able to move to the next section. Sometimes the instruments or notation were sounding far too busy but I still needed a certain number of notes to carry on, when that happened I would just mute an instrument and put in as many notes as possible to get to the next section. This felt like the only way to progress without making something that sounded way too busy and this took the fun out of the game.\n\nSteve4\nSteve4 just ruined everything with his incredibly annoying voice.\n\nMaybe I'm taking a casual music based game too seriously or maybe because I do quite a bit of music production I've come to expect too much when it comes to any sort of music creation. Either way I feel like the game was a bit of a let down, a mildly entertaining let down.\n\nEven though it has it's faults I would still recommend the game to anyone with a passing interest in music creation or some time to waste.\n\nAt the time of this review the price for this game is £0.49, it's worth it for that price","October 17, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like others have said it feels more like a children's toy than a video game. For the price, this is a fantastic bargain for such a good "toy" that even parents will want to play with... for a little while.\n\nIf you are familiar with using a DAW/music production in general you will probably get a big kick out of this for the first few levels but that feeling will wear off pretty quickly.\n\nThere is always a premade beat going on in the background along with various synths/voices and the provided "kits" are very very similar to eachother and are very limiting. For me personally, these things are very hard to look past.\n\nAlthough this review sounds more on the negative side, I still highly recommend it.\n\nTo end on a more positive note, I recreated Darude - Sandstorm with dog barks and I smile whenever I think about it.\n\nEnjoy.","November 1, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I instead got was a brilliantly crafted game which let me make music (albeit terrible music I am not great at timing).\n\nPros:\n- Decent story line\n- Easy to pick up (Lives up to the pick up and play aspect)\n- Great jams\n- Lets you export your songs and make cover art for them.\n\nCons:\n- Too short. This game took me half an hour at most to finish. The story line while great, did feel like it could have more.\n- It felt like you had to use all of the tools provided in story mode.\n- Lack of things to use to make cover art\n\nAgain, this game surprised me in the most pleasant of ways, and was well worth the price I paid for it. If any dlc comes out for this game that extends the story line or tools you get to use, you can bet I'll be buying it straight away. While the amount of items available to use to make cover art did put me off by a very very small amount, I would still recommend this game.","March 26","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I paid around £0.69 for it and for that price it both entertained and annoyed me for a while.\n\nThe game has 5 pros I can think of.\n\nCut Scenes\nI think the cut scenes are the best thing about the game and they had me laughing quite a few times. Steve3 is what made the cut scenes entertaining.\n\nMusic\nThe backing tracks in the levels are actually really good as standalone tracks.\n\nSliders\nI really like the fact there were volume sliders, that I did not expect and they were great for muting unwanted instruments.\n\nExporting\nAnything you create can be exported as an mp3 which is great.\n\nPrice\nIt was very cheap when I bought it and I think it was a fair price, I don't think I would pay full price for it though.\n\nThere are 4 main cons when it comes to gameplay.\n\nInstruments\nI was limited to a only a handful of different instruments to choose from and though the majority were nice sounds some of them would not fit into anything that was playing so I just ended up muting them. Each stage used slight variations of the exact same instruments which got very repetitive.\n\nNotation\nI could not make my own melodies or basslines, instead I was limited to 4 predetermined notes/hits which sometimes clashed with the backing track. Because the backing tracks were basically full tracks already they could end up sounding far too busy when your own notes/hits were added.\n\nMandatory number of notes\nI did not like having to have a mandatory number of notes in the sequencer to be able to move to the next section. Sometimes the instruments or notation were sounding far too busy but I still needed a certain number of notes to carry on, when that happened I would just mute an instrument and put in as many notes as possible to get to the next section. This felt like the only way to progress without making something that sounded way too busy and this took the fun out of the game.\n\nSteve4\nSteve4 just ruined everything with his incredibly annoying voice.\n\nMaybe I'm taking a casual music based game too seriously or maybe because I do quite a bit of music production I've come to expect too much when it comes to any sort of music creation. Either way I feel like the game was a bit of a let down, a mildly entertaining let down.\n\nEven though it has it's faults I would still recommend the game to anyone with a passing interest in music creation or some time to waste.\n\nAt the time of this review the price for this game is £0.49, it's worth it for that price","October 17, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I do say you should get this game there are allot of cons but also allot of reason why!\nPros:\n1. Thegame is fun...thats it its fun\n2. The game can be played many times because in each level you can make a different song and experiment with the best song you can make.\n3. Its simple and easy. Really all it is, is clicking or you can press- Z,X,C,V to make the music. Though there is a more advanced way of doing it called grid which puts you in a grid and you can make your own music by placing certain points in the song where it will make the noice, like a dog bark on sqare 2, collum 3 and then a high pitched dog yelp on square 5, collum 2.\n\nCons:\n1.the game is really short. By that I mena the game took me half an hour to beat as there are only 5 levelsto it, and like I said in my 3rd statment in pros, its easy so you'll be going through the game very quickly.\n2. this might be just me, but when mixing the songs together Its hard to consentrate after a while because everything overlaps themself.\n3. you can only delete nots in grid mode, in the other mode you have to start the beta all over again which is very annoying.\n\nIn conclusion it's a game that you could buy for £1.99, which is cheap, that you could have on your list for if you are bored one night. Luckily I bought it in a sale for 29p and I would highly recomend getting it in a sale as at £1.99 it is a tiny bit much for a game that keeps you entertained for about an hour!","August 14, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure how much I payed for it. Normally I wouldn't buy a game like this, or really indie games this was just something to spend the remainder of my money on. Also, because my brother had a music sequencer app on his phone, and that influenced me to get this as well.\n\nAt first I wasn't that intersted in it. Now that I've put some time into it, and understand how to create music a bit better it's more fun. It's actually really easy to create a song. I call it song, but really it's just a loop. I haven't played too much of the main story just one jamtenna. That was when I first got it. Since then I've been messing with quickplay.\n\nIt reminds you a lot of Katamari Damaci. Seems very Katamari Damaci inspired.\n\nI can't really convince you to buy it. I mean it seems like you would either be interested in it, or not. Music maker games were always a niche.\n\nThe only things I wish this game had were......\n-Ability to choose own instruments in quickplay (which isn't that much of a bother really. maybe cosmic dj 2? :D)\n-Ability to save the loop unremixed. Most of my loops sound better remixed anyways, but still... Maybe you just want the loop?\n-Ability to tap along to your song while it's playing and the instrument not laying down on the track. Like when I'm choosing my instruments I can play with them, and tap out a beat with that specific instrument. If I do it while I am creating a song it lays down on the track, and I can't expirement with those instruments without it repeating!\n\n\nCreating song's is addicting though.","July 26, 2015","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short, musical game. A nonsensical questline with some tasty grooves along the way. There is no challenge. It's not Guitar Hero but you make music, in a sense. You don't really create music as much as you just sequence additional instruments onto pre-existing tracks. So it's not really all that immersive or open. The tracks will sound the way they want to, it's just a matter of how busy or desolate you want to make the soundscape. In the end you have to make every track very busy and colorful in order to advance through each level, which makes every level the same in one sense. You could literally beat the game on mute, which probably isn't a good thing for a music game. By the end of the game I was just seeing where the story went and kind of rushing thru the levels. Might be more fun with friends, whatever those are.\n\nIt only takes about an hour to beat, but you could take an hour building a beat if you wanted to.

Even at full retail price, I'd recommend this game. My only real issue about this game is that it's short- it's VERY short. It only took me 1 hour to finish the story line- which wasn't really much of one. Cosmic DJ is a game where you are a Cosmic DJ and have to save the city from "Bad Vibes" from the main antagonist (forgot his name). The antagonist destroys all the "Jamtennas" that provide good vibes to the city. As the cosmic DJ, you must fix these "Jamtennas" by completing the tasks given. There are 4 Jamtennas you must fix and each Jamtenna offers 4-5 missions where you need to create a song using the tools given and fix the Jamtenna. The gameplay is very fun and energetic. It's not really complicated and can easily be done by a child. One thing I really liked about the game is that after you create your song, the game will mix all of the songs from that one Jamtenna into a remix which you can save as a .mp3 to your computer. You can create cover art while the game converts the remix into a .mp3. You aren't forced to save the songs, if you really don't like it.\n\nConclusion: If you are hesitant on getting this game, buy it. It's cheap, fun, and will kill time if you need to. 9/10","May 27, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once finished, the computer cuts your parts up so it sounds like 2 different parts.  Then is saves your song.\n\nThats' the whole game.

If any dlc comes out for this game that extends the story line or tools you get to use, you can bet I'll be buying it straight away.

It is easy to go in and create a beat of your own with and you do not need to be a wiz with music making to do it well.  However this is where the negatives start to kick in.  In the game you go between 4-5 different instruments and create beats with essentially 4 different notes....and that's it really. There are bonus loops or instruments that can appear and give you the option of changing your current instrument with the new one or have the option of selecting new music in general.  Besides this there is no other way to make or alter music.  This is where the simplicity will be seen as a negative.  You are not able to fade music in or out, change the BPM, and there is no way to edit your samples the way YOU want after you create them.  The game will automatically edit the samples together which may make your song sound better or worse.  It is a shame that if you want to make advanced samples or create your own songs your out of luck really.  It took me 3 hours to go through the entire "story" section but I will say I had a lot of fun playing through it.  Even though you have limits to the kind of music you can make it is still a fun expereince that is worth that little bit of money it costs to play it.  People looking for an advanced music maker to make samples and great tracks would probably get nothing from this, but for players looking for a simple and fun music creation game to mess around and have fun with then there is nothing wrong with this game.  Did I forget to mention any song you finish you can save and export it to your music library on you computer to listen to whenever you want (even if the songs are just 1 minute long).  A lot of neat ideas in this game I just wish there would be options for more advanced options to give people freedom to create even more awesome tracks.    However because the game only costs a couple of dollars my negatives really are just minor.        Cosmic DJ get's a 7/10 From me.  "It's good for what it provides you for a few dollars and gives you a fun time while providing cool and silly visuals that will put a smile on your face."\n+Fun samples and good beat\n+Great Price\n+Easy to pick up and play\n+Able to Export your music converted automatically to MP3 to your computer library\n+/- Length of game is short but is reasonable considering price\n-Simplistic and does not offer any advanced means to create some real creative samples and tracks\n-some samples that you HAVE to use don't feel like they fit in the song your making\n-no way to select what instrument for when you create custom tracks\n","July 29, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is excellent in my opinion.\n\nAll I wish is for the ability to choose the EXACT instruments we want rather than it being random in quick plays.\n\nAwesome game, very worth the purchase!","May 5","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall there are about 6 'Areas' to play through and each one has 4 miniature 'stages' where you can play around with 5 different instruments/voxes. The backing tracks can only be changed a tiny bit through progression, the more stuff you put into a song the more options you might get to add into it even further.\nThe story's funny to me personally, I rather liked the 'far out' voice of the narrator and the weird things that happen along the way. There's a charm to how simple this game is and honestly I couldn't stop playing once I picked it up.\nThe soundtrack is awesome, especially since the player has quite a bit of influence over it, and there's even more charm to be found in a game that lets you export your little creations to a folder on your computer for later listenings (it's automatic, so don't expect a deep, in-depth music creator here).\n\nEven though the game is incredibly short (expect 2-4 hours depending on how much you want to screw around with the tracks) I found that it was definitely worth the price of admission. It doesn't hurt that I also got this game on sale for less than a dollar, but honestly even if it weren't on sale I'd still recommend it.\n\nIt's only $3, just don't eat lunch for like, one day.","May 6","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
