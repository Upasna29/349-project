I managed to make it through 2 of the levels without losing any pilots. I was racking up XP and RP and researching my Scout's heavy weapons.\n\nAnd then ... disaster struck. It was supposed to be a standard sweep of some dusty mining town, a place called Tundeer. We deployed north of the gates, took out a few Xeno and thought we were ready.\n\nWe couldn't find any of the Faction colonists, but the place was crawling with Xenos. It didn't take them long either, to figure out we were there. The hit us hard, from the west. Scout Brianna had the taken the high ground and the Hunters came in from the ridge to her left. We'd swept it and didn't spot the spawning tunnels. In an instant, Brianna's mech was surrounded. The Warrior's Wrath boost got the Captain back to the ridgeline in two turns ... but by then it was over. Brianna was dead, her tank torn to pieces.\n\nWe cleared Tundeer. We even saved a few of the colonists. But none of us could forget Brianna ...\n\nSo far I like this game. One of the stand out features is the ability to undo the spending of XP at any time with the "Respec" button. Gear does not cost Gold so you can configure and reconfigure each character whenever you want. Don't like that build? Re-design and try again! Game was made by science fiction fans, I'm glad to see hints in the lore about Star Traders 4X too!\n\n*** Full Disclosure: I am a long time fan of the developer and was part of the Alpha Testing team for Battleforce. I also backed them on Kickstarter for one of their other Steam games. I would recommend buying this game just based on the customer service but I did really enjoy playing it before it came out on Steam. ***","September 21, 2015","true","16.4"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","93","106","13","4"

Not so here.\nYou get a new sword and all of a sudden you're single hit killing those low level Xeno's that used to need two hits.\nCrowd control is a thing, and now your Templars are ready for it!\n\nI feel the game also does a good job of satisfying the needs of players who like varying skill levels. I often see the arguments about casual and hardcore gamers now, well to me all games should be capable of supporting both by the use of difficulty levels.\nTrese Brothers have added many difficulty options to suit all players and each level has a good description of what it actually does so the player isn't left guessing and trying to figure it out themselves (Yet another thing the Brothers should be commended on).\n\nThe game does so much right and the Trese Brothers really have poured love and affection into their game and will continue to do so (for Free, I might add).\n\n*Edit: All of the below minor complaints from me have been patched and fixed and the devs continue to update the game. Brilliant devs and they deserve huge credit for everything they do.*\n\nThe very few minor things I disliked or found confusing about the game are already being responded to and were the majority have voiced an opinion are being changed.\n\nThings like the speed of text during cutscenes, I'm slowing down in my old age and I find I am having to rush to read which breaks immersion of the story for me. It confused me because during missions you have to click to forward text and I felt this should be the same for cutscene text.\n\nDuring the starting missions of the game, before you really know what is going on, you are asked to activate a gate but the switch you use to do this just looks like any other map flavour tile and the fact you can click on it is not immediately obvious.\nI lost a few turns here, while thinking to myself, Alright I'm in the area you told me to go to, why isn't something happening? Because you didn't click the switch dumbass. Well it wasn't really that obvious game :D\n\nThe open and closed deployment before going into a mission confused me because whenever it said open I was clicking furiously around the screen for some way to take the Templars I wanted into the mission.\nBefore I finally went to the forums and read that 'open' means you can get a control point in the mission which will allow you to call in more Templars as opposed to actually allowing you to take what you want from the beginning.\nAnd closed meant there would be no control point and what you get is what you have for the full mission. (This is something the devs are addressing and will be updated to allow you to take what Templars you want outside of what is actually needed for the scenario, like an engineer or scout etc).\n\nLastly the fact you left click on an enemy to see their stats but also left click on an enemy to attack them.\nIn the later missions of the game it is important to watch your Templars heat and balance moving, damage and other various skills.\nSo I often want to check the health left on an enemy to be sure I can kill it in another way before taking a shot with the same Templar again.\nThe current system can lead to mistakenly taking shots or using a skill you did not want to.\nYou can unselect your Templar or their skill before clicking on an enemy to avoid this but I feel it is a little clunky and could do with being changed.\n\nAs I said, these things are already been looked into by the Trese Brothers and overall I think they did an amazing job with this game.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves Turn based strategy and squad building games and if you are new to the series and just dipping your toe in I couldn't fault you starting here.\n\nWell worth a purchase.\n\nI hope when the Trese Brothers grow into producing AAA titles they remain true to their current values and continue to price their games correctly and support them as they do now.\n\nThank you Trese Brothers.\n\nI look forward to what I hope will be a very long and bright future for you in video games.","September 24, 2015","true","13.0"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","75","83","3","0"

It shares common ground with other squad tactics games like Xcom and the more recent Warhammer 40K Space Hulk games. It adds its own spin on progression by blending table top RPG attributes, light tech tree management and weapon/gear loadouts to give it its own unique tone and feel.\n\nCombat is quick and challenging, often you can kill a enemy in 1 turn but if you aren't careful they can do the same. It's important to have each member of your squad cover and support one another, because if any single member is left exposed they will quickly be overwhelmed. At the end of the day CROWD CONTROL is the name of the game, you are also often playing AGAINST THE CLOCK. You are encouraged to race through and complete each scenario as fast as possible. If you stay put and try to bide your time you will usually lose by attrition and get overwhelmed. By this same token exploration can be a double edged sword where exploring the map might uncover bonus experience or a cache, but you might stretch your characters too thin and risk becoming too weak to finish your objective. Buffs and enhancements have limited use so you need to use them with some finesse, this also ties into the pressure to speed through the level in as few turns as possible.\n\nThe combat turn is free forming where your characters can do any action in any order you wish. The characters don't have to complete all of their actions before selecting the next character. There is no turn order. For example: your soldier can shoot someone, then have your captain buff the squad, then go back to your soldier to setup overwatch, then have your captain push ahead all on the same turn.\n\nAnother wrinkle to combat is there are forward points or "Tactical Points" that you can capture and control on the map. You use these as staging areas; they generate currency over time you can use to resupply, deploy extra squad members and give your squad bonuses. You will often feel compelled to protect these "Tactical Points," especially since the enemy can destroy and capture them too. Maintaining these points can be critical in some levels. However in other levels the Tactical Points can be a misleading lure; slowing your game down where you get caught up in standing off against the enemy when you should instead be pushing ahead. Caught up in a struggle over Tactical Points will cause you to lose momentum and eventually lose to attrition as many levels will have unlimited enemies.\n\nAnother thing to be wary of is that while many of the enemy spawn points are marked and easy to identify, many others are much more subtle and not so easy to identify, this can lead to some frustrating moments (especially at higher difficulties) as spawning enemies can freely move and attack on the same turn that they appear. This can compounded by squad members' short line of sight. Members that can counter act this with the "Sensorkit Scan" will be invaluable.\n\nDeath on lower difficulties will give you back your characters after you finish the level, but on higher difficulties death is permanent. The game is very different depending on the difficulty setting you chose: on low to medium difficulty the game is more akin to a Sci-fi RPG with a core party you can rely on regardless of what happens. At higher difficulties you get more of a Xcom experience where you have to live through the loss of your veteran members killed in action.\n\nProgression is handled in a split of traditional skills and attributes, a branching tech tree, as well as weapon/armor/augment loadout you take into battle. You can respec your squad skills without detriment. With unlimited respecs you can adjust to whatever scenario the game throws at you and experiment without the worry of being stuck with skills you dislike. There is some light customization with color swap, portrait swap and renaming your characters, but it is not very in depth. Some more options and perhaps different graphics for the more robust armor and weapons would help give the characters a little more distinction and personality.\n\nThe story is serviceable but not very robust which is understandable for a squad tactical game. The focus of the game is the combat and how you handle yourself in battle. Most of the plot and background development will happen through cut scenes, monologues, dialog trees and discussions with fellow crew at headquarters. I actually hope more plot, origins and history of Shalun will be added in future updates to flesh out this games plot ties with the other Star Trader games a little more.\n\nThe UI is easy to understand and most things are clean and well explained.There are useful tool tips for most elements in the game. However I do feel some key information ought to be included in the tool tips such as remaining AP/MP and perhaps armor and deflection. Toggles for animation speed, and more general game options would be welcome additions too.\n\nMusic ambiance is decent, some tunes are catchy and capture the mood or situation, but some tracks seem cut short and can become weary after several plays. Sound effects are also serviceable but nothing amazing.\n\nIn Summary:\nOverhead Squad Tactical Grid Scenario Combat Game with some twists and a unique approach to progression.\nFight as a Templar Captain in part of the Star Traders universe taking flavor from Dune, Space Hulk, and some Hindu.\nPRO\nSimple and challenging combat that is easy to pickup and play.\nLots of scenarios, varied difficulty settings, and an ever growing list of content (due to updates) help give the game long legs and high replayability.\nGreat overwatch mechanic that is tactical without destroying balance.\nThe devs are very involved and receptive to community feedback and the game is always improving as a result.\nCON\nCharacters could use some more customization to make each member feel more like your own.\nVery little game options to tailor your preferences.\nMusic and sound effects are serviceable but could still be better, particularly music loops could be longer and more varied.\nSome enemy spawn locations are hard to make out leading to frustrating moments.\nMany levels require a "core" set of classes and don't leave much room to experiment with the less used classes. Edit: Devs have added a swap out member mechanic which does help this a bit.\nOTHER\nThe Tutorial levels can drag a bit and do a bit of hand holding, I'd suggest playing through it just once for the plot points or to get the basics down and then skipping ahead to the main game from there.\nThe setting is akin to Space Hulk but has it own subtle spin and ties into the other Star Traders games from a Templar prospective, I hope more plot and Star Trader history is added in future updates.","October 4, 2015","true","24.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","50","57","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitekitten/recommended/370020/","whitekitten","Jewel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitekitten/","198 products in account","I love this game. Have thoroughly enjoyed playing 23+ hours so far and I think I'm about halfway through. Bottom line, if you're into squad based combat games, and don't need fancy graphics, this game is for you. It's kind of like XCOM but without the stragteic base management, instead the strategic management is more about spending your xp wisely, equipping your troops correctly, and unlocking the parts of the trees that your soldiers need to upgrade gear/abilities.\n\nI hope these guys come out with an expansion, or another game. They have got everything right from the actual gameplay perspective, all they need is a little more polish on the graphics (better and more varied animations, a bit better UI) and sounds, but those are just a matter of getting better assets, not a fundablement problem with the game.\n\nGood\n* Writing is crisp and impactful without delivering walls of text. You also don't have to read pages of exposition up front, the game drops you in the middle of the action and the story without the need to explain everything up front. If you don't mind learning-as-you-go (I really enjoy it) then it's a great experience.\n* Excellent balance of difficulty, fun, and excitement. I've felt challenged on most levels (occasionally I breeze through one), and even lost a few levels.\n* The equipment and leveling up systems are great. You unlock gear through a requistion process, but you don't buy individual pieces, instead you can then assign it to any soldier. When you level up you get to assign 2 different and independent stats while leveling a talent which are the abilities you can use in game.\n* The soldiers classes feel /very/ different from each other and there are about 10 of them. Even small loadout changes can really flavor how they behave and operate on the battlefield. You also have a lot of choices on how you want to mix/match meele/ranged.\n* The game doesn't reward you for "farming" during the mission at all. Get in, get the job done as quickly as possible, and keep your soldiers alive. You get extra xp and requsition points for doing the right thing (not for sitting at a spawn and camping).\n* The in-mission replenishment system is great. You defend control points and those give you supply points which you can use to purchase stuff like medpacks. These control points aren't in every map, and generally if there are any you have to bring an Engineer.\n* The mission flavors are great. I always feel like I'm doing something new. They do a great job of mixing up "defense, escort, push, speed, explore" kind of maps. I have actually picked out different flavors of teams based on that. The size of your team also changes, and there are occasionally NPCs that come with you (which can be a fun way to play with a class you haven't unlocked through the requisition system already).\n* The mechanics of the game are great, and there's a lot of stuff in the character page that helps explain stuff. I would comment that it's kind of hard to get a feel for if you're pumping a stat too hard. IT would be nice to see the dice rolls and calculations which drive the game so that you could get a better idea if you've put way too many points into accuracy.\n\nBad\n* The sound effects are pretty terrible. The music is OKay, but the gunshots and alien damage noises are really repetitive and often times I have a hard time telling what they are suppose to be.\n* There is no "walk range" indicator that shows you what tiles you can move to. This also becomes a problem when you're starting out on a new tileset because it can be hard to tell which tiles you can move onto. You basically just have to experiment.\n* Graphics are barebones and animations are a little stiff as well as having exactly one animation for each action. No idle animations either. It's servicable, but not great.","October 24, 2015","true","28.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

Templar Battleforce is a love letter to games like Space Hulk and the early days of X-COM.\n\nYou play as a group of superhuman, genetically enhanced warriors who are protecting a newly colonized section of a vast interstellar empire. Imbued with the ancestoral memories of your templar ancestors, it is your duty to beat back the unreleting hordes (and they really are hordes) of Xenos scum looking to make a meal of you.\n\nGameplay consists of top-down, turn based combat. You command a small squad of templars in a manner very similar to the original X-COM. Unlike your crysalid-bait rookies, (and more like Space Hulk) your templars have tremendously powerful skills and infinite ammo. The downside is that both abilities and weapons generate heat, as does movement, forcing you to pick which targets to kill, but to decide when as well. Overwatching a bridge swarming with xenos may provide excellent fire support, but the resulting weaponsfire may also overheat your critically toatsy templar.\n\nAlso like Space Hulk, you are always completely and totally outnumbered in Templars Battleforce. Enemy reinforcements are infinite, and many battles are fighting advances or retreats against mounting waves of foes. This makes for some surprisingly intense combat, and will definitely give your grey matter a workout. Do you split your forces into two advancing teams to get to the objectives faster? Do you leave one behind at the beacon to wait for your own reinforcements? Do you hold at the beacon until you are at full strength and hope it is sufficient to beat back the mass of xenos that have arrived?\n\nThe game also rewards quick mission times with greater experience, giving incentive to take risks. However, your troops are persistent, as is death. Don't spend your Templars unwisely.\n\nTLDR:\n\nIf you're a fan of Space Hulk, X-Com, or Turn-based Strategy, you can't go wrong with Templars Battleforce.","May 6","true","15.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","1"

With more skills, items, stat distribution, then you can shake a stick at, you will craft your army of Templar warriors from head to toe as you battle the Xeno alien forces. Templar Battleforce is extremely focused on playing smart, as I played the game I noticed it focuses more on tactical positioning and proper skill usage, and less on fast paced action and explosions.

It's a great game by a great developer. The Trese Brothers, long-time veterans of tabletop tactics games, got their start developing games for smartphones.  They have since produced numerous games exploring multiple genres in a short handful of years. Templar Battleforce represents a return to their stated mission: the creation of high-quality, multi-platform RPGs and Strategy games, supported by strong community involvement and a commitment to lifelong game updates.  All of their games fulfill this vision in some manner, but Templar Battleforce checks every box.  Furthermore, in creating Templar Battleforce, the Trese Brothers have used the lessons learned over their first few years as a fledgling studio to re-envision and re-invent the spirit of one of their earliest games- Templar Assault. It's a great feeling to play a game that is an indie dev's dream made real.\n\nA Different Grim, Dark Future\nBefore I discuss gameplay I'd like to address a common criticism of both the Star Traders universe and the Steel universe (Trese Brothers' fantasy setting).  The Trese Brothers have time and again explicitly recognized the Warhammer and WH40K settings as major inspirations for their work.  They also acknowledge many other sources of inspiration for their original settings.  Are the Trese Brothers' settings derivative? Yes. Does that make their settings rip-offs? No.  Point me if you can to a fantasy or spce opera setting in a game that is not derivative, because I've never seen it.\n\nThe Trese Brothers settings combine common tropes in original and compelling ways, building an internally consistent universe on the foundation of inspiration.  Yes, some devs cut & paste together bits and pieces from popular settings.  The result is a lazy pastiche of improbable bedfellows, without depth or heart.  The Trese Brothers are clearly heavily invested in their settings, and as a result the world-building is unique, coherent, and immersive.\n\nEvery Leviathan Armor is for You, Templar. Which One Will You Make Your Own?\nGameplay is divided into two primary components: missions and combat, and HQ activities.  The game features features a branching storyline that is tense and dramatic without being overbearing.  You will encounter story dialogue during most missions, but it rarely lasts longer than a handful of sentences.  The combat is top-down and grid-based.  Each Templar has a set number of Action Points (AP) and Movement Points (MP) derived from their base attributes.  The bottom of the screen displays an action hotbar, portrait, and HP and Heat bars for the selected Templar. Actions use AP and generate Heat. If MP is available acting will consume that as well, so it's often prudent to move everyone first and then go back have each one act.  If the Heat meter fills the Templar will not be able to use hotbar abilities. If it overfills they will take damage. Luckily, taking no action dramatically cools the armor.  Cover, line of sight, smart ability use, and overwatch are key elements of success.  The math feels polished, precise, fair, and detailed.  Many maps contain multiple main and secondary objectives; you will rarely play a "Kill All Enemies" mission.\n\nBetween missions you manage your squad at the HQ screen. It looks like a base-building interface but there's actually very little of that.  Instead, this is where you choose how to level each character, hire new characters, and requisition new items and abilities.  It's a class-based paradigm, with each class having access to unique skill trees and equipment.  Each level attribute and skill points are distributed manually, allowing for enormous flexibility and diversity.\n\nPerhaps my favorite piece of the HQ experience is the requisition tree.  You earn RP by completing objectives, which you can then spend on an astounding array of global unlocks. Many of the unlocks are class-specific, and the skill-tree paradigm means getting the unlock you want first requires unlocking everything below it.  This is where the game requires careful consideration of your own gameplay style- you can't just unlock everything, you have to choose.  Of course this aspect also adds to the games replay value.\n\nThus, my Recommendation...\nIf you've enjoyed other Trese Brothers games, you will definitely enjoy this one.  And as always the Trese Brothers offer the game attentive and continuous support.  I don't know of any other studio as endlessly committed to improving every product they release.  If you are new to Trese Brothers games, Templar Battleforce is a great place to start your journey.\n\nI recommend this game for all fans of turn-based squad tactics or of space opera RPGs.  I also recommend this game to almost anyone else, because it both imminently accessible and thoughtfully compelling.\n\nTemplar Battleforce: 8/10\nTrese Brothers: 10/10- an all around class act.\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","February 17","true","10.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","2"

Enemies and Templars alike have a wide range of interesting talents to select from, none of which have struck me as redundant so far. The tech tree is expansive and detailed, with missions providing enough unlock points to facilitate experimentation while you find the layout that works best for you. The Templars also feature a system akin to genetic memory that allows for full respec between missions. While flavourful, this also allows you to experiment with a variety of builds without having to worry about making your units suboptimal in the later game or having to maintain more copies of each class than you need.\n\nThe developers clearly love their creation and have demonstrated a level of interactivity, responsiveness and support that I find very impressive.\n\nIf you like the genre, I absolutely recommend this game.","November 3, 2015","true","21.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I will not go into the gameplay or -mechanics in detail, other reviewers already did that extensively. I bought this game a while ago after noticing it in my steam queue and browsing the reviews (esp. vintoks' and Arkelis' recommendations I found very appealing). Played it for a bit and dropped it for XCOM2. Now I am back at it and that alone should tell you something.\n\nThe Good:\n+ It's been said before, this is the game Space Hulk wanted to be and failed at.\n\n+ The game is very accessible, I consider myself to be a filthy casual when it comes to squad tactics games and I knew my way around pretty quickly without reading a manual. The tutorial is excellent in that regard and tooltips are really helpful. All the powers/actions are adequately explained and those explanations are easily accessible from all the relevant screens.\n\n+ The game mechanics allow for a very good scaling of the difficulty level. I have only played on normal yet (which isn't too much of a challenge even for me *yet*) but I took a peek at other difficulties and the heat distribution of your armor alone requires more planning on your part on the higher ones.\n\n+ I enjoyed the tactical challenges and diverse missions I have encountered so far and I don't miss the hilariously aggravating RNG of XCOM 2 for one second.\n\n+ Customization of your troopers helps identifying and becoming invested with them, as far as you can get invested in something without a personality (your Captain is the sole exception there, as he actually talks) ;).\n\n+ The ability to - at any point between missions - completely and freely respec any character is brilliant and invites you to experiment without having to start a new character. This is (for me) a serious long term enjoyment factor.\n\n+ Same goes for the diverse equipment options you can unlock for your Templars.\n\n+ Various troop specializations give you a wide variety of tactical options (once you unlock the relevant classes in the requisition tree).\n\n+ The story is nice, if not very surprising or unexpected, especially when you are a 40k aficionado like me.\n\n+ The devs. If you read - for example - the negative reviews, you might have noticed, that each one has a calm, objective comment, addressing key gripes of the reviewer where those where recognizable. Frankly I have yet to see something like that anywhere else on Steam (didn’t do ALL the research here tho, so do not make that into a gospel, please). At the same time there is still tweaking and improving of the game going on, months after the official release. And I am not only talking bugfixes, but also new skins and general improvements lesser people would hide behind a DLC.\n\nThe Bad:\nThings I didn't like with the game(play) itself, as opposed to outside appearances (see The Ugly). I am struggling with this a bit, since I pretty obviously enjoyed the game so far. Also I haven't finished it yet, but I wanted to get a positive review out as small games really can use those. So I might come back later and add to this here, but for now, this is what I got. As of now, none of them are anything major, just small annoyances:\n\n- While there are secondary objectives to a mission, I haven't yet found a way to actually discover what they are without stumbling across them accidentally on the map. This clashes with the bonus you get for completing a mission in as little time as possible. That may be intentional, but I'd like the opportunity to decide beforehand if my squad should rather try for secondary objectives or speed. As it stands I don't even positively KNOW if there are secondary objectives at all most of the time (mostly there are, I think, but there seems to be no way to know beforehand) and this leads to a tendency to do a mission twice, once to chart the map and once to actually progress the campaign. Again, this might be intentional, but me no likey.\n\n- There are opportunities to pick up loot from containers during a mission. You can recognize those by the coloring of their adjacent fields. This I discovered accidentally, it would have been nice to get a hint towards this in the tutorial. Also it seems there is a limit on how often this works during one mission, because I had times when I had already picked something up and then further containers I came across didn't give me anything (again a little annoying, because of wasted turns to get there). This too would be nice if it was mentioned somewhere, I haven't found a hint in that regard yet.\n\n- Sometimes the dialogue options between the missions don't make it sufficiently clear that picking them will start a certain mission and close off other options.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n- If you are looking for eyecandy, this might not be the game for you. The devs did good (and upgraded it noticeably a short while ago), but it can't hold to current standards. And why should it? It is an Indie game, catering to your tactical needs, graphics are a secondary means to that end at best.\n\n- The soundtrack, yeah same. It is ok, but we are pampered by AAA games in that respect. I personally turned it off after a while and have something playing in the background (I hear all the cool kids do that these days anyway).\n\n- No voiced narrative or characters. It's all reading here. That is no problem for me but it bears mentioning.\n\n- The action, hmm. Action and round based strategy? Yes possible (see XCOM(2)), but imo more of the eyecandy category.\n\ntl;dr:\nI enjoyed (and still enjoy) this game a lot. I regard it as a real gem in the huge dungpile of bad games that Steam can be. If you like turn based squad-tactics you should check it out. If you like a 40k-esque setting,  even more so. If you bought Space Hulk and were disappointed by that, buy this game! Seriously!\n\nThe price tag is immensely reasonable. I have spent more money on some boardgames I put away after one evening. I already got my money’s worth out of this and am still going.","February 26","true","30.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

You don't simply level up your soldiers, you adapt your squad to your style of play.\n\nFinally, the Trese Brothers are the most responsive game developers ever.

The mobile game origins are pretty obvious, but rarely distracting, and it's way more complex than I expect from most mobile games.

You like sci-fi? You like turn-based TACTICAL (yess, all caps!) games? You like RPGs with deep customization of characters and squad? You like story-driven scenarios with lots of objectives? You like to have access to the mechanics of the rules? You like all of the above except the sci-fi genre (you prefer goblins and wizards, is that it?)?\n\nWell you have to at LEAST read on.\n\nI've only played 2 missions (2 times the first one, 1 time the second), and let me tell you this : this game is serious stuff!  Now you might say ''Pfff, you barely played the game, how can I give credit to your review?''. Because just browsing through the interface, options, library, menus, tech trees, character sheets, etc., you'll get the feeling you know you like to have from this kind of game. The feeling of satisfaction. The feeling of devotion and attention to details from the devs.  The feeling that you'll spend quality time playing the game. The feeling that your decisions in-game actually matter.  And... the feeling that you won't see much of your family and friends for the next few weeks!\n\nHonestly, I know nothing from the Star Traders universe, but I'm familiar with Warhammer 40k and StarCraft with their space marines. The Templars in this game hits the same chords : who doesn't like hulking machines decked-out in heavy weaponry ready to fire at every alien shenanigans they come by? On a more serious note : the Templars are really well done and diverse.  The lore behind them is also very interesting, and I love how it reflects into actual character customization. In this game, you can respec your Templars at-will between each mission, so you'll never be locked in your choices of character upgrades.  It lets you try different skills without the drawback of having to lvl another character.\n\nWhat I really like is that information is not hidden. If you haven't noticed yet, I like to look at menus, tooltips and interfaces a lot because to me, these are the things that make or brake games like that.  And the ones found in this game are simple, easy to use and easy to know what is what.  From the font, to the colors used to identify different rolls, to its sound effects, you simply cannot have difficulties navigating through your character sheet, assigning orders and planning your moves.\n\nNow to actual gameplay and features. After only 2 missions in, I see the enormous amount of tactical and strategic plays you'll have to make to succeed in this game.  From using the terrain to your advantage, to capturing Tactical Points to get more reinforcement and supplies, while having to carry out your mission in a timely fashion, this game offers a deep experience.  It let's you take your time to plan out your strategy. Turn by turn, yes, but also before deploying into the actual mission.  You have to select your gear, your talents, your skills, etc.  Because you want to succeed, yes. But you also want to survive.\n\nTemplar Battleforce offers a wide selection of game difficulties that will satisfy casual to semi-hardcore to full hardcore players.  Permanent death not your cup of tea? Play easy or normal, where your Templars carry on to other missions if you succeed even if they were defeated in battle.  You like to play with permanent death but don't want to lose everything if you screw up? Demanding and Hard difficulties let you abort and retry your missions without penalty, but you can chose to carry on and accept the death of characters if you succeed the mission.  Then there are harder game modes where decisions are final.  You died? Sorry pal, you are dead.  No turning back.\n\nAnd finally, the amazing support of the devs.  The devs are real soldiers.  They have placed an Overwatch over their game.  As soon as you ask a question.. BAM! an answer comes right away.  They never seem to overheat.  And they are really dedicated to implement player suggestions into the game.  Browse through the community hub and you'll see. They put out guides, they ask for game files to track stats, they actively participate in discussions, they give interviews and are clear about the future of the game (no DLC), and most importantly, they update the game frequently. The game is even available on mobile platforms and they plan to share saved files eventually.\n\nSo by all means, if you hesitate about buying this game, you shouldn't. If you are into tactical turn/squad-based games, you will like it. If you don't like that type of game then.. what are you exactly doing reading about it? :P","November 8, 2015","true","18.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

You can upgrade items while in HQ\n3) There is a big requisition map that sort of looks similar to the talents map in map of exile, but opens gear options/abilities like recruiting certain armor/classes\n4) I think the combat is done better\n5) Maps are smaller, more focused, and have objectives (and some side objectives)\n\nThis is kind of a more x-comy Heroes of Steel but with a requsistion map instead of base building and more story centric, less open world.\n\nI like it more than heroes of Steel.  I personally think it is well worth the full asking price depending on what you are looking for in a game.

If you are looking for a traditional rpg such as WL2 or PoE this isn't one so either skip or wait for a big sale.

Yes, this is indeed like playing a squad-based Warhammer 40k tactics rpg.\n\nYour Templars are very much like the Space Marines of the Warhammer universe: the enjoyment of slaughter, the willingness to die, and the massive suits of power armor. However, unlike Space Marines, they can be women too. And that's about the only difference.\n\nThe story is mediocre, centering around colonizing a new system and fighting off xenos and cultists, but provides a few intersting moments. It is a squad-based tactics rpg though, so story is put on a backburner to the combat, which is... alright.\n\nCombat is by far the better part of the game. Multiple classes, most of which actually do use different tactics and even feel different. The Soldier/Neptune and Berseker/Paladin basically play the same except that Paladins can heal. Scouts move fast and hit with snipers, Engineers can fortify and build turrets, soldiers overwatch, hydras can create lakes of fire to limit enemy movement. All this makes choosing who you use and how you use them an actual challenge, especially in the missions with tight corridors.\n\nUnfortunately, that really is all there is to say about this game. It's an enjoyable play of squad tactics and provides quite a bit of fun. On the harder difficulties, your squad members die permanently, but you can recruit replacements any time, so that makes it pretty pointless. If you enjoy tactics games, this is worth a playthrough, though probably pick it up on sale rather than full price.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There are 8 classes total including the captain.\nAll templars earn xp, which is used to upgrade stats. They also earn points to apply to talents. A nice and interesting feature is they earn 'wargear' points. The higher this is the better the gear they can equip.\nLoadouts can be changed at any time, none of the weapons/armour/gear cost anything, once they are unlocked you have them.\nThere is a nice variety of enemies trying to separate your limbs and the levels, even though turn based are really tense.\nThere is too many features to list them all here, from the tact points, reinforcements and the excellent overwatch system.\nYou get attached to your customised templars and beg for miracles when one is getting swarmed.\nThe campaign is long, I don't feel like I've even scratched the surface of it. It is full of choices, go this way? Help these people? The game/story is well written and it's an interesting universe the devs have created. The art is actually quite nice, and  you can zoom in close during battles. The sound is well done and it really adds to the atmosphere.\nThe devs are really active, really supporting their games and easy to communicate with.\nHonestly I couldn't recommend this game higher, it's a bargain at it's price.\n\nThe game has complex systems at work in the background but it is really easy to understand and learn.\nDo youself a favour and pick this one up, it's an overlooked gem for sure.","January 7","true","26.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You take your squad through turn based missions not unlike Xcom tactical phase or Jagged Alliance (if you remember Laser Squad then that's an even better comparison) and the game uses both an AP and MP system as well as an overheating system (keep running around, firing wildly and using abilities wantonly will quickly overheat a Templar's suit and cook the pilot inside!).\n\nMP+AP might confuse some people at first as AP uses up MP too, but it also allows you to take more complex moves then allowed in say..xcom unless you have a ton of perks. Ex: you can have a Templar throw a grenade for 1AP, fall back with remaining MP then end your turn by using up all your APs into firing action.\nCombined with overheating, this means optimal use of your Templars can be trickier then it seems especially in hectic situations. If I'm making it out to be tedious though, rest assured, it isn't. It enhances gameplay and contributes to the feeling you are commanding a squad of walking tanks.\n\n\nInbetween missions you unlock equipment, abilities and new Templar classes in a tech tree of sorts as well as levelling up and gearing up your Templars. At first the options are limited as you'd expect, but you quickly start unlocking stuff and your Templars are able to carry more equipment as they level, increasing build flexibility as the game goes on.\n\nThe game can be played with ironman settings and permadeath if desired.\n\nThe best points of this game are definitely the squad development which is far more extensive then any other title of this genre I've played and lots of action, you'll quickly rack up hundreds of dead xenos.\n\nAs a 40k fan I was quite partial to the design and feel of the Templars themselves too, a couple of missions has human enemies and/or allies and the difference between normal squishy humans and your power armored behemoths is quite satisfying.\n\nGraphics is probably going to be the biggest barrier for people who care about that. Visuals are perfectly serviceable and clear and I like the blood splatter and gooey messes aliens leave, or for that matter the bloodied wrecks of dead Templars, but I recognize that people born a lot later then me might have more picky tastes so check out screenshots and see if that doesn't bother you.\n\nPros:\n-Exelent rpg mechanics and squad development mechanics, so many games have the rpg tag yet have rather shallow level up mechanics and this isn't one of them. Tooling up your templars is just a joy in this.\n-Linked to the above, you can respect stats and talents any time, so no fear of making "bad" builds and you can experiment more.\n-Missions are nicely varied in the objectives and challenges you need to overcome.\n-Great gameplay overall.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are clear and functional but unlikely to impress. Animations as well can be described as such.\n-Apart from maybe 1-2 music tracks, don't recall the music to have been particularly memorable.\n-There is a story and even some choices to make but this isn't really a game you play for the story. That said, I found the Templar lineage part of the background quite cool and liked how it justified respeccing Templars within the lore.\n\nOverall as far as squad based tactical games go this is a really good title, 100% reccomend it.","September 26, 2015","true","57.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Do not let the dated graphics put you off. The game has a depth to it that you would not expect if you judge it by its looks alone.\n\nWhile not evenly polished, the game is quite enjoyable. On normal difficulty, the game will challenge you without becoming overly frustrating. There are a couple of levels that add speical objectives that are difficult to achieve either due to time constraints or due to the sheer amount of enemies that come after you. Others, such as the final battle, put your units in situations that make it very difficult to keep them from being overrun and torn apart before you can get backup to them.\n\nAll of the unit types are useful in combat, which is something that other games do not do well. Your engineers can hold their own, the scouts are death dealing glass cannons that can save your units from ambushes through their ability to scan around corners, and the hand-to-hand units deal and absorb damage with a flare that put a smile on my face. The later units tend to be a little too similar to their predecessors, and tend to have weaknesses that offset their heightened powers to the point that you are better off investing in boosting the older unit types rather than spend precious research points on the newer units.\n\nWhile it might seem that I am being harsh in my review, it is because there were so few flaws in the game that they stand out like proud nails on an otherwise unblemished floor. I give this game my full recommendation, if you like either Warhammer 40K or X-COM.

I think that there are a few things that are off, but it's really enjoyable to play. I also respect that there have been so many patches and additions. There are a couple things that are kinda like...what? otherwise a very good game.\n\nIt's tactical and turn based. It's heavily reminiscent of Warhammer 40K so if you're a fan of that you might like this, or hate it depending on how much you like warhammer. The plot is simple. you're a templar dood who takes command of a squad. You're trying to locate the source of xeno scum and wipe them out, essentially.\n\nThe turn based combat seems a little weird at first, but once you understand how it works it can work pretty well. You spend AP by doing actions or you spend move points by moving. if you move first, you don't spend action points, but if you shoot first you spend move points. Like if you have 6 move and action points. You move 3 spaces and then shoot for 3 action points. You would have 3 action points and no move points left. This means it's often better to stand firm and fire a whole bunch and encourages stationary combat. Which is good as well because the enemy is mostly melee. There are defintiely ranged enemies too though and there aren't just xenos, but they are the main enemy.\n\nThere's also a 'heat' system where if you take too many actions your templar can overheat and take damage. This restricts you from shooting and moving too much.\n\nI feel as though the 'requisition' system is neat too, but kinda makes me spread too thin. It's better to focus on a few classes, like 4 of them than to try and get them all. I also don't like that there is soldier and then heavy weapons because they function essentially the same. Paladin and berserker are similar too, but they have the distinction of being a healer and a pure melee which is nice, but there could be more variety in them.\n\nThe other classes are pretty varied though and quite fun to mess with. I like that engineers can lay turrets or specialize in capturing. Scouts can kite or be big hitters and armor penetrators or dedicated stealth scouts. Stealth works pretty uniquely too since it's not just 'turn invisible now you're invisible' but that you increase your stealth and stealth levels make you harder to detect. The only downside I can see is it's hard to tell if your guy is actually 'stealthed' since stealth levels reduce the range the enemy can detect you at. You kinda gotta manually do it?\n\n\nAnyway I would definitely recommend the game. I like the game, the devs seem responsive in fixing bugs and adding in some content and making the game as a whole better. Some real love was put into the game and it makes the game even better as a result. I would like to see another templar game come out!","November 28, 2015","true","28.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

TBF is much more focused and mostly you aren't going to roam freely around the maps, but it's not a bad thing, since it makes the gaming experience more compact and probably more enjoyable for the average gamer. (In reality you can explore the maps as you wish, but it's dangerous because xenos are costantly spawning and there's a turn limit for XP bonus, if you're trying to obtain it).\nTactical combat and character development are excellent as in HoS, while the tech tree adds a layer of complexity, that makes up for the more linear structure of the game. Feeling of progression is also faster, and so the general pace of the game.\nI can't decide which one I like more, it really depends if you prefer a fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and I like them both.\n\nPros:\n\n+ better graphics and sounds than in HoS\n+ more focused mission-based gameplay helps keeping a good pace\n+ missions are not repetitive, objectives are varied and you need different approaches\n+ more character types, with lots of possibilities for talent/gear customization\n+ extensive tech tree that makes talent choice much less obvious than in HoS\n\n(Very minor) Cons:\n\n- as in HoS, music is mainly made of loops; there are some brilliant tunes among the lot, but also some that you'd wish to skip (but you can't, unless you exit the mission and reload)  (you can check my Extended Soundtrack mod if you wish, look for it in the Steam forum)\n- unlike in HoS, the story isn't a very important part of the game, even if it shares the setting and the world lore of other games by the same developer (the Star Traders series).\n- a bit shorter than HoS\n\nOverall the game is great, and you should play it if you like turn based combat. Don't expect XCOM (I mean the old one), here there's a story that enfolds, and missions are pre-scripted. It's very rare that I keep playing a game after I've finished it once, and it happened with this one.\n\nI also have to say that some of the few negative reviews insist on the fact that it's a mobile port or that it has a mobile feel, and have put really little time in actually playing the game. I've never played a game on a mobile device so I can't judge, all I know is that if you focus on the game's qualities you shouldn't really care if it's a port or not.","January 5","true","109.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The graphics are great but won't force you to have to buy the latest PC hardware. The game play is simple and easy to learn. An excellent tutorial shows you how in just a few minutes to begin battling the hordes of deadly aliens that stand between you and victory. In game story dialog and a built in Library provide you with the rich history that blends in with all their other games set in the Star Traders universe.

For $10 you can't go wrong here if you are a fan of the genre\nHuge skill trees and tons of loadout options. <3 customize\nFree respecs for your toons whenever you want!\nNot a terrible story so far.\nInsane value\nI can tell the replay value will be huge based on the req page and many difficulty settings.\n\nCons:\nHard to predict dmg. Sometimes you get hit but armor soaks 100%, sometimes you get 100 to zero'd by that same single mob in a single turn.  Simply put the damage calculations are wildly random because of too many factors. Armor, deflection, dodge, block, parry, evasion compete against damage crit accuracy and penetration. There may even be more I can't remeber.\n\nSome things are either buggy or just not clear. Overwatch skill will sometimes hit a target each step he takes in the box. Sometimes tho it won't hit him even once regardless of LOS. Sometimes stats do not update on your character sheet until you get into battle, forcing you to add up all your bonus's to have an idea of what your crit or block is, and even that is off from time to time.\n\nSome of the load out relics need cost adjusted. It is very hard to equip most relics without huge sacrifices at every other equipment slot and they are far from game breaking. Honestly most of them are noob traps as is.\n\n\n\nThe cons I listed are have very little impact at med-hard difficulty, and none at less than medium. For insane difficulty tho it can be frustrating.\n\nAll in all though if this is your favorite genre and you have ten dollars to spend you would be a fool to pass this up. I can't wait to see what these guys do in the future.","October 19, 2015","true","64.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is a bit light on the roleplaying aspect but the action is amazing and has a ruleset that blows away the simple but punishing nature of games like the newest XCom's hit/miss mechanics. You will not find frustration by making the right decisions just to have your men screw up your tactical approach. But failure will come with bad choices or just a lack of battlefield visibility that you did not get, aka you can feel good that your loss is your fault in this game and not the dice. I have put together a couple of lists of things you can do in this game and why it is cool.\n\nBefore I get into the details, I'll cut straight to the chase with some stuff that wow'ed me:\n\nA scout who does not have to be long ranged but I can use his massive movement to sneak up and melee troops down quickly or have him cripple enemy movement long-distance before my soldiers mop him up with overwatch fire\nOverwatch fire from soldiers is a big field I set down where enemies who move into the square get shot ( for free, no action on my soldiers part) each time they move through the field, but they also clear a path for other enemies to go through, so you might have to have a couple of overwatch fields to get everyone, but the enemy does try to use this to their advantage.\nI personally fell in love with the Hydra class the minute he set half of the battlefield on fire and I saw xenos running through them getting torched, only to fall to my overwatch fire or weakly attack my captain and then get slain by his free counter-attack.\nTactical Character Customization    Characters are outfitted by purchasing ranks in a tree tech system. It is a tree that splits each of the 8 classes into 3 distinct trees. You get points to buy them after each mission. This alone gives you the ability to customize and play whatever squad you want, in a way that you want. You can go crazy with a super tough melee oriented squad, or go sneaky long-range scouts, or just blow up the whole battlefield with Pyromaniac Hydras and grenade slinging soldiers.\nCombat involves both melee and ranged and both are very good and compliment each other. Melee and ranged are both about positioning your men right. Since this is turn based, but has reaction type skills like Overwatch in it, you want to make it appealing for enemies to engage your melee who can counter-attack them, through your ranged overwatch fields. This is very fun to setup fire lanes and watch enemies fall before your organization.\nCombat is about escalation and management of your forces and the enemies. Each map usually involves you trying to cut off the enemy forces before they outnumber you too greatly ( or your suits start frying your men because each action builds up heat that can damage you if it gets to high from using it). You can counter this by controlling choke points but the cool mechanic is that you can control tactical points to bring in more templars whose abilities might really help you out - a hydra to ignite the whole battlefield or another soldier to setup more overwatch lanes...or perhaps a stealthy scout to infiltrate and lock down another area where the xenos are pouring in from. This becomes a game within the game in a way.\nRules System that is explained in game so you don't need to wiki everything\nCombat resolution is a system of D10 dice rolls made in game that are compared to your opponents opposing dice rolls. This distributed average of hit and misses makes sure that your characters and the enemies are not just getting lucky or unlucky.\nThere are no obvious dump stats when you level up your templars, the game does its best to make every stat important. Aggressive damage stats like Quickness also give you defense bonuses, stats like tactical influence how good your buffs from your men are but also give you critical hit advantages.\nThere are no crazy instant win abilities or stats. Every ability and stat plays into each other very well and makes you build a team of fully functional warriors who need each other.\nI know this was a long review, but damn, this game is great and I feel like I am only in the beginning still after 15 hours. I definitely look forward to conquering this game and then moving onto higher difficulties with a much better strategy.","October 20, 2015","true","50.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Lot's of content, good class and progression system, flexible difficulty settings, rich back story, runs smoothly to boot.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in one word it would be: functional. There's no beautiful art or pretty effects, but what's is there gets the job done. The core gameplay is solid and the game runs smoothly, which to me is the most important thing a game has to get right before anything else.\n\nGameplay consists of turn based battles where you command a squad of space-marine-esque warriors called Templars. They come in various classes which gives them access to different abilities. The combat system can be a bit dense if you try to understand everything at once, but the game does a decent job off telling you what you need to know at any given time and if you really want to dig into the system there is a "Library" section that explains the game rules in detail. One thing I esspecially appreaciate about the interface is: tooltips, tooltips everywhere. Don't know what a stat does, just hover over it and a tooltip will appear and tell you what it feeds into, how likely am I to kill that alien?, hover over it and a tooltip will pop up giving you hit percentages and average damage.\n\nIn a game with a dense rule set like this I'm thankful that the devs made sure I could always quickly access enough information to make a decision and there are plenty of decisions to be made, both in and out of mission. Character progression consists of assigning points to their base stats, their special abilities(called talents) and giving them better gear. Below this is a requisition tree where you spend a requisition points to unlock new talents and equipment for your characters. I think this tree is very well planned out as it offers multiple ways to specialise your character classes, and many pieces of equipment can be used by more than one class, thus you can expand your options for other classes even as you level up only one. The limited amount of talent points each character gets means that you will inevitably create multiple characters of the same class and specialise them differently. For example: the scount class can be used as a fast stealth unit, or speced to be a high damage sniper.\n\nThe missions themselves are varied enough to be interesting. Most of the objectives consist of finding a thing or getting your entire squad to a certain place, but the map design and narrative keep this from getting boring. The game also provides a variety of difficulty settings from easy to the hardcore-permadeth-single-autosave difficulty for the ultra masochist. I have not finished the game yet but 18 hours in it looks like there's still plenty more content.\n\nOn the surface the game lore feels like it draws a lot of influence from Warhammer 40k, but I feel that it ultimately stands on it's own. Yes you have a force of elite warriors in mech-suits, yes you have a race of completely unsympathetic biological killing machines, yes you have cultists working to undermine humanity from within, but it's not like WH40k has a monopoly on these tropes and Templar Battleforce puts enough of it's own spin on them to keep things interesting. I find the concept of the Templar Lineage particularly fascinating.\n\nThe game's story is mostly delivered through text in "cutscenes" and through conversations in "secure areas"(missions where you can just walk around and talk to NPCs). This is fine if you don't mind reading text and enduring a little low budget storytelling. I think the devs did a decent job of breaking up the text and avoiding gratuitous exposition dumps, but your mileage may vary. If you really don't care for the story you can quickly skip over the text anyway.\n\nMy opinion on this game is summed up in the TLDR.  Make no mistake this is a niche game, but it does what it sets out to do. It's fun, polished and great value for money.","November 15, 2015","true","25.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's got a good setting for a fun TBS game. The heat component is great for adding that little bit of extra tactics into your turn choices, and the tech tree is nicely spread out with lots of options to play the way you want to play. That being said, there are A LOT off little things that throw wrenches into the gameplay. The spawning system for enemies is very random. While they mostly spawn next to tiles that look like holes for skitterings to crawl out of, sometimes they spawn on the space directly next to you for absolutely no reason. Additionally, the leveling system takes a huge factor of risk vs reward out of the game, because every unit you recruit will automatically be the same level as the units you've had since the beginning. Units you don't bring into combat still level up, and the skill tree becomes a little washed out because of this. Basically you can lose your geared up Hydra by charging him ahead, and not have to worry because you can spend SP to get another one of the same level with no hassle. It's a shame, because if the game progressed a little more smoothly within the realm of Risk vs. Reward, it would be a 10/10.

There is more or less 40 missions. You usually need 10 to 20 turns to finish missions. (I would say 20 min to 1h30 per mission?)\n\nThere is 8 distinct kinds of soldiers (captain, scout, engineer, paladin, berserk, etc...) You chose how they progress after each mission : skills points and attributes points, how you equip them and which talents you learn or improve, depending on soldier's class. (For example: strike harder with blade or gun, strong short range shooting or long range, personal or mass boost -defensive or offensive-, more movement points, cover, radar, healing, attacks with penalties for ennemies, turrets, more abilities uses, capture, repair, etc...)\nBefore each mission, you can freely re-attribute skills points, attributes points and talents points, to modify you soldiers as you need.\nThere is a big development's tree used to chose which classes you will improve, which gears and abilities you will unlock, and which items you will be able to use. There is a lot of separate branches, and you cannot reset this tree, so your "battleforce" really depends on it.\nYou can entirely  create and chose which soldiers you use during missions, even if sometimes some soldiers or some classes are forced on. All soldiers progress during the game, even if soldiers you use a lot progress faster.\n\nThere is a "capture tactical points" mechanism in many levels. With tactical points, you can deploy new sodiers in mission, get new items to help you, and you usually want to protect it. It's not the core of the game (you don't do so many captures or deployments), but it's definitely a big part of the gameplay.\n\nThere is a totally black "fog of war", so you have to explore and discover maps, ennemies and objectives.\nThere is sometimes secondary objectives (places to go) on maps to get more xp, but usually you don't know if there are secondary objectives in a mission, and you don't know where it is.\nThe game push the player to move quickly and to kill a lot. The less you need turns to beat a mission (and the more you kill per turn), the more you receive XP.\nThere is small randomness in ennemies'creation.\nThere is no randomness for maps. So, if you retry a level, you will know what to do and where to go.\n\nSometimes (not too many), you have to do some choices, so the order of mission will change... and you can't do all missions in one playthrough.\nWhen you finish the game, you can start again with your team and stronger ennemies to continue your progress.\nThe game saves automatically every turn. (So if you quit during a turn, you will have to start again. It can be useful if you did a bad move.) You can never save by yourself. During a mission, or at the end of a mission, you can restart the mission. (Except for ironman mode.)\n\nThe combat system is relatively complex, but there is an in-game "library" to briefly explain all concepts... if you want understand. There is some tutorials missions, to explain really basic stuff.\nThere is randomness during fights. Even if you can definitely influence it, and you can probably deal with it, the difference between a strong critical hit and a dodged one is obviously big.\nYou have to deal with a "heat" mechanism which inflicts damage if you do too many actions every turns.\n\nThere is a story and a universe around the game. You learn it mainly by talking with 2 or 3 NPC between missions. (You can skip it.)\n\n\nPersonal opinion\n\nI like turn-based games, and I enjoyed this one. It was fun to play, to find the best solution, to improve my soldiers, to discover the game. I liked different kind of soldiers and different abilities. Even if it's "simple", I think that the team successfully diversify missions. There is a lot of interesting soldiers, talents, gears and items, and the game is still well-balanced.\nI liked to be able to play an entire mission in small game's session... and to know the length of a mission before I start it, based on the turns goal.\n\nPersonnally, I'm not fan of all mechanisms. (If I want more xp, I have to play fast rather than safe... I don't like the fog of war most of the time, because for some level you need to know the map to make best tactical decisions... The development's tree is big, with a lot of branches, so you cannot enjoy all classes during a playthrough, it's a little bit sad... You have to play always with same soldiers if you want the best progress for them, so you can't easily try all of them... It seems that the best way to play is to focus on some abilities and to avoid overheating, so you don't have enough talents points and heat to really use all interesting talents during fight.) But it's just details! The game is well crafted, the small team behind the game seems to be nice, so I can easily recommand this game, if you like this kind of game and if you liked what you saw in videos and screenshots.\n\nDefinitely, it's for people who like turn-based tactical games.","January 1","true","46.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a game of dizzying depth and what it lacks in raw graphics it makes up for in gameplay.\n\nIf anyone played the Space Hulk videogame and felt it lacking then Templar Battleforce is the answer. It plays very much like a mix of Space Hulk (both the boardgame and the videogame) and X-COM, though it's by no means a clone of either of these games. Templar Battleforce brings to the table many new features such as 'Heat' for your Templars, an opposite of HP that means every move you make or action you take will put your Templar one step closer to overheating. The mechanic forces you to give your men a rest every few turns or risk taking unwanted damage over time. On top of that certain battlefield have Tactical Points which can be captured by you or the Xenos. Once these points have been captured you can spend the SP they generate to call in more soldiers or ordance, or upgrade your team. Any recruits you call in that survive the battle will become veterans, and can be deployed in every battle from there on.\n\nFrom a fantastic lore to fantastic gameplay to rather decent music Templar Battleforce is well worth the price that it's being sold for.","October 3, 2015","true","9.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Your units gain experience and requistion/technology points in missions. The more side objective you achieve and xenos you kill the more xp and rp you get. With xp you can level your units, with requisition you can buy new skills, classes and weapons, powerfull relics in the requisition tree. The tech tree is rather large.\n\nThere are 8 classes: Captain, Hydra, Neptune,  Berserk, Soldier, Engineer, Scout and Paladin.\n\nThe classes have different equipment and skills. Your progression choices on attributes when leveling have impact on the gameplay. A unit with high fortitude and melee skill is good in melee as you can aspect. But you can also decide to try different builds. A standart bearer with excellent party buffs for your captain? Or a soldier with high grenade ability and melee skills? It is your choice.\n\nThe requisition system is interesting and motivates to get more rp to get better equipment and classes. Some are even essential for progress in the game. The paladin as healer or the engineer for capturing strongholds in the level, where you can get reinforcements.\n\nThe tactical gameplay is very good. You have a little rng here, because every actions success is based on dice throws. But if you invest xp intelligently into your units you get nearly 100% chances on attacks and up to 60% block evade for incoming attacks. It is possible to create 'useless' units, if you invest wrong, But you can respec your units anytime in the hq to prepare for missions on normal difficulty. The AI behaves human like. It does not circumvent your overwatch field, it is not omniscent and makes errors. A human player could not know where you place your traps or overwatch so it does not cheat to win. The AI has many units to make the missions more interesting. After 10 missions i had killed 500 aliens. More then in any other turn based tactic game i played before. The missions can get quite difficult when you are slow and not focused on your objective. After all you are fighting against hordes of aliens, stopping and resting will get you overwhelmed quickly. The missions are quite interesting and different. Some times you have to escort a bomb carrier into the heart of an alien cruiser or defend a bridgehead for some time. Or you have to kill a boss while being attacked by waves of aliens. Killing the boss will win the mission.\n\nYour units have movement points and action points to spent. You should move before using action points, because any left movement points are spent when you use your action points.\n\nThe grafics and sounds are adequate. They are 2d, every unit is animated. Unfortunately there is no movement range indicator for enemies, so you have to learn the movement patterns of the different enemy units. Most have 6 movement range like your units. Do not expect Xcom remake like grafics.\n\nIf you like the old star quest or space hulk boardgames this game is made for you. It is space hulk on steroids, with tech tree and a roleplaying stat system and an interesting atmosphere and story.\n\nI encountered many bugs but not one software bug in this game. Performance is flawless. Very nice product.\n\nI am not a fan of pointy review score, but i would give this game a 10/10. My personal game of the year.\n\nHave a nice day","October 2, 2015","true","20.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I wasn't even four levels in before I found my heart racing, my 6-man squad having been reduced to one lonely captain racing to hit the last relay before the hunters caught up to him. I made it, barely, and as I finished the level I realized I hadn't been challenged like that in quite some time. It isn't that the game threw some unknown curveball ar me, not at all. The systems were laid out very clearly as little tutorial bits that were spread over the first few levels. The game taught me the rules...then tried to beat me to death in a fair and ruthless way.

However, I can imagine that some people might be nibbling on whether to purchase this or not, so here is my first impression.\n\nSummary:\nPros: I like the theme, I like the combat, I like the customization of the different character's abilities.  So far I'm definitely on track to get my money's worth and then some.\nCons: Personalities between the different templar are not very distinct (more about that below)\n\nIf you like being a paladin/templar type character and like commanding squads in turn based combat I think you'll really enjoy this game.  Consider that this is an early impression, that may be subject to change later on.\n\nDetailed Version:\nI bought this game for the promise of commanding a team of badass templar/paladin type characters.  Any time I have the option in an RPG to play a paladin type class, that's what I go with.  It was the theme of this game that really hooked me.  You get to play the good guys, and fight some mean old space aliens.  Nothing wrong with that.  I do hope that as the game goes on I get the opportunity to explore the belief system of the templars a little.  I like to geek out about that kind of stuff.\n\nThe meat of the game is the turned based combat in which you use your templars to fight against Xenos.  The combat works well.  It's easy to jump right in to the action and pick it up as you go.  I don't think its revolutionary or anything but that doesn't bother me.\n\nCoupled with the combat is the all important customization.  Each level you get points that help you specialize in different types of abilities.  This is another main draw for me.  Rather than just a few different units with set roles there is the potential for enormous specialization.  At just over two hours I haven't even scratched the surface of the what I can do.\n\nThe problem so far with the game is that none of the templar characters are distinctive.  The "captain" of your squad has generic dialogue that makes he or she indistinguishable from your other squadmates.  The captain doesn't have an established name or backstory, none of them do.  They're all here to protect the remaining humans from the Xenos, and any other threats.  That's it.  I'll have to see how the rest of the game unfolds, but my main criticism for now is that I'm not really invested as I should be in the plight of these generic templars.  Some humor, maybe a character who's faith is challenged by seeing his people go through this, or anything to change it up a little would be appreciated.\n\nI'll update this post once I feel I can do the game justice with a full review.  With my criticisms in mind I still say with confidence that I like this game, and I think others will too.  I definitely look forward to playing through this interesting game, and leading my noble templar to victory.","September 25, 2015","true","14.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The strategy is much more refined than that of its' nearest relatives, and the missions force you to think creatively about how to best combine your units to face situational challenges - dividing your forces to reach multiple objectives, fighting against a timer, deciding whether or not an optional objective is worth the extra turns it will take to complete, etc.  The combination of units which advance, and also persist through the campaign even if they die(and also respec'd at will), allows you to experiment freely with specializing your forces using a very deep tech tree and equipment loadouts to develop your own playstyle, or prepare any particularly challenging levels with a customized force.","September 30, 2015","true","80.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

It is somewhat rough around the edges but is surprisingly easy to get into if you have a general idea of what to expect.\n\nThe core tactical combat gameplay is very well done and even exceeds games like XCOM in some areas such as flexibility and variety. While the internal mechanics of combat suffer from the opaqueness of the dice rolls system and of the damage mitigation formula, the game offsets this with ample toolips and a set of starting missions which guide new players through all they need to know to enjoy the game. Extra praise is deserved for both the tooltips and tutorials as these two elements are rarely well done in indie games and are often quite mediocre in AAA releases.\n\nCombat itself is familiarly intuitive and draws much of its allure from the fairly deep customization options and progression available. First off you have a sort of tech tree which controls the pool of equipment, active abilities, and recruitable templar classes available. Every templar in your band belongs to a class which defines which active abilities are available and which equipment can be equipped. In addition to equipment and talents (active abilities), every templar has two sets of defining statistics which can be increased by one point each level. You will end up customizing talents, equipment, and attributes for each templar every time he levels up which will be every 1-2 missions. This is so since you can freely respec any templar between missions and you will want to do this when new abilities or equipment become available, which happens almost after every mission depending on how you choose to progress the tech tree. This opens ups the ability to experiment freely with your squad build and keeps you from worrying too much about planning your progression ahead of time.\n\nI was also very happy with the mission design so far (about 10 missions in). The length of each mission is right on target with about 30 mins on average and the overall pacing is excellent so far. The time I’m spending in mission and out of mission leveling my army is at a good ratio to prevent being fatigued with either aspect. The missions themselves don’t drag out with most missions aiming for around 15 turns on average to complete which keeps each turn and what you do in it very significant. The heat mechanic plays an important role here. Heat builds up from using abilities and moving and decreases a small amount each turn and will decrease a lot in a turn if no or almost no actions are taken during that turn. Maxing out on heat will start causing hitpoint damage to the templar so this helps keep the action tense makes you consider every action you take or don’t take during a turn.\n\nI have a few small gripes with the game which affect my enjoyment of it in very limited ways. No ability to change keybindings is regrettable but not critical since the default scheme is workable if somewhat inconvenient. The way vision works could use improvement as your templars can only seem to see 5 squares away which can lead to very awkward ambushes. Enemies can attack the same turn they spawn which is annoying but since they don’t spawn in packs, for the most part, this is nowhere near as big an issue as it was in XCOM. There is plenty of room for the UI to be improved and enhanced with such features as moving the camera via mouse screen edge scrolling, highlighting interactable elements on mouseover, indicating which squares either your unit or an enemy unit can move to this turn or the enemy's next turn. The Devs have indicated that some of these fetures, edge scrolling in particular, will be added in future updates.\n\nThis is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactical RPGs in the style of the recent XCOM or going further back to Temple of Elemental Evil and Pool of Radiance. The story is very adequate for a game where the story is arguably not the main focus and works very well to build up the right atmosphere of tension and heroics and this is a type of game that benefits greatly from having that kind of backdrop. The ample depth of progression available for your “army” and each templar along with way the game encourages experimentation will keep most players hooked.","September 25, 2015","true","49.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Because the theme, it has space, steampunk, and a bit medieval history. It blends all the themes and their sounds, and makes for a very nice feel to add to the game.\n\nGraphics: This game could have been on the old Nintendo or Sega systems back in the 90's. For the younger generation, this game is probably awful looking, but I just love it. The nostalgia of playing a game that could have been a game  from my youth is just great. The colors of the Templars and the other factions are simple but feel right. The templars are a rustic metal, while the Xeno seem like they're straight out of a circuit board.\n\nGameplay: Plays like most tactical strategies, you can only move so much each round and attack. This game takes a different kind of system, where if you attack before moving, your AP gets removed from your movement as well. Each of the different classes have armor and weapons you can equip between chapters. But the catch is you have to use the Requisition tree to unlock them. It also is where you unlock the more advanced units. This makes each playthrough interesting as you cannot really unlock all of the features in each playthrough.\n\nReplay Value: I am still working on my first campaign, but I already see the skill trees and talents that I messed up. A scout doesn't need much melee points, so focus on his ranged skills. I could play this a hundred times, and might just possibly do so.\n\nStory: The story so far seems a bit confusing, but it does seem in depth enough. It has lore and backstory, much like you'd get out of Elder Scrolls or Warcraft. I feel that as the game develops you will get more details to make the reason you're in this fight more obvious.\n\nOpinion: Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. It has given me something to sit down and enjoy after a long day. I can play a level or two and then move onto something else. I can pick it back up the next day, and not feel like I've lost anything. I managed to pick it up on sale, but the standard price for the game is not bad for an indie game. I definitely say if you like tactical strategies, Fire Emblem, or just a general history buff, Templar Battleforce has something for you.\n\n*Edit: I would like to add that I love that the team is putting time into making the game look and run better than the initial launch. I am enjoying the new character designs they did, and the UI changes. Keep up the good work.","December 31, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also, you are presented with choices in the game, possibly leading to different fights and possibly endings(haven't finished the game yet). There are some annoying things(scanner scanning 2x due to lag mouse tap?), but so far the game has run smoothly, no huge game-breaking bugs, no hang-ups, no crashes.\n\nThe one thing that I am bothered though is the Gfx, it is 2015.....\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game to turn-based fans.

I picked this game up on sale, and it has been well worth it so far.   For an indie 2d game, it is very polished and well supported.  The gameplay offers a lot of good choices for customizing nearly everything in your squadron. The missions so far have had enough map, enemy and mission based variety to keep it interesting. The lore and story line give you a sense of purpose and keep you wanting to see what's next, and if that's not your thing, they have a handy skip button for the RP.\n\nThe choices you make in building your squad is probably the strongest feature.  I really have liked the idea of heat to keep you from overusing certain moves and gear customizations that can augment that.The ability to respec unit abilities also is handy if you need to adjust to beat a mission you are failing to complete.\n\nIf I had one complaint, it's the design of the requisition tree.  It's too much like confusing 4x games, and I feel a more streamlined design would make it a lot easier to understand.\n\nAll in all, I highly reccommend this game.","March 20","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The units under your control, the eponymous Templars, are not entirely dissimilar to WH40k Space Marines, being humans piloting suits of battle armour that augment their abilities.  The twist here is that rather than having a concept like 'gene-seed', a Templar's memories and experiences are passed down through their bloodline across generations.\n\nAnyway, enough of the fluff.  The meat of the game - the tactical battles is competently done; movement and combat is handled via a variation of the time-honoured action point system and works intuitively.  Most missions seem to have a turn goal - completion of the objective within this will bestow extra experience, and this mechanic - coupled with a large sprinkling of risk/reward secondary objectives and tactical points to capture -  can lead to some nail-biting mission climaxes.\n\nThere are excellent customisation options available for your Templars in between missions too, an RPG-lite skill and talent progression system for them to work through and  a very detailed tech tree which you unlock parts of by using the 'resource points' tallied up at the end of each battle.  Contained within the tech tree (which in terms of presentation reminds me of Sword of the Stars 1) are many weapons (some unique), abilites and miscellaneous items all of which allow for many varied takes on a Templar squad's makeup.\n\nGraphically the game is serviceable and has improved with recent patches.  The audio is functional but nothing to write home about.  If I had one niggle it would simply be the relatively minor suggestion that the game lacks a little polish - there are points at which grammatical/spelling errors crop up in some of the story text for example and while I freely acknowledge that these are far from game-breaking, they do nonetheless pull me out of my 'zone' in the game and bring me back to reality with a bump.\n\nAll things considered (including the fantastic support Trese brothers continue to lavish on the game) I would heartilty recommend this title to anyone who enjoys turn-based squad level combat.  It's probably the closest we'll ever get to a genuine turn-based WH40k game, yet it does have its own distinct and well-developed lore.

All units are limited by seperate action points and movement points while every command or use of an ability generates Heat, that limits continuos actions.\nBoth melee and ranged combat are availible and the game pushes you to explore and develop your own loadouts for each member.\nafter each mission you are awarded experience points for your Templars and Requisition points to develop your technology trees that in turn unlock new weapons, armor and even units.\n\nWhile the story is not the most intruiging, it is fresh and simple enough to add to the game. Every level is mostly unique with different objectives, layouts and aproaches to them that create a scale of replayability and keep gamers interested to continue.\n\nAs any early access title, the game does have a few bugs and confusing aspects that arent explained very well in it's library of explainations. Save for weapon types, new weapons are not visually different on the templar as well as armor. Radial zones used for targeting enemies are often misrepresented and AOE abilities must be guessed and judged without indication.\n\nOverall, the fun of wiping out Xeno scum and thrusting my Captain ♥♥♥♥-middle into the fray of battle overpowers any complaints.\n\n10/10 for random xenos spawning in the middle of my squad after ending turn.","January 4","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The writing is beautiful space-knight chivalry and politics, and works well into the scenario design. There are many levels of difficulty, no doubt there's one that's right for most any player.\nThe interface design can be a little overbearing with the visual bluntness of it, however it's very intuitive.\n\nThis is a game with somewhat complicated mechanics going on in the statistics, and it also fully explains all of them. Contrasting this with many other games that leave the players in the dark about finer points for the sake of appearing simple, this game spells out all its rules for the player in the help area.\n\nThe tactical play is solid. Templars have battle armor that generates heat with every move and action, and dissipates every turn. They take damage from overheating and lose access to some abilities, so this is literally a set of rules where "every move counts".\n\nThere may be a nuance or two that leave something to be desired for some people. The permadeath is relatively gentle and squishy - new recruits are free and infinite outside of battle, come at a percentage of captain level (depending on difficulty setting), and can be respec'd and redesigned freely - so you never really "lose" a soldier, just some negligible amounts of experience(perhaps less negligible on harder settings). The soldiers in your roster are just ready-to-deploy sets of specs and loadouts so you don't have to use the random stuff on new recruits in battle(though that'd be an interesting alternate way to play).\n\nOne might also say that some of the 8 soldier classes are too similar. Three of them are just gunners - gunners that are mostly offensive, gunners that are strictly offensive and use flame attacks(though the fire trails can be defensive), and gunners that emphasize overwatch, grenades and buffs. Many of the classes have limited gear options and the choice isn't about how you build that class, just using it or not (gee, do I want my guy that generates a lot of heat to have gear granting greater max heat? yeah probably). Other classes have a big variety of useful abilities and it pays to have two of them that are specialized differently, so it feels like some of the classes got the short end of the design effort.\n\nDespite this I do NOT think the tactical decision making in the game leaves anything to be desired, the choices all impact the game. I find myself agonizing over the simplest stat growth choices.\n\nAnyway, this game has far exceeded expectations, and I've played my share of XCom, FFT, and etc. I think it will please anyone who doesn't have strong preferences about the nuances of the genre, and rather is open to the design choices of individual games. This game's choices work really well for it, in my opinion.","January 6","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I feel obligated to review this game to prevent its deceptive simplicity from harming its sales.\n\nThough the setting may ostensibly be regarded (and not without reason) as extremely iterative upon Warhammer 40K, Templar introduces an almost neo-platonic thread early on and pursues it to a fair deal of realization.  Though your "captain's" dialogue, where present, is indistinct, the absurd degree of personalization defines your units in combat well enough.\n\nThe combat system is a bit of a black box, and at first I feared that it would be a unentertaining slog, but not only is the difficulty curve well balanced, I found myself in scenarios that really did feel like "heroism" on the part of my team.\n\nThe greatest sustaining factor in the game's favor is the advancement system.  I want to complete every mission to further characterize my units and I want to start another mission afterwards.\n\nIt would be a shame if this game were overlooked due to a poor first impression, as even an hour in I felt enitrely satisfied with my purchase.

There is a plot, but it's not important. All you need to know is that YOU GUIDE VALOROUS BATTLE-BROTHERS IN A NEVERENDING CRUSADE OF PURGATION AGAINST VILE XENO SCUM FOR THE GLORY OF THE MANKIND. And almost all of these totally not WH40K terms are said by your squad leader at some moments.\n\nAll of this might give you an impression that the game is a bland low-budget space hulk clone.\nAnd you will be very wrong, because it is AWESOME hardcore tactics with deep gameplay, which only draws some inspiration from aforementioned space hulk. And did I say that the game is hard? I mean really hard, as in "your squad can be wiped on normal during tutorial" hard.\n\nAlso,the devs are super cool, they fix bugs quickly, add new content and implement features requested by community.\n\nVerdict: go buy the game, its cheap and awesome, or Teh Emprah will smite you.","January 1","true","18.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(Seriously, the theme that plays after you pick a mission and your character is speaking is AMAZING! Something about it.) Truly impressed.\n\nThe combat and controls are fun and fluid (although it does feel slightly like it was designed for tablets and similar touch devices.) The one gripe I have, which is small, is that one cannot target unoccupied spaces with skills such as grenades. It is, however, forgotton in an instant when my attention is inexorably drawn to another facet of combat. And of course when I demolish the Xeno scum with said Grenade : )\n\nBuy it, try it and love it.

This lovely little game first caught my eye when I was trolling around the internet looking for video games that gave me the ability to play customizable soldiers clad in epic battle armor. This little gem caught my eyes and I've been hooked ever since.\n\nIn Templar Battleforce, you play an elite force of genetically modified humans who are capable of cognizant recall of their ancestor's memories. They, along with a convoy of more "all natural" human beings have fled the core of the galaxy to seek their fortunes, and survival, after an epic war ravaged their homeworlds in a past war. They come under attack during their exodus and are forced to make landfall on a set of desert worlds. From here, the story of the Templars truly begins.\n\nIn this game, you will control a customizable taskforce of Templar warriors. Your force is broken down into multiple different unit types: Your "Blade Class" Captain (Basically, the proper Player Character), Soldiers, Scouts, Engineers, Hydras (Flamethrower equipped heavy infantry), Neptunes (Autocannon/HMG equipped heavy infantry), Paladins and Berzerkers. Each class evolves as you spend a limited pool of requsition points to unlock new abilities, equipment, and options for your units.\n\nThe Requisition Tree deserves special mention because of how in depth it is. Every class has no less than three branches they can develope along, and given the relative rarity of the requisition as a resource, you will have to carefully mold your taskforce, selecting which classes and which abilities you desire to define your Templars with. Will you try for a generalist approach, taking each class and combining the smaller number of individual powers to create a greater sum than the whole? Will you focus on one or two classes, creating an army that is solid because of the uniform excellence of a Templar unit type? Will you stride into the battle with guns blazing, Neptunes holding the fort and laying down massive walls of firepower while the Soldiers press ahead and annhilating xeno scum with plasma blasters? Will you take up axe and sword, forming mighty shield walls while augmenting and healing your brothers and sisters in the middle of cyclone of melee combat? The choice is yours, and if you play the campaign through, New Game Plus will reward you for your diligence and victories in the face of defeat.\n\nThe campaign consists of a series of linked missions. This is where the meat of the gameplay is. Each mission will have its own objectives and peculiarities. While they tend to follow a fairly similar layout from one mission to the next (Kill enemies, survive against timers, take strategic points), each mission does in fact have its own peculiarities. You will cleanse infested landscapes with mighty flamethrowers, you will assault into alien ships to plant bombs in the core of the vessels, you will retreat through canyons and pver bridges while burning the earth during your retreat, you will investigate derelict space hulls, you will save desperate people from the middle of nightmarish scenarios, and you will secure cities against invading forces. Each of this mission types will come with their own peculiarities, their own specifics in terms of victory objectives, and each will have a larger place in the game's overarching plot. So, while the missions will have similar formulas, you will never truly play the same fight twice.\n\nThe mechanics on the field are rather simple at the end of the day. You have a topdown isometric perspective, wherein you command your units on a tactical grid. Movement points, action points, special attacks and abilities, unique battlefield requisition, and more will all be at your disposal. Each character is commanded individually, giving you the ability to maneuver your forces and utilize your strengths in strategic coordination. Soldiers can lay down fields of cover fire while your melee units advance, meanwhile your scouts move up ahead to find enemies and peg them with high powered sniper rifles or venomous needlers. Cap it off with your engineers setting up turrets to organize a defensive peremiter for your Neptune to hold with his suppressive fire so your strike force can advance deeper into enemy territory, and you'll find victory in your sights. Or do it another way. If you're familiar with tactical turn based squad games, then you will be right at home with Battleforce Templar, no matter your preference for command.\n\nAll of this is topped off with a world full of lore and personality that is revealed through the journal of your Captain and his/her interactions with the various NPCs you will meet in both missions and peaceful zones between campaigns.\n\nLikewise, the music  tracks to this game, while somewhat limited in number, definitely set the tone for the missions. Each soundtrack is crafted with an emotional theme in mind, ranging from an uplifting ballad of defiant action against the enemy to stress inducing choruses that are played when the mission's stakes are high and the price of failure is higher.\n\nFinally, the developer(s) for this game are actively improving upon their creation all of the time. Since I first obtained Templar Battleforce, there have been at least three full mini campaigns introduced, several revisions and additions to the Requisition Tree, expanded lore entries and dialogue options, expansions to enemy unit types, and a multitude of bug fixes, weapon rebalances, and class expansions. This is clearly a labor of incredible love from a dedicated company that wants to deliver the best experience possible to their customer base without shelving the cost of expanded content on their fans. They're doing this old school, and they're doing this right.\n\nIf you are a fan of Tactical Turn Based Strategfy games and love to support developers who put their player base first, this game comes HIGHLY recommended.\n\n","December 7, 2015","true","60.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I often can't tell why an attack didn't go through, friendly or foe. It doesn't say "miss" when you miss, though it does say "blocked" when you block. This needs to get better, and perhaps there should be a combat log showing attack/defense rolls so I can better see what is going on.\n\n2. There is no indication when an enemy is attacking my troops- the map does not scroll to the site of the attack it just stays still. This is a big problem when I have someone camping somewhere and am focusing on a different part of the battlefield, and I have no idea that one of my troops is getting killed without putting up a fight.","October 27, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

And they don't hold back while introducing the mechanics (at least at the demanding difficulty) like so many other games whose beginings turn into a snoozefest. On the topic of difficulty, you're given a number of options that clearly define their effect on gameplay - no mysterious 'Nightmare' mode that doesn't share with you why it might be so frightening. If you'd enjoy tactical turn-based combat on a square grid with in depth leveling and research trees - this is probably something you'd enjoy.

I have even been encouraged to do one by the developers and i genuinely think they take criticism on the nose and act on it. They're good developers, i like them. Though as a disclaimer i use to like the BoE (Battle of Empire) devs too until they screwed up so....Take that with a grain of salt i guess.\n\nAnyway on with the review.\n\nFor starters i'll look at it's aesthetic and how nice it looks, mostly because that's what i see first on the store page. And it can be very, very misleading sometimes, for better or worse. So how does the game look? it looks like a top down 2D strategy game (as you can probably guess). When actually playing the game it looks pretty good, it looks how it does on the store page and even has a few nice little details here and there, it looks nice for what it is. If i had a complaint it would be that i think they could go even further with the details but we're talking tiny, usually not noticable things here, it looks fine as it is.\n\nI couldn't really think of anywhere else to put this so it'll tie the graphics and gameplay segments together. It looks like Warhammer 40K and XCOM had a baby. It shares the gameplay of XCOM (with a top down 2D view) and even the perma death (at normal difficulty and above only, i think). The Warhammer 40K part comes in just from the lore and its general look. This, keep in mind, is not a rip off of either game and it only looks like it was inspired from it. The gameplay itself is your standard squad based turn based strategy game in the same vein as XCOM. Most of it actually feels a lot like the XCOM except with some functional differences. There isn't any cover (sadly) but there are tiles that boost your defense or your weapon range. There is melee combat as well which opens up a few new possibilities. The level design is pretty good as well, layouts are good, squad loadouts and levelling up is also pretty nice, it lets you play how you want for the most part.\n\nAudio is fantastic, i love the soundtrack for the game, the weapons sound a little weak (in my opinion) but other than the plasma rifle's its ok for the most part. Not a lot to say here as its all ok at least and fantastic at best.\n\nBugs, glitches and optimisation. I haven't noticed any bugs, i don't think i've even seen reports about them or any wide spread problems on systems. The optimisation is pretty good. It shouldn't be hard to get a game like this optimised due to how little it actually uses of my system but hey, worth mentioning.\n\nExtra comments or thing's i think should be said: the game is pretty awesome, i finished it in around 20 hours. Will add any more edits or thoughts as time goes on and i play it more.","January 29","true","22.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Probably.\nGood to see it's getting there :)\n\nIn Templar Battleforce you basically play the captain of a Warhammer40k Space Marine company. Except it's not WH40k.\nThe turn based combat requires a solid ammount of planning and is extremely fun and addictive. Between missions you can spend requisition points to upgrade your marines with cool equipment (including even "relics".. :)), new abilities, and even unlock new types of marines (berzerker assault, heavy weapons centurion style marine, etc).\n\nThe story is ok, nothing spectacular. The graphics are obviously very rough, but it does nothing to reduce the charm of this spectacular game.\n\nRight after Xenonauts (the master of all indie turn-based tactical games on steam which you MUST have), this is probably the best.\n\n\nAlso, tip: Use only scouts.

Squad Based Turn Based Tactical Shooter with a lot of RPG elements...\n\nA lot of people are comparing TB to Space Hulk and for the most part it's a fair comparison.  One significant difference though is in the overall survivability of your Templars.  In Space Hulk a single Genestealer can easily kill a Terminator In TB though your units can survive a few hits without a significant problem.  This isn't to say that the game isn't challenging, it is, and although I haven't advanced very far into the storyline the RPG elements seem like they will go a long way towards encouraging players to develop an attachment to their Templars unlike a lot of other squad based tactics games where the individual units are seen as ultimately disposable.\n\nAt any rate, if you are willing to put up with ameture hour on Youtube and want to check out some gameplay here's a link to the first part of my LP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNqS9ZoobsY&index=1&list=PLHpPhPNbuNsF2HipWIrpPQKxmlyja7AgJ","September 23, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Thankfully did not enounter any bugs on my first play through (demanding difficulty). Balance could use some improvement. None of the maps felt particularly challenging, so much as occasionally tedious. Some levels are near impossible to complete in the target number of turns (if you approach them with no prior knowledge) and can spiral into runaway heat as you search for the right order to activate switches. Once know the correct path to take for routing power / unlocking doors, they are easy. These sequence should really be randomized and the maps balanced accordingly. Other than that, most maps can generally be rushed in half the number of target turns or less. MP is the single most important attribute. Buffed scouts with 12+ MP will wreck many maps. Beat the end boss in 7 turns on first try (target 30)... felt like the easiest map in the game. RNG can be silly with the map initialization. Sometimes you spawn a single low level creature on first turn, other times you spawn a whole group of powerful mobs, which makes the idea of playing on Ironman completely unappealing. Haven't tried to replay as a second lineage. Hopefully replay will encourage more complex builds and incorporate more variety in mobs in terms of abilities and tactics and not just faster spawning / higher stats. Also hoping that end game content when it is released will introduce new gameplay since right now every map feels like either a scout blitz or engineer march.","October 23, 2015","true","43.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Similar pretence. Similar style. But not X-COM. It is a great game with a well thought out story and gripping mechanics. The retro style graphics gives a wave of nostaliga and the difficulty levels ensure all players can have whatever level challenge they wish. The turn based system is excellent and merged with a time limit it ensures you cannot slowly (and safely) crawl through a level. The 'heat' mechanic is a breath of fresh air and you are forced to play sensibly to ensure your templars do not overheat and turn into metal burritos.\n\nThere is limited replayability factor, and there is additionally nothing new with this 'alien invasion' story and the turn based mechanics.

The interesting part comes from the "heat" system which I won't go into explaining but it certainly makes it stand out somewhat from other turn-based strategies\n\nAesthetics - 8.5/10 - Very stylised and definitely not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed the clarity that was brought about by the simplicity\n\nStory/ Dialogue - 7.5/10 - The concept of the leviathan mech suits and the templar lineages is pretty interesting, but overall the story really comes down to humans vs aliens and I spotted more than a few typos throughout the story and additional flavour text you can get between chapters\n\nTop-down Steampunk/XCOM in space - As your templars level up they gain access to not only more stat points but also more gear points, allowing them to wield superior equipment requisitioned from the templar armoury. Many of the abilities you unlock are able to affect multiple targets at once encouraging you to keep your troops close in order to maximise your effectiveness.\n\nDepending on the difficulty you're playing on you can permanently lose templars - but as tragic as this may be it is not game over. Any new templars you bring in gain a chunk of experience proportional to your captains own experience. Veterans that haven't been used in battle for a while will also maintain this level of experience so that you do not have to constantly hire new templars in order to change up your strategy.\n\nOverall - given the price - I would say this game is definitely worth picking up for the ammount of gameplay you can get from a single playthrough; even more so if you intend to play through multiple difficulties.","November 21, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Balance is a strong point; on normal difficulty, you should win, but there is plenty of tension if you gamble and spread your team too thin.  Lots of options for each type of player and skill tree has a big impact on how you play your team.  For example, the scout can be a classic one-shot-one-kill sniper or you can kit out with poison and high speed.  Allowing re-spec on troops a big plus- you dont have to reload or start new campaign to try new tactics.

The theme of the game reminds much of Warhammer 40K but the lore stand on its own and its not a blatant ripoff.\n\nThe tutorial felt a bit too long, the game don´t really opens up until after it. Luckily you can skip it if you start a new game after you played it once (you still gets xp for it). There is also a game+ mode, you replay the campaign with the same squad, after you finish your first playthrough, and keep your xp and equipment but the game gets harder.\n\nIMHO I would recommend this over the rather shallow "Warhammer 40K: Deathwatch". The level up of the Templars are far more complex, far more classes and there is a huge research tree to improve the Templars.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n"Armored in the Leviathan battle mechs, your mighty Templars will face hordes of terrifying Xenos, rogue human factions, and the ancient Narvidian threat.

Do you like turnbase-tactical-combat like XCOM ? This game might interest you.\n\nFirst of all: The Wh40k reference isnt just a "maybe", its a fact. This game screams "Wh40k" but isnt the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ license-soldout game that GW produces lately. Sci-Fi Setting, Templars are Space Marines, your enemys are Tyranids. As a wh40k Fan you will smile by all the little hints the game gives you. The background story, the dialogues (Vae Victus! Only death ends duty! The honoured fallen will be remembered!") the setting, the weapons, everything. :D\n\nThe combat system makes sense, the level design is very different and viable, so you dont play every mission like the one before, the level/xp and loot system kinda grabs you by the balls and you instantly wants to achieve more unlocks to get better equipment and Templar classes (which btw are also like wh40k.. captain, tactical, assault marines, apothecarius, techmarine, scout, devastator and sternguard - ingame called captain, soldier, berserker, paladin, engineer, scout, neptune and hydra.)\n\nEven if i like wh40k and i kinda believe that the devs wanted to create their own version -> There is still alot of work to do. Most important:\n\n- you cant choose which Templars deploy in the mission, you start with a random team and if there is a tactical point on the map you teleport some of your veterans in with Points. BIG FLAW for a game like this.\n\n- the UI still lacks a lot of informations on the battle field and needs to be improved (skills are all explained, iam talkin about the mouse-hoverups and battlefield informations. still kinda clunky.)\n\n- I need more different gear items for my templars and more different enemies.\nGimme orcs, necrons, etc. all the good stuff. Not just tyranids.\n\nI can still recommend the game, caus i believe there will be updates and then its getting really good and escpecially for all the wh40k fans -> a real alternative to live our hobby without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GW games out there.\n\nPS: NO CRASHES OR BUGS FOUND.\nAlways a good sign.\nHigh quality standard.","September 25, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

There is not a distinctive look, design, or quality to make it stand out, so most definitely graphics is not a selling point on this.\nPretty much the same applies to musics and audio. Being a strategy game, the musics cannot be repetitive or even annoying, as it is often the case for this game. I ended up turning off the music and playing my own, and after several missions, ended up also turning off the effects.\n\nHistory and Setting 2/5\nThe history of the game got me interested at first and the concept of a "small battleforce" against endless waves of enemies is one that I personally like, but later on in the game the story really became quite dull, with unimpressive turn of events, and tremendously lacking character development.\nThe theme is very much alike to Warhammer 40K, portraing the fight of "stronger humans" (Space Marines?) against "swarming aliens" (Tyranids?). The analogy is striking also in the looks and selection of armors and weapons.\n\nRPG and Skill development 3/5\nThe skill development and weapons selection is impressive to say the least, lots of choices in very many different directions allow for plenty of strategy customization, and since the very type of units that can be deployed have to be unlocked, it has a direct impact on the degree of adaptability to the different missions.\nThis point would be 5/5, however it is offset by many bland choices available in the tech tree, equipment listing and skill selecvtion, that really are not useful at all, and by few extremely powerful skills (overwatch?).\nIn the end, of many choices theoretically possible, only a handful are actually useful. Stats, on top of it, are definitely straightforward and do not offer any additional depth at all.\n\nTactical depth 2/5\nThis one point got me struggling for a while, and is the reason I kept on playing to decide it it was "just good enough" or "just not good enough". In the end the redundancy of the mission overall feel pushed toward the latter. Although missions seem varied at first, it really boils down to this:\n-enemies behind us! only way possible is forward!;\n-quick, do this and that while you run toward the big green EXIT signal;\n-only kill enemies that stand in your way;\n-KEEP RUNNING;\nSince in many missions the margins for error are very narrow, this tactic ends up being most of the times a puzzle where you just have to know ho to solve the level, get that right through trial and error, go on with next iteration.\n\nConclusion\nThe game has the potential for improvement, but right now does not deliver.\nNeeds more polishing in terms of story.\nNeeds a sleeker tech tree, with still many choices and directions, but less useless branches.\nNeeds "satisfactory" missions where one sets the pace of the battle. Currently, the aliens always decide the pace, and you keep up (puny human).","April 15","false","11.6"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Permadeath should not automatically equal stat-difficulty, as this reduces the options of creating a challenge on people's own terms.\n\n\nPros\n\n- Vast technology tree\n- Interesting variety in equipment with a certain Warhammer 40k/Space Hulk feel\n\nCons\n\n- Outdated and charmless visuals\n- Superficial tutorial\n- Unbalanced difficulty options\n- Helps itself rather shamelessly to Space Hulk/Warhammer 40k concepts.

That doesn't have to be something bad, but it is in this case. For example UI is lacking. There are tooltips, but they do not have all the information. There are actions your templars can do (attacks, buffs etc.). Tooltips only tell you the cost of the action, but details about what it actually does (for example, that this attack has +x damage) are not available there. You have to right click on the button to get more detailed information. Overal the interface is not very friendly.\n- the game is slow. And I don't mean that my PC is struggling or that I get low FPS - it's just that enemy is taking his time. It's a littley funny, because there is this option to change speed of AI turn to high and it turns off animations. That would be nice, but in practice they take almost as long even without the animations (enemy would run to your unit, stop, think, attack, your templar would attack back, enemy would stop, think, attack etc. it really takes a lot of time).\n\n\nI do think the game has potential, so if you are not sure, remember you can try and ask for refund if you don't like it (which I'm going to do now).","January 31","false","0.8"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","1"

Mechanically everything works, but I don't find anything compelling in this game to, say, the game's from the UFO series, or even XCOM EU (and I hate that game). Or almost any other RPG tactical. Combat is pretty tame. You've got different points that award increased attack and defense to whoever holds them. A supply system that rewards you for holding tactical points with more characters on the field. Additionally, classes, talents, skills, etc which can be used to differentiate the different characters. There's also an RP upgrade system where you use points to unlock equipment, skills, etc. Also, the AI seems fairly straightforward so far, no twists, but it was early in the game (I doubt I'll have anything more to say on that). Together, it is solid, but if you search through most tactical games, you'll find most have a good chunk of the above in one form or another. However the dev's are still working on the game and we could see mechanical improvements. And besides that I hear what you're saying, "But dark, that's no reason to rate the game 2 out of 5, it should be at least a 3 out of 5 for these reasons!"\n\nWell, my astute audience, my main issue is with the story. Some other reviewers are going, "OMG, the story is brilliant! Buy the game!" Obviously I disagree. For starters, I find the very idea of "Genetic memory" to be laughable. Might as well go, "Magic" (I'm doing jazz hands, fyi). But I gave the game a chance and set aside how silly that concept is. No, despite that, my main issue is that the dev's seem to be wishy washy about this "Genetic memory" and memory of the ancestors thing. In one scene, for instance, our main character 'knows' that a big baddy will come through a gate and so tells everyone in the party that it will occur. My immediate response was, "Wait, what?" At one point or another every person in your party would've had an ancestor that probably witnessed this sort of event so why the devil is our protagonist saying that? Are they just that kind of annoying a**hat? Wouldn't it make more sense to just do ancestoral flashbacks that way we get the info and it can be cool at the same time (show vs tell, devs)? Ugh, anywho, when the big bad does pop out what it is has to be explained to the protagonist via helper helpington (or reddish shield guy if you prefer). This isn't to mention how annoying it is when we're told a whole bunch of history to things that our character was indirectly a witness to.\n\nAnd I can hear the buzz of the annoying uncritical fanboys, "But we get to make chhhooooiiiccccessss!" Okay, okay, sure, but the game has essentially murdered my interest in it at this point with these crimes against story telling and no amount of 'choice' makes up for that. Especially since this isn't the first game to do "You've got choices now!" Bland emotionless characters aren't helping either (at least at this point). Of course, the ultimate sin is that we're 'told' about this lineage. I don't see why we couldn't have an overarching family/lineage tree in the UI somewhere to give us all of the backstory. Even give all of those non-descript recruits a place in that tree. Seems like a better idea than what is currently in game. I imagine there should even be a few family feuds in there. This "Genetic memory" thing could be intriquing if done right, as it is, its a snore fest with no mechanical traction to get us anywhere to the more interesting points.\n\nAnywho, I'm certain a solid chunk of peeps are all going, "Pft, I don't care about any of that," or "You're totally missing the point, X and Y and Z happens!" To the first, okay, but there are people that do. To the second, I don't really care. At this point the game has failed from a story telling perspective and in major unforgivable ways. I came in wanting to see what would transpire and now I no longer do. The writing up to this point is crap and the mechanics weren't enough to tide me over until X or Y or Z. So, for those like me, where story can make or break a game, this game, as it is now, is not worth buying.","October 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 14 of 62 people (23%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","23","14","62","7","4"
