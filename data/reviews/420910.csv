The ones that exist are easy to figure out/exploit)\n- No Challenge (just a grindy game. provided you're not brain dead, you won't lose.)\n\nNormally, I don't give negative reviews on Early Access Titles. But the dev's alpha roadmap is pratically complete and the game just isn't at a place where I could honestly recommend it. I'm concerned about the future plans for the game and where the dev plans to take this one.\n\nFor example, most "sneak peeks" I do on early access or alpha titles take an hr of gameplay and even then, I've only just scratched the surface of most games. In Store Manager: Cellular Edition, I had covered all the mechanics inside of 10 minutes. The only thing left to do would have been grind. I think this is fairly eloquent in showing what the game is like.\n\nThe game runs nice and stable. There doesn't seem to be any obvious game breaking bugs.\n\nIf Dev stretches the scope of his game, starts to include some more depth eg:\n\n- Selling phone plans not just phones\n- More control over staffing levels\n- More control over stock levels/inventory position\n- Increased analytics around the "market"\n- Weekly cycles/opening times\n\nIf we start to see some of these things or other things that increase the depth and challenge to the game, this review will easily become a positive one. I'll return to cover it again if a significant update is made.","December 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","42","60","2","4"

You have to staff the store and order inventory to sell. Since there's a lot of phones and you don't have much money to start with, most of your customers will leave empty handed because you don't have their ideal phone or their 2nd choice. The game provides statistics for you to see the breakdown of all the models and their demand, allowing you to manage your stock with your limited funds more effectively. Once revenue is in the green things are easy. You'll have money for experienced staff to handle customers faster, marketing campaigns to get more in the door, and enough stock to satisfy those crazy days where every seems to want one particular phone.\n\nAnd... that's about it for the moment. I got to the point where with good employees and top-tier marketing I was selling about 40 phones per day, netting around 15-20 grand in profit daily. The only thing you can do with money besides putting it into inventory, marketing, and staff are upgrades. At the moment you can put demo models on the tables or set up displays to advertise particular brands. My store already had a high satisfaction rating and setting up demo models didn't seem to get more customers in my store. I set up four Kiwi yPhone displays and sales were roughly the same; Some days I sold mostly "Robot" phones, on others I mostly yPhones.\n\nI had a look at the developer's site and there's some pretty neat ideas planned for the future like the possibility of thefts, but for now there's less to it than a typical lemonade stand game.","December 9, 2015","false","4.2"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

Knowing the game is in alpha I expect there to be issues .  What I got was a menu with no real game at all.  When you click new game you get a menu that explains the developers goals but no way to click through to start a game.  These menus take about a minute to scroll through each one as is freezes on every single window.  I worked with the game for about 5 minutes and still was unable to figure out how to start the game.  during this time I had to cntl alt del the game 3 times.  I have the hardware to run any game out there.

What the game has already is a good start definitely though, if they can build upon this then it will indeed be a very good management/simulation game.\n\nYou're managing a cell (mobile) store and have to control the ingoings and outgoings and every day you get the profit gain/loss.\n\nI would recommend it now if you're highly interested in management/sim games and a basic game does not bother you but it's still very early days in Early Access with the full release being planned for sometime next summer 2016.\n\nThe developer seems very adamant in listening to the community and getting feedback to keep upgrading the game and making it better and with the game being very solid (apart from the wasd bug which scrolls super fast on my PC) I would recommend a purchase.\n\nI have attached a preview video which is 15 minutes long and will show you a lot more of the game and will give you a much better idea.

The ingame UI dressed in a cell phone is just that. Tedious, clumsy, unresponsive, no feedback, inaccurate, annoying eventually. Everything is mouse driven, not even F1, F2, F3, F4 to set the game speed, which also resets every time your phone rings. More hotkeys for keyboard driven control would be nice.\n\nThat's all you do during the day, customers most commonly call to ask if something is in stock, or to complain; to which you either aplogise or give them free stuff. All in-game related data is displayed on virtual sheets of paper, that you can't drag around, to have the more important ones side by side.\n\n"[...] the most comprehensive and accurate retail store simulator ever created [...]" has shallow mechanics, a small static table of items to stock up on and sell, with no real market research at hand, and full of fantasy quantities of money / prices.\n\nEmployee salary seems to range from $400 to $700 daily, that's $12,000 to $21,000 a month, or $144,000 to $252,000 annually. Yet, your employees are so unhappy, they quit every couple of days. Meeting with your employee to ask how they feel, does cost you $500... wait, what for? A little stress relief for $500?\n\nAnd I can't get over the hiring process, especially when you find people through word of mouth and like none of them; the game repeatedly reminds you with an extra message box, that you'll lose the roster and the money you spend on job ads. Sigh.\n\nThere's fantasy prices for marketing, too - $100 cold calling, $250 newspaper ad (one expensive newspaper), $500 for some sign flipper, $1000 for a radio ad, $1500 for a networking seminar (don't as me how that's advertisement), $2000 for a TV ad.\n\nBut of course you're not allowed to spend ANY money on marketing unless you end up with $2,000 or more at the end of the day, because you're "too close to the red". How does that make sense? Who owns this business, the developer, or the player? Who is he to tell you how and when to spend your money?\n\nYou can have at most 2 employees working in the store, although you can hire up to 4. Using the 2 spare ones gives your 2 main ones a stress relief, so they're less likely to quit their $144,000+ anual salary job. Break room upgrades are not yet implemented. You will not be able to serve customers yourself when things get busy. You'll sit at your desk all day long, answering your annyoing cell phone.\n\nI can't see how this game would live up to its promise of being the most comprehensive and accurate any time soon. I've played Tycoon games 20+ years old with deeper mechanics.","May 26","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
