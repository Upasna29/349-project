"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgitburns/recommended/363580/","omgitburns","Snelrev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgitburns/","546 products in account","I sat down with this game a bit this morning after being recommended it, by a friend. I want to say first that i am usually not someone interested in these type of games, but due to the friend and the low price of the game i thought i'd give it a shot. I will be writing a bit indepth about everything up top here, and then add a little TL;DR of the pros and cons of the game for people that don't want a longer read.\n\nGraphics:\nVisually this game is quite appealing, simple but nice graphics and very colorful. While i usually am not a fan of these kind of simplistic type of cube-graphics, i have to say this looks a bit nicer, since they have made the cubes look almost 3d and at the same time managed to get it to fit very well with the music and atmosphere of the game.\n\nSounds/Music:\nThe music in this game is very good, it reminds me a bit of the Hotline Miami soundtrack and does bring up the tempo of the game a bit. If it wasn't for the soundtrack, this game wouldn't be as special.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay, as a casual indie game should be, is very simplistic and easy to learn. But it does contain alot more depth once you get into the game a bit. It starts with the easy, pull a line, cube bounces, get it right. But later in the game it mixes it up a bit with having to hold over cubes that are moving in the way, to slow them down, then quickly switching back to your cube and launching it again, which calls for some skill, speed and precision.\n\nThere is alot of maps to this game, i only got through the first two worlds and half of world three before i put it down and from checking the achievements i can see twelve worlds.\n\nI think the thing i liked the most about this game, and the most surprising thing was the boss battles at the end of every world. These are really off from the game, but in a good way. The first worlds boss is a circle in the middle that shoots lazers towards you that you have to dodge while bouncing into the circle twenty times. It added quite a few fun mechanics and was a really fun challenge. Now the second boss was even more impressive, as it wasn't really a boss at all. It was a game of asteroids where you had to hit at least 60 asteroids while dodging exploding circles, it took me several tries on this one, but it was a fun challenge. As i said before, i haven't gotten to boss three yet, but i bet that one will also be as interesting.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\nGood soundtrack\nInteresting Levels\nChallenging and Fun Bosses\nClever Idea\n\nCons:\nSome of the levels at the start are just insanely easy, and then further forward it just spikes in difficulty.\n\nYou lose if you manage to get the cube in without bouncing it first.\n\nI honestly wish the playercube was a ball so i could easier figure out if it was going to bounce off a corner or not.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAll in all a pretty good game. If you like casual indiegames with good soundtracks and got £5 on you, go ahead and get it.","August 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

The graphics are pixel based and retro with a side of vibrant! There are over 100+ creative levels and some pretty fun boss levels which break up your rhythm and make things even more challenging.\n\nThe goal is to fire your block through the map utilizing bounces in order to find your way to the finish. Things get really difficult quickly as advertised; you can breeze through about 16 levels before you start failing on the regular. Earn different star ratings to unlock new worlds and achievements; these are based on how few bounces it takes to complete the level. I really had fun with this game!\n\nIt's a solid game; only worth about $3 though. I found this in a in cheap bundle.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

The game is in fact fun and will require a lot of patience. The whole thing is really nice, the neon graphics and the music all fit perfectly and you'll keep coming back to it to play a couple of levels. So yeah I totally recommend it.","February 28","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
