This game was designed to be an Indian Jones style game, and it nails it. The enviroment is full of traps, dangerous jumps, puzzles, and aggressive wildlife.\nYou never feel safe in this game, you wont find any hand holding here, you have to explore every bit of the levels just to find out what to do, then you have to experiment ( with jumps, running to avoid, long swims where worry about running out breath)\nand finally perform all the platforming, shootouts, and puzzle solving perfectly to get to the next level. Because of this the games enviroments feel more alive and real then most newer and graphically better games. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is that the controls will take time to get used to, but once you do you will actually like playing the game this way the game is built with these controls in mind and is expertly designed. Every little movement is in your controll from walking, running, the angle of your jump, grabing, pulling yourself up, these are all controlled with individual button presses where most game especially today will do all that automatically, it is much more challenging, but in the end you feel far more like you actually achieved your moves then you do in any game made today. make sure to google or check the forums to get the game running right on modern OS, dont let that discourage you from playing these amazing games.","November 26, 2013","true","0.6"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","52","53","0","1"

I still highly enjoy it. However, don't play it unless you're up for a challenge. In addition, there are two items worth mentioning. First, graphics are naturally better on the PC than the PS1. I noticed that TR1 and TR2 looked a bit cleaner. In TR3, there is a huge difference. It's total eye candy for those used to the PS1 version. And secondly, gone are the evil blue save crystals that you were forced to seek out if you wanted to save your game. Now, you can save your game whenever you please and where blue crystals once resided, now you get green crystals that heal you when you run through them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/225320/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","How does Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft measure up to its predecessors? Well, I think a more fitting title for the game could've been Tomb Raider: Part III. In retrospect, I'd apply a similar moniker to Tomb Raider II, as I feel they work more as either expansions or episodes, rather than fully fledged sequels. That being said, what we have here is still more of the same: more of the same action-packed, platforming and puzzle-pulling gameplay of which the Tomb Raider series is so renowned for.\n\nLara Croft returns once again in another globetrotting adventure, this time in search of four pieces of a legendary meteorite, scattered throughout the world. She must travel to India, London, Nevada, the South Pacific and Antarctica to retrieve them, and stop the mad Dr. Willard, among other hackneyed antagonists, from using the meteorite pieces for their own devilish deeds.\n\nFor the first time in the series, you're allowed to select which set of levels to play in order, but I really don't see the point of this at all, as you end up playing all of them anyway. Lara's mansion makes another welcome appearance, serving once again as a tutorial for newcomers and veterans alike, allowing them to get accustomed to Lara's new abilities, including sprinting, a dive-roll, crawling, and using monkey bars. And yes, you can still lock Winston in the freezer, or even shoot at him on Lara's new shooting range! Secrets return to the system from the first game, in which hard to reach places reward you with a cache of healing items, ammo and even weapons from time to time. And if you collect all of them, you can unlock a secret level, which I love as an incentive for completionists. You can keep track of this by checking your stats, which makes it a lot easier to find them.\n\nThe main issue I have with Tomb Raider III is inconsistency. Similar to Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III suffers from an uneven pace and lack of balance. For example, the London levels are incredibly boring, long-winded, and full of water and ladder sections, both of which are incredibly cumbersome. The South Pacific levels offer a bit more variety, but here there's an even larger emphasis placed on water, and controlling the kayak is absolutely abysmal. I actually love tank controls, so I have no issues with games like the older Resident Evils or Tomb Raiders 1-5, but the kayak is just so floaty (no pun intended), so sticky, so unresponsive. In contrast, Tomb Raider III has one of the best looking opening levels I've seen in a video game. It truly is stunning how Core managed to work around the limitations of the engine to provide such beautiful locales. Antarctica and Nevada in particular are also very well done sections and feel far more natural and at home in a Tomb Raider game.\n\nThe difficulty is also just as sporadic and unpredictable as it is in the second game, and I once again find this incredibly grating. There is a large amount of instant deaths, most of which feel so damn cheap. It feels like cheating to just save after every small section just to avoid playing the same parts over and over again, but I suppose that's a better alternative to what the PlayStation players had to suffer through. Whereas in the PlayStation version you have to collect "Save Crystals" to save the game (wherever you wish), in the PC version you have an infinite amount of saves (as in previous games), and Save Crystals are converted into floating green crystals that function as instant small medpacks. It's kind of bizarre and I wish Core had just outright removed them rather than changing them.\n\nThe game looks and sounds fantastic, there's no denying it. The levels are so detailed and considerably less artificial. Effects such as water, fire and muzzle flashes look stunning, and the lighting is phenomenal. It has this autumn-afternoon, orange-green colour palette going on that I really, really like. Nathan McRee returns once again as the composer, and has thankfully resurrected the Tomb Raider Theme from its hideous Tomb Raider II remix. Sound is far more solid and involving in Tomb Raider III, and I think it's one of the best aspects of the game. Judith Gibbins lends her voice to Lara for the second time, and she still remains my favourite voice actress for her.\n\nDespite my aversion to the inconsistencies of the game, I'd still recommend it for fans of the previous games. I wouldn't, however, recommend it for someone trying to get into the series for the first time. It's quite difficult and not very accessible to newcomers. I enjoyed the game but I felt that, like the second one, it failed as a sequel and filled more of a expansion pack role. For me, I consider The Last Revelation to be the true sequel.\n\n4/5.\n\nPS. In Nevada, workers before you enter Area 51 have Lost Souls from Doom and Doom II on the back of their jackets. This alone added half a star to my final score.","October 17, 2014","true","29.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","2"

Who else would search for them than Lara Croft?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nAfter the great hit of Tomb Raider II Core Design went for another adventure with Lara Croft in 1998 called "Tomb Raider III - Adventures of Lara Croft", published by Eidos Interactive. It is the third follow-up of the Tomb Raider franchise and also the sequel to Tomb Raider II.\nMillion of years ago a meteor crashed to earth and scattered a mysterious artefact across the world. Unaware of this event and the true history behind it Lara searches for the Infada Stone, one of the pieces from the artefact from which local beliefs that it holds great powers. On her mission she encounters Dr. Willard -the head of RX Research Team-, who clears the story behind the stone that Lara found in india. A hunt for the other 3 missing pieces in london, south pacific and nevada begins. But this should be just the beginning...\n\nSince Tomb Raider II the gameplay of the Action Adventure didn't change much. Yet, a lot of new features have been added. First and foremost the graphics since the last game enhanced again. The envoironments are now more detailed and smoothed out including the 3D effects such as water surface, fog, snow, rain and the dynamic lighting.\nNoteable is the change of sound effects as well as the incredible well made ingame music. Everything sounds a bit more muffled, beginning from the steps of Lara right up to the weapons.\n\nHer arsenal is everted once again. While the normal pistols with unlimited ammunition, harpoon and the uzi are the same weapons as known in the previous game, the shotgun and grenade launcher got new skins. The automatical pistols are replaced by a Desert Eagle (probably the most useful and powerful weapon in the game) and the M16 moved for a MP5. Her arsenal also includes now a rocketlauncher.\n\nLara got some new acrobatic moves too. She is now able to crouch and crawl, sprint and make her way hand over along special ceilings. On her journey Lara will be also able to travel with brand new vehicles such as a kayak, a motor boat, a quad bike and a mine car. In ice water the air bar will be replaced by a thermal bar which drowns faster but recovers slower at the other hand. Snakes and traps can now poison Lara and she will need a medikit to heal her from the poisoning.\n\nThroughout the gameplay at the PC you will encounter green crystals with the purpose to heal Lara immediately. Their orignally intention was to be a limited save object on the consoles the player could use. For some reasons the developer still kept the possibility to save at any point in the PC version, while they only changed the purpose of the crystals.\n\nThe most noteable feature is the possibility to choose between the main levels after india and before antarctica. The opportunity to play Nevada, London and South Pacific in any order the player wishes refreshes the whole gameplay and makes it worth to play through the game a second or even a third time.\n\nSadly, the keyboard-only controls carry over from Tomb Raider 2. Admittedly the camera follows smoother now when Lara moves, but the still existing limited field of view and the missing option to turn the camera in any situation makes it difficult to predict some actions inside a level.\n\nBesides of this Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft will fill hours with platforming and solving puzzles!\n\nA cute fact at the end: Apes from the jungle can steal items in front of Lara Croft and will run away from her. Aint that cute?\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAs already mentioned in Tomb Raider II, the graphics and controls aged very well compared to modern games. Yet, it is a absolutely worthy sequel to the previous game and made nearly everything right. New weapons refresh the game while discovering the new places. Every level has its own charm and atmosphere, so that the hunt for the new artefact will not get boring fast.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of this franchise and for those who want to experience the charm of these old classics.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nTomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft is available at the Playstation 3 and PSP (via PlayStation Network).\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Improved graphics compared to Tomb Raider II\n[✔] Remarkable level music and enhanced sound effects\n[✔] New weapons, vehicles and acrobatic movements\n[✔] Main levels can be played in any order\n[✔] Unlimited saves at any point / Health Crystals\n[✔] Feature of poisoning from animals and traps, thermal bar in ice water\n\n[✖] Clunky keyboard-only controls\n[✖] Graphics primitve compared to todays standards\n[✖] Fixed camera, only possible to move Lara's head\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMg4oYL7ak\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618226951\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

Looking at it now she wiggles like a fish however back then, it was pretty damn cool as she explains about her new adventures being Tomb Raider 3 – Adventures of Lara Croft. Of course she describes that Tomb Raider 3 is the most exciting adventure yet as she has new outfits to wear, new locations to explore, advance AI, new features like sprint and so on however there was a key element right at the end of this clip stating she hopes we take good care of her. Well, whilst Tomb Raider 3 has all these new features, once thing is for certain, it's the hardest out of the three by a mile.\n\nWhilst made all of those promises, and they are the words straight from Lara herself, the game play hasn't really changed much from the previous installments. Granted she does all those acrobatic maneuvers and showing no signs of vertigo, it still is the same game with different locations. Being the third installment, you think developers Core Design improves some of the game play like better camera angles or have the ability to use the mouse. Unfortunately this was not the case so veterans of the other two games shouldn't have any issues with the controls or putting up with the odd perk like the camera facing directly at Lara front on whilst jumping. Newcomers though will have great difficulty though.\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-iii-adventures-of-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12585765/\n\n7 / 10","April 23, 2014","true","16.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

(btw TR3 is dark as !@#$)\n\nbut on the other hand , the game has alot of crashes that needs to be fixed like :\n\n1. if you tweek the gamma or just simply press on the graphics setting inside the game , you'll be "kicked" outta the game.    SOLUTION: don't touch that\n\n2. random black textures from time to time.   SOLUTION: save the game , exit the game , open the game\n\n3. if you customize your controls "user controls" and exit the game then open it again , the game would mix the default controls with the user controls .\nSOLUTION: everytime you open the game you have to apply the user controls before you play (happens in TR1 and TR2).  it's really easy , your custom controls are saved ... just press action on controls , you'll see the default ones ... press right or left to switch to "user keys" and press action.\n\n4. as the same as the first point , if you change the graphic setup before you enter the game , you'll have a high chance for the game to crash.   SOLUTION: don't mess with that either\n\n5. AND MOST IMPORTANT : this game has no steam overlay ... in other words , if you press the  "shift+tab"  thingy , it won't work .... same proplem could be found in TR : underworld.\n\nSOLUTION: pray that lord gaben fix that ;)\n\n\nenough from cons , now let's talk about this game a little bit.\n\nif you played the new Tomb Raider games and eager to play "the history behind lara" you must\npractice the movement of the first 5 tomb raider games which share the same gameplay concept and engine which are vastly different from the modern games , go to the tomb raider guides and see the jump types and how to climb.\n\ni don't recommend starting from this game right off the bat cuz TR3 is well known of booby traps and frustrating jumps , dark areas and hard puzzles ... that's why i recommend TR1 and TR2.\n\nas i said in the beginning , i love this game ... really good memories and fun moments , if you master the movements i assure you that you will be satisfied , i love the first 5 TRs more than the rediculously easy TRs nowadays\n\n7/10\n\nbest version , classic , needs some small fixes.","December 30, 2015","true","19.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","1"

In the PS1 port of Tomb Raider 3, they removed quicksaving and instead had the player find collectable items that let you quicksave.

There are definitely some stand out examples of really great, fun levels, and you  get to choose to tackle them in whichever order you please, adding strategy and replayability to the game.\nThe game is unabashedly completely bonkers, too.

Don't get me wrong; this game is loaded with all the ingenious traps and puzzles you'd expect from a Tomb Raiding simulator, but the ♥♥♥♥en spiked ceiling rooms, and Thames Wharf seriously make me want to go raid my own tomb, via a cyanide pill and funeral.\n\nOverall, it's quite dated, but it's close to my heart, and it's still got some really cool ♥♥♥♥ in it.","December 27, 2014","true","23.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This is the HARDEST of all the Tomb Raider games of any generation (unless you're pedantic and think the dodgy controls of AoD make it 10x more difficult)\nOh, and it was released in 1998. PC graphics have been touched up but don't expect your 4k monitor to have its full potential realised.\nNot only are there much more frequent traps that will kill you instantly, there are vital peices of the games many puzzles that can be very easily looked over due to sneaky lighting tricks/blending the lever/switch into the background. This is evident from as early as the second level (Temple Ruins) where the *SPOILER* second key is found behind movable blocks that after moving the first block don't seem to have any purpose *ENDSPOILER*.\nI personally feel this game is designed for those familiar with the original Tomb Raider format, especially comparing the first level in this (Jungle) to Caves and The Great Wall from TR1&2, which is in my opinion much more difficult than those two.\nNot gunna talk about the horrific underwater puzzle in Luds Gate - just gunna say USE A GUIDE.\nBut, I do feel this game pushed Tomb Raider's boundaries giving Lara new abilities and new obstacles. The level design is infuriatingly brilliant and the final boss is much more of a challenge than previous games.\n\nAll in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game, but only to those who have perhaps played the original two first. Probably best to emulate TR1 though.","November 30, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not necessarily a good game, either. While the developers added a lot to the default Tomb Raider experience (including new volumetric lighting and 3D particle effects) and enhanced the otherwise unchanged and familiar gameplay formula of jumping, climbing, puzzling, shooting and dying by handing Lara a new set of skills including crawling through tight spaces, a much needed sprinting feature and monkey-swinging your way across certain areas, the game ended up being needlessly convoluted and confusing.\n\nFor the first time in the series the player can choose where Lara travels next in her adventure after each completed chapter with locations ranging from the dark and rainy London over a mysterious island in the South Pacific, to a highly guarded secret military base in the deserts of Nevada. Only the beginning that takes place in and around abandoned temple ruins in an Indian jungle and the ending of the game are not selectable for story-related reasons.\nIt is certainly not a feature that was needed but it's a neatly implemented idea that offers some minor freedoms to the player with different weapons and ammunition pickups being available in certain sections of the game that might be helpful in others.\n\nWhile the level design in both of the prequels was executed extremely well, Tomb Raider III throws you into a ton of complex and most of the time downright annoying areas that require so much backtracking you'll find yourself running around the levels aimlessly for hours, not knowing where to go or what the game wants from you. Some parts are so ridiculous you'll want to delete the game once you find out what you were supposed to do in order to progress.\n\nIn terms of locations there is a huge variety of different structures and themes to explore much like in Tomb Raider II even though this time they tend to feel rather random and make you wonder what the hell the writers were thinking when they came up with certain places and designs.\nObviously the locations don't come without a plot, which might be the biggest weak point of the game. Granted, the franchise isn't known for captivating stories but while Tomb Raider I and II both did a fairly good job at introducing the player to villains, side characters and overall themes and lore, this game just... doesn't. None of the things you encounter make any sense whenever you find your mind drifting off and occupying itself with questioning them even the slightest. The villains have no sort of backstory let alone motivations for their actions, the settings Lara finds herself in feel almost incidental and even though the main drive of her actions, the so called Infada Artifacts (named after an Indian temple where Lara assumes the only one of the relics to be located only to find out there are actually several more), are not as obscure as the Dagger of Xian (the object of desire in the previous game), they still feel out of place and the writing and lore accompanying them is simply uninspired and lackluster.\n\nHold on, didn't I say Tomb Raider III wasn't necessarily a bad game? Whoops. Well, to be fair, I do enjoy playing through it every once in a while but only because I have suffered enough over the past decade to know where all the hidden (or should I say damn near invisible) items and passageways are and because level skip cheats exist and I don't have to torture myself with some of the ludicrous level design choices.\n\nWell, ultimately it's up to you as usual but let my review be a warning and try to take a few breaks before breaking your keyboard in two out of sheer frustration.","February 3","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

People who haven't been introduced to the greatness that was the playstation, or perhaps as far back as the Super Nintendo should not buy and play any of these games. I rather like the idea of being able to play some of the greatest classics of the time.\n\nFirst to note are bugs that I have encountered:\n\n- Setting up the controls took forever as the game kept freezing right at the keybind menu.\n--To get around that, if it should happen, set all your vid settings first, then exit the game. This will ensure they are not lost. Then play Lara's Mansion. You may have to use the controls already preset for a little bit. Then go into the menu and change your controls to whatever works. Those who have played Tomb Raider using an emulator via the disk drive will most likely know what kind of control scheme seems to work. It sucks but you can get used to it. Exit the game when you are done to save your settings. You may have to go into the keybind and set it to user keys each time you play because the game allows keybind conflicts between the two. So when you crouch she may draw her pistols. Going into the keybind menu seems to remedy that for some reason.\n\n\nOther than that, I haven't come up with any other bugs. It doesn't use DosBox so that is a major plus. With the higher resolution available it looks a lot nicer than playing on the playstation. Music works fine. I don't know if there are supposed to be sounds when picking up an item, like there was with TR2. If there is, then they are absent.\n\nThe reality is, in todays standards the game is a 3/10. The only thing that makes it a 3 is the fact that the puzzles are very clever and force you to be calculating in your moves. Today's games are so linear and so shoot'em up that you can run anywhere. Even the latest Tomb Raider titles are like that. Not this game or any of the Core Design TR titles.\n\nIf you have never played the game on playstation and if you have never used control schemes like these, do not buy these games. They are strictly fan-only as they are extremely dated and VERY DIFFICULT. However, I do recommend this title to those who have played the series in the past.","February 6, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiguilherman/recommended/225320/","tiguilherman","tiguilherman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiguilherman/","412 products in account","Back in 1999 and already baffled (in a good way) by the first 2 games of the franchise, I finally bought the 3rd part of Lara Croft's (back then definitely the biggest name of the gaming industry) saga for the Sony Playstation, expecting to get that same fix of what I always loved about Core Design's masterpiece of a franchise and then some.\n\nThings, however, didn't go as smoothly as expected.\n\nBack then I couldn't get into the game because of its difficulty but I thought it was my fault for - as a kid - sucking at it. I could make progress with time and patience (some levels took me over a month), but it was simply too much of an effort and little fun to pay it off.\nSo I put the game on my waiting list and finally, in 2015 - 16 years later - I went to give it another try and boy, was I disappointed: my displeasure with it didn't change one bit.\n\nWhat actually changed was the maturity in my approach to it, as well as the acquired ability to really be able to identify what went wrong with it.\n\nOk, so TR1 was the big sensation of 1996 and everybody who played it back then know that. Absolutely tremendous in every way.\n\nTR2 brought along in 1997 a series of innovations: A more mature approach to the character of Lara itself, with more cutscenes and a more elaborate plotline, different kinds of locations (as the picturesque Venice, a dive in the deep ocean into the Maria Doria, the tibetan foothills, and so on), the introduction of urban scenarios (which in TR2 are not bad at all), new weapons, the clever use of lighting (flares) and so on. Everything underlined by a great level design that offered, in my opinion, a very fair challenge. How could you not like it?\n\nThe third part, however, tried to surpass the second one not with new resources or a new approach (like TR2 did after TR1), but with (little) flash over substance. It was simply the sequel nobody asked for: More of the same with a twist of lemon. Of course, I won't deny that people back then (like myself) wanted more than anything else just to have more fun with good old Lara, especially after 2 very successful games. But to craft an entire game only on that urge for quantity, and not quality, could only lead to a bland piece of software with a very short lifespan. And that's exactly what happened.\nI will tell you why:\n\nThe developers tried to enhance even more the gameplay and challenge by making more intricate puzzles, which, along with the atmosphere (art direction+soundtrack), basically composes the core of the game. The rest is - let's be honest - simply decorative. The level design and some ideas of TR3 are not bad at all, I admit it, and the game may look good (or harmless) in a first impression - when you, for example, are testing the game on a store or in a friend's place (until you eventually buy it).\nAs you play however, the game engine starts to show its age, and you notice that some platforming puzzles are simply too clumsily implemented. There are some ledges you can't even see right, and back then this was even worse, as it was enhanced by the lower resolution.\nThe intention was good, of course. If you are making a sequel you SHOULD bring something new to the table, but they simply didn't have the tools to do it and did it anyway.\nThe result was a very confusing level design filled with alot of unnecessary frustration. Actually this wouldn't be so bad if they also didn't punish you so harshly for failing, which leads me to the other big fault of this game:\nIt's HARD in a very unfair way. 90% of the times you missed a jump, you will either fall inadvertently to your death, or into a river full of piranhas with no possibility of getting out, or drown in quicksand (btw how that happens in the level "Crash Site" is just laughable), and the list goes on.\nALL of them game-breaking situations, which means you WILL have to load a save. You will then, of course, be ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and fall into one of these 2 situations:\n\n1. If you didn't save, be ready to ALT+F4 in anger and do something else, because the game's a long ways of being atmospheric or instigating enough to entertain you to play the same thing all over again until the part that you failed. It's a crude form of challenge, a blatant hardship with absolutely no reward apart from the dim ray of hope that things will get eventually better until the end of the game, which never really happens.\n\n2. If you, on the other hand, are a good scout and save your game every 5 minutes because you're no fool and already felt from the very beginning that you will have to do that if you wanna avoid frustration,\nyou were right. Congratulations.\nThing is, that is still annoying and it still totally breaks the flow of the game (or any game, for that matter). In the end, you can't really enjoy the experience because you're so worried with death and looking everytime over your shoulders for the next trick the developers - for sure - will throw at you. Be it some piece of the ceiling falling over your head with no chance of a timely, spontaneous escape or being crushed by a rolling boulder that just fell from someplace you can't see and didn't give you nearly enough time to even notice that something unusual was about to happen.\nYou will just see Lara dead.\nSo believe me you will be loading your save ALOT before you finally get that jump or notice that they purposedly put the exit of a tunnel in that dark part where the camera (which was always awful) doesn't go, just to keep you wondering in frustration.\nThe game's full with these bad jokes.\nWhat they wanted with this I don't know, but if they figured this was going to be fun, they were wrong.\nRelevant sidenote: Every vehicle mechanic in this game is broken aswell.\n\nSo that's the gameplay for you, one of the 2 attractions of a typical adventure with Lara. The next one is the atmosphere: As far as the art direction goes, this game unfortunately doesn't even come close either to the mysterious and instigating environments of the first game or to the aliveness and freshness of the plethora of different scenarios of the 2nd part. The London stages I found particulary boring and uninspired, as well as the Area 51 levels in Nevada. This engine simply wasn't designed to do urban stuff. It feels and it plays awkward, even for 1998's standards.\n\nOn top of it, the story is really generic. I know the story was never a strong point in TR games, but this one's simply doesn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ either about content nor value.\nSomething a teenager could write in 10 minutes.\nWhat's really bad, though, is its presentation. There's absolutely NO fill-in as to why Lara suddenly appeared in Nevada after being 2 minutes ago in London, for example. Everything seems like a poor excuse to shove more levels down your throat - again, the hopeless, pointless struggle of quantity against quality.\nThis entire game was actually more suited to be an expansion of TR2, and the devs actually do a really bad job of hiding this truth, beginning with the couldn't-be-more-generic title of the game: "Adventures Of Lara Croft". Are you serious?\n\nThe soundtrack, however, is not bad at all, despite not actually being something you could call a soundtrack. It's more like short bursts of music that inspire mystery and suspense, following the tradition of TR1 and TR2, which is never a bad thing. A nice cherry to a cake that unfortunately has a bad taste.\n\nAll in all, if you're a completist like me and you have a strong motivation of playing every single game of the franchise, be it for nostalgia or just for the sake of knowledge, go for it and be warned.\nBut if you just played TR1 and TR2 back then and just wanna have some fun for old time's sake, go play those games again, because this one doesn't make the cut.\nIf you never played anything from the franchise, I beg of you to STAY AWAY. You will ruin your first impression of it. If you know what's good for you, start with TR1.","February 8, 2015","false","30.5"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","12","26","2","2"

Many of the traps kill you even when you know what is waiting for you as they require super precise movement in order to avoid. It is not really welcome considering how clucky the game is.\n\nI feel I managed to survive the game only due to being TR veteran. The puzzles are pretty badly designed.

A bad example of a TR game, including the 2013 "reboot", but also just in general bad.\n\nThe game engine itself is archaic in the way the levels are created. All levels are created with "squares" is pretty much the best way to describe it. Textured squares. Seems kinda stupid, but in the first two games it worked really well (for 1996-1997)TR 1-2 were set in temples and jungles and what not, and didnt really need TOO much detail; TR3 has levels set in London, and replicated that city with the game engine almost made me quit this game before finishing it, it's that bad. The way com♥♥♥♥r desks looked, and a friggen kitchen stove that looks to stupid and not realistic at all. Core Design, in my opinion, bit off WAY more than they could've chewed with the amount of detail they were trying to add and replicate in TR3 with the game engine they had (but kudos to them for even trying).\n\nLevel design in TR3, compared to TR2 (IMO), is plain bad and feels rushed. As i was struggling to enjoy the game, i looked back at reviews from 1998 for TR3, and a review from IGN said almost the same thing. Core Design literally only spent almost a year from when TR2 was released to push this out, and when you play the game you can tell. Levels aren't expanded in the way TR2 was, and feels like a step back in the wrong direction. Platforming is bad in most of the levels, and switches/buttons aren't even clear with what their even doing... "Hey let's click thi switch on the wall..." **click** "....wtf did it do?" is pretty much what you'll be saying 8-% of the time in TR3. See, TR2 and 1 had a quick clip of waht was opening or a certain sound of something opening around you. TR3, while it DOES has SOME clips of whats opening, not in the amount of what was in the previous titles. So you mostly left with kinda wondering around, feeling like you've never played a game before because you're ♥♥♥♥ing lost in a levels that was rushed with needless deadends and cheap boulder traps.... OMFG THE BOULDER TRAPS....\n\nYou think they included the Level Skip code for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles? No, they did not. It was included because you can find yourself stuck because you saved at a wonrg time in a level, and for some reason a puzzle you were solving reverted itself, without warning, and the item you used on the puzzle is gone. You're ♥♥♥♥ed. Stuck in London, Antartica, wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you encounter the bug because the developers didnt even QA test their game they rushed out. So you can either restart the crappy designed level, or skip it and feel a little dirty on the inside cause you cheated. I felt dirty twice in this game, both because of a game breaking bug that forced me to do it.\n\nThe story sucks and the Boulder traps. ♥♥♥♥ the stupid Boulder traps, man...\n\nThere is some positive stuff going for the game. I loved how i could choose my own path in the way i approach the level i wanted to start first, second, and third. This was nice, and can actually help players create a unique experiance in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. There's a Rocket Launcher. I'm pretty sure Laras' boobs are bigger in this game. She has multiple outfits she wears for each level. And thats it.\n\nVerdict? 3/10 Stay away from this POS like the ♥♥♥♥ing Plague, friends... or if you're a TR like me, PLAY IT and enjoy :)","January 10, 2015","false","29.2"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","3","16","0","0"

Tomb Raider II was the very first game I ever picked up for PC when I was around 8. Both my parents played it, and my mom was the first one to beat it. Needless to say, I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan.\n\nTomb Raider III feels like an anomaly in the series that I just can't figure out. It has cool places to go, a good structure, and was the first game to impliment the crouch and sprint features. Off the top of my head, it appears to run on the same engine as Chronicles and Last Revelation, but has the same menu system as I and II. Tomb Raider III is something of a transitional game, and is also the last game until Anniversary to feature Lara's Manor. That being said, Tomb Raider III's level design, of all the games, is the most convoluted and elaborate, with the first level "Jungle" featuring no explanation for why Lara was there when you first start playing, and being the longest first mission to solve out of all other games, completely negating any linear tutorial-like qualities for a very open and hard to figure out level design. Unfortunately, this is a trend for all levels (Or at least most) in Tomb Raider III, so I recommend having a walkthrough ready if it's your first time playing. If you want something better to ease you into Tomb Raider, II is the way to go, with the most gradual and steady build in level difficulty of all the other Tomb Raider games. Of course, if you want the best story, you want Last Revelation.\n\nThat being said, Tomb Raider III, at the very least, is still better than Legends, Anniversary (which butchered I), and of course, Tomb Raider (2013), which was more of a spit int he face to the series than anything else.","June 22, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tomb Raider II was the very first game I ever picked up for PC when I was around 8. Both my parents played it, and my mom was the first one to beat it. Needless to say, I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan.\n\nTomb Raider III feels like an anomaly in the series that I just can't figure out. It has cool places to go, a good structure, and was the first game to impliment the crouch and sprint features. Off the top of my head, it appears to run on the same engine as Chronicles and Last Revelation, but has the same menu system as I and II. Tomb Raider III is something of a transitional game, and is also the last game until Anniversary to feature Lara's Manor. That being said, Tomb Raider III's level design, of all the games, is the most convoluted and elaborate, with the first level "Jungle" featuring no explanation for why Lara was there when you first start playing, and being the longest first mission to solve out of all other games, completely negating any linear tutorial-like qualities for a very open and hard to figure out level design. Unfortunately, this is a trend for all levels (Or at least most) in Tomb Raider III, so I recommend having a walkthrough ready if it's your first time playing. If you want something better to ease you into Tomb Raider, II is the way to go, with the most gradual and steady build in level difficulty of all the other Tomb Raider games. Of course, if you want the best story, you want Last Revelation.\n\nThat being said, Tomb Raider III, at the very least, is still better than Legends, Anniversary (which butchered I), and of course, Tomb Raider (2013), which was more of a spit int he face to the series than anything else.","June 22, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once again, you get new weapons, vehicles, and moves to statisfy anyone craving for a slight difference from the last game. There's now more details in the environments as well as heavy use of weather to make the out door scenes more natural. The thing I love most about this game is that the middle levels can be played in any order after you go through the India level. This is sighted as the third and final part of the "Classic Tomb Raider Trilogy" as afterwards the later games would go through various experimental stages.

For instance, pulling a lever in one area to open a door in another makes perfect sense in an ancient tomb designed to protect the secrets inside, but makes no sense on a London rooftop.\n\nI have no problem with the game's designers including the urban settings when in moderation, I just wish they had created the gameplay to suit.\n\nAnother problem I have noticed with this game is the occasional nonsensical puzzle element. I can't help wondering if these were included as a cynical way of selling strategy guides back in the day.\n\nThe story is also worse this time around feeling a little disjoined from the whole.\nThe series feels like it's running out of steam at this point with the developers just phoning it in. While the graphics, sounds, and animations have been improved, the same basic gameplay problems persist, namely the inane fixed camera that tends to show repeated close ups of Lara's backside rather than the ledge you are trying to jump to.\n\nStill, I did enjoy this game, but  less so than the first two instalments.\n\n7/10","November 24, 2015","true","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played the first or second game, this one will probably provide you some enjoyment.\n\nThe level design is pretty good. Lots of jumping platforms, puzzles and wide environments to explore. There were a few frustrating ones where the somewhat bad control scheme was made evident [I'm trying to map the controls onto an xbox controller], but aside from that it's pretty good.\n\nThe combat system is pretty much the same as in TR2. Same weapon choices available, enemies include shooty guys, ranged poison guys, dinosaurs (for some reason). Overall pretty good considering the era the game was designed.\n\nThe music and art is very nice, Despite the fact that it is very low resolution.\n\nA good game for you if you like the early tomb raider games.","January 8","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It did work very well for me on Windows 10 but on Windows 8.1 i have this FMV Issue i cant seem to solve. So i have to disable the FMV's while i play through, which in this game the settings/options dont have it so i have to manually disable them. Either way, everything else works flawlessly, unlike the other 2 where i had to use a program like Joy to Key to Xpadder, TR 3 took full controller capability without problems, and i use a Logitech RumblePad 2. Besides those things this is an amazing game and really sped up the pace of the series in general. Faster moves, jumps, tricks, etc etc. You can really tell this is where the game developers started to really play with all aspects of the game engine. Really unleashing their potential and finally making a fun and pretty memorable experience. Compared to the first two the amount of Weapons in this game is Ludicrious! Rockets! a Desert Eagle!
