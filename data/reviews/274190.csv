"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bralef/recommended/274190/","bralef","Colonel Mustache","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bralef/","484 products in account","You can literally punch Satan so hard he explodes.\n\nI could stop the review right there, 'nuff said. Except no, there's so much more to it than that. Broforce is more than just a one-track gag, it's a love letter to 80s and 90s action heroes wrapped in an homage to Contra, Metal Slug, and with a little Worms for good measure.\n\nAt first glance, the game may come off as simply a novelty. But they didn't just take a generic character, slap the name Rambro on him, and call it good. Every single character in the cast of over 30 has a great deal of love and detail worked into them. Each character has a unique primary attack, a special attack, and a melee attack. Rambro has a trusty machine gun and versatile grenades, whereas Bro Heart has a claymore and the ability to scare enemies by screaming at the top of his lungs. If a character is played by Van Damme, you better believe he can deliver split kicks to terrorists' faces.\n\nTherein lies Broforce's "gimmick:" You start each level with a single life and a random Bro you've unlocked so far. Freeing a Bro trapped in a cage will grant you another life, while also swapping your character to another random Bro. Thus, you have to decide between keeping your current character, or getting the extra life. It's a simple mechanic when you get down to it, but it adds a huge amount of replay value to the game - You'll rarely beat a given level the same way twice.\n\nEach character, given that they're completely different, has their own upsides and downsides. Brocketeer may lack the raw firepower of the other characters, but his jetpack lets him rocket punch dudes and make crazy jumps. MacBrover's dynamite may be less straightforward than a gun, but timed right can cause absolute carnage. Of the gigantic cast, there are maybe one or two characters I try to avoid, and even they can get the job done.\n\nPart of Broforce's charm is in its sheer hilarity and the number of things you can do. I once threw a guy at another guy, killing them both...The second guy was a suicide bomber, however, so he exploded, sending a dog flying through a door, which killed another guy as it opened. You can kill a guy by hitting him in the head with a flash grenade. You can kill Satan by throwing another Satan at him (the latter Satan also dies). You can throw your claymore, which decapitates everyone in its path. Someone out of range may try to shoot you, but your claymore, now stuck in the ground, will reflect the bullets right back into his evil face.\n\nThat's not to say Broforce is completely without faults. In all the carnage and chain-reactions of destruction, it is pretty easy to die, especially when most characters die from a single shot. There are definitely some deaths that feel like they were unavoidable, such as an explosive barrel falling on top of me from offscreen. The reason why I completely forgive this, however, is because of how fun the whole thing is. Death usually has little consequence, so an annoying moment here and there are easily remedied by the barrels of laughs in between. It's definitely a game that's more fun than frustrating. As someone who's not particularly hardcore, the game has never been so frustrating that it made me want to stop playing.\n\nMultiplayer makes the game even more fun and more chaotic. Depending on the level, adding more players can make the game easier (because of the multiplied firepower) or harder (because of the added chaos and thin-spread lives), but almost always makes it more fun. You can high five one another (triggering slow motion), flex together, and if you really want you can drop the rescue chopper on their head. Everyone starts the next level with exactly 1 life anyway, so messing around at the end of the level is surprisingly consequence-free.\n\nAlong with the main levels, there are challenge levels, which when completed unlock powerups in the rest of the game. You can call in an "All-American Supply Drop", aka a nearly-invincible mech with the american flag plastered on in place of a windshield, or take some steroiVITAMINS that let you throw dudes like Superman and scare enemies with your homoerotic grunts.\n\nAt the end of the level, after you've shot Satan in the face (or punched him so hard he exploded, or thrown him off a cliff, or beaten him to death with his own minions, or scared him so hard he jumped to his death), you (and your friends, on the rare occasion you coordinate everyone's jumps correctly) board the rescue chopper and fly off into the distance, as a rockin' victory theme plays and the entire level explodes for no discernible reason.\n\nThat's a perfect image to sum up Broforce: Over the top, ridiculous, nonsensical fun. It would have been very easy for the developers to take the game's concept and turn it into a one-track novelty that doesn't actually amount to much. But Free Lives is the prime example of what a game developer should be. They didn't just put time, money, and effort into this game: They put love into it. They clearly weren't just trying to make a quick buck, they made Broforce because they loved the things they based it off and wanted to share that with other people. Broforce is a game that's a great idea in theory and an even better idea in reality. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest games I've ever played.\n\nPlay this ♥♥♥♥ing game.","December 22, 2015","true","214.7"," 631 of 648 people (97%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","97","631","648","208","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/274190/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBroforce was my first impulse purchase when I got into PC gaming last summer and I don't regret it at all.\n---\nBroforce is not the most sophisticated game. A story is non-existent and there's not much motivation beyond rescue the hostages and kill the bad guys. But that's not much of a negative at all, because the gameplay blows away any wishes for a story or deeper motives. Broforce set out to be an ode to 80's and 90's action movies, the Expendables in video game form, and it succeeds on every possible level.\n\nThe biggest selling point is the characters, all pixel-art parodies of 80's and 90's action movie heroes. Rambo, Commando, Walker Texas Ranger, Snake Plissken, John McClane, The Terminator, Judge Dredd, and more are available to play as and each with their own unique weapon and secondary explosive. You start each level off as a random hero and can switch to another by rescuing hostages, similar to the weapon swapping mechanic in Super Crate Box.\n\nEach level is a fully destructible playground filled with explosive barrels, propane canisters, and many many enemies ranging from simple goons to suicide bombers to guard dogs and mini-gun wielding mini-bosses. The stylized graphics are nicely detailed, with blood, dirt, smoke, and fire flying with every explosion. The destructible environments adds an layer of depth, allowing you to tunnel beneath enemies to flank them or collapse the ground under their feet or crush them beneath trucks and heavy debris. All those tricks and fast reflexes will be needed because the game is not easy. You die in one hit.\n---\nThose impressions are months old, but remain as true as ever. Broforce is hard, it's chaotic, it's challenging, it's fun as hell. You feel like a badass, but you also havve to plan your attack because you can die so fast. A lot of times, rushing in will get you killed, while it would be better to flank from above or blow the ground away from below.\n\nSince I wrote that, new heroes have been added, from Neo to Machete. New bosses and challenging new enemies and mini-bosses to fight. New levels and mechanics. The editor has been improved and expanded. Unlike the majority of betas, this feels like a finished games that gets big content updates rather than a skeleton of a game missing critical features like some Early Access games.\n\nSo the bottom line: Broforce is a mother♥♥♥♥ing blast and you should play it if you like fast arcade action with highly destructive environments and the chance to play as your favorite action heroes.","April 7, 2014","true","21.2"," 689 of 752 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","689","752","0","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/274190/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBROFORCE (you have to say it as a growling shout, or you don't do the game justice) is a game about action heroes. Actual action heroes, as it turns out. Oh, sure, the names change. But with a list of playable characters that includes "Rambro", "MacBrover", and "B.A. Broracus" I think we all know the score.\n\nDon't worry, I'm going to try to steer clear of mentioning any but the earlier-unlocked characters in this review. For the best effect, I recommend not spoiling the list for yourself. One of the most fun parts of Broforce is the anticipation of the next unlock, and witnessing the reveal to the sound of the character's name being shouted by the thoroughly-manly announcer.\n\nBROFORCE is a run-and-gun platformer. The game moves briskly, but not so much so that you can't keep up. It's a nice speed that feels appropriately actiony without feeling unfair. Controls are slick and responsive. Deaths will usually be your own fault, and are accompanied by a noticeable lack of frustration. We all know that feel, right? You die in a game, have to start the level over, and curse either very loudly or under your breath, depending on who's nearby. In Broforce, I don't have that. The game plays so well, the action so entertaining, that having to try again only serves to prolong the enjoyable experience.\n\nThe environments are almost entirely destructable. The effect reminds me of Worms, but with a little more detail to it. When you destroy some dirt, a block or two above it may also crumble. Destroying the ground underneath of a support will cause the support to fall apart piece-by-piece. Blocks in ruins will fall and crush anyone underneath. You can blow up explosive barrels, of course, but you can also send propane canisters rocketing satisfyingly into anything in their path, pushing enemies through walls and then detonating after a short distance. Think the conclusion to the final battle in the film version of Kick-♥♥♥.\n\nThe main draw of the game is the still-growing number of Bros to play as. You don't get to pick your Bro, they're randomly chosen from the ones you've unlocked so far. Unlock more Bros by rescuing more P.O.W. Bros from cages through the game. Each Bro rescued gives you an extra life and turns you into a new Bro. The new Bros are unlocked after you do this certain numbers of times. At the moment, I believe it takes some 300 rescues to catch 'em all.\n\nThe other way to change Bros is to die (and have at least one life remaining). I've seen people complain about not being able to choose who to play as, but I stand by the current model. It's the same sort of thing I really enjoyed about the way Bastion forced you to use each new weapon for a short time. You can't just pick one thing that works and run through the entire game using only that thing. It would get boring before you were even halfway through, and there's not a chance you wouldn't blame the game for that. Having to use each one, whether you like it or not, allows you come to appreciate the pros and cons of each instead of ignoring the new thing to stick with your favorite.\n\nThe Bro lottery simply means that you have to develop your tactics on the fly. Let me tell you, I hated MacBrover at first. Instead of firing bullets at everything, you now have to throw timed explosives at them. And his special is just a remote-detonated version of that. What a rip-off, right? WRONG. SHUT UP. YOU SIT BACK DOWN AND YOU LISTEN, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU. Turns out, MacBrover is pretty much the bane of most bosses. Most Bros can only shoot straight ahead. They may have a special that lets them lob a grenade or whatever. But those specials are limited, and the grenade will honestly probably just bounce a safe distance away from your target, anyways. MacBrover's explosives will detonate more-or-less exactly where you drop them. And since it's his main attack, he can do this infinitely. Find a nice perch and unload, man. Plus, I mean, once you get the hang of it, dropping explosives so that they stick to the general rabble is pretty fun, too.\n\nNow imagine an entire game, FILLED with Bros, all of whom have their pros and cons just like MacBrover. Now imagine that you never know who you'll be playing as next. Getting somebody who meshes well with the situation at hand means plowing through that situation while your heart drips with physical glee. Getting somebody who isn't perfect for the situation means being confronted with a fun challenge where you have to work your way through it like a man.\n\nThere's a good variety to your enemies, as well. You'll kill loads and loads of the basic mooks, but you have big guys, dogs, bomb-tossers, and more. Each of the bosses manages to be pretty unique. I mean, you know, they're mostly just giant death machines that fire big guns at you. But they move differently, fire different types of big guns in different trajectories... look, point is, you won't get bored of the enemy variety, alright?\n\nBROFOOOORCE is still in Early Access, meaning you can expect loads more content in the future. At the moment, one playthrough will probably run you maybe 3-5 hours. The game's enough fun, though, that you shouldn't be surprised if you play it all over again once you're done. Maybe in co-op, this time. The Steam Workshop will extend the length of the game quite a bit. Plus the new Alien campaign (inspired by the Alien series of films) is only just around the corner, and that'll help. New Bros come out now and then, and the devs still have more ideas up their sleeves. You shouldn't be afraid of the "Early Access" label on this one. You'll get your money's worth.\n\nI mentioned co-op. There are actually several multiplayer modes. Co-op is the main one. At the moment, online co-op can be a little laggy at times. It's not perfect. It's not terrible either, though. I've played through the full campaign with a friend, and while there were times where the effects of my friend's actions would play out before they actually performed those actions (often resulting in everything turning into sudden explosions and chaos so that I quickly lost track of what was going on, and usually died as a result), as I said, we did finish the campaign, and the majority of that time consisted of both ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.\n\nThere is an issue with the way the online game treats things like the local game, however. Even online, the screens tries to keep everyone in it at once. If it fails, then it will focus on one person, meaning that the other player can't really see what they're doing. 98% of the time, this isn't a problem. But there was one boss that moves vertically that really tripped us up. My strategy is to climb the boss as quickly as possible. My friend's strategy is to not do that. He immediately finds himself offscreen, dead, and waiting for me to ride the boss to death or success.\n\nI'll probably update this review every now and then until the game is out, and then I may or may not rewrite it to reflect the final product. If you don't see anything after this paragraph, then the former hasn't happened, yet. If you're even reading this paragraph, then the latter hasn't happened, yet. Anyways, get some BROFORCE, bro!","January 27, 2015","true","26.0"," 144 of 146 people (99%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","99","144","146","35","2"

Hands down at the top of my list for couch co-op games. It's so good my wife even begs to play on some days (she is absolutely not a gamer and actually hates games).\n\nA typical day off work for us here at our place:\nInvite some bros over\nWe order pizza\nEat munchies\nStart up broforce...and before you know it -birds are chirping, sun is out, and you have to wake up in 3 hours to go to work - and you don't even care, you had a blast - this is THAT Kind of game...\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. The campaign is a blast. Explosion runs are races that are challenging and fun. Don't even get me started on deathmatch! We all get so competitive, it's crazy. I recommend if you are new to broforce, PLEASE don't spoil the surprise of looking at all the character unlocks. We had fun calling them out and being surprised just by that element alone. Each character has different weapons, grenades and abilities - some extremely more powerful than others, but they are all evenly balanced for deathmatch.\n\nI've even been invited to a really lame party a while back, so I whipped out my laptop from my backpack, hooked up broforce to their flatscreen - ♥♥♥♥ got intense. If you read most of these reviews, they are all trying to be funny, since the theme of the game is democracy, and liberating vietnam, and spreading love for 'murica... however they aren't being very helpful in describing the product. I think i've accurately described one of the best games on the market. This game will make your cheeks hurt from smiling and laughing all night. Expendabros is NOTHING compared to the real deal here... But if you haven't gotten it yet - this is best played with real friends, side by side. I use logitech F310's and they work perfectly. Trust me. Buy this game.","November 24, 2014","true","49.2"," 140 of 144 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","140","144","0","5"

This is the action movie archetype, the reason we sit in cinemas summer after summer—a plotline now so mechanical, that Free Lives went ahead and turned it into a mechanic.\n\nIt’s how every single level of Broforce’s technically endless campaign plays out (a level editor and custom playlists back up the sizeable main game). Like any action movie, the details might alter. Sometimes you’re taking one of those massive, diagonally-moving lifts you only ever see in evil labs rather than grabbing a chopper-lifted ladder, but the effect is the same\n\nIn fact, this is Broforce’s entire design outlook. It pilfers from action movies, and uses their familiarity to build an immediately readable take on the accepted run ‘n’ gun genre—all pixels, enemy screams and one-shot-one-death twitchery.\n\nThe playable "bros" are Broforce's most obvious references. You play as a line-up of real action stars disguised behind increased muscle mass and names with “Bro” clumsily wedged into them. John Rambro, Mr. Anderbro, Broheart. Every one of the game’s tens of characters is pacey, can climb any surface infinitely, and comes with primary, secondary and melee weapons. But they can play totally differently—the brilliance here being that, if you’re au fait with the action film canon, you’ll have a handle on how they’ll work, even before you’ve used them.","October 27, 2015","true","11.3"," 151 of 164 people (92%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","92","151","164","42","3"

The player must fight through the destroyable world and little brown resistance, in order to reach the end, and kill satan himself, before jumping onto a helicopter with explosions behind you.\n\n\n\nWith over 20 playable “Bros” to pick from, all coming from movies or TV in the 80s or 90s, will make any action movie fan wet themselves with nostalgia. Each character has their own special attack and primary weapon, making each one a new experience. “Bros” are unlocked by rescuing a certain number of POW’s; also doubling as lives for the player. Each time a player re-spawns, a new random unlocked character is selected, changing the play style.\n\n\n\nOne major point about the game everyone should be aware of, is the player only has 1 life point. Falling too far, or catching any bullet, will kill you. Thankfully, the enemies have a slow reaction time, and like to shoot very slow bullets; fast enough to kill you, but slow enough to jump out of the way of. The enemy's range from, massive minigun guys, to dogs, to tanks, to typical tanned jungle dwellers. The ingame environment is 90% destroyable, excluding some checkpoints and the end bit.\n\n\n\nBroForce does some things right.\n\n\n\nThe destroyable word adds more fun into the game\n\nThe multiplayer is fantastic\n\nThe characters are fun to play\n\nBroForce doesn't take itself seriously\n\nEach special ability is either useful or funny in some way\n\nMaintains a proper difficulty curve\n\nHas a level editor\n\nVery nostalgic\n\nYou get to kill satan\n\n\n\nBroForce does some things wrong\n\n\nThe levels editor is sometimes buggy\n\nHard to play multiplayer with randoms\n\nRepetitive\n\nStill buggy\n\nSome characters are almost useless\n\nLacks playing cards and achievements\n\n\n\nAll in all BroForce isn't a wonderful game, that being said, it is stupid fun and is damn good. Players can kill many hours blowing things and people up, whether you're American or not. The $16.99(CAD) price tag just isn't justifiable. If its on sale, or you really want to play with friends, pick it up\n","June 3, 2015","true","17.7"," 163 of 186 people (88%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","88","163","186","47","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/274190/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Broforce is a 2D Run and Gun game where you are tasked with bringing freedom to the entire world. At least that is what they claim we are doing, as we blow enemy hideouts to smithereens and fly off into the sunset. To accomplish this we are given control of “Bros” which are all parody characters out of popular films such as Rambro, Bro Hard and Bronan the Brobarian. As you can no doubt tell, this is very much a tongue in cheek type of game. Broforce is centered around fast gameplay, epic guitar riffs and destruction above all else and has very little story to speak of. You and up to three friends can join in on the carnage via drop in, drop out online or local coop to deliver fiery freedom to terrorists. Starting off the game you will have the choice of either picking Campaign or Arcade Mode. They are mostly the same except campaign mode gives you an overworld while arcade is just back to back missions. Then you will be given the choice of normal and hard difficulty. It is suggested to start on normal since hard has faster rates of fire, more enemies and placements designed to annoy you.\n\nAt the start of each mission you are given a random Bro that you have unlocked and must make your way throughout the levels saving new Bros for extra lives. Bros all play differently from one another and each have special attacks. For example one bro may only have his fists and be able to send projectiles back at enemies, while another bro throws dynamite and is able to attract enemies via a cooked turkey with dynamite stuffed into it. There are also differences in speed, strength and range between them, so every Bro requires their own play-style, which makes the repetition in this game feel very minimal. To unlock more characters you have to a certain amount of Bros from their cages. The random nature in which you are given Bros is a double edged sword. On one hand you will not be able to rely on the character you are best at and only play as them throughout, but on the other hand some Bros are just not equipped for the task at hand, which will cause you to die until you are given a Bro more suited to the situation. You can retry a mission as many times as you like so it is a minor issue. Unless you are playing on IronBro mode, a permadeath mode that is unlocked later in the game and makes it so each Bro can live only once, once you lose all Bros it's game over.\n\nTo defend yourself you will have melee, ranged and special attacks. Melee and ranged can be used indefinitely while special attacks usage amount varies from character to character. Strangely enough you can only shoot horizontally, so any enemy above or below you is untouchable via weapon fire until they are on the same plane as you. That is unless you get clever with explosives or special attacks to kill them before they know what hit them. The problem with simply jumping below is that enemies have far greater range than most Bros do, so you have to get in rather close to shoot them. Since you die in a single hit that can be an unnecessarily risky move. This game does require a decent amount of foresight before going in guns blazing. You have to consider if there may be enemies hiding in the grass, if you can take out the enemies before they fire at you and shoot an explosive near you, or if it would simply be better if you punch through a wall and make your own path. There is a pleasant amount to consider before making your move and makes it all the more sweeter when you proudly stand alone in an environment torn apart by an intense battle. That is the perfect time to use the button dedicated to flexing your muscles.\n\nEnemies have quite a bit of variety to them and range from dogs, suicide bombers and even supernatural enemies later on. They all have different means of attack and some are able to take a lot of damage. Terrorists have a certain room in which they will infinitely respawn until you destroy the ground under that door, causing them to all fall to their deaths. Sadly, AI is terrible in this game and enemies are very likely to be the cause of their own deaths. If you are spotted the enemy will just stand there and shoot at the direction he last saw you, over and over again until you kill him. The difficulty comes from the traps, enemy numbers and camera which you have no control over. Once you kill an enemy its corpse will provide cover to his friends behind it until you gib it with a few bullets, while enemy bullets can conveniently pass through the body. The camera is far too zoomed in, causing you to be killed by an enemy that was out of view or getting explosives dropped on your head that you had no way of knowing where there on occasions.\n\nYou will also face multiple vehicles like mechs, helicopters and trucks that spawn enemies from it. Out of all the vehicles you can only hijack the mechs by standing on it and pressing the melee button.  These deal some serious damage to everything it comes across, though its ability to move around is based on a very small fuel supply, so it won't last too long. Your main threats will be the crazy bosses in this game.  The amount of destruction they all cause is staggering and it is a joy to take these down. Some will not just die by shooting at it and will require some outside the box thinking. The overall amount of destruction you will see in this game is truly impressive. Nearly anything can be destroyed and the levels usually end up looking like the planet is imploding in on itself. The only things which can't be destroyed is the ground surrounding the American flag which is used as a respawn point. There is quite a bit of levels to play through on the campaign/arcade. It keeps getting crazier and crazier the further in you go until you are eventually fighting on American soil. What little dialogue there is, is delivered via text and adds nothing to the game. The only difference in campaign mode is the over-world I previously mentioned, where you can fly around and run into seagulls because why not, as well as be able to choose which levels to take on first at times.\n\nTo top it off this game supports custom maps via Steam workshop. These can also be played with friends and are just as enjoyable as the ones found in the main game. They can be downloaded right from in game and can also be saved so you can play them offline. These offer much more value to the game and are quite a few of them already. Great music is something Broforce also has, especially that final ending theme song. With its fast paced gameplay, considerable difference between Bros and various ways to tackle levels, it offers plenty of replay value even without the user made content. Its AI is unimpressive to say the least but there is a ton of fun to be had mowing them down in various ways. All levels are perfectly playable if you end up doing it solo and may even be preferable, so you know exactly what is going on, which can be pretty hard when you have three others blowing up the map. At the end of the day this is a great game that plays like a mix of Metal Slug and an extreme version of Dig Dug.  For those still unsure I highly recommend checking out the free game  The Expendabros  to get a taste of what is on offer. Highly recommended to those that like the genre, want an action packed game or simply want a fun game to play with friends.","October 31, 2015","true","10.3"," 105 of 115 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","105","115","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sacheverell/recommended/274190/","Sacheverell","Sacheverell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sacheverell/","451 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAny game that lets me tear through a horde of bad guys as a Terminator, then lets me tag in Indiana Jones with a high-five for some whip-swinging action, topping the whole thing off with Mister-T pitying a horde of burning fools on his way to the final flag (and red-skinned evil leader), deserves a f**king medal.\n\nEven unfinished, Broforce is everything a platformer game should be: Explosions. Eye-catching graphics. Explosions. Really clever character and weapon designs. Highly satisfying gameplay that just doesn't seem to wear out it's welcome, no matter how many times you blast through a level. It is everything that made 90s action movies great, meshed with everything that made 90s console platformer games great. Die Hard? Demolition Man? A-Team? Contra? If any of those words gave you a nostalgia-boner, then this game is for you.\n\nI don't recommend games very often, because frankly, the latest half-decade of products have been 98% crap. Same old shooters, same old fantasy RPGs, same old everything. This is a refreshing change to the current crop of games, and while it pays homage to a different era of gaming, it does so on its own terms, in its own way.\n\nIf you want to feel like an action hero (or a whole team of them, as the case may be), buy this. If you want to high-five your friend in co-op, buy this. If the idea of bullet-hell or explosions gets you excited, you NEED this game.","April 7, 2014","true","23.4"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","74","80","0","0"

I don't think I will write here anything new above everything else that was already said, but this game fully deserves my +1  and besides, I just couldn't recommend it more.\n\nIt features lots of explosions, varied enemies, fully destructible environment (if you overdo it, you can annihilate everything including your way out) and bros - numerous playable characters that parody popular tough guys or gals from movies. Many of them differ wildly from one another in playstyle, and you get them at random (whenever you die or liberate a captive, the game assigns you one from the set you unlocked).\n\nYou can play alone or co-op with up to 3 friends, both online and locally. And if you have someone over at your house, they can join you anytime - even while you're in the middle of a stage, just hand them a gamepad/ keyboard and press a button - it's that easy. There is no friendly fire (you're not taking damage if a friend shoots you directly), but you can kill your co-op partner nonetheless by environment (boulder to the head after destroying the structures too much) or blow them up by triggering explosives they stand next to. But that's ok - even dying is fun in this game.  :D\n\nEverything is fast paced and humorous. You can approach the stages in a more tactical way, or just jump around like a headless chicken & shoot all over- whichever suits you better. You will most likely die much more following the 2nd approach, but due to the random switching of bros you may luck out at some point and push through to the end while having fun all the way. There is much fun to be had - while the stages don't vary that much some may still surprise you, and the bosses are imaginative as well as challenging, ending is just perfect - completing the campaign feels extremely satisfying.\n\nBroforce is crazy fun & provides pure, unfettered joy. It was simply designed with player enjoyment in mind :)","April 29","true","7.9"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","74","80","8","0"

Start level\n2. Kill about 80 soldiers to get to the last quarter of the level\n3. Stand there, as The Brominator, dismembering every motherf*cker in sight with your minigun.\n4. Don't notice that installation in the tunnel ceiling.\n5. Giant Spinning Saw Blade comes down from the installation and races across the screen, precisely through the middle of where you stand, speeding towards you like furious spidermokey\n\n10/10 Would get brutally eviscerated again\n\n\n*EDIT* I switched on this game last night, with my son, (as we usually do), and asked myself, "Hold the Holy Hell on a minute!! What's this I see?"\n\nI'll tell you what I saw......THE MOTHERF*CKING BRODATOR AS A PLAYABLE BRO!! (That's The Predator, for you uninformed Mooks).....Yeah, that's right, I know you're a Mook and me and my Bros are coming for your ♥♥♥!!  You thought it was bad getting swiss-cheesed by a minigun? Wait until you feel the Force of Freedom, courtesy of a radar that detects enemies and fires lasers at them automatically from an invisible Brodator!!!\n\n**EDIT AGAIN** 410 hours played so far.......I'm trying to remember things from my past but am having difficulty recalling them.  There's one specific item, I'm sure it's a common occurrence but my mind is failing me at this juncture......Yellow.....No, orange.....or was it red?  I remember heat, and a blue surrounding.......and magnifying glasses focusing beams on to unsuspecting and completely expendable insects......What is it called?  Come on, brain, don't fail me just yet.......Oh!  I think I got it!!  For some reason, I have the word "NUS" in my mind!!  I think I remember seeing this "NUS" sometime in my distant past but my memory of it is dwindling with every custom level that I play on Broforce...NUS?  That doesn't sound right?  USN?  No,..But I think I'm close....anyway, I think....Maybe......Yes, I think I need to get out more...\n\n.....I sometimes have this urge that compels me to open the curtains, unlock my front door and stumble into the street, to try and benefit from the effects of this seemingly wondrous and immortal yellow deity that is known as UNS.....or is it a mythical object thought to live in the sky?...I'm sure that most people know what I'm talking about.....unless they're gamers or geeks, of course.  Like me, all they really know is blowing stuff up, stealing cars, using explicit language, destroying enemies and beating bosses, (also tea-bagging on multiplayer when you get the kill......Yeah, I know, that's old-hat now and is mostly seen as boring by Old School gamers.....but so is drawing on people/shaving somebody's hair/eyebrows off when they've passed out due to too much drink/drugs/furious masturbation, that doesn't mean it's any less funny!!)....all in a minimum of 720p.....Although most of us won't settle for less than 1080p, (goes without saying), which the newer consoles play at, but come on, X-Box/Playstation......Took you long enough to catch up, didn't it?  Now you got even more catching up to do since PCs can run at 4K and now utilise G-SYNC, for the most part, anyway   :DLskull: :nahclown: :mdhappy:\n\nAs a whole, we know nothing of these legendary "Daylight Hours".  Ask us what Project Reality was and you'd better be prepared for an enthusiastic lecture lasting several hours, in which we drop some major knowledge bombs on you but talking to us about the hours of 4am-3pm (04:00 - 15:00)?  You might as well be trying to teach an octopus how to order in some Chinese for a Friday night.......I thought I was emulating the rest of the Human Race correctly 5 weeks ago but the yellow object was white instead and all I felt was a chill as I heard the ravenous, wild dogs that roam these parts dart from shadow to shadow behind me, sometimes stopping to listen to a distant howl from the woods, the padding of their paws getting louder and louder and I can almost smell their fetid breath as they close in......then I feel them circling me in the near mist but can't see into the fog, this is Britain, after all, and everybody knows our fogs are thicker than an elephants spunk-out.........I don't think I'll try to find this thing anymore, I shall wonder no more about this daily happening that I once read gives life to so many creatures and plants on this rock, it seems to be an activity fraught with danger and confusion and can only lead to bad things.......So, instead, I think I'll sit at my computer......Oh, look, Broforce has finished updating.....I wonder what they've added this time? More levels?  Updated Workshop items? New enemies? Even more Bros?   I think I'm going to find out......*STARTS LOADING BROFORCE*.........I can't remember the name of that phenomenon again.....damn wossname?....Memory!!...and the colour of the subject has now drifted from my recollection, it's like the last 5 minutes of my life have been completely erased from my mind.......But it's OK, I have Broforce......\n\nNow then, Updates......So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so many updates.  They're regular, sometimes adding content, sometimes just bug fixes, but they're there, you see them frequently and each one does something, unlike some Early Access games who pretend they're doing some major work on the game but in reality are just updating the font used and fixing the size of the in-game text because the 5 people who do actually play the game are squinting like constipated moles when somebody shines a torch across their garden in the middle of the night.  These devs also listen....and I do mean LISTEN.....to what their user-base are saying and they act on it as quickly and as much as they possibly can do.  You definitely get a sense of the devs loving this game as much, or maybe even more than, the 98 (that's NINETY-MOTHERF*CKING-EIGHT!!!) percent of users who rated this unfinished game positively, and this shows in the discussions as they're always on there, either making notes of what they might need to change or replying to users who are stuck with a certain aspect of it.  Questions like,\n\n"I bought Broforce and it won't run on my PC.  I start it, it pops up for a second then closes again.  What's the problem?", to which the correct response is,\n\n"Holy Sh*tting f*ckaduck!!  We didn't know there were still people running RIVA TNT2 graphics cards!!".\n\nAt this juncture. on a semi-serious note, I'd like you, yes YOU, to show me any other Early Access game with a 98% positive rating from 8,000+ reviews, seriously, try and find one.....That's right, you CAN'T!! That alone should tell you how god-damn, mamma-jamma-in', dog's-b*ll*ck's, bee's-knees, badger's-'nadgers and other funny, rhyming animal body parts chuffin' awesome this game truly is.","January 22, 2015","true","604.8"," 107 of 133 people (80%) found this review helpful 120 people found this review funny","80","107","133","120","0"

It is a run and gun platformer that serves as a love letter to action movies. There is a large cast of action heroes from Robocop to Mad Max that all use a variety of moves to help spread freedom across the world. Whether you are going on a chainsaw massacre with Ash williams, yelling like Arnie while creating a swordquake slam as Conan, sending bullets back at enemies as Neo, or pitying the fool as Mr. T, Broforce makes you feel cooler than you actually are.\n\nDestructible environments and force switching characters keeps the experience chaotic, fun, and full of risk-reward situations. Gaining an extra life means that you have to give up playing as Blade and will have to adapt to whatever random bro you turn into next. It would be really easy to just use Macgyver to blow up all these enemies, but doing that would make the next jump up a lot harder. Shooting these explosive barrels will make short work of enemies and open up a new path, but it could also send down deadly debris.\n\nThe main campaign has you steering a helicopter around different parts of the world to help spread freedom through a 12 gauge and explosions. The enemies are satisfying fodder, and there are some nice surprises in the form of mechs, bossfights and aliens, with more still to come. Aside from campaign there is an arcade mode that has you running and gunning with no helicopter navigation in between. There are some very early alpha versions of different race like modes that are fun, but not quite up to par with other Bro modes.\n\nOn the local co-op front, deathmatch is a clear winner. My family and friends all have fun jumping in playing with all of these outrageous action heroes. It's an experience that reminds me of Smash Bros, but with more Bro and gore.\n\nEven though this title is Early Access it has like nothing less than non-stop fun, great polish, and awesome updates since my preorder.\n\nWalking away from explosions, highfiving bros for slow motion, throwing satan off a cliff, disembowling enemies, shouting freedom so loud that it terrifies enemies, and so much more, can all be found in bounty in Broforce.","July 2, 2015","true","87.3"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","57","63","17","0"

All around me were the corpses of enemies who had been killed by the deadly xenomorphs. I stepped through a passageway and was mortally wounded by acid spit. As I laid there, slipping away into the unknown as enemies flanked me on all sides, John Rambro appeared over me and whispered, "I've got this, bro..."\n\nBroforce is a game I've been playing on-and-off for more than a year, and it still manages to entertain and surprise me with its cheesy 80s bravado, constantly-evolving gameplay and a robust custom level community.\n\nUshering players in with an eagle's cry and a gruff military commander with a rockin' mustache barking orders, the game tasks players with infiltrating various Vietnam outposts and cleaning out the enemy resistance, using one of many different heroes who can be unlocked via rescues. These run the gamut from standard 90s action heroes (like Rambo or the Terminator) to female heroines (Ripley, Cherry Darling) to cult favorites like the Boondock Saints or the Rocketeer.\n\nThere really is no plot to speak of, but you won't care anyway because you'll be too busy spamming burning hot American justice into the hearts of faceless goons to care. Every level features a variety of enemies, traps and challenges to keep players on their toes, and the later stages (as of this writing) pit you against massive alien enemies and hordes of rocket-spamming foes.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the game is how fluidly every hero controls, and how many different gameplay mechanics are at work here. Whether it's John Mc-sorry, Bro McClane and Rambro's standard assault rifle spam, Cherry Broling's hover-by-way-of-Princess-Toadstool ability, the Brocketeer's double-jump or the Boondock Bros' AI helper/respawn ability, there's a wealth of ways to complete each level.\n\nThe game is definitely inspired by Contra, and can definitely be punishing in later stages, especially given that while you may have superior firepower, you're about as fragile as tissue paper. Each bro dies in one hit, forcing players to be mindful at times about how many additional lives they have.\n\nThe custom campaign mode is where the game really shines, and what gives it such exceptional replay value. There are a lot of custom maps, ranging from fully-fledged stories to brutally-difficult challenge maps.\n\nThe game is also hilarious when played in co-op or multiplayer mode. I've had the privilege to play this with friends multiple times, and the "rescue a bro, get another player in to help" mechanic works very well. Sometimes it's fun to screw over your friends by blowing out the floor underneath them and letting them fall to their deaths.\n\nBroforce will definitely appeal to anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s and can laugh at the various references and shout-outs to past franchises. Even for an Early Access title, it's very well-made (barring a few bugs every now and again), and is one of the best retro action platformers available on Steam right now.\n\nIf you don't buy it for yourself, do it for America.","September 11, 2015","true","58.8"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","43","48","13","0"
