In one go. TL;DR: it's an enjoyable game with a good story and nice and glossy art.\n\nIt has a few parts that are a bit wonky. I can't speak for the Japanese version, but in the English version there are some bugs occasionally, but I encountered nothing game breaking. Just a couple of instances where character names were displayed without text underneath, but I don't think any of the actual story or dialogue was missing, because I didn't feel like there were any obvious gaps. Most likely it's just a residue of the lengths of the text in the text boxes not matching up in the Japanese and English versions.\n\nAs for the translation itself, it felt pretty solid. I encountered a few spelling and grammatical mistakes, but nothing that made it unreadable or hard to understand. There was also one instance where I felt like something was probably a plot hole, but if it was it wasn't something that undermined anything truly vital to the plot. (Though again, to be clear, this is just speaking from one playthrough of one of the possible routes.) The story was engaging and the ending of the route I picked left me with a lot of interesting things that I can't wait to discover as I unlock more!\n\nThe female characters were more well-rounded than I expected as I started, and I was pleasantly surprised that although they (of COURSE) all end up falling in love with the protagonist, they are still more educated, and written in a way that actually shows it, and more multi-faceted than female characters usually are. Which isn't to say that everything was entirely perfect, some parts of the writing still made me cringe, but A LOT less than usual.\n\nThe art style - especially the more quirky expressions - is really delightful. It kind of looks a bit like Kaen has stuffed a pillow over her bust, and I question Fuma's fashion sense with nothing underneath the vest immensely, but hey. I bet we've all seen worse.\n\nAnd finally - though I doubt that there will be too many who cares about this: A DIABETES MENTION THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE AND/OR DIRECTLY MISINFORMED AND STEREOTYPED!! HOLY CRAP!!!","April 6","true","16.5"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","36","37","0","0"

I can say this visual novel was very enjoyable.\n\nNeedless to say this novel really is quite a gem. There are many moments where the storyline will get you to think on a deeper end, and by that it may cause a headache in a sense. (Ever been in an existential crisis? Yea...)\n\nDespite such things. the VN really does have a lot of deep quotes that may take to your philosophical and/or psychological liking.\n\nFor instance. (One of my favourites from this VN.)\n"A person dies twice. First, when their physical body dies. The second is when everyone in this world forgets they ever existed."\n\nEach character has a very likeable uniqueness to them.\n\nI absolutely love the artwork and style, though I do feel there could've been more content.\nMusic is great, however it feels limited.\n\nTL;DR: Great VN, can really get philosophical. 8/10\nCrude TL;DR: It's an absolute mindâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.","April 27","true","9.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This review is based on my first 4 hours with it. ::\n\nCampus Notes - forget me not is a Visual Novel that lacks in execution but fills in it's gaps with Charm, sometimes. It has a fever dream of a story, often times trying to jump above it's own heights with attempted profundity, and it lacks proper grounding and drama. All of the characters have character, but they're never really developed, at least up to the point I got.\n\nAll in all, it's worth the admission price for visual novel fans, but that's in spite of it's content instead of because of it. I really hope that 4th Cluster continue to make games, since this game, it's characters and story, had a lot of potential than came to surface here.","April 7","true","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/recommended/435360/","SnowonHokkaido","Â¤ Queen of Doughnuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/","183 products in account","TL;DR\nwell researched, story driven Visual Novel with attention to details and at least 4 different endings. characters feel alive and choices do affect the game, cliffhangers will get you hooked and the music is tolerable (this coming from a metalhead!). Buy it for the story, a nice fresh wind for this genre\n\nLong review\nI recently started picking up Visual Novels again, and this is by far one of the best currently available on Steam, for the following reasons:\n\nArt and music\nThe art is certainly amazing; the characters don't appear too cute or overly sexualized (like some other games on Steam here ehem...); the art has obviously been influenced by Anime. Hence, if you don't like this, don't buy this game.\n\nIn addition to that, the soundtrack is OK. It's not played in a loop and I actually enjoyed listening to the OST. Don't expect Hatsune Miku or JPop, the music is really fine\n\nReading the VN\nThe text aims to create the impression of an actual novel. There's not just one sentence per "page" displayed, the pages are filled with actual paragraphs, which is definitely a plus since the developers really put  their thoughts into their game. You may need to take breaks though since you may not be used to the font. I certainly needed to get used to reading that much on a screen again (old fashioned me, IKR)\n\nThe content\nThe story is very good for a VN, it will get you hooked with some nice cliffhangers here and there, and it is not too predictable which seems to be a common problem among some titles on Steam here. A lot of details have been added and every choice usually adds a different junk of dialogue. I was suprised since the developers really did their home work and researched historical facts and added ancient tales not related to Japan. The plot is somewhat serious, and this is certainly not a comic version. Expect daily lives of college students and Sci/Fi. It was definitely interesting to me.\n\nAlso, the game has a very nice feature some other games seriously lack: choices. I'm mentioning this because a lot of games have been tagged with "choices", but the choices don't change the overall play style. In this game, you can get slightly different outcomes depending on your choices (dialogue) and these choices also influence what the characters say while the story itself is mostly linear. In addition, you can get different endings which heavily influence some of the content. You'll need to read carefully.\n\nBut what's most important are the loveable characters who have been equipped with a lot of personal and emotional details. The characters appear real, very real, and depending on your choices, they can show surprising development. Don't just pick your favourite yet, they'll surprise you.\n\n\nSome minor negative remarks:\nThe game does not offer voice acting, you need to actually read the lines, so if you are used to LISTENING, you may be disappointed. The FONT is tiny and may prove difficult to read, whereas some achievements are a bit too easy to guess in my opinion (if you're an achievement hunter that may annoy you)\n\nIf you're looking for my Tl;dr, scroll up. Cheers!","April 26","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
