The gameplay and the artistic style do not go well together.  If you start screwing up, then you miss out on the cool sound effects and music, which are the reasons I play this game.  However, the art/effects/music are super distracting and make it harder to play.  I mean, fair enough, adds to the challenge.  The part that gets me, though, is that the learning curve is extremely steep.  When coupled with long stages, I just sit here going, yeah, I couldn't have learned how to do that in the time I was offered (because the game does a very bad job of teaching you of the upcoming mechanics), so I lose and then I have no interest to play again because the stages are so long.  It's just a massive snowball effect.\n\nIt would help if the graphics weren't so distracting to the gameplay.  Maybe I'm just getting old -- I mean, I am, so that's true -- but I have a really hard time following what the hell is going on.  I can barely discern between incoming attacks and attacks I've already deflected, I can't see some of the blocks sometimes due to their color, and I have a pretty hard time discerning where the hell some of the attacks are going to land.  There's a part in the second stage where many attacks come in, all of which are the same color, and they're bouncing off the sides.  If it wasn't so late into the stage I could probably pick up on it, but I just lose interest.  It's pretty poor design, in my opinion, and that just annoys me.\n\nI boot it up every few months because I think it'll be different; I really do like the music, but I don't get to experience it because I suck.\n\nSo yeah, if you suck at this game you're just going to have a bad time lol.  I totally dislike this one because Im not good at it and I'm not willing to try to get better.  The flaws irritate me and turn me off.\n\nBut yeah, check it out.\n\nOh, but the menus in that game suck.  Click and it sends a ball/block thing.  Wait a fullish second for it to hit your paddle before the thing actually goes through!  And if it misses then you don't go into whatever you selected.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/63700/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","BIT.TRIP BEAT is actually a really cool rhythm game.  I wasn't expecting much  with this title, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's quite addictive, and the difficulty is there as well.  The basic concept is kind of like pong, where you hit little dots with your pattle as they come flying toward you, but as the level progresses and the beat gets more intense the patterns the dots come at you increase in difficulty.  There are all sorts of neat effects, like disappearing, dots that freeze your pattle, double time, pattle shrink, bouncing dots, etc.  It's a lot of fun; however, the levels are extremely long, and if you end up losing, it takes forever to get back to the position you were at when you "died".  This is unfortunate, because it really discourages you from playing again.  So, although it's addictive, it's really only good for pick up and play gaming.\n\nThat said, the sound quality and gameplay this game offers is extremely high, just try the "Test" level on the main menu (which is a Portal reference) and you'll see what I mean.  But, while we're on that topic, the menus are needlessly complex and quirky. When you click on an item, a dot crosses the screen and you have to bounce it off your pattle to enter that submenu.  It's eye rolling, but that's really the only complaint, besides the length of the levels, that I have.\n\nPros:\n\nAddictive and fun gameplay\nHigh sound quality\nGood as far as rhythm games go\n"Test" level is awesome\n\nCons:\n\nSoundtrack and level design can get lengthy and repetitive\nStupid main menu design\n\nI would recommend grabbing this title.  I think it's unique and great for pick up and play gaming.  Nice for a 10 minute game, much like a Shmup is.

A series of rhythm games that originated on the Wii. As a result, the collection of games haven't really gotten the attention they so rightfully deserve. For what their simplistic controls and Atari style aesthetic hide is a treasure trove of unparalleled immersion and emotion.\n\nBit.Trip Beat is the beginning of the Bit.Trip Saga. The opening cutscene reveals that the mascot has been born and...well it's very abstract. Needless to say, It's the gameplay that is unique. At first glance, it appears to be pong. Just a paddle on the left and blocks coming from the right. But if you hit that block (called a "Beat"), the game makes a tone that actually goes in time with the music. And once that beat hits the right side of the screen, another tone is made, also in time with the music. Okay, this is pretty cool, I thought as I maneuvered the paddle up and down with the mouse to hit the beats back. And then I hit enough to rank up. The beats changed tone, they were more crisp and less chiptune and more electric. I "leveled up" into what is apparently Mega. The game has three modes of play: Hyper, Mega, and Nether. Hyper is where you start, and is where you start in every bit.trip game. Mega is one step higher with a less chiptune sounding aesthetic and more flashy animations. Miss enough beats and you will enter back into hyper. continue to miss beats and you will enter nether, a black and white realm that sound like the heart rate monitors in hospitals. if you miss enough in Nether, you lose and you have to restart the level. And for levels that last roughly 15 minutes and NO checkpoints, it is quite devastating to lose. But you just want to get back! That is the allure of Bit.trip. they are all difficult, but they are so much fun to play. When you enter Nether, you start to race. Feeling lost as if you are slipping. Few games can get this kind of urgency but this game, as well as its sequels, master this.\n\nAs you play, you start to think  you mastered the game. but then, the game just decides to throw in a new beat that you've never seen before. I personally like the final level. Some of the things that happen in that stage are pretty cool and I'll let you guys find out. All in all, this game is certainly worth the price tag. Get the soundtrack with it as well, you won't regret it.","February 23, 2014","true","2.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/63700/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","BIT.TRIP BEAT is the first of the BIT.TRIP games, a rhythm game in which you play as the left paddle attempting to prevent any pixels from passing you, loosely based off Pong. The pixels (hereafter referred to as "beats") travel from the right side of the screen to the left, in time with the music. Some behave uniquely depending on their color, and the player's score increases depending on how many beats in a row they are able to hit. Once you've hit a certain number without having missed a certain number, you'll move into a higher "mode" which has flashier graphics and higher scoring. Similarly, once you've missed a certain number without having hit a certain number, you'll go to a lower "mode" with more plain graphics, eventually losing altogether.\n\nIt's an excellent game, but can be rather difficult at times - there are no checkpoints mid-song, so much of the game relies upon memorization of patterns, and being able to anticipate what is coming up next via the music. That being said, there is a visceral pleasure at completing a particularly difficult part sufficiently to allow you to proceed further in the level - if you enjoy rhythm games, this is one of the best and should not be missed.","February 17, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElfRanger/recommended/63700/","ElfRanger","Erikel elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElfRanger/","190 products in account","When I got this game from the Bit.trip Collection which was £2.99 on sale, I was not expecting much. But this game is absolutely amazing and I would call it my favourite Indie Game of all time. The concept is simple. You control a paddle and are tasked with repelling beats coming from the right side of the screen. Seems easy right? Well the game is far from it. It took me around 15 tries to complete the 3rd and last level Growth. The 2 main things I find good about this game is the astounding soundtrack which makes me glad the soundtrack was included in the collection. From the slow beautiful rhythm of Transition to the fast and epic music of Descent to the final climatic music of Growth, this game had me listening to the songs over and over again. In fact I am listening to the soundtrack right now. The other thing is the fair but tough difficulty of the game. Usually I get frustrated at hard games but this one just made me feel more determined to win next time every time I lost. My favourite part of this game is one of the parts which is most criticized. The end game boss. When I first saw the last boss I thought it was just a simple game of Pong and would be easy. Yet again the game proved me wrong with a tough as nails last boss that showed no mercy. I lost again and again and again but I just kept coming back to the fight determined to see this game through to the end. Imagine it like this. You are at the bottom of a deep well, so deep not even the smallest ray of light can be seen. Somehow you just know there is a climbable path to the top, almost impossible to traverse but that small glimmer of hope keeps you determined. You traverse the path cautiously almost falling several times but somehow managing to regain balance. As you climb up the well becomes more illuminated and more hope fills you until you reach the top. But standing there is another person who's only objective is to push you back down to the bottom. You underestimate the person and after a brief struggle you fall all the way to the bottom. Determined not to give up you yet again start climbing up the well. Eventually like before you reach the top but this time you put as much effort as you can to escaping the well and defeating that person. You fight with all your might and a fiery fury and eventually...lose. You fall back to the bottom but no way are you just going to stay here wallowing in self pity forever. You furiously climb the well again and again and again but fall back down again and again and again despite your best efforts. Then after many attempts just as you are about to fall during a battle with the person you give one last push and emerge victorious. You feel like you just won an impossible battle and won despite impossible odds. There is no feeling greater than the feeling of success you felt at that moment. That is the best way I can describe winning Bit.trip Beat. I hope the rest of the games in the series are just as brilliant as this one. I highly reccomend this and assure you it is definitely worth it to feel these amazing feelings.","December 4, 2014","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The levels are pretty long, the music isn't too offensive, and there's plenty of variety given the fact that the gameplay is basically breakout/pong.\n\nThe BAD:\n\nI guess this game was designed for Wii motion controls. The mouse response feels pretty imprecise and twitchy, even after quite a bit of tweaking, which makes the game a bit frustrating.\n\nAlso, the flashing backgrounds frequently get too much in the way of gameplay, which creates an element of "artificial difficulty" that really shouldn't be necessary.\n\nFinally, I'm getting lag/slowdown on a fairly high end system, which points to bad/sloppy porting or maybe a game programmed in Flash or something...\n\nOverall, I generally never recommend games where "artificial difficulty" in the form of poor control, bad design and bad porting (lag in low-end games on a high end system), so I unfortunately can't recommend this one at all.","February 23, 2014","false","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Think of it as a pong game on steroids with an amazing soundtrack that interacts with events in the game. If this game looks difficult, it should, because it is. Many playthroughs will be needed to get through all three levels and great concentration will be needed to master all three. Normally games that have extremely high difficulty are plagued with being just that. A game that is extremely difficult but other than that there is no substance or goal to work toward. That is what separates this game from every home made game that is meant for nothing more than to test your patience. As difficult as the game is, there is so much charm that oozes out of this game to keep you coming back. The music like I said is absolutely amazing. It never gets old, and is always exciting when you progress to the next stage in the level, and the music gets more frantic. There's nothing more terrifying to let beats slip by you and hear that massive knock that lets you know you messed up. Miss too many and you get knocked down to a lower score multiplier. Miss even more and get knocked back into the 70's with a lifeless black and white screen with no other sounds than beeps. Fail to recover out of this will break you, then game over. Unlike most difficult games, this one gives you a chance to recover and stay in the game and it does it so well. Each level has an end boss and it is so satisfying to watch them blow up when you defeat them, because they are not easy either.\n\nI own this game on the Wii where it was originally released, and while I love the Wii version, the PC version really has a huge advantage with the mouse controls vs. the Wiimote controls. The mouse control makes it much easier to keep your paddle steady and makes movements more precise. When playing on the Wii I can only make it through a quarter of the way through on level 3. On the PC version I almost made it to the boss. A bad thing about the PC version is that I have to run this game in windowed mode or else I get some mean lag in the controls when running full screen. Not sure why this is, but it's not a massive deal. Once you start playing the game, there won't be any time to look anywhere else on your computer.","December 28, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Immediately after launching the game, players are treated to a retro art style not unlike older Atari games. The game boasts bright, solid colors and blocky sprites, even with the fonts and most of the background decorations. There are some 3d objects in the game world, but they aren't as detailed and also sport a voxel look to keep in theme with the retro style sprites. Since this is partly a rhythm game, the music plays a big role and is also outstanding while fitting the retro theme. Beeps are heard when hitting back balls in time to the music. The music for each level is more or less fits the electronic genre and acts as a backing track. When the game is played well, the beeping sounds combine with the level music to sound like a cross between chiptune and general electronic music. In addition, the menu music and credits are handled by a guest artist known for making purely chiptune tracks, and they are also very catchy when put into this game.\nThe gameplay is really just Pong with some extra difficulty thrown in. At first you are just hitting blocks back with a simple pattern. However, the game starts throwing in blocks that move differently. Then, it starts putting in so many blocks at once that players have to hit without missing. Hitting each block makes a note, which helps in trying to deduce the pattern of blocks headed your way along with making this a rhythm game that plays like Pong. Bosses are at the end of each level, which tend to throw blocks to hit back like in the majority of the level or also imitate other old Atari games. Part of the difficulty lies in the background and graphical effects being somewhat distracting at times, making it easy to miss when something bright or flashy suddenly appears.\nYes, there is a story in this game and series. It is really confusing but it's told throughout the Bit.Trip series. Let's just say there's a person called Commander Video and he's in this one. The cutscenes are a breather from the game action, but don't make as much sense as the trippy backgrounds when playing each level.\nThe game may feel pretty easy at first with the first level being a decent but doable challenge. Once the second level is reached, most players will have trouble with one of the ball patterns and end up losing the level. The game is a whole is short with times of less than 5 hours for the entire game being not uncommon, but each of the three levels take anywhere from 10-15 minutes and each level must be done all at once. Losing a level forces you to do the whole level all over. This game is definitely difficult, but rewarding once players get the pattern for each level down and know the level by heart. Thus, it may take some time replaying levels to memorize what to do in each level.\nBit.Trip Beat brings some retro styled but modern video game action with great chiptune music. The gameplay is essentially like Pong, with blocks that move in different ways and sometimes en masse. The game can get very difficult, which can be a deterrent. By playing levels over and over to know the pattern for each level, the game gets fun with the graphics and music looking great and sounding fantastic.","July 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It just seemed interesting.  On the Wii, it is in all honesty, probably my most played game (keep in mind I've played and 100%ed SSBB at least four times).\n\nI don't really know how to describe a game like this.  I guess I'll start here: BIT.TRIP BEAT is one of the most intense rhythm games you will ever play.  It combines great 8-bit melodies with an uber-hard version of pong you play to the song.  The BIT.TRIP franchise in its own is very difficult.  Every game is a rhythem game that may actually drive you to rage.  Oh, did I forget to mention how hard these games are?  Let's just say it's somewhere between EVE Online difficulty, Dark Souls difficulty, and Super Hexagon difficulty.\n\nThe only real problem I have with it is the controls.  First, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND not using the keyboard; use the mouse or controller.  Also, I wouldn't recommend a laptop's touch pad to substitute for a mouse.  I personally like playing it with the Wiimote, but that's probably just me.\n\nRatings-\n\nGame Design-8/10\nGraphics-8.5/10 (for 16-bit, you have to admit it's pretty damn good.)\nSoundtrack-8/10\nReplay Value-6/10\n\nFinal Verdict-7.6/10\nRecommended buy price-$2.50 USD, or buy with the BIT.TRIP franchise pack.","January 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's actually pretty deep. Message me if you want to know it, or ask a dev or something. It's hard to find it online) of Commander Video as he takes down evil through various forms.  So, on to Beat itself\n\nBeat has 3 levels, like every Bit.Trip game, and is as challenging as all of them. In this game, you take the form of a line that looks like a pong paddle, and you hit "beats", blocking them from going past and sending them back. The game starts off slow, but quickly picks up speed. It's pretty challenging, especially when you try to get a perfect score or go to the highest difficulty. If you're on the verge of buying this, I would say go buy it, odd are you will like it. Now, in the PC version, you control yourself using the mouse to move up and down, and it moves pretty smoothly, but make sure you dont have a crap mouse. In the Wii version, you make your paddle horizontal and tilt it forward and back, which is pretty good, but it's hard to go from PC to Wii, or vice versa. However, if you liked the Wii version and wanna grab it on here, I would recommend it. It also has a mini level that is portal themed, which is cool.\n\nFor the Bit.Trip series reviews, I will make a review for both the PC version and the Wii version, since sometimes they don't have the same scores (See my CORE review).\n\nSO, final Scores:\n\nWii- Pretty fun game, can be hard to tilt your controller JUUUUUUSt right, but still a fun game! 7.8/10\nPC- Pretty fun game, not as hard to get it just right, but then again, your mouse could suck. 8/10\nBit.Trip Complete- Check my CORE review for more about the game. 9/10","January 2, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game could have been so much better instead its a one dimision note. Yeah its great the first time you hear it but after hearing the same tune its get super old fast. Basically you smash balls against a backdrop of rotating colors designed to confuse and make you miss.\nOk there is an easy mode that made the game a lot more playable. Still think its missing something. There is a boss battle and there are cutscenes.\n\nThe game is still kind of boring.","June 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I managed to play the demo of this and I was quite impressed and made me want for more, but unfortunately I didn't have space on my Wii for this game.\n\nI was glad to discover that the game was ported to Steam, so once it was on sale I inmediately snatched it and I wasn't dissapointed.\n\nMy only complains are that it's a very short game and it can get very frustrating. Also, those who are epileptic should not play this. Other than that, it's a very entertaining game that combines very well retro-ish music, colorful pixel graphics and Pong style gameplay, and even with the short duration, those who want to go for the achivements and high scores may get some replay value out of this or maybe just go back and repeat a level just like you would do with a song.","August 17, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is much more forgiving that bit.trip runner in that you can miss some of the blobs without failing. If you miss too many you go into a black and white mode that allows you a second chance. However I still did not like this game at all. There is no fun in it, you have to be far too tense and precise when playing the game to get any enjoyment from it. The only good thing about bit.trip runner was the audio and visuals but this game you are not given chance to appreciate them as you have to focus too hard on the left hand edge of the screen and even when you do allow your eyes to wander the visuals are uninspiring.

The game takes some getting used to because while the mechanics are dead simple the patterns sometimes give little warning and the background visuals are specifically designed to distract your attention.  Seriously, the distraction is so bad that the game literally can produce eye strain as you struggle to keep up with the flow patterns of incoming balls.  There are also elements of the game which aren't easily understood such as how the game penalizes you for missing beats (ball hits).  The music is entertaining and the visuals are exciting enough that this is probably a better game to watch someone else play than to actually *BE* the player.   In fact, Tracy's comment on watching me play was that this would be the perfect game to stone out to.","July 7, 2011","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering the standard sale price, you might think there would be a lack of content.\n\nOh, how wrong you'd be.

If you do well, the music picks up a few more instruments, and becomes more pleasant to listen to, and more things start happening on the screen. The flashier graphics actually make the game the game more difficult, though. If you do poorly, the music will get worse and the graphics become simpler, making the game easier. If you're close to losing, the game will drop into black and white, with the music just reduced to the beat. This is the sort of game that is be much more interesting to watch if played by a master.\n\nI love the elegance of this game. The controls are very simple, which really lets the rhythm gameplay shine. The game is difficult, and most of that difficulty comes from having to move the paddle quickly and precisely. (Actually, this game was originally on Wii, and the motion controls made this game a lot easier to play.) This game does get pretty frustrating, especially because if you're stuck on a certain part, you have no option except for playing the section until you memorize it. This game's other problem is that there actually isn't a whole lot of content. The game is only as long as it is because you're unlikely to get through without dying many times.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend BIT.TRIP BEAT as a short, but fun experience. Fans of music games and of older games are more likely to enjoy it. It's not a must-play, so wait until it goes on sale.","July 3, 2011","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you do well, the music picks up a few more instruments, and becomes more pleasant to listen to, and more things start happening on the screen. The flashier graphics actually make the game the game more difficult, though. If you do poorly, the music will get worse and the graphics become simpler, making the game easier. If you're close to losing, the game will drop into black and white, with the music just reduced to the beat. This is the sort of game that is be much more interesting to watch if played by a master.\n\nI love the elegance of this game. The controls are very simple, which really lets the rhythm gameplay shine. The game is difficult, and most of that difficulty comes from having to move the paddle quickly and precisely. (Actually, this game was originally on Wii, and the motion controls made this game a lot easier to play.) This game does get pretty frustrating, especially because if you're stuck on a certain part, you have no option except for playing the section until you memorize it. This game's other problem is that there actually isn't a whole lot of content. The game is only as long as it is because you're unlikely to get through without dying many times.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend BIT.TRIP BEAT as a short, but fun experience. Fans of music games and of older games are more likely to enjoy it. It's not a must-play, so wait until it goes on sale.","July 3, 2011","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you haven't you should still give this game a whirl as it is one of the most enjoyable "Rhythm" games to date.\n\nBit.Trip Beat is what you would call "Pong with Levels, Kick-♥♥♥ Music, and easy to learn controls and objectives." The music in this game is very satisfying and getting combos of consecutive hits rewards you with more tones in the music. I enjoyed my time playing this game and I think that many other people would enjoy playing this game as well. It's rather short, but when playing on higher difficulties it makes getting combos in order to stay alive tantamount to trading in training wheels to driving a rocket power bicycle.\n\nIt's hard, very hard, but knowing that you can hit the "bits" makes it even more exciting. The mechanics are basically Pong/Breakout but the balls, which I call "bits," are expertly placed and paced throughout the levels. Each level is just a bunch of patterns with a boss that changes things up a bit at the end of the level. The game takes about an hour to an hour and a half to beat but is still enjoyable. If you want a rhythm game that just requires the mouse and all your concentration this game is hard to pass up.\n\nEither way, if you want something to chill out to after a long day or something that is very frustrating; this game has it for you. I enjoyed my time with the game and it's hip beats and I hope you do too.\n","November 21, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately the only case that is evident, is that though it seems to pride itself on likening itself to the games of eld, Bit.Trip Beat just doesn't stand up, isn't consistent enough, and constantly sucks joy out of the game in it's punishment design.","October 2, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you miss too many, you get sent to a gray purgatory kind of "last chance" area where if you still can't hit the pixels, then you lose. The problem is, I like the gray puragtory area because I can at least see the pixels to hit back without being distracted. After a while, fun turns to frustration.

This is my Wii-based review.\n\nThis is basically a clever pong that encourages perfect play, as there are only 3 (?) stages.  Each stage is fairly long and set to music, which bouncing back the oncoming projectile dots adds tones to.  Each stage builds difficulty fairly strongly, and there isn't too much replayability beyond a perfect scoring.\n\nThere's a minor semblance of story to the BIT.TRIP series but nothing much to get invested in.  The Wii version used tilting to control the paddle, I imagine the mouse makes precision fairly easy in this version.\n\nIts an okay experience for cheap, honestly, there just isn't much depth to it.","November 25, 2013","false",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think most of my playtime will be idling for the card drops.  And getting a potato back when the potato sack thing was a thing.

It's a decent pong-based rhythm game with a cool soundtrack, but it gets repetitive pretty quick. Worse, the screen is usually way too busy to tell what's going on with a high degree of accuracy and the game includes *way* too many bright flashing effects for anyone with even with the slightest light sensitivity to enjoy pain-free. I know that I had a lot of trouble playing it without getting migraines, and many friends I showed it to complained of similar issues. This ends up creating a game that isn't really based on skill so much as it's based on your eye's ability to not freak out when exposed to all the lights.
