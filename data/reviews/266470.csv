Plenty of Mech variations and weapons. I had no problem climbing in and doing battle. The missions are well made and full featured, and the bots play well. Not bad for early access. I'm sure they'll be adding stuff and tweaking the hell out of it in the coming months. I'm looking forward to when we can form squads and track stats and have an effect on the war. Then this game will become really great.","July 22, 2014","true","68.2"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

If you are looking for a solid Mechwarrior-like combat, this game can give you that. There are things that need polishing. However, the downside is that you can hardly find people to play with due to the soft launch. Devs are fixing things and will do a proper launch soon.\n\nTo top it off, it is a Team vs Team, heavy mech combat. You cannot skate around super fast and do crazy manuever like Armored Cored's mech. Your mech is basically a tank with legs, so no fancy movements.\n\nYou build your mech from several chasis(will be adding in the future updates), put on the weapons and equipments. To balance the fight smaller chasis is faster, but less armor, and carry lighter equipments. Bigger chasis is slower, but tougher, more armomr, heavier weapons, however, loadout comes down to the battle points, you cannot just put anything in there, it is limited by battle points for each mech, and different mech will have different points.\n\nThe combat itself is fun, especially with another player. There is AI support for both single and multiplayer match, but it is not that smart, however, they do there jobs well, especially when they are with players. Combat will be tactical to certain points that you need to manage your weapons, you can fire all weapons at once or as a selective group, which can be set in the hangar. Weapons have its effective range, some can easily overload your system, and some weapons' projectile do travel the distance, so they can be dodged.\n\nThere may be claims that it takes too long to take down a mech, which is not true if you know what you are doing. Your mech (as of the current build) has 3 parts, torso, and 2 legs, and around 7-8 additional parts depending on your loadout. These parts have their own HP, so if you just shoot at every part, not just particular part. It will take a while to take down a mech. Mechs can be take-down by destroying their bodies, or both of their legs.\n\nold:\nNice and Solid Gameplay despite the EA release, but the Soft Launch is killing it slowly.","July 24, 2014","true","10.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

I have found playing just a short while that I can see some potential in this game. Being in an Australian timezone I feel it will be a long time before I can play online with the dedicated servers due to ping and player numbers, so I am restricted to Single player. However the beauty of this game is if I can get enough friends interested, I can run my own dedicated server.\n\nThe fact this game even has that mode is GREAT, it adds much more variety & options then the drudgery that is playing MWO, or Hawken.\n\n"SO FAR" the devs are showing interest in the community feedback so far which is great, if they can keep that up, that will help them a long way.\n\nThe graphics aren't phenomal, though respectable, the gameplay mechanics work, though do need a lot of work, and the devs are stated that is part of their plan which is good. The overall Vision the developers have for this game is very good, its just a matter of whether they are able to get there.\n\nIf you just consider this a Speccie stock purchase, and play a bit now and then and provide feedback it will hopefully help the Devs get this game to where they want.","July 23, 2014","true","14.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

The game just went live today but already you can see a lot of cool things happening in regards to giving you that stompy mech experiance that has been missing all these years. It's also really nice that there are both online and offline options so you can play against other players or try out different mech configs on your own. So overall while its a bit rough around the edges, so far so good :)","July 22, 2014","true","2.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","1"

However I was only there for the mechs, and the game did have a few mechs for you to play with.  Basically there's 4 default mechs that fall into the light to heavy catergories, then you have the option to build your own mech.  Now I know at this point you're probably drooling, but the options are limited.  Basically you pick a chasis, and you;ll be using the same chasis as one of the defualts, so there isn't a lot of variety there.  4 chasis, which you can customize the paint, camo, stickers, and logos on, then you get to add some weapons to your mech's hardpoints.  Each chasis has its own base armor rating as well as speed, and point level.  So everything you add onto your mech costs points, and adding extra armor will take points and reduce your overall speed.\n\nWeapon types are very vanilla, gatling guns, lasers, rockets, flamethrowers, nothing out of the ordinary or jaw dropping for that matter.  However you can still customize quite a bit, trying to create that perfect battle mech.  I go with low overload weapons, usually gatling guns, gatling lazers, and maybe a rocket pod so I can spam my opponet.  Most players I saw were using the railguns and after a few shots would overload their weapons then stand around like an idiot while they waited for their weapons to cool down.\n\nYour mech has several hit locations on them, each with its own raiting.  So your opponent, or you, can prioritize certain parts.  For me and my mech Tiny Savage, I circle my opponet and target the legs, once the legs go you'll have a hard time being able to turn effectively, then I just keep running circles and blast away.  Or you could knock out a certain weapon system, or just shoot at whatever part of the mech you feel like.  Just note that once your cockpits health gets low, you'll start to seem some distortion going on, and you'll have a hard time seeing things.  If this happens, or your mech has taken a beating, just find your nearest repair center which will have combat ready in no time.\n\nI will say that the AI is dumb, like dumb as a bag of rocks.  Often times they will just run to a location and stand there the entire game.  Other times they'll take a certain amount of damage and immediately stop fighting and run back to their base to try and repair themselves.  Matches can take a while to complete, especially attrition, because somehow those ticket counters never seem to go down fast enough.\n\nOverall I would suggest that you check this game out, especially if you're a fan of mechanized combat, but I'd wait and see if this thing goes on sale, because the $19.99/$14.99 I spent was a bit much for an early access game that doesn't have a whole lot of content in it. All things considered though, its a good game, and its fun, I put 76 minutes into without even realizing it. So 7/10 mostly for the lack of mech types available, and the terrible AI, however I expect all of that to be fixed once this game launches fully.","April 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There's four chassis on which you can load weapons, armour and tools, from really light scout-like vehicles that are hard to hit to slow, lumbering hulks bristling with hurt and thick armour.\nThe style is very different to Lore, being less twitch and more tactics, but you can tell they're both Dark Horizons games.

No tutorial that I could find, and although there is a bot option in Instant Action, other players do join pretty quick.  I guess just check the key bindings and figure it out.  It's not too bad of a learning curve.\n\nThe game plays pretty good.  The lightmechs are real fast, the heavy mechs slow, though with 3rd person view only (for now - develepers stated working on cockpit view) and crazy jump jets it sometimes feels like you're piloting a figurine on a tabletop not a multi ton mech.  It has some large, wide open levels and I've had some pretty intense battles.\n\nThere is a decent selection of pre made Mechs, some you'll even reckognize form Battletech or Mechwarrior.  They all have different capabilities and the developrs have done a good job making some feel and handle very different, some refinement is needed.\n\nThe graphics are right now fairly rough but I expect texture updates eventually.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for arcade type combat in mechs try it out, I  imagine after some updates the controls might turn a bit more.....realisitic?  Is that possible in a fictional game?  Anyway, hopefully you get what I'm trying to say.\n\nIf you love giant mech games and know what buying early aceess can mean and the risks involved (such as games never being finished or taking radical turns and not being the same game you bought) then I recommend it, as it's on sale (or was) and 5$ is decent to support the developrs.\n\nIf not a huge fun but a moderate fan, or missed the sale, it might be worth waiting to see the game in a more polished state before decding to support it or not, and you might get another sale in the meantime.\n\n6.5/10 at full price, 7.5/10 on sale........for the time being\n\nMaybe I'll see you on the battlefield!","September 22, 2014","true","2.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","3"

There are a ton of dev sponsored events but they usually have quite a few players and the one i was able to make it to was extremely fun. Expecting ea games that are niche to have large playerbases is a false perception that is probably influenced by ea titles like dayz or rust that have very large playerbases skewing the fact most ea games just dont draw that many people no matter how good they are. these are mostly indie devs without large marketing budgets.\n\nThis game has the framework to be great. There are, in my opinion, certain mechanics missing that would make the game more dynamic and fun, i.e. rocketjumping on the ground, so like ac3 being able to boost for a short time to gain some speed and be a dodging mechanic all in one. The sniper rifles and long range weapons are a great start to make this game go in the direction the devs seem to want (from my experience so far) as a more militaristic, average pased mech game relying on positioning, aim, and teamwork.\n\nNot to mention, the devs on this game, unlike many many ea titles, actually listen to and respond to the playerbase. I mean the real intention of ea is to help developers develop and finish the game youre purchasing....right? Ive mentioned a few ideas to the devs so far, and i wont say I had anything to do with them adding it in, but for example the long range weapons i suggested a few months ago, well guess what? They put it in the game! And its a really great addition. In my opinion this factor alone makes this game well worth a measly fifteen dollars.\n\nThis game will grow over time, with the cockpit views, more and more weapons and mech types, more customization of the mechs themselves, better ai, better graphics (already looking really sharp with the shader changes), and of course, the soon to be redmund favorite of faction wars. I havent been this excited for the future of an ea title in a long time.\n\nSure there arent many people in servers very often, but I mean Im not sure what youd expect from an ea game like this. Plus the devs come from a background of writing backends for netcode of games with other studios (i might be wrong on the terminology) gives me great confidence that MP play will be stable and lag/choke free in the future, especially when your faction might lose their last territory from a missle lagging and winning someone a match.\n\n10/10 must buy for mech lovers.","August 20, 2014","true","65.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Anway, currently there is a little bit of customization, and big explosions. Would buy again.","September 9, 2014","true","33.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I'm a huge mech warrior fan and this isn't far enough along yet. I bought it to help support them. I'm mainly interested in SP.  Not much there and the graphics are twitchy, the anti alaising doesn't seem to work and the textures are repaetitive. (to small) so water and land from the sky appear as repeating patterns.  Probably needs to be moved over to the crysis engine or something, it' snot smooth... mechs move to fast,  It's just klunky.  Downloading Mech Warrior online now! (though I prefer single player games) that one at least is free to try and looks fantastic.","December 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","2"

Shots don't really give much feedback for degee of damage.\n\nYou can kind of torso twist as per mechwarrior, but it doesn't feel like it does much. Parts can be destroyed individually, but I have yet to feel any real penalties.\n\nMost of the single player is  mech walking simulator with an additional point mouse at AI that has trouble aiming feature.\n\nBasically a Unity project someone didn't really take time to completely flesh out. Don't bother.","January 4","false","0.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
