"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058156743/recommended/440340/","76561198058156743","just some posh git","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058156743/","447 products in account","Just so we're clear, this is just my first impressions after about 1 hour of play give or take so if I happened to miss anything from here, I am probably blind as a bat or I haven't reached that far into the game yet.\n\nFirst off, this is a game built on the Unity engine so looking at the options menu, it's no big suprise that it's usually bare bones starting off with the graphical settings. All you got is resolution that's fixed to your native resolution and can't change it unless you go into windowed mode, toggling realtime shadows on or off, and some basic form of Anti-Aliasing with the absence of graphical presets, but this game is not very demanding as far as I can tell. For sound, it's just the master volume, no sliders for voice, sound effects ,or music. Languages consists of English and Japanese, with the last one is basically swears with the ability to upload any language of your choice. The help menu is written in broken English, but it's not broken enough to not get the message it wants to say.\n\nThe gameplay is an on-rails shooter in a third-person perspective, so don't expect a third-person cover shooter. Looking at the game's screenshots, the UI in-game, and the way to navigate the menus, I have realized this game is a mobile port, but does it really affect the gameplay all that much? To me, not really except some design decisions that happen to get through. There are quite a bit of weapons to take with you on the field, but down the later levels, it really feels like they are just direct upgrades from previous weapons you were currently using and when you select a weapon, it has a button labeled upgrade so I originally thought I could alter stats to make the guns more interesting and make early game weapons still viable to use late game until I realized it's only to increase your ammo reserves since buying the weapon itself only comes with one spare magazine for some odd reason. Honestly it would be tolerable if there was a way to switch weapons at will instead of throwing away your entire primary reserves only to be left with a pea shooter. As an on-rails shooter, it unfortunately suffers the same problems as that god awful Rambo game with no warning markers to tell you if you're going to get hit, but instead of fixed health, you have regenerating health so it becomes less noticably infuriating, even though you still get hit occasionally behind cover. The gunplay feels pretty weak with no visual recoil on the guns with fairly poor sound assets in addition to janky animations almost convincing me that the guns were pre-packaged Unity assets and I say that because I am someone who really enjoys games from Tripwire Interactive. Speaking of recoil, there is no recoil to even speak of because it is actually on a set cone of fire that shoots in random directions so don't even think about trying to control said recoil. Occasionally, they will spawn melee units that instantly kills you for some inexplicable reason since I don't recall melee units in rail shooters instagib players at all, no, I can't think of a single one that does that. The levels themselves are pretty short considering this is a mobile game and it is deliberately designed to force you to replay levels over and over again to get enough money for the gun you need and the ammunition required to pass the level only to repeat the process again in return artificially extending the game longer than what the actual length is.\n\nPerhaps I just have really low standards nowadays, but $6 is an okay price for what this is. Verdict? I can't really find myself recommending it to just anybody really and I kinda feel bad for saying it. I'd only recommend it for those who has the time and cash to burn, but not for those who are desperate for on-rails shooters. If you are looking for on-rails shooters, take a look at Blue Estate and Typing of the Dead: Overkill. Or better yet, Go to an arcade outlet and find Time Crisis 3.","March 1","false","2.1"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","47","57","0","4"

It's an on rail shooter so no third person free control sadly. However, once you start to get into the game long enough you will not mind that it's a rail shooter. Most of the time you will feel like you're playing an arcade game once you get all the upgrades the game has to offer.\n\nThe first time you play the game it's going to be difficult ofcourse, and the starting weapons are going to be ♥♥♥, but if you can make it to the last level of the game you will have the best weapons in the game. You can also upgrade the cosmetic looks of both your character and two of the main bad guys.\n\nFrom start to finish I beat the game alittle over four hours, again once you have the best stuff in the game you can beat the game in alittle under half an hour...i'm serious. There is replay value surpisingly, once you beat the game you can try and beat it without dying, test the weapons in levels that you didn't have at the time OR...one of the games weirdest yet funniest replay values called (Rokiahi Madness). Lets just say it dramaticly changes all of your characters subtitles into...questionable thoughts as to what game you were playing in the first place.\n\nAll in all the game is worth a try if you were thinking of buying this arcade like game.","April 7","true","5.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

MP5\n\n3.When Ina boss  use the attack helicopter and attack player from behind it so hard change cover becauce minigun can attack two way and rohiaki have been kill quickly it make me feel needs luck to survive.\n\n4.Some camera view rather bad, so make more problem in 3.\n\n5.Black screen story when finish level. I'm think you should make it likes cutsecne after finish defend lobby level.\n\n6.The pistol should be damage for Centurian boss. many player maybe haven't enough ammo for the first play.So make bad feeling must restart when near finish level.\n\n7.Should have cutsecne after end cedit.I'm expect player want to know what after and next intend herself about this case. not abruptly ending.\n\n\nMaybe this game have a lot of defect but interesting system design, Boss system look rather challenge and enjoy to play (P.S. but for use some gun)\n\nFor the first pulice I'm think this game is Not bad but I'm not recommend my friend to buy it. Even my close friend have interesting "MOE military girls" still undecided.\n\nhow even I'm wish you have next project on steam. :D\n\nI'm give 5/10 SCORE for this game.","March 6","false","15.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","1"
