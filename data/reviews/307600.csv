Lords of the Night gives you a bunch of new things to fight from jungle critters to Armor wearing Moon Cultist. They also added a lot of new weapons and items, some of which you need to unlock to use.  The UI has been imporved and the over all game feels much faster than the origional.\n\nYou start the game on one of three difficulty levels. Normal and Hard which both give you a good chance of starting off with some decent stats, and you get to choose what items you take with you at the start. Then there is Classic Mode which plays like the origional board game and puts you at the mercy of the RNG gods with no boost to your stats and random starting items.\n\nAs you progress through the game you will get Air Drops that will contain a collection of weapons and items for you to choose from, you have 3 item points for each drop and get to spend them how you want.  You can also replace your lost Laser Lance from the Air Drops, so there is no need to backtrack to the start of the game to replace it.\n\nMy only complaint of the game so far is the lack of a save system, but that is a feature they will be adding soon.\n\nIf you enjoyed the origional Chainsaw Warrior game then you likley will find enough new content in Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of the Night to make it worth your time.","February 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","27","32","3","1"

Nearly. In the 11th hour one man, one hero rose to face Darkness and banished it from this world, saving us all.\n\nBut evil will always find ways into the hearts of men. Now, eighteen years later, deep in the Mexican jungle, the followers of a forgotten God have found a new ally, and an old enemy we had thought defeated returns to finish what they had started eighteen years ago.\nDarkness has returned and only one man can stop it from destroying the world.\nIt had been a suicide mission then. Noone thought he could succeed, much less survive. Then, against all odds he prevailed. Can a million to once chance come true... twice?\n\nIn a  desperate race against time, cutting his way through the jungle, hordes of zombies and a crazed apocalyptic cult, the Chainsaw Warrior has only 1 Hour to reach and banish Darkness or all will be lost.\nNew dangers lurk among the trees and in the swamps. The ancient guardians of the aztec ruins have awakened. But with great challenges come great rewards and the Chainsaw Warrior will need all the help he can get if he is to save us... again.\n\nPrepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Armed with his trusty chainsaw. He is ready to once more be the hero the world needs.\nAre you?\n\n\nGame Facts:\nLike the original Chainsaw Warrior, Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of the Night is a game of turning cards and rolling dice. Each card you turn, each action you take will thake 30 seconds and you only have 1 Hour before the world ends.\nYou move through the jungle by turning cards and encountering enemies or traps and just sometimes finding something to help you on your mission. What equipment will you take with you? What risks will you take? And yes, how lucky will you get? These all will determine your success or defeat.\n\nPros:\n+The Chainsaw Warrior games manage, with simple mechanics, to capture the pressure of time, the sence of emergency, that mad, desperate dash. You frantically turn cards willing that clock to stop ticking, the doom counter to stop its count.\n+ Three difficulty settings affecting stats, equipment points and whether you get to see the equipment you pick or are forced to select blindly\n+ Equipment allows for various tactics to reach the end. Even though in the end it comes down to one thing: Destroy Darkness or die trying.\n+ Classic mode truly is challenging\n\nCons:\n- Like any game based on dice, luck is very important.\n\nChanges from old game:\n\n* Ranged combat has been completly rebuild, making ranged weapons far more useful. You can now manouvre from melee to ranged distance and put that assault rifle to good use.\n* Instead of two decks there now are three: Jungle - Ruined City - Temple\n* Old Aztec temples can be found and explored to recieve special blessings - but beware, they are guarded.\n* The Meat Machine and Slime have company: more unique enemies have been added and act as mini bosses at the end of the first two decks.\n* Darkness is spreading as Shades. These offshoots of Darkness may be encountered sepparately and defeating them will weaken Darkness, making that final battle easier.\n* New equipment to match the new setting, including new versions for your trusty chainsaw. Some of this equipment has to be unlocked through playing the game.\n\nVerdict:\nThe clock is ticking. While you were reading, Darkness has come this much closer to killing us all. Go, Save the world.","May 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","19","24","4","0"

Don't fear, you'll still die multiple deaths because of crappy dice rolls, but you do have a lot more tactical choices to make, both in weapons and equipment. Airdrops of new equipment during the game, also help give back a sense of agency.\n\nThen there is the addition of 'blessings', basically an active or passive power that can help you during your gruelling trek through the jungle (think along the lines of "heal 3 points", or "immunity from radiation damage"). New blessings can be acquired by entering a temple and killing a high powered monster (the game's equivalent of a very basic side quest).\n\nThe pulpy setup of the original game is still in full effect, and I would say that the new setting adds a lot of flavour to the overall John Carpenterness of it all.\n\nPersonally, I'd recommend this game over the original Chainsaw Warrior (although at these prices, why force yourself to choose).","February 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/307600/","tablis","Tablis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/","741 products in account","The main thing you need to know: this game is ridiculously buggy. It's like it received just enough testing to not crash (and to be fair - it never crashed for me, unlike the first Chainsaw Warrior) but the intricacies of equipment, mechanics, unique enemies and all their possible interactions were left to their own devices. I spotted easily upwards of 20 bugs, from purely cosmetic ones like HUD indicators not updating to reflect various gear-induced bonuses and maluses, through irritating ones like items having broken mechanics or achievements being shoddily implemented, to downright progression blockers that force you to start a new game (if you don't know the workaround).\n\nWith that out of the way, let me now say I still enjoyed the game a lot. It's a significant improvement over the first Chainsaw Warrior in terms of graphics and content and audio as well. All the ingame interaction buttons are now clumped together in the bottom-left corner of the screen, which lends itself to less swinging of the mouse back and forth across half the screen for every card, which was my main gripe with the previous CW. There's more items, weapons, enemies, achievements, everything. It's good, old-fashioned fun.","November 8, 2015","true","8.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

In all fairness, I'm writing this review with very little play-time up my sleeve, but on the whole I have to confess that the aforementioned excitement has dulled ever-so-slightly into mild disappointment.  Let's see now...\n\nMy first hesitation is the setting.  While I completely applaud the decision to not just set this in a post-apocalyptic New York - AGAIN - choosing to situate the continued adventures of our titular hero in an Aztec-ian jungle suggests, to me at least, that we're slowly moving towards more Serious Sam-styled territory (though all of these characters ultimately owe their lineage to Ash of "Evil Dead" fame, suffice it to say).  Now, whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the individual, but personally I miss the urban decay / Escape From New York aesthetics...but that's just me.  If you harbour a particular hard-on for the Aztecs, you'll obviously be right at home here.\n\nOh, and the music has changed accordingly, and while there's basically nothing wrong with the more jungle-y flavours on offer here - well, except perhaps for the fact that it's all a tad too laid-back and "muzak"-y to generate much tension or momentum - on the whole, I must say that I miss the super-synthy goodness of the earlier game's soundtrack.  (Oh, and there's also a completely needless and irritating "punch" noise every time you enter melee combat, even if you choose to use the chainsaw or what-have-you; other than this, though, the sound effects are perfectly dandy.)  Now onto the mechanics...\n\nMy earliest impressions of the game are that it is SLOWER than the first Chainsaw Warrior; and with that, arguably a tiny bit more cumbersome.  The 2013 game was VERY fast-paced, with cards turning over at lightning speed and enemies defeated just as quickly.  This time 'round we have ARMOURED enemies, who effectively take "damage" and gradually weaken rather than simply being defeated outright.  There are also some more "tactical" combat situations, such as a giant statue guardian who you can either attack directly, or firstly choose to target the stone hands of to reduce its ability to defend itself.  The overall effect of all of this is that combats seem to take longer, and therein so does the game.  Again...personal preference.  But for better or for worse, that "jump-in-jump-out" / "I'll just play one more quick round" quality of the original game seems to have been lost somewhere in the shuffle.\n\nThings are also arguably slowed down (read: overcomplicated) by the fact that the devs have opted to make this a tad more of a full-blown "video game" this time around; and thereby less of a "board game adaptation".  Simply put, there are less cards to look at (equipment is just a list this time 'round), and the cards which ARE portrayed are visually less varied in content (one type of zombie crops up repeatedly, as opposed to the original, in which we had a healthy rogue's gallery of the nasties in question).  On a purely personal note, I also simply don't "like" the artwork as much (a very important factor in ALL games, be they video / board / card / whatever).\n\nThere are also BOSS FIGHTS - some optional and some unavoidable in nature - which again, slow the pace for a moment whilst you ♥♥♥♥ yourself wondering whether or not to waste precious Laser Lance ammunition on something other than Darkness himself.  And I'm also pretty sure that all the new-'n'-improved "card-decimation" animations (chainsaws cutting through enemies, cards exploding, etc) take longer to resolve than the more modest equivalents from the first game...though this may just be a figment of my imagination (but even then, still contributes to my overall argument of things generally "seeming" more sluggish).\n\nSo the overall feeling of hurtling-towards-the-inevitable-final-confrontation has been hampered somewhat in favour of more conventional video game dynamics, and that oh-so-modern notion of the "side-quest" (in the form of temples and the aforementioned optional boss fights); again, and I can't stress this enough, PERSONAL ♥♥♥♥ING PREFERENCE.\n\nI don't know...perhaps I'll warm to this one more in time, but I think I found the charm of the 2013 game to lie predominantly in the speedy "casual"-ness of its nature, and that can't quite be said this time around.  And I'm sorry, but I really just don't dig the jungle as much (hell, I'm a bit of a John Carpenter fan, as you may have guessed from my non de plume).  Having said all this, it's still a good game, especially at that price, and anyone who appreciates board / card game adaptations is liable to get at least SOME jollies out of it.  I dunno, maybe they should have set it in post-apocalyptic London, and had zombies in bobby hats?  Full points for trying something truly different, I suppose...\n\nVerdict: 7/10.\n\n(PS There is one genuine improvement over the original game:  Thanks to "air drops", you no longer have to back-track all the way to the START to replace a lost or broken Laser Lance...without a doubt, the single most annoying feature of the earlier game.  So full kudos for THAT one!)","February 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","6"

I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like dice-based (D6) card games and the Aztec theme, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice and simple - the detail in each card is well done. There are visual effects whenever you do an attack/use an item, but most of the time you will just be looking at and reading the cards on a static background. The music and sounds are decent, however, I quickly muted the music in favor of my own. The story involves you racing against time (nightfall) to stop The Darkness from destroying the world.\n\nControls are entirely mouse-based and simple. There is an optional tutorial that very quickly shows you everything you need to know, however, improving your playthroughs will require you to die a lot and learn through trial-and-error. The learning curve is mostly minimal depending on your knowledge of D6-style gameplay, and the most difficult element of the game is probably understanding how to best optimize your loadouts for each run (for example, if you roll a character that is weaker in hand-to-hand (hth) combat, how do you compensate for this?).\n\nGameplay consists of you drawing cards until you encounter the area boss (this can occur before all the cards in the deck have been revealed). Defeating the boss will allow you to progress to the next area, until you reach the last boss in the third area. After each action you take, a "round" occurs, decreasing the time on the clock. Once darkness falls, your character will take a hit to his hth stat. If you reach 0 on the clock, The Darkness will automatically win. As you draw cards, you will most likely encounter an array of enemies, however, you can also run into different types of traps, airdrops (allow you to restock/change equipment), temples (protected by a powerful guardian and will give you a blessing buff if you defeat it), or events.\n\nBefore you begin, you will randomly generate (roll) a chainsaw warrior to play as. This makes each playthrough a bit different, as you will have different values in your Wounds (hit points), Venom Resistance, Radiation Resistance, Range, Reflex (ability to dodge), and Hth stats. Enemies do different types of damage, and falling to 0 in wounds, venom, or radiation will result in your death. Your character will roll a special perk, which may be something like decreasing each area deck by 5 cards, increased reflexes, etc. You may also select your starting equipment, and you will usually start with 3 to 8 equipment points (this seems to be offset by high or low starting stats). You can choose from different melee, ranged, and heavy weapons to help you survive the Aztec jungle. There are also a number of devices (ex: medpack, extra ammo clip, etc) you can take with you. Finally, different armors can help you fend off enemy attacks. If you select the "Classic" difficulty, all equipment will be replaced with a ?, only to be revealed once you start your run (truly making everything random-based).\n\nYour starting equipment selection is a critical part to your playthrough because you can end up making your run easier or much more difficult depending on your choices. For example, if I roll a character that is a bit weaker in the hth stat, I may decide to grab a Stun Nux, which adds 4 to my hth stat whenever I am fighting a living opponent (ex: cultists). Taking advantage of a higher range stat is highly recommended because many of the enemies you will fight will prefer hth combat.\n\nWhen you draw an enemy card, they may have a special effect (ex: deal x type of damage immediately or ambush: go immediately into close-ranged combat) and/or do an extra type of damage (venom) on top of normal wound damage. Different enemies will prefer either hth or ranged combat, and using the opposite tactic on them will give them a debuff of some kind. For example, many of the initial zombies you will encounter are hth fighters, so using a ranged weapon will almost always hit them without the need for a dice roll (unless they have a really high reflex stat). Some zombies will counter this tactic by having an ambush ability, which will allow them to immediately put you into close-range (there is a device that will negate the ambush ability). In close-range, you can use melee weapons or try to evade your opponent. Every action in combat involves dice rolls, and succeeding in an evasion will result in no damage taken (failing will still cause you to evade, but you will take some damage) and put you back in ranged-weapon distance.\n\nDuring combat, your enemy (multi-enemy battles are still fought one-at-a-time) will roll two die (D6), adding this value to their hth or range stat depending on the level of engagement (ex: you are using a melee weapon against a melee opponent). Next, you will roll two die, adding this value to the appropriate stat (in this case, your melee stat). If you have a higher value than your opponent, you will instantly kill them unless they have armor, in which case you will do 1 damage to armor (until it goes down to 0 or 1 - at 1 armor weapons like chainsaws can pierce through). There are weapons that allow you to ignore x armor. If your opponent's attack value is higher than yours, then you will take damage depending on the type of your opponent (either wounds, or both wounds and venom). Armor will allow you to negate some types of damage if you roll a 5 or 6 during an armor check. You also have the option to try to escape, however, you have to roll a 6, otherwise you will take 1 wound damage.\n\nIn a situation where you are using a ranged weapon against a melee opponent, the enemy will add their roll value to their reflex stat instead of their attack stat (since they cannot attack you at range). If they beat your roll, you will miss and they will close the distance. Against enemies with significantly lower reflex stats, you will automatically hit with your ranged attack because they are too slow.\n\nSome of the tougher opponents can only die to special weapons, so conserving your laser ammo is critical to survival and progression. Your equipment can become stolen or even broken, which can be fatal most of the time. Multiple playthroughs will help you refine your preferred playstyle.\n\nOverall, the game is very nice and simple - a good filler game if you want to spend a short amount of time playing something. I always try not to mention price in my reviews if I think it is unnecessary, however, I will say that I purchased this game on sale for $3.24 CAD, and I think that is a much fairer value than it's original price of $6.49. I suggest you wait until it is on sale, unless you are dying to play it.\n\nFor people that enjoy D6 card games, you should definitely give Chainsaw Warrior a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","May 10, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","3"

The original (digital) game is a great one, but it was done by indie studio Auroch Digital and you know how things go... sometimes you don't really get enough dough to work on a sequel.\n\nWell, fortunately for all of us, not in case of Auroch Digital and Chainsaw Warrior. LoTN sequel is capitalizing on the first one and it's doing it in such a style, it's unbeliveable.\n\nFrom the trashy, John Carpenterish ruins we've moved south to Mexican Jungle, where the blades of our chainsaw will meet up with the flesh of Aztec zombies aaaaand... Slime (♥♥♥♥ YOU! ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!), crocodiles, zombie crocodiles, zombie monkeys, moon cultists, armored cultists and so on. Enemies are many and different and you better read what those cards say or you're gonna get yourself in trouble.\n\nApart from that we now have to work our way through three decks. I've realized it's usually taking me around 20 minutes to get through the game... if I'm lucky.\n\nThere's a ton of new items which really makes this sequel a perfect gagball for all those people who've complained about game being way too random. Of course, the rule design of this new title stayed as close as possible to the original one (read: bad dice rolling, you're going underground), but new items and ways you can use them will bring extra strategy and options in your games.\n\nApart from this, now you'll have an ability to visit temples, kill monstrous enemies along the way and receive godly blessings which will help you on your way to destroy The Darkness. And yeah... punch crocodiles. Kill 'em using only your fists.\n\nTo sum it up, Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of The Night is all-better, all-improved, all-more-fun version of the original. If you didn't pick the original, pick this one up. If you did, pick this one up. In any case, you can't really miss. And don't wait for no discounts - this indie dev deserves ALL OF YOUR MONEY. Go, through money at the screen NOW!","February 25, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","3"

Army of Darkness (hell, the whole evil dead trilogy) and Braindead. Besides being awesome, what do they have in common? A badass mowing through zombies with a powertool, be it a chainsaw or a lawnmower. Chainsaw Warrior distills this to its core experience, throw in a bunch more 80s cliche and lets rip. You want a chainsaw to match your mood? Feel magnificent with the master-crafted 'saw or guts'n'gore manly with the diesel noise machine. Maybe you want to get your 'Murica on with a shotgun or go full "I watched a video on how to build this on the Youtubes" crazy with a flamethrower? This game's got you covered. Just maybe you want to go old school knife a zombie. Can't be bothered to walk over there? Throw it at that stumbling fool.\nNow just in case you're thinking the game will leave you feeling like a over-powered, zombie slaying, 80's thowback, macho, deity, think again. Lords of the Night is difficult enough to actually feel rewarding when you eventually finish a run through and unlock some of those sweet new items. If you're really looking for a challenge, there's the classic board game mode which lumps you with random stats, random items and the faint impression of a dev laughing at you as you go forth into the jungle with every chainsaw in the game and a hand-to-hand rating of -2 (slight exaggeration of the desperation you will inevitably feel). Want a quick restart button so you can keep trying to get good stats and items? Too bad, you asked for this. Now go try and punch some zombie to death and hope the air drops are kind.\nWhile Chainsaw Warrior gets a hour to save the world, you'll only need 15 minutes or so to blast out a play through. Just quick enough for a sneaky game on the crapper at a reasonably relaxed work place.","May 18, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearer/recommended/307600/","clearer","Jormundgand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearer/","69 products in account","Most of the reviews on this game claim that the game is almost entirely dependent on luck -- that you're actions carry very little weight on the game and your chances at survival.\n\nWhile luck is a huge factor, when you do get to make decisions, you can make some really poor ones and some really good ones. What kind of gear you pick has a huge impact on the difficuly. How much you blast your enemies in ranged and what kind of armour you get, all affects how likely you are to survive your encounter with the darkness.\n\nHaving said that, there is no course of action that will guarantee success -- all you can do is try to maximize your chances of success. To me that's a good thing (even if it does get frustrating). If you understand how chance works, you should have a good chance at beating the game.","January 27","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
