Another nice feature is the ability to put one of five ghosts on available points on the screen to create shooting turrets or healing points that aid you in your battle.\n\nWhat is good:\n1. The soundtrack... its awesome and very well done.\n2. The difficulty. The game is hard and unforgiving like a good shoot em up should be.\n3. The ghost mechanic gives the game additional replayability as you probably will want to try a different approach on a  level you've already beaten.\n4. Varied bullet patterns. If you've played a few bullet hell shmups you'll be surprised to see a few quite well done and interesting patterns here.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Controls feel clunky. You either feel like youre not fast enough to dodge the onslaught of bullets or you use your dashmove and overshoot. This of course gets better with practice but right of the start controlling Poe (the main character) never felt quite right to me. To me it felt like the dash move was originally intended to make you invincible for a few frames but then they cut that feature out at the last minute.\n\n2. Gameplay. Despite having scrolling backrounds this is basically a twinstick onescreen arena shooter like geometry wars. Enemies spawn on screen and you try to kill them as fast as possible. Most foes take a ridiculous amount of damage though and often times fighting those bigger enemies feels slow and repetitive. At the end it all boils down to which ghosts to use at what point in the level and i didn't find this particulary exciting. Never before have i played a shmup in which destroying enemies felt so unsatisfying. They don't explode or scream or have nice death animations. Killed enemies just vanish without a sound.\n\n3. Graphics. Stylish but Cheap. Everything looks like a cardboard cutout and is barely animated at all. Think of old flash games. Disappointing.\n\n4. Content. Yes there are ghosts and relics(passive boosts) to unlock when beating the levels at certain difficulties but at the end of the day there are only 3 different levels. They change according to the music at higher difficulties but to me everything felt quite samy.\n\n5. The whole rythm affects gameplay thing. A great idea that fascinates at first but eventually shows its downside: It makes the game unpredictable. Pushing the "shoot" button to kill a near enemy but you are not shooting? Yeah, because the music at this very moment does not allow it. This wouldnt be that bad if you could actually predict the music and play accordingly but the whole soundtrack (as good as it is) sounds like some kind of everchanging rave/techno/remix stuff. Try to predict this. :)\n\nAs you can probably tell i do not like A City Sleeps. Compared to other shoot em ups its slow and repetitive, looks cheap and has not enough content to warrant its price tag of 14€.\n\nYoull be far better off to buy stuff like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown, Deathsmiles, Akai Katana or any other shooter from cave.\nThe only redeeming thing about A City Sleeps is its soundtrack. Yeah. buy and download the soundtrack, its awesome.","October 19, 2014","false","2.9"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

You shoot in the beat of the music.\n-Great in short bursts. Short level.\n-Unlockable special abilities change up the levels and add highly to replayability.\n-Although short, the game is relatively challenging and offers a variety of difficulty levels to unlock.\n\nFor every fan of the sadly scarce Shoot 'em up genre that enjoy a vibrant soundtrack that compliments the game well this is a must have. With it's beautiful art and fluid gameplay, it offers high replayability despite the short length. It is a sadly (at launch at least) overlooked game that in the terms of production quality and overall gameplay is at the top of its genre. If you enjoy the art style and are a fan of this genre, as well as are intrigued by the idea of the music pretty much dictating the game flow, this is a game you shouldn't miss. For everyone else, at least at a sale, it is worth a shot and will probably end up being a gem in many people's game library.","October 16, 2014","true","1.7"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

Instead, it tries to fuse shmup and rhythm game.\n\nUnfortunately, the music / rhythm element adds nothing to the game whatsoever, and despite using preset music, the link between music and gameplay isn't any better than in titles like Beat Hazard, where an algorithm generates gameplay elements for the music of your choice.\nAt the same time, the controls don't feel snappy enough for a bullet hell shooter. There's a fidgety system of 'ghosts' that doesn't really serve a purpose and can be clumsy to use in the middle of combat.\nVisual clarity is lacking, and an option to turn off the visuals of your character besides your hitbox is missing. Sadly there's also nothing impactful about your own or the enemies' shots. For all the effort they put into visual fidelity, the development team forgot to make opponents do anything else than just disappear.\n\nAt this price (already reduced from an even higher previous one), this feels like an Early Access game sorely lacking in content. It tries to make up for this by offering particularly difficult levels, but still ultimately has three relatively short stages. So far sale discounts are also anything but steep. Other games based around electronic music like Electronic Super Joy offer much better value for money.\n\nTo summarize, this is only really worth your time & money as art.","June 22, 2015","false","2.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/316180/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","One of the my favorite things about Harmonix as a studio is how they’ve managed to hang on to their soul and passion for game development even after creating two of the most successful franchises in video game history (and subsequently, the many, many sequels which followed). Guitar Hero and Rock Band were a legitimate phenomenon, so much so that their popularity eventually became their downfall (taking music games as a collective whole with them). Harmonix themselves have yet to close up shop though, and in the post-music game crash they’ve started to experiment and begin to redefine themselves as a studio capable of more than popularizing plastic instruments.\n\nA City Sleeps is the result of their recent efforts, an energetic bullet hell shooter fueled by thumping EDM and blazing neon lights. Entering the dreams of a troubled cyberpunk city, the nightmares of its inhabitants become personified as alien specters, tormenting their hosts and waging a war on anyone who should try to exorcise them.\n\nHowever intriguing a setup, it was almost immediately forgotten once I actually entered a dream and became entranced by the sensory explosion I was somehow enacting. While it occupies space in the realms of both rhythm games and bullet-hell shooters, A City Sleeps’ biggest strength is as an active visualizer which requires your complete attention if you hope to see it through to the end.\n\nEach shot fired provides a beat, a synth, a note in a constantly remixing track which ebbs and flows as you fight off enemies, each of which in turn provides their own melody. The compositions which emerge from these systems are at once beautifully uniform and unstable; digital consistency grinding against human unpredictability and imperfection to mold a track that is immediately familiar yet never quite identical.\n\nThe act of remixing these tracks alone isn’t what captives me though. It’s in the combination of intense arcade shooting, total absorption in the gorgeous and overwhelming visuals, and the constant harmony of so many sounds coming together that something incredible is born. A City Sleeps isn’t a game which compels me to explore it fully, not due to a lack of curiosity at what might be hidden at the end of its most challenging stages, but because I find a comfort and excitement in its most basic missions. The earliest levels showcase A City Sleeps at its most dynamic and controllable, allowing the player to appreciate the genius of the various instruments working to allow such a game to function, without the all-encompassing stress and overstimulation present when the difficulty is raised.\n\nIt’s a slight disappointment then that these moments are almost immediately replaced with missions that lean heavily toward static memorization and mechanical competency. I was enthralled by my first trilogy of dreams, but found myself losing patience and interest when the difficulty rose and I needed to utilize a more utilitarian approach to combat. A City Sleep is at its best when it allows the player enough freedom to experiment without given so much as let their attention wander, something sadly only understood in the earliest moments of the game.\n\nA City Sleeps may tend to favor its least interesting and impressive elements, but while it runs short, in its most accessible state it is also its most ingenious. This is not the game I would have expected to see from Harmonix, and their inexperience definitely shows in attempting to repurpose the same progression system that worked so much better in their previous games, but for how limited its scope may be I find myself continually fascinated by what A City Sleep has attempted, and in its finest moments succeeds with beyond question.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","September 25, 2015","true","4.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"

This is another case where they do things wonderfully, but the only problem is that there are too few music tracks (or levels) to recommend besides on sale.\n\nSure, they have harder versions of the same levels to mix things up a bit, including the music, but the learning curve is a bit intense, and of the difficulties, the lowest is the only one I can get through consistantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZerthSpirit/recommended/316180/","ZerthSpirit","ZerthSpirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZerthSpirit/","85 products in account","This review contains my personal opinion about the game A City Sleeps.\nI did enjoy this game, and have played it for several hours.\n\nThis game does have built in controller support.\nI played this game with the hardware specs on my profile and used a  ps3 controller.\n\nThis game fits into the side scrolling/arcade shooter genre and you play the game as Silk,  a "dream exorcist"  curing people of demonic possessions. When the people of SanLo fall into an eternal slumber, only you can save them with your exorcisms. The game is played in levels called “dreams” and each dream has three stages.Death results in a penalty to your final score, and restarting at the most current stange in your dream. The easiest way to think of stages is as if they were checkpoints.  There are a number of ghosts that you can summon to help you in your tasks, you start with two, and are able to unlock more as the game progresses.\n\nWhat I liked:+Versatility\n*The ability to equip as many as three ghosts at a time means that you’ll be able to play the game in a manner which fits your personal style.\n+Intuitive Controls\n*I would recommend playing this game with a controller. The buttons are simply and intuitively mapped, as well as easy to remember.\n+Soundtrack\n*The soundtrack was very pleasing to listen to. Most of the tracks are very well composed and easy to listen to. I would consider buying the soundtrack separately to listen to while writing, or doing other tasks.\n+Engaging gameplay\n*The harder difficulties have some very unique curses that make the level more challenging, and require you to have a different mental approach.\n\nWhat I didn't like:-Animation Quality\n*The attack animations are somewhat choppy at melee range.\n-Difficulty\n* Even at the lowest difficulty some of the levels can seem frustrating, or overwhelming.\n-Penalties\n*The points you score take a hit if you have Mercy (the healing ghost) activated. I just dislike this, obviously you’ll need to summon mercy at some point (unless you’re an elitest) and I don't think your points should be penalized for that.\n-Boss Fights\n*The boss fights, while not extremely challenging in the traditional sense, can be an overwhelming amount of stimuli at once (the whole screen is full of seemingly undodgeable attacks), and if you fail, you begin at the beginning of stage 3. Once you interpret and anticipate the attack patterns the fight isn’t too hard, but it’s more than a little frustrating having to re-do stage three. I think it would have been much more enjoyable if the failed boss fight started back over at the beginning.\n\nOther notes:>The enemies in the game are very diverse, while you can tell what enemies are based on a similar model, their appearance, sound, and attacks are unique.\n>The story is present, but not well explained, and much of the terminology isn’t defined either.\n>The dreams all have the same 3 stage format with the boss at the end, which can be a bit repetitive.\n>After several hours of gameplay I did not notice any glitches, bugs, or lag. Everything appears to be working as designed.\n>I received this game as part of a humble bundle, I did not pay full price for it.\n\nFinal Score 7/10\n+++++++\n\nDespite being a little on the frustrating side, the game is a lot of fun to play, and the art backgrounds combined with the soundtrack make this game so much better. I’m not generally a fan of this type of game, but I will continue to play it when I am taking a break from my other games. If you’re a fan of the genre, I think this would be a unique game to add to your collection. if you are easily frustrated, however, you may want to rethink this game.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nYep, absolutely.","July 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","4"

The game takes the combination of a shmup and turns it upside down with a very stylized and memorable soundtrack. It's nice to see a developer take a chance on such a obscure genre, that I believe is only really popular in Japan.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and flows perfectly, the art is beautiful and each enemy stands out. As for the soundtrack I could go on about how amazing the soundtrack is! (buy the deluxe edtion!) I found myself playing the Empress level multiple times just to play the last boss fight with the music.\n\nSome people might be turned off by the fact that the only only features 3 levels, but after you complete a level on a certain difficulty you will unlock an even harder diffculty for that level. The harder difficulties really feel different and aren't the same level you just played. The bullet patterns change and really has you really thinking over your stategy and trying to memorizes the certain bullet patterns.\n\nIf you are a fan of shumps and/or music games or if you are looking to play something completely different this game is just for you!\n","October 17, 2014","true","4.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Your attacks as well as enemy attack and spawn patterns correspond to the different elements of the soundtrack, creating a unique shoot em up experience that can best be described as a mixture of the frantic action of games like Beat Hazard with the tight, music timed level structure of REZ.\n\nYou're character Poe has a standard multi directional attack and the ability to equip  ghosts and relics.\nGhosts are active powers that can be activated in multiple slots of the levels. Each ghost has two forms. The basic attack ghost Anger for example can either be used as a fast paced homing shot or as an AoE, while the positional orientated Master ghost can be used as either a heavy sniper attack or a leash, damaging enemies between you and the slot. There are multiple ghosts to unlock, adding a huge emphasis on experimenting with different tactics based on your ghost load out.\nRelics are unlockable passive abilities, that buff your ghosts or standard attacks.\n\nThe soundtrack is the highlight of the game. Unlike many other music driven games there is no importing of your own songs via beatmatching. Instead you have a game that is designed around it's soundtrack. If you played and enjoyed REZ, you know exactly the trance like state that you fall into, dodging enemy bullets and timing your attacks to the beats and sound of the music.\n\nOne of the short comings of the game is the level variety. You have 15 levels that are 3 levels (songs) in 5 different variants each. While I personally think that the game justifies it's price point with the highly addictive gameplay, some might find the lack of level variety off putting.\nI highly recommend A City Sleeps.

It's quite short, only three stages with 3 chapters each and some incentive for replayability in form of unlockables and new difficulties.

You play as a member of an exorcist organization, and must go into three people's dreams of increasing difficulty and destroy what is haunting them with the assistance of ghosts with varying powers, from healing to electric shocks. For the most part, Killing enemies isn't your top priority, it's surviving. after a set amount of time, most of the enemies just leave, to be replaced with different enemies. The only major enemies you want to take down first are the ones with health bars, and the bosses. In the first stage of each dream, you have a large amount of health, so getting through to the boss isn't too difficult, but when you advance to the more challenging stages, you'll be tempted to use the Mercy (healing) ghost, but don't. It doesn't heal enough to be useful and it dractically reduces your point multiplier. The other ghosts, however, do come in handy when you're in a tight spot.\nThe highlights of this game is it's music and it's art. I personally love the art style and can't get enough of it. As I said before, the music is amazing and worth playing for the music alone, even if you're not huge on the bullet hell thing.\n\nOverall I definitely think this is a must buy for any music lover. Although there are not too many levels, the diffulty of the last stages will give you hours of enjoyment.\n\n(Disclaimer: the time I have put into this game according to steam is incorrect, I have played much more, through various other means that I don't think need mentioning.)","December 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/recommended/316180/","charkie","Charkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/","1425 products in account","A City Sleeps is a dual-joystick shmup that sort of came out of nowhere from Harmonix, best known for Rock Band and Dance Central.  It's a horizontal shooter that sort of reminds me of Action In New York/S.C.A.T or Section Z on the NES, but with a much greater range of attacks and directions to fire. In addition to your main attacks, you have Ghosts you can bring into levels to use during certain sections. These Ghosts give you defensive or offensive abilities, like a healing wave, a turret, a bullet vacuum, and some more unusual abilities. Going through a level not only requires the ability to dodge enemy shots, but also knowing when and where to deploy your Ghosts to make things more managable (and replacing a ghost you've already placed is not an issue.\n\nSince this is a Harmonix game, music naturally plays a large role. Everything revolves around the soundtrack; enemy patterns, the tempo of your shots, and when your Ghosts are active. You can think of each enemy as an instrument, and their shots are the music they play. You can use this to tell when an enemy is going to open fire or anticipate when one of your Ghosts is ready to act, which is especially useful for defensive ones. And since everything ties to the music, it helps that the soundtrack is really good.\n\nA City Sleeps unfortunately falls a bit short when compared to other shmups. The controls feel floaty, which can make dodging tight clusters of shots iffy at best. Even if you use a passive buff you earn later to move faster, it's still not that accurate. There's also a dodge move that lets you zip across the screen quickly, but it doesn't offer any invincibility frames, so you're even more likely to run into something. There's no lives or continues; if you die, you go back to the start of whatever section in the level you were at. The sections are fairly short, so it's not really a big deal, but if you die at a boss you don't go back to the start of the boss fight. You're sent back to the start of the previous section and have to fight your way back to the boss. Even if it only takes a minute or a little more to get back to the boss, that can end up getting very frustrating.\n\nIt's also a rather short game. There are three levels, but each has three difficulties and two "Cursed" variants. Each difficulty plays differently enough that it's a significant difference, and the Cursed levels add modifiers to make the level harder, like faster enemy bullets or a larger hitbox. Beating levels will unlock new Ghosts and Relics (passive boosts you can equip, like the faster movement speed mentioned earlier and ones that will change how your Ghosts act), but it still didn't take very long to clear almost the entire game (the first level's final Curse is a real SOB and I still haven't managed to beat it).\n\nStill, I really enjoyed A City Sleeps and I'm still going back and playing it when I have some free time. Something about the rhythm action really clicks for me. The legnth of the game is certainly going to be a turn-off for some people, but if you're on the fence about it, definitely pick it up if you see it on sale. If you're ok with a shorter game experience, then get A City Sleeps.","October 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It plays like a wave-based side scroller, with intriguing mechanics that contribute both to the over-arching story, as well as add significantly to the gameplay, allowing it to feel very much like a noted title in the near-to-overflowing genre.\n\nYou are a girl. I wasn't paying much attention to the story the first time around. You have to attack these robot things, and sometimes they get a little rough. Thankfully, you have spirits that aid in your struggle. So far I've only gotten two spirits, but with all the slots I have available, I'm very anxious to scoop up the rest. Attach a spirit to an altar when the time comes, and they will assist you by attacking, healing, and presumeably in other ways as well.\n\nThe game is also heavily based on the music in the background, which, considering the developers, shouldn't come as much of a surprise. The pulse of your weapon is timed to the background music, as well as the rate of fire for any spirits you have. The world moves with the music as well, getting more aggressive as the music does, and vice versa. Many times, it feels like the music is changing with the game, but in this case, it feels like just the opposite.\n\nCurrently the price sits at a snug 10 dollars. I wish I could say I've played enough to suggest it's worth the price, but if what I've played is all there is to the title, it feels mildly steep. I might wait for a sale, or even a bundle.","July 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really enjoyed how everything - your bullets, the enemy spawns, and the enemy bullets - is determined by the music. There are three stages - each stage contains two checkpoints on your way to the stage's boss. There are three difficulty levels, with challenge twists on two of them - effectively making for five difficulty levels.\n\nYou control a character who shoots bullets and controls ghosts, which she can place as power-ups at certain times in the level. The ghosts can help you deal with enemies or refill lost health. There's also a close combat mechanic which you can use to charge up for a unique and powerful move. As you progress through the game, you unlock relics (buffs) and more ghosts, which make for some nice variety.\n\nThis is not a big budget game, but I enjoyed the art style; it has a nice charm to it. I really love the music in this game too, which is important when so much of the gameplay is tied to it.\n\nThe more time I put into the game getting better, the more rewarding it felt when I finally beat a tough level - sometimes after 15-20 deaths. I might have given up on some games with that kind of death count, but I felt compelled to keep going and challenging myself with this game.\n\nI agree with others who wish there was some more content. There is a lot to master here (at least for someone like me who had little experience in this kind of game), but another stage or two would have been great.\n\nI'd love to see some more games with this kind of music-infused gameplay.","October 19, 2014","true","25.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Another nice feature is the ability to put one of five ghosts on available points on the screen to create shooting turrets or healing points that aid you in your battle.\n\nWhat is good:\n1. The soundtrack... its awesome and very well done.\n2. The difficulty. The game is hard and unforgiving like a good shoot em up should be.\n3. The ghost mechanic gives the game additional replayability as you probably will want to try a different approach on a  level you've already beaten.\n4. Varied bullet patterns. If you've played a few bullet hell shmups you'll be surprised to see a few quite well done and interesting patterns here.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Controls feel clunky. You either feel like youre not fast enough to dodge the onslaught of bullets or you use your dashmove and overshoot. This of course gets better with practice but right of the start controlling Poe (the main character) never felt quite right to me. To me it felt like the dash move was originally intended to make you invincible for a few frames but then they cut that feature out at the last minute.\n\n2. Gameplay. Despite having scrolling backrounds this is basically a twinstick onescreen arena shooter like geometry wars. Enemies spawn on screen and you try to kill them as fast as possible. Most foes take a ridiculous amount of damage though and often times fighting those bigger enemies feels slow and repetitive. At the end it all boils down to which ghosts to use at what point in the level and i didn't find this particulary exciting. Never before have i played a shmup in which destroying enemies felt so unsatisfying. They don't explode or scream or have nice death animations. Killed enemies just vanish without a sound.\n\n3. Graphics. Stylish but Cheap. Everything looks like a cardboard cutout and is barely animated at all. Think of old flash games. Disappointing.\n\n4. Content. Yes there are ghosts and relics(passive boosts) to unlock when beating the levels at certain difficulties but at the end of the day there are only 3 different levels. They change according to the music at higher difficulties but to me everything felt quite samy.\n\n5. The whole rythm affects gameplay thing. A great idea that fascinates at first but eventually shows its downside: It makes the game unpredictable. Pushing the "shoot" button to kill a near enemy but you are not shooting? Yeah, because the music at this very moment does not allow it. This wouldnt be that bad if you could actually predict the music and play accordingly but the whole soundtrack (as good as it is) sounds like some kind of everchanging rave/techno/remix stuff. Try to predict this. :)\n\nAs you can probably tell i do not like A City Sleeps. Compared to other shoot em ups its slow and repetitive, looks cheap and has not enough content to warrant its price tag of 14€.\n\nYoull be far better off to buy stuff like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown, Deathsmiles, Akai Katana or any other shooter from cave.\nThe only redeeming thing about A City Sleeps is its soundtrack. Yeah. buy and download the soundtrack, its awesome.","October 19, 2014","false","2.9"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

Instead, it tries to fuse shmup and rhythm game.\n\nUnfortunately, the music / rhythm element adds nothing to the game whatsoever, and despite using preset music, the link between music and gameplay isn't any better than in titles like Beat Hazard, where an algorithm generates gameplay elements for the music of your choice.\nAt the same time, the controls don't feel snappy enough for a bullet hell shooter. There's a fidgety system of 'ghosts' that doesn't really serve a purpose and can be clumsy to use in the middle of combat.\nVisual clarity is lacking, and an option to turn off the visuals of your character besides your hitbox is missing. Sadly there's also nothing impactful about your own or the enemies' shots. For all the effort they put into visual fidelity, the development team forgot to make opponents do anything else than just disappear.\n\nAt this price (already reduced from an even higher previous one), this feels like an Early Access game sorely lacking in content. It tries to make up for this by offering particularly difficult levels, but still ultimately has three relatively short stages. So far sale discounts are also anything but steep. Other games based around electronic music like Electronic Super Joy offer much better value for money.\n\nTo summarize, this is only really worth your time & money as art.","June 22, 2015","false","2.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/316180/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","One of the my favorite things about Harmonix as a studio is how they’ve managed to hang on to their soul and passion for game development even after creating two of the most successful franchises in video game history (and subsequently, the many, many sequels which followed). Guitar Hero and Rock Band were a legitimate phenomenon, so much so that their popularity eventually became their downfall (taking music games as a collective whole with them). Harmonix themselves have yet to close up shop though, and in the post-music game crash they’ve started to experiment and begin to redefine themselves as a studio capable of more than popularizing plastic instruments.\n\nA City Sleeps is the result of their recent efforts, an energetic bullet hell shooter fueled by thumping EDM and blazing neon lights. Entering the dreams of a troubled cyberpunk city, the nightmares of its inhabitants become personified as alien specters, tormenting their hosts and waging a war on anyone who should try to exorcise them.\n\nHowever intriguing a setup, it was almost immediately forgotten once I actually entered a dream and became entranced by the sensory explosion I was somehow enacting. While it occupies space in the realms of both rhythm games and bullet-hell shooters, A City Sleeps’ biggest strength is as an active visualizer which requires your complete attention if you hope to see it through to the end.\n\nEach shot fired provides a beat, a synth, a note in a constantly remixing track which ebbs and flows as you fight off enemies, each of which in turn provides their own melody. The compositions which emerge from these systems are at once beautifully uniform and unstable; digital consistency grinding against human unpredictability and imperfection to mold a track that is immediately familiar yet never quite identical.\n\nThe act of remixing these tracks alone isn’t what captives me though. It’s in the combination of intense arcade shooting, total absorption in the gorgeous and overwhelming visuals, and the constant harmony of so many sounds coming together that something incredible is born. A City Sleeps isn’t a game which compels me to explore it fully, not due to a lack of curiosity at what might be hidden at the end of its most challenging stages, but because I find a comfort and excitement in its most basic missions. The earliest levels showcase A City Sleeps at its most dynamic and controllable, allowing the player to appreciate the genius of the various instruments working to allow such a game to function, without the all-encompassing stress and overstimulation present when the difficulty is raised.\n\nIt’s a slight disappointment then that these moments are almost immediately replaced with missions that lean heavily toward static memorization and mechanical competency. I was enthralled by my first trilogy of dreams, but found myself losing patience and interest when the difficulty rose and I needed to utilize a more utilitarian approach to combat. A City Sleep is at its best when it allows the player enough freedom to experiment without given so much as let their attention wander, something sadly only understood in the earliest moments of the game.\n\nA City Sleeps may tend to favor its least interesting and impressive elements, but while it runs short, in its most accessible state it is also its most ingenious. This is not the game I would have expected to see from Harmonix, and their inexperience definitely shows in attempting to repurpose the same progression system that worked so much better in their previous games, but for how limited its scope may be I find myself continually fascinated by what A City Sleep has attempted, and in its finest moments succeeds with beyond question.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","September 25, 2015","true","4.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"

When the people of SanLo fall into an eternal slumber, only you can save them with your exorcisms. The game is played in levels called “dreams” and each dream has three stages.Death results in a penalty to your final score, and restarting at the most current stange in your dream. The easiest way to think of stages is as if they were checkpoints.  There are a number of ghosts that you can summon to help you in your tasks, you start with two, and are able to unlock more as the game progresses.\n\nWhat I liked:+Versatility\n*The ability to equip as many as three ghosts at a time means that you’ll be able to play the game in a manner which fits your personal style.\n+Intuitive Controls\n*I would recommend playing this game with a controller. The buttons are simply and intuitively mapped, as well as easy to remember.\n+Soundtrack\n*The soundtrack was very pleasing to listen to. Most of the tracks are very well composed and easy to listen to. I would consider buying the soundtrack separately to listen to while writing, or doing other tasks.\n+Engaging gameplay\n*The harder difficulties have some very unique curses that make the level more challenging, and require you to have a different mental approach.\n\nWhat I didn't like:-Animation Quality\n*The attack animations are somewhat choppy at melee range.\n-Difficulty\n* Even at the lowest difficulty some of the levels can seem frustrating, or overwhelming.\n-Penalties\n*The points you score take a hit if you have Mercy (the healing ghost) activated. I just dislike this, obviously you’ll need to summon mercy at some point (unless you’re an elitest) and I don't think your points should be penalized for that.\n-Boss Fights\n*The boss fights, while not extremely challenging in the traditional sense, can be an overwhelming amount of stimuli at once (the whole screen is full of seemingly undodgeable attacks), and if you fail, you begin at the beginning of stage 3. Once you interpret and anticipate the attack patterns the fight isn’t too hard, but it’s more than a little frustrating having to re-do stage three. I think it would have been much more enjoyable if the failed boss fight started back over at the beginning.\n\nOther notes:>The enemies in the game are very diverse, while you can tell what enemies are based on a similar model, their appearance, sound, and attacks are unique.\n>The story is present, but not well explained, and much of the terminology isn’t defined either.\n>The dreams all have the same 3 stage format with the boss at the end, which can be a bit repetitive.\n>After several hours of gameplay I did not notice any glitches, bugs, or lag. Everything appears to be working as designed.\n>I received this game as part of a humble bundle, I did not pay full price for it.\n\nFinal Score 7/10\n+++++++\n\nDespite being a little on the frustrating side, the game is a lot of fun to play, and the art backgrounds combined with the soundtrack make this game so much better. I’m not generally a fan of this type of game, but I will continue to play it when I am taking a break from my other games. If you’re a fan of the genre, I think this would be a unique game to add to your collection. if you are easily frustrated, however, you may want to rethink this game.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nYep, absolutely.","July 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","4"

One of the worst "supports" I've ever experienced. Not only does the game still display controller settings instead of keyboard and mouse (the usual), it dumps you imemdiately into a tutorial as soon as you fire up that displays those controller cues while disabling the MENU system, so you can't even back out. So you end up banging every key until you find out what is what, but the response from the keyboard isn't timed right, so it doesn't always register your presses. Actually had to kill the game from Task Manager, since couldn't complete the tutorial since it wasn't registering the switch ghost command right.  When you do get up into SETUP, you still can't adjust your control settings there. The option for setting keys is listed, but it only works for controllers. You actually have to edit a file while outside of the game to map your keys. And after all of that frustration, when you finally get it up and running, the game is short. So you end up spending more time getting it running than you do playing it.","August 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game takes the combination of a shmup and turns it upside down with a very stylized and memorable soundtrack. It's nice to see a developer take a chance on such a obscure genre, that I believe is only really popular in Japan.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and flows perfectly, the art is beautiful and each enemy stands out. As for the soundtrack I could go on about how amazing the soundtrack is! (buy the deluxe edtion!) I found myself playing the Empress level multiple times just to play the last boss fight with the music.\n\nSome people might be turned off by the fact that the only only features 3 levels, but after you complete a level on a certain difficulty you will unlock an even harder diffculty for that level.

It's quite short, only three stages with 3 chapters each and some incentive for replayability in form of unlockables and new difficulties.

Your attacks as well as enemy attack and spawn patterns correspond to the different elements of the soundtrack, creating a unique shoot em up experience that can best be described as a mixture of the frantic action of games like Beat Hazard with the tight, music timed level structure of REZ.\n\nYou're character Poe has a standard multi directional attack and the ability to equip  ghosts and relics.\nGhosts are active powers that can be activated in multiple slots of the levels. Each ghost has two forms. The basic attack ghost Anger for example can either be used as a fast paced homing shot or as an AoE, while the positional orientated Master ghost can be used as either a heavy sniper attack or a leash, damaging enemies between you and the slot. There are multiple ghosts to unlock, adding a huge emphasis on experimenting with different tactics based on your ghost load out.\nRelics are unlockable passive abilities, that buff your ghosts or standard attacks.\n\nThe soundtrack is the highlight of the game. Unlike many other music driven games there is no importing of your own songs via beatmatching. Instead you have a game that is designed around it's soundtrack. If you played and enjoyed REZ, you know exactly the trance like state that you fall into, dodging enemy bullets and timing your attacks to the beats and sound of the music.\n\nOne of the short comings of the game is the level variety. You have 15 levels that are 3 levels (songs) in 5 different variants each. While I personally think that the game justifies it's price point with the highly addictive gameplay, some might find the lack of level variety off putting.\nI highly recommend A City Sleeps. It's a unique shoot em up experience that everyone that likes either music games or bullet hell shooters should give a try.\n\nA City Sleeps Soundtrack on Bandcamp:\nhttps://harmonix.bandcamp.com/album/a-city-sleeps-soundtrack","November 17, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a member of an exorcist organization, and must go into three people's dreams of increasing difficulty and destroy what is haunting them with the assistance of ghosts with varying powers, from healing to electric shocks. For the most part, Killing enemies isn't your top priority, it's surviving. after a set amount of time, most of the enemies just leave, to be replaced with different enemies. The only major enemies you want to take down first are the ones with health bars, and the bosses. In the first stage of each dream, you have a large amount of health, so getting through to the boss isn't too difficult, but when you advance to the more challenging stages, you'll be tempted to use the Mercy (healing) ghost, but don't. It doesn't heal enough to be useful and it dractically reduces your point multiplier. The other ghosts, however, do come in handy when you're in a tight spot.\nThe highlights of this game is it's music and it's art. I personally love the art style and can't get enough of it. As I said before, the music is amazing and worth playing for the music alone, even if you're not huge on the bullet hell thing.\n\nOverall I definitely think this is a must buy for any music lover. Although there are not too many levels, the diffulty of the last stages will give you hours of enjoyment.\n\n(Disclaimer: the time I have put into this game according to steam is incorrect, I have played much more, through various other means that I don't think need mentioning.)","December 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/recommended/316180/","charkie","Charkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/","1425 products in account","A City Sleeps is a dual-joystick shmup that sort of came out of nowhere from Harmonix, best known for Rock Band and Dance Central.  It's a horizontal shooter that sort of reminds me of Action In New York/S.C.A.T or Section Z on the NES, but with a much greater range of attacks and directions to fire. In addition to your main attacks, you have Ghosts you can bring into levels to use during certain sections. These Ghosts give you defensive or offensive abilities, like a healing wave, a turret, a bullet vacuum, and some more unusual abilities. Going through a level not only requires the ability to dodge enemy shots, but also knowing when and where to deploy your Ghosts to make things more managable (and replacing a ghost you've already placed is not an issue.\n\nSince this is a Harmonix game, music naturally plays a large role. Everything revolves around the soundtrack; enemy patterns, the tempo of your shots, and when your Ghosts are active. You can think of each enemy as an instrument, and their shots are the music they play. You can use this to tell when an enemy is going to open fire or anticipate when one of your Ghosts is ready to act, which is especially useful for defensive ones. And since everything ties to the music, it helps that the soundtrack is really good.\n\nA City Sleeps unfortunately falls a bit short when compared to other shmups. The controls feel floaty, which can make dodging tight clusters of shots iffy at best. Even if you use a passive buff you earn later to move faster, it's still not that accurate. There's also a dodge move that lets you zip across the screen quickly, but it doesn't offer any invincibility frames, so you're even more likely to run into something. There's no lives or continues; if you die, you go back to the start of whatever section in the level you were at. The sections are fairly short, so it's not really a big deal, but if you die at a boss you don't go back to the start of the boss fight. You're sent back to the start of the previous section and have to fight your way back to the boss. Even if it only takes a minute or a little more to get back to the boss, that can end up getting very frustrating.\n\nIt's also a rather short game. There are three levels, but each has three difficulties and two "Cursed" variants. Each difficulty plays differently enough that it's a significant difference, and the Cursed levels add modifiers to make the level harder, like faster enemy bullets or a larger hitbox. Beating levels will unlock new Ghosts and Relics (passive boosts you can equip, like the faster movement speed mentioned earlier and ones that will change how your Ghosts act), but it still didn't take very long to clear almost the entire game (the first level's final Curse is a real SOB and I still haven't managed to beat it).\n\nStill, I really enjoyed A City Sleeps and I'm still going back and playing it when I have some free time. Something about the rhythm action really clicks for me. The legnth of the game is certainly going to be a turn-off for some people, but if you're on the fence about it, definitely pick it up if you see it on sale. If you're ok with a shorter game experience, then get A City Sleeps.","October 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It plays like a wave-based side scroller, with intriguing mechanics that contribute both to the over-arching story, as well as add significantly to the gameplay, allowing it to feel very much like a noted title in the near-to-overflowing genre.\n\nYou are a girl. I wasn't paying much attention to the story the first time around. You have to attack these robot things, and sometimes they get a little rough. Thankfully, you have spirits that aid in your struggle. So far I've only gotten two spirits, but with all the slots I have available, I'm very anxious to scoop up the rest. Attach a spirit to an altar when the time comes, and they will assist you by attacking, healing, and presumeably in other ways as well.\n\nThe game is also heavily based on the music in the background, which, considering the developers, shouldn't come as much of a surprise. The pulse of your weapon is timed to the background music, as well as the rate of fire for any spirits you have. The world moves with the music as well, getting more aggressive as the music does, and vice versa. Many times, it feels like the music is changing with the game, but in this case, it feels like just the opposite.\n\nCurrently the price sits at a snug 10 dollars. I wish I could say I've played enough to suggest it's worth the price, but if what I've played is all there is to the title, it feels mildly steep.

In total it took me about 7 hours to finish the game, which wasn't difficult but takes some getting used to. I would recommend playing on a controller it may end up being easier to control, I played through the game using only keyboard and it didn't feel terrible but for anyone not used to playing a SHMUP using a keyboard, they should get a controller.\n\nThe only drawback to the game is there are only 3 stages, each one will unlock an increased difficulty once the stage is beaten. Due to this it does feel a bit repetitive. The thing that changes this up is that the ghosts (powerups) that unlock after beating certain stages does change the way you would play a level and that keeps things fresh for a little while.\n\nThis is made by Harmonix so the soundtrack is very good and since the music flows with the bullets and powerups when everything works it really feels like you can predict where you should be to avoid bullets. For anyone that really enjoys the SHMUPS from Treasure or Ikaruga, this may be too easy of a game but is still worth a playthrough.","January 2","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I cut my teeth on the bullet hell subgenre with this game and enjoyed it. Played it to the first credits roll (as of this writing.) It gets a bad rap on the rest of the internet because it's thin content-wise. There are three stages with five difficulty variations, two of which are identical to previous difficulties with extra handicaps. Beating levels unlocks "relics" (equippable power-ups) and "ghosts" (which can be slotted into "idols" in a level to heal, do damage, etc.) which allows you to customize your loadout. There isn't much of a story. The flavor text accompanying each level describe the player character (Poe) and her place in the world. She's a "silkworm," a working-class exorcist in a futuristic city who dives into people's dreams to free them of malevolent kami (which are basically thetans) to make ends meet. I like the aesthetic, the sound design, and enjoyed playing it. After playing another game (Undertale) I wanted to try a bullet hell game and this fit the bill. It's kind of a shame that there's not much here.","December 19, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed how everything - your bullets, the enemy spawns, and the enemy bullets - is determined by the music. There are three stages - each stage contains two checkpoints on your way to the stage's boss. There are three difficulty levels, with challenge twists on two of them - effectively making for five difficulty levels.\n\nYou control a character who shoots bullets and controls ghosts, which she can place as power-ups at certain times in the level. The ghosts can help you deal with enemies or refill lost health. There's also a close combat mechanic which you can use to charge up for a unique and powerful move. As you progress through the game, you unlock relics (buffs) and more ghosts, which make for some nice variety.\n\nThis is not a big budget game, but I enjoyed the art style; it has a nice charm to it. I really love the music in this game too, which is important when so much of the gameplay is tied to it.\n\nThe more time I put into the game getting better, the more rewarding it felt when I finally beat a tough level - sometimes after 15-20 deaths. I might have given up on some games with that kind of death count, but I felt compelled to keep going and challenging myself with this game.\n\nI agree with others who wish there was some more content. There is a lot to master here (at least for someone like me who had little experience in this kind of game), but another stage or two would have been great.\n\nI'd love to see some more games with this kind of music-infused gameplay.","October 19, 2014","true","25.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Not only does the game still display controller settings instead of keyboard and mouse (the usual), it dumps you imemdiately into a tutorial as soon as you fire up that displays those controller cues while disabling the MENU system, so you can't even back out. So you end up banging every key until you find out what is what, but the response from the keyboard isn't timed right, so it doesn't always register your presses. Actually had to kill the game from Task Manager, since couldn't complete the tutorial since it wasn't registering the switch ghost command right.  When you do get up into SETUP, you still can't adjust your control settings there. The option for setting keys is listed, but it only works for controllers. You actually have to edit a file while outside of the game to map your keys. And after all of that frustration, when you finally get it up and running, the game is short.

Fun gameplay with moderate replayability due to leaderboards.\n\nHowever, this game is SHORT.  There are a total of 3 different stages with its themed enemies and music, and this is just repeated with 5 difficulty levels.  With a game like this centered around music, I would have hoped for more stages with more opportunities for awesome music.\n\nIf there was more effort put into level creation, this would go highly recommended by me.  However, I would only recommend this if you can get it on sale.  $15 is a steep price of admission for a game with this amount of content.","December 20, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I cut my teeth on the bullet hell subgenre with this game and enjoyed it. Played it to the first credits roll (as of this writing.) It gets a bad rap on the rest of the internet because it's thin content-wise. There are three stages with five difficulty variations, two of which are identical to previous difficulties with extra handicaps. Beating levels unlocks "relics" (equippable power-ups) and "ghosts" (which can be slotted into "idols" in a level to heal, do damage, etc.) which allows you to customize your loadout. There isn't much of a story. The flavor text accompanying each level describe the player character (Poe) and her place in the world. She's a "silkworm," a working-class exorcist in a futuristic city who dives into people's dreams to free them of malevolent kami (which are basically thetans) to make ends meet. I like the aesthetic, the sound design, and enjoyed playing it. After playing another game (Undertale) I wanted to try a bullet hell game and this fit the bill. It's kind of a shame that there's not much here.","December 19, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ommmmmm/recommended/316180/","ommmmmm","CannonFodder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ommmmmm/","235 products in account","A middling bullet-hell shooter with dual-stick mechanics whose soundtrack far exceeds the game itself. I found myself wanting to just listen to the music more than actually play.\n\nSeveral points make the game somewhat frustrating:\n\n* Your attack rate is not consistent. It is tied to the beat of the music. While usually at a good clip, there are some spots where it slows down.\n* Not shooting isn't really an option. When you stop tilting the stick, a significant chunk of the music goes mute, which diminishes my enjoyment of the game.\n* Tied in with that, dual-stick shooting gets really old really fast when you can't let up.\n* No bombs. You have to earn your bomb by closing to melee range at hitting enemies, which turns your ranged attack into a melee one.\n* Doesn't feel good. I don't really feel in-control of movement, as the game feels too sluggish to warrant the "only your core takes damage" dodges that a bullet-hell shmup demand, and using the dash is an exercise in "point in a general direction and hope you didn't point the stick one or two degrees off". I recognize that the game is themed around dreaming, and sometimes when you dream you get a floating feeling where you fly around, but you can't have that in a bullet hell. It's gotta be precise.\n\nIf you can get the soundtrack alone, it's great. But I think the music is wasted on this game.","January 10","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
