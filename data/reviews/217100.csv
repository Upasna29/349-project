Bringing this game to PC and trying to uphold that reputation is no easy feat.  However, Dementium II HD does fairly good job at its redention of the DS horror classic.\n\n4/5 Controls: With average customizability and controller support, the game offers industry standard customizations (i.e. sensitivity, key mapping, etc.)\n\n4.5 /5 Graphics: Trying to hold true to the DS roots, the game presents very minimalisitic graphics (you won't need a GTX 680 anytime soon to play this at 60 fps) which do add to the quality of the game (In my opinion lower quality graphics tend to lean towards a more scary experience).  What they've done was revamped the qualtity acceptable enough for current PC users.\n\n4/5 Story: If you've played the DS version there's nothing new for you here.  Crazy doctor, his wierd experiments, main character is in a mental hospital, its pretty self explanatory but it creates a good basis for a horror game.\n\n4/5 Gameplay: Controls in horror games differ tremeandously, with each game trying to seperate itself from the others; Dementium II HD is no exception to this trend.  You're provided a standard PC FPS experience however the combat does vary slightly from other FPS genres (i.e. The guns' crosshair has some lag to it when turning making aiming a little more challenging)\n\n4/5 Music: The remastered and newly scored music for the HD release is quite a nostalgic experience to that of the DS version.  The music could be cut out here and there to give the atmosphere of the game a darker and lonelier feeling.\n\nAt the moment there are some glitches here and there but nothing you wouldn't expect in a game's first release.\n\n\nIn all, there's no reason you shouldn't be happy with spending $15 on this game considering its current status.\nThere's much to be ammended in the game before its a perfect port of the DS version (I would have been happy with a port of the DS version with just the addition of PC controls).\n\nIn all this game deserves a 4/5 (not averaged).\nIt's shy of amazing, but you won't be slamming your head on the desk wondering why you bought it in the first place.","December 17, 2013","true","2.3"," 403 of 568 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","403","568","2","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/217100/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Dementium II was a Nintendo DS FPS-Horror game, sequel to Dementium: The Ward. I never played either of them, so I can't say how this compares to the original, but I can say a general opinion on the title, and how it stands on the Steam market.\n\nFirstly, you'll have to acknowledge its DS origins to understand some of the design decisions in the game. The combat is somewhat simplistic for a FPS. Enemies do react to being hit in certain spots more than others, but it feels somewhat simplified. The beginning enemies especially are noticeable as you start the game with just a knife, and the first few are pretty simplistic (enemies that just try to approach you and hit you with a melee attack). How you attack, how the enemies react... It all has a very handheld feel to it, combined that most objects in the environment have simple geometry and some of the textures are kind of low. Not a terrible looking game, but it does look a bit dated. The graphics have been completely reworked for the HD version, but it mainly tries to update them rather than fully modernize them.\n\nThe audio also is notciable just upgraded DS tunes as well. The music is not bad, there's actually some very nice songs in the collection, but it sounds like Silent Hill 1-level quality. Also, the game has a bad habit of making a certain battle theme playing when enemies are near. It isn't TOO repetitive, but you will hear the song a number of times before the game is up. But the sounds can be pretty competent to fit the mood.\n\nBut the game does a good job at slowly but surely introducing new elements and enemies to keep things interesting. The enemies are surprisingly varied, and new ones keep on getting added until the last fourth of the game. I hear the original game had respawning enemies, but that's thankfully not the case here. Enemies don't respawn when backtracking or re-entering a room, which is nice and makes defeating enemies with supplies feel worthwhile. You can run in most instances though if you feel so inclined. Bosses, while not amazing, are pretty good. Definitely not bad, more than serviceable, so yeah, pretty good. And like the normal enemies, they're pretty varied. There's a few puzzles tossed into the mix, no real brain teasers, but they can be fun little distractions, and like other elements, they switch-up the puzzles so you aren't doing too much of the same thing. In fact, I have to applaud the developers on trying to switch things up enough to avoid the game from becoming too repetitive. The locations even are pretty varied and feel different, and even backtracking doesn't really overdo itself. The locations main 'themes' switch between asylum-type levels, nightmare-type levels, and outdoor snowy-type levels, but they each have a different sub-theme and different environments and design. The developers seemed to have found a sweet middleground for making elements familiar, but not treading too much of the same ground to be repetitive.\n\nThe game isn't scary. Tense sometimes, but the game never really tries to scare you. No scripted scares, no jump scares... Which could be a good thing. The game simply uses audio, and its environment and monsters. The atmosphere can be tense sometimes, and even creepy, but the game possibly relies too much on its combat for itself to really settle in.\n\nAnd that's one thing you'll need to know about Dementium. It is a very action-focused title. While you can run from most encounters, you will be fighting a lot of enemies, with limited supplies, and the monsters are the main focus of the game. There's a total of 10 weapons in the game, and each feels very different, though noticeably you gain five of the game's ten weapons in the last third of the game, and three weapons right in the final chapter, making how they're spread maybe a bit uneven.\n\nI'd say it's a good game, not an AMAZING game, but if something that's like a mixture between Doom and Silent Hill interests you, this may be right up your alley. Not a bad game, or a bad remake, I'd give it a solid 6-8 our of 10, but keep in mind its handheld origins definitely show and I did find a few of the game's enemies a bit frustrating, and the combat was pretty simple. Can be a very nostalgic feeling game, if that's what you're looking for.","December 18, 2013","true","11.4"," 200 of 295 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","200","295","0","1"

Not because its scary, not because the story is rich or you get attached to the characters but because it really is as awful as everyone says it is. Clunky and broken controls, clipping textures and repetitive combat are just three reasons why I wouldn't recommend this even if it were free. Nothing strategic about the boss battles just spam the attack button and make sure you dodge their *special power* and they're beaten. Nothing HD about this either.. graphics are average at best and this game proves to be just another bad port. Sometimes I really hate being a completionist because I have to force myself to play through terrible games like this one. It was honestly painful. Save your money, save your time, save yourself the frustration.. this game is definitely not worth any of it.","August 29, 2014","false","13.1"," 64 of 90 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","64","90","2","18"

That said you can immediately notice the graphics that are not on par with today's PC standards. Also, the gameplay is simple, the controls are a bit non-responsive and the story is not exactly long. You can complete William's story in a mere 3 hours.\n\nStill, Dementium 2 can be fun. It is a horror FPS game and you have all the weapons you need in such a game (knife, flamethrower) along with all the monstrosities you expect to jump at you at every corner. During the gameplay you proceed from room to room annihilating mentioned monstrosities while occasionally picking up an object only to use it elsewhere to overcome an obstacle.\n\nI like how the game transitions you sometimes - while half of it takes place in a mental institution and in its surrounding village and caves the other half puts you in the same areas but in a hellish, underworld-like environment. One could call it a day and night cycle that is often repeated.\n\nDementium is mediocre at best but a good pastime. If you have nothing on your plate and do not desire to pick your next AAA game up you can have fun with it. Its low price can also get you closer to making this decision.","November 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","0"

It is a sequel to Dementium: The Ward, and expands on the original with more enemies, abilities, weapons etc. Playing Dementium II felt like a cross between Silent Hill and The Evil Within. You switch from a normal environment to some kind of demented horror environment, which overlaps your reality. You play as William Redmoor, who is trapped in a Prison mental health facility and is experiencing waking nightmares.\n\nVisually the game isn't as modern looking as The Evil Within, but it's not bad either. It's got some good moments where something jumps out and scares you, or you encounter a monster and have to fight with a knife, but the AI seems rather simple even on harder difficulties. The story is interesting, but drawn out and you get pieces of it at a time.

The back and forth item collection of the same areas really shows this used to be a ds game as I imagine the creators had to utilise a limited amount of space. The combat is not satisfying and becomes incredibly tedious once a rhythm is formed. The same kind experience can be given from a free half-life mod called cry of fear and in my opinion is a creepier game than this one. For a more weapon and combat orientated experience I would recommend the painkiller games.","December 19, 2013","false","3.7"," 171 of 291 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","171","291","0","0"

I also finished Moon on DS. And I remember getting this game and playing for about 30 minutes before my DS got stolen one day. I didn't even get a taste of what this game was like.\n\nYou see, Dementium: The Ward was pretty amazing, because it's one of the few first person survival horror games I can think of on the DS. Sure, it was buggy, sure, the animations were wonky, sure, one of the worst parts, enemies respawned all the time, and suuure, the game was ♥♥♥♥ing short. I managed to finish it on a single sitting.\n\nNow, I got this years ago. I got to play Dementium II back when it first game out, and when I found out that they were making a PC port, I was excited. I'll be able to finally seal this chapter of my life.\n\nWell, I guess the game didn't age well at all. Unlike Obscure.  The port seems lazy, the visuals look like something out of the PS2 era, the sounds are atrocious most of the time, and the controls feel kinda...Laggy. I swear, it feels like some of your attacks, or even when you stop moving ,there's this momentum before anything happens. Less than a second, but still quite noticeable.\n\nThe game is rather short. I managed to finish it in less than 4 hours. The achievements can't be all unlocked in a single sitting, though. Because you need to re-do some of the boss fights with a different weapon to get some of them.\n\nThe world is heavily inspired by Silent Hill, and the monsters seem to be, too, yet they don't even come close to being scary most of the time. Same for the ambience.\nThis game feels lackluster, unpolished, the animations are terrible at times, and all in all, it's not really scary. I think what made the original Dementium amazing was the fact that there was not much like it on the DS at the time, and when translated to the PC (albeit, lazily), where there's MUCH better games out there, this game feels vastly inferior and mediocre. The ending is completely underwhelming, too and the final boss was a pushover. The storytelling was...Not that good. I mean, I enjoyed it. I've got a thing for mediocre games, and I like the dementium games as dumb as they are, but for the average Joe, I wouldn't recommend it.","April 6","false","5.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyraarane/recommended/217100/","tyraarane","Tyraa Rane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyraarane/","780 products in account","TL;DR: This game feels like it really, really wants to be The Suffering (particularly in terms of story and setting), which is what I recommend you go play instead.\n\nGraphics-wise, for a Nintendo DS port, it's not bad when bumped up to Fantastic quality. I didn't have any problems running it on my system in terms of FPS, so it's not like it's a bad port, but I wouldn't call it "HD" either. Sound quality's a more mixed bag; some sounds were okay (I think because they were fixed in a patch), whereas others are tinny and very low fidelity.\n\nWhere Dementium II really falls down is the gameplay. Enemies are bullet sponges, and there's no discernable difference between most weapons. It takes the same number of shells, bullets, flamethrower uses, etc. to kill most common enemies. Except for sometimes, when one inexplicably dies in one shot (maybe I got a headshot? It's hard to tell where hitboxes are with the enemies' herky-jerky movements), and other times, when one inexplicably takes 6+ bullets to kill. I don't even know.\n\nThey do try to mix it up a few times, mostly with the bosses (the fight against "The Giant" was actually kind of fun). And sometimes with unkillable enemies, or enemies that KO and then revive, because everyone loves wasting ammunition! ...Seriously, the combat is borderline atrociously bad.\n\nOn the plus side, it was only ~5 hours long, and I got it on sale for <$4 USD. ...Still though. Just go play The Suffering. Trust me.","March 22, 2015","false","4.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/217100/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","A lot of horror games seem to forget that at the end of the day, their game is supposed to be fun. You can cram it full of weird monsters and spooky notes and jumpscares all you want, but if it's not fun to play, no one's going to care. Dementium feels like it really takes that to heart, balling up a bunch of common elements and a few cliches in a package entertaining enough that you won't care about the details.\n\nYou play William Redmoor, apparently the same guy as in the original Dementium, whose brain problems have landed him in an oddly secure mental hospital. You have a habit of hallucinating some very Painkiller-looking monsters, and indeed your perception shifts between the hospital and its baton-wielding security guards and some gritty, monster-filled hell dimension. It's a pretty good hook, if not a terribly original one, but the game throws in a bunch of neat details to spice it up. You have a full map of each area, and there are all sorts of side rooms and locked doors that you need additional weapons or items to access. It feels almost Metroidy, except for that the core path is quite linear and there are no real secrets, just places to remember to backtrack to.\n\nThere's a pretty good spread of monsters as well, though they tend to lean towards melee types and aren't particularly fast or threatening. They have a ton of health, which can make fights tedious, but to be fair, so do you, hence the lack of threat. Outside of their Clive Barkery appearance they're not particularly scary. Dementium also likes setting up enemy arenas and gauntlets to work through, and with the generous amounts of health the enemies have these can really bust up the game flow, and not in a good way. New weapons and foes come quickly enough to keep you interested and moving forward, though.\n\nWhat really got me about Dementium was how fleshed out it is as a game, despite the core gameplay and combat being a little cheap and weak. There's a perfectly good tutorial baked into the opening of the game that gets you right into the action. You have an inventory screen where you can fiddle with items and check your selection of health and buff supplies. You get to leave the hospital behind after the first chapter and explore some outdoor areas. The cutscenes are clean and frequent, even if the animation quality is lacking. And even the story tries to be a little different, with a mysterious antagonistic doctor talking about his plot to create the very real monsters from your own brain.\n\nFor a title originally released on the DS, Dementium II HD is a solid, well-rounded FPS adventure that really doesn't suffer for its console origins. Each of its many parts is polished and arranged with the others to form a legitimately entertaining package. As long as the combat doesn't wear you out, you'll find plenty of fun in this one, something that can be hard to find in other horror games.","October 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

This is a fantastic game as it not only is a horror game, but also a puzzle game. I have seen the version for this game on the nintendo DS and I thought it was incredible for it's time, but the controlls were a bigger question mark.

It's not the most revolutionary thing, but it's got some heart.\n\nAll of what I just said there applies to the DS version. The HD version did NOTHING to improve the gameplay, and it really shows. The enemies are easy to dodge now that you have WASD movement instead of DPAD+Touch screen, enemies require way too many hits to kill considering how little ammo you get, the level design is too spacious and devoid of much to do, and the sound is reused from the DS version in all its low bitrate.\n\nThese could be all surmountable problems if the combat had felt smooth and polished, but it's not. It's the same "strafe back and forth out of enemy's attack range with melee weapons" combat you've probably seen in other games, and shooting feels stiff and lacking any punch. I attribute the latter's problems to the Unity engine (which this game runs on), mainly because I'm of the belief that it takes serious work to make something look/feel good in that engine. As an aside, if you do want to see a good example of a well-polished Unity engine game, take a look at Endless Legend.\n\nSadly, the game being "HD" tampers with its general horror theme. Better controls means you aren't struggling against them during fights, better view distance makes areas that were once thick with darkness reveal just how empty they really are, and the lighting feels static and blandly applied. Even the animations for the weapons feel too floaty and lacking the correct feeling of power that they should have.\n\nUltimately, Dementium II HD just feels like a straight "pretty-ing up" of the game, and misses the opportunity to refine and tweak gameplay to fit for a game free of the DS's tight resource restrictions. In many ways, the performance limits helped Dementium II feel tense and scary, but the PC version fails in that regard. Dementium II is a good game, but only on the DS.","March 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Much of it feels rather stiff (obviously dictated by its original platform), especially in the movement - and I say this as some who thinks the movement in System Shock 2 is completely appropriate for the respective game.\n\nFurther perplexing is how much focus there is on combat, given the system it was first developed for.  While there are times where just running away is an option, they often put you in situations where you must destroy all the enemies in an area to proceed.  This feels like it works against the general vibe of the game, which seems to be shooting for (and accomplishing to some extent) a true survival horror quality.  I feel they should've focused on more of the Resident Evil-like puzzles the game had, and leaving combat as a secondary option.\n\nThe classic Silent Hill inspirations are very prominant, right down to the nightmare world changes.  Mix in some Hellraiser, and you've got the general visual design.  This and the audio design are where the game shines the most.  Still hampered by being an up-rezzed port of a DS game, but you can definitely feel the artistic ability the team has in these areas.\n\nIn all, it reminds me of Blue Stinger - a game that's not horrible, but having a few poorly thought out aspects that hold it back from being a great game.  If you need something to at least scratch that survival horror itch in these days of action horror games, this will do alright, giving you about three to four hours of relief.\n\n(Those jumping puzzles near the end though, Jesus Christ.  Just horrible game design, especially for a game with terrible jumping.)","July 4, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Alright.\nDementium II on DS? Great. My favourite game on the DS.\nDementium II on PC? Terrible.\n\nThis game was made out to be a complete remake of the game for PC. What we got was a lazy port of the DS Version, which runs worse than it does on the DS, with much clunkier controls and hit detection.\n\nIt has slightly better graphics, granted. But the better textures actually take away from the immersion and horror, removing the Silent Hill-esque feeling of the game. Oh and they added a "new" monster (reskinned version of another monster) where there should be no monster.

I think a lot of people didn't know what to expect when this game came out. (It's basically a PC port of a Nintendo DS game.) It stays true to the original Dementium 2.\nThe AI isn't anything special and the graphics aren't anything spectacular, but it does have some cool monsters. Most of them won't put up much of a fight though. The hit detection is a pain, but if you manuever just right it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nIf you're expecting this game to be like Resident Evil, then you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for kicks, and in the mood for a really campy horror movie, then you might like this game.\n\nUpdate: I can no longer recommend this game due to a game breaking glitch.

Now that I've reached the colossus, and the dynomite isn't working, (The dynomite is needed to kill colossus.)

For a horror based game this sort of thing wears thin really fast.\n\nMost of the rooms are pretty bare and the texturs aren't very high definition.  This kind of looks like something I would see on maybe a console game a few years ago, but not what I would expect on the PC now.  If I wanted to play this sort of thing, I would have bought an older console.\n\nIf you like this sort of combat, and similar foes, I reccomend getting Doom 3 instead, it's a lot more detailed, with similar suprises, and less locked down combat.   If your looking for a more explorative horror game, where you do less fighting and more sneaking....  go for Outlast, or Amnisia.\n\nI can see now why this was discounted down to two dollars, but I'm still dissapointed in this kind of quality in a modern PC game, even if it was originally made for the DS.","August 9, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved these games because unlike many indie survival horror games that use cheap jump-scares, these games heavily utilized the environment to unsettle the player, similar to Silent HIll (the player is even taken to another world while he searches for his wife). So I was excited when I heard they were going to make and HD port, unfortunately, this port was not made by the original dev team, and it shows.\n\nThis port has "cleaned up" all the visuals, the environments are not as dirty and rusty as they were. At points it even has a cartoony look to it, taking away any unsettling feeling the original gave off. The indoor areas are suppose to be the scariest part due to them being dark and the player would rely on the flashlight, yet here they're bright enough to not even need the flashlight, worse still, most of them give off sunlight through the windows or cracks. The weapons feel weaker, they don't have the same kick. During some cutscenes, only one side of the speakers gave off any audio. If you wanna know how much the visuals were "cleaned up", simply look at the box arts between the original and this HD port.\n\nThe original is a great indie survival horror game, this port undoes most of the visuals the original did so beautifully. I recommend buying the original on the Nintendo DS or getting an emulator.","August 11, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as it goes it is much, much worse than the original DS version which was an excellent game for the system. This HD port has poor graphics, running at half of the framerate of the original, with weird and clunky enemy animations, awful hit detection and an annoying control scheme that makes the game fairly boring, especially some minor enemies that seem almost impossible to kill without getting hit a lot first. That goes for both melee and firearms. The sound department is ok, nothing spectacular but it manages to do its job. As for the story, well it is confusing and after a while, I really didn't care at all. The achievements are somewhat easy and manageable to get on the first round if you don't mess it up.

When i first reviewed this game I thought it was rather good. See, the thing is, somehow, the HD PC PORT OF A DS GAME is worse than the DS version in every way. The controls are ♥♥♥♥, and somehow the guns are harder to aim than the DS version, which used a ♥♥♥♥ing touch pad to control it. The weapons, while being better graphically, are worse designed. For example, in the DS version, the sledgehammer actually looks like a hammer. But the PC version just looks like a stick with a brick attached to the end. It's small annoyances like this that kill the game for me. Another oddity is that when firing the revolver, there is a short delay between the muzzle flash and the kickback of the shot, which makes the revolver feel like one of the worst feeling weapons to use the entire games industry. There are more things, but it's mostly just small ♥♥♥♥ like that. How did they ♥♥♥♥ this up? I'm a big fan of the Dementium games, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of them back in the DS days. But they've gone and ♥♥♥♥ed it. ♥♥♥♥ed it into tiny, little bite-sized pieces. Get the DS version, it's just plain better, somehow. Scarier, more fun to play. But, if it's absolutely impossible to get the DS version, this is still just passable. That is, if you're REALLY wanting to play this game. Expect to be disappointed playing the inferior PC version though.\nYeah, it's ♥♥♥♥ basically. 5/10 for the PC version .

Also, normally the escape button pauses the game, but you can not pause the game within the first few minutes to change settings or controls. So therefore I have no idea how to do anything without rebooting the game and watching the cutscenes over again. Speaking of the cutscenes, they are mashed together very poorly with the main gameplay. The cutscenes frequently break the flow of momentum. I fought the first boss with a knife. Or rather, a shank. This boss was a big ugly monster that should of clearly overpowered me, but instead I was easily able to kill him with my shank. Then the guy who unleashed the moster on me says "that's just a glimpse of what I can do." That immediatly turned me off to the rest of the game. Did I mention the poor voice acting?

I did buy it 75% off though, in which case I WOULD recommend it.\n\nANYWAYS:\n\nThis really IS an HD port from the DS, i'm not sure why people keep saying it's not "HD". Model quality is really nice, goes up to 1080p resolution-wise, and I wouldn't have ever guessed it was originally on the DS. However, the AI, the story, certain gameplay mechanics, and some other things REALLY bring this game down.\n\nThe story is just a cookie-cutter plot where a man wakes up in a mental asylum and then some Resident Evil rejects pop out of Hell or something, and you shoot them in the face with a terrible aiming system. Since the game was originally put on the DS, the crosshair isn't fixed. It jumps around like a jackrabbit on steroids, making some firearms pretty much useless. I found myself using the shank more than I did the revolver. The small areas you explore seperated by doors are all to accomodate for the DS and its lack of hardware to produce large environments. Which, I understand. It's all good on the DS. But when you put it on PC, it just kinda feels clunky and breaks the immersion a bit. (One good thing I noticed is that I haven't encountered one loading screen yet, so A+ for that)\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\nGraphics            8/10\nStory                 5/10\nGameplay          7/10\nReplayability      3/10 (Based on assumptions)\n\nWorth $15 bucks? Nope. Wait for a Steam sale.","June 9, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I thought it'd be a good deal for $1.99 considering how much potential this game has. The graphics aren't worthy to be considered HD, as some models look like they're of the early PS2 era, yet some details are high quality, it doesn't look too good for a Unity engine game. The gameplay is unchanged from its DS counterpart, albeit that it's mediocre due to the lack of alterations, enemies are stupid and don't serve as a threat, firearms lack hit detection even when you blast them at point-blank range, and I can't get far enough into the game as it just crashes as soon as I defeat an enemy or enter a different area (I bought this game yesterday and I tried playing it today, crashes just started occuring.) Sound is decent, some are ripped straight from Counter-Strike, Dementium II itself and some of its own sounds, yet the Dementium II sounds are still compressed, that's not good. The story is the same as the original DII so I won't spoil it. Do not buy this game, get the DS version or if you want this so badly, just get it, be aware of the possible game-breaking bugs that might occur.","August 5, 2014","false","4.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I expected the graphics to be dated, I mean it's  a DS port, so know that this thumbs down has nothing to do with the graphics... It's the game play.  It feels like I'm playing a tablet game with a mouse and keyboard.  The old, move forward slash, back up, to dodge, move forward slash, back up, rinse and repeat until the enemy falls down is literally how 90% of the combat plays out.  The remaining 10% is using firearms that are not nearly as effective as the melee attacks and run out of ammo quickly.  It's one of those games that just re-spawns enemies over and over again to fill time.  Oh the door is magically closed until you kill the same two enemies 5 times that spawn on opposite ends of the room and move very slowly.  The floating black clouds with 6 glowing eyes are the worst part of this game.  They teleport you to an arena where you fight... You guessed it 2 guys on opposite ends of the room that re-spawn 2 times apiece and then re-spawn on the opposite two walls 2 times.  And you don't just go through this once, OH NO, that would be too easy.  They force you to go through this every time you touch the black cloud and the black cloud doesn't go away after the arena, oh no he re-spawns and there are at times 3 of these guys in a room and each one will send you to the same arena, again and again and again.  The levels are very small, so in some ways you should feel comfortable like you couldn't get lost, but there is a lot of back tracking and little areas where you have to do something in area A before you can open a door in area C, but there is no reason area C would be unlocked no other than "magic".  I hate that kind of thing..  At least they had a good reason with the whole sledge hammer weapon (you can knock down wooden barricades) but the entire nature of these game feels like it's trying to stretch out it's game play as long as possible and it gets down right boring.  It's not scary, it's not exciting and it feels slow to the point where it's not fun.  That is my opinion of this game.  I sadly pre-ordered it...  *sigh*","December 28, 2013","false","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I honestly was.  I even played it right up to what turned out to be - upon quick consultation of a walkthrough - a room mere MINUTES away from the final boss battle.  A room full of platforms one has to jump across, with fiery death awaiting just below.  A room which was not the first but the SECOND of such rooms, in quick succession to each other; in a game which had precisely NO tricky jumping bits PRIOR to these moments.  But most importantly...a room which was SEVERAL MINUTES away from the last save or check-point.  And what did I do?  I misjudged one of the jumps, and died.  And frankly, found myself lacking the will to try again.  EVER again.\n\nUp until that point, I was going to sum this game up in one word:  "Fine".  No great shakes, certainly lacking in ambition...but y'know..."fine".  "Okay".  "Passable".  And I'm still going to use those words, if only because when a game is this simplistic and repetitious, does it really matter that I didn't actually SUFFER through the final boss battle - which looked awfully like, y'know, a pretty standard final boss battle - and merely WATCHED it in a video walkthrough?  I don't think it would have enriched my life greatly to actually finish the game; though I do believe that passing on such an honour has left me short at least one whole Achievement.\n\nOh well.  Sometimes life is tough, but we must all endure.  Sometimes we must look our failures unerringly in the face, and say:  "I am still a worthwhile human being.  Even though I lacked the patience to REPLAY THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF DEMENTIUM ♥♥♥♥ING II ♥♥♥♥ING HD, just to fight SOME ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID WORM CREATURE WHICH SOMEHOW, BAFFLINGLY CONSTITUTES THE FINAL NEMESIS OF A "PSYCHOLOGICALLY"-THEMED HORROR GAME SET IN AN ASYLUM...does not mean that I am not a worthwhile entity in the scope of the greater universe.  I still have a valid contribution to make, even if it won't be GETTING THAT STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING ACHIEVEMENT.  But hey...I still have all the hair on my head.  And that's more important, to have a full head of hair than to TEAR IT ALL ♥♥♥♥ING OUT BECAUSE SOME STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING THRIFT-SHOP GAME DESIGNERS COULDN'T BE BOTHERED STICKING ANY ♥♥♥♥ING SAVE POINTS ANYWHERE NEAR THE END.  I am...still valid...worthwhile...deep breaths...deep breaths..."\n\nFunny thing is, up to that point, one of my main "complaints" about the game was going to be that it was a tiny bit too easy.  I mean, I had 4 medkits and 14 bottles of pills on me when I died.  But did all this healing I'd saved up during the rest of the game save me from dying when I fell into the flames?  Noooooooo.  And what about that ridiculous amount of ammo I'd conserved...could I maybe use that to...FIGHT the flames as they devoured my body?  Noooooooooooooooooo.  Am I ever liable to play this rather shoddy (and not exactly "HD"-looking) Nintendo DS port again?  ♥♥♥♥ nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  And I wouldn't recommend anyone else doing so for the princely sum of fifteen dollars, either.  But if you're a glutton for punishment, and don't mind wasting a bunch of hours on a game haunted by the ghosts of the countless similar yet superior games which have trodden these well-worn floors so many times before, it might just be worth picking up in a sale for a fiver.  MIGHT.

Renegade Kid followed it up with a fantasic sequel that may not have been purely survival-horror, but found a great mix between action and horror elements with ambient spaces, creepy enemies, and a story which didn't come out and answer everything, letting the player be immeresed in the both the confusion and dreadful mystery of it all. It was by no means a spectacular game, but I was a fan of it despite the flaws. The HD port takes everything I loved about the DS version and throws it out the window. Where the gritty graphics complemented the DS's capabilities, the graphics for this game can hardly be considered HD. They look plasticy and the models can hardly look creepy when they look so clean and polished. The ambient music is gone to, some new tracks do add feeling to empty areas, but some area's music was swapped out for something that doesn't fit the mood. The combat has been scaled way back to the point of a boring chore. Where the DS weapons felt like they had weight and stopping power on the endless horde, the weapons in the PC version feel like you're shooting NERF darts at the enemies, and that's if you can hit them at all because the camera is so dang choppy when more than one enemiy come on screen. It's not my computer, I have a great computer. But looking around feels like the character has a mental problem. Also, there is a half second delay between clicking and using a weapon, which makes timing shots or swings at a fast enemy nearly impossible. The game also introduces a new enemy, an invincible snow ghost which rushes you out of an area, but they put them in the more atmospheric of areas and take away from exploration into just what is going on in the story.

Dementium II HD has a very 90s FPS feel to it. I'd describe it as Doom meets Silent Hill. On one hand you have the  FPS action of the classic Doom games, and on the other you have disturbing visuals in the likeness of the first Silent Hill.\n\nGraphically, it's not likely to win any awards. However, given that it was originally a Nintendo DS title, I'd say the developers did a pretty good job with it.\n\nThe combat, at times, can be a bit repetitive. In many cases, you simply grab your shank and hack to your heart's content while circle strafing. There seems to be a decent enough enemy variety, though, to keep things flowing nicely.

Which brings my first point why the 2nd game for a remake and not the first, come on guys thats a bad move as mentioned for new players in the series.\n\nNow the graphics aren't "HD" HD and more PS2 - pre xbox 360, the textures of mainly the creatures are not that great compared to the DS version, the enemys look  way too clean, unlike the DS version where they look menacing from being covered partially in blood and dirt. The actual cut scenes are way nicer looking and really makes the games graphic quality i mentioned show.\n\nThe actual horror ambience is gone as you no longer need the flashlight, yeah even with the gamma and my screen brightness turned down i can see around the room clearly.\n\nCombat has some clunky lag when it comes to the hammer and knife but otherwise alright. Also the relics second function doesnt work. Also enemy difficulty is well easier with most of the enemys besides the freaking laughing guys, not sure of there name i think its "hoppers". By easier i mean you won't get hit much, the main concept of shooting the "Chest-maws" or for some "Freaks" heart dead centre for an insta kill is still there but besides that most enemys have a lag hit detect or death animationwhich is pretty annoying,same goesfor the monster sound effects, now its not my computer trust me when i say the sound/hit/ and death lags happenthey happen at RANDOM. Not all the time but at random.\n\nNow to the big main thing of Dementium that i loved it for, the tension, in this HD version its been removed, not sure if it was to welcome new players or what but this practically breakes the game. No pitch black rooms that limit your vision, no inventory limitations to make you make sure each shot counts so you don't have to go toe to toe and the bosses even on the hardest difficulty have been nerfed. The DS versions first boss on normal is alot more difficult to take out, even on the HD versions hardest difficulty the DS versions normal difficulty is harder. Also towards the end they added an un-necessary death pit at the only worst part of the game, sudden platforming, will waste 10 minutes of your time if you fall in it, originally youd just spawn back at the pit with some health damage but now you gotta walk all the way back.\n\nAnother problem is the flash light being used with a duel hand weapon, in the DS version this was never possible, (in the first game you couldnt use a flash light and weapon at the same time) which means no need to try and find your nemy in the dark without your light.\n\nAnother grip is the achievments, everyone knows they bugged out and 1 still is, another doesnt have enough ammo for the weapon to get the kills.\n\nFinally my ultimate problem with this is the missing survival mode, yeah new players who get the HD version you'r missing out.\n\nI stongly recommend you get the DS version, i recommend this if you can't locate the rare gem's but keep in mind the tag's should read, "Action" "Indie" "Adventure", since all horror element is gone.\n\nP.S. to those who have seen images of a duel weilding mingun creature thats concept art for a non-existent enemy so stop asking.","July 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Graphics and gameplay feel and look like they were a couple of years ago and simply can’t compete with modern day horror games like Amnesia, F.E.A.R. or Dead Space. If you’re looking for a horror game, I suggest you look somewhere else. This game may have been a good title for the Nintendo DS, but it’s far from good for the PC.\n\nRead the full review at our website![3rd-strike.com]","January 10, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

No not really, the game is short, easy despite being clunky and a bit buggy, the plot makes no sense, dispite being 'HD' you can still tell it was a DS game, and even if some of the monster designs are alright you could just play one of the Silent Hill games and get the same effects wrapped in a much better package.\n\nI never played Dementium II on the Nintendo DS where it was originally released, but after beating this version I looked up videos of it and that seems like a much better game... doesn't look amazing or anything, but better then this, and worth pointing out the original developers of this game did not make the PC port.","November 1, 2014","false","3.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

I absolutely loved it, so I was excited upon hearing news of a HD PC port. This port however, turned out to be a disappointment. Poor, awkward controls (especially with the gun handling), and the choppy animations made combat dull while the cleaner "HD" graphics along just made the game look more cartoonish and took away the eerie atmosphere that the original had. There's also problems with graphic settings not saving, so you have to manually set that up every time you launch the game; not much of a problem of course, the game itself is relatively short, and the replay value is even lower than the original (it did not have a Survival mode the last time I played this port, and the original had one). Some achievements also don't work, so I advice achievement hunters to stray from this game.\n\nOverall, I found it to be a poor experience (especially compared to the original NDS game). I wouldn't recommend it at the original price of 15$, nor the current price of 10$. I do think it is worth a try when you see this game up on a sale, but fans of the series should prepare themselves for disappointment.\n\nEDIT: The review was actually just based off what I remember from a few months before typing this, and recently attempted the game so here are my thoughts: controls with mouse/keyboard are ♥♥♥, poor framerates, and the soundtrack is good. Original thoughts still hold true.\n\nI did mention that some achievements don't work so if you get this game, then re-attempt from a checkpoint several times (if its a kill-count specific achievement; though this didn't work for me), and if that doesn't work, start a new game.","December 11, 2014","false","14.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've read several other people posting that in the snowy area the game constantly crashes and from what I can gather there isn't a definitive solution to this issue.

What happend to his wife and daughter? We are tasked with escaping and chasing this mad doctor who happens to spew nonsense (to me) and that ending, seriously? I played all that for that end? I hardly felt anything was scary here.\n\nClearly there was some inspiration taken from Silent Hill, you can almost feel the presence of an atmosphere (real/nightmare world, mind tricks, bleak settings) too bad that's all i felt, a fleeting presence.\n\nGraphics are okay for a port from the DS. As for the music, was there even music in this game other than the starting screen? if there was forgive me cause it hardly made a impression on me.\n\nNow comes the combat and gameplay, see the real horror lies here, not in the story. Awkward movements, buggy combat and controls and those 3 platforms areas you need to jump across at the end? Absolutely terrible gameplay design, the jump mechanic is horrible and I play 2D platformers, just lazy from the developers. Also some achievements are buggy, i had to redo a couple of em to actually get them to register.\n\nIs this a good game? No, but if you're bored and/or you're a survival horror fan like me then by all means give this a try, it can be finished in a couple of hours (if you're not a achievement buff and even that isn't hard) just be sure to get this on a sale or in a bundle, this game is not worth the full price.","October 2, 2015","false","22.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The sound is poorly done.  The gameplay is plodding, and the combat is  clunky.  The enemies are more annoying than scary.  The "puzzles" are either childishly easy, or can simply be clicked around until solved at random.\n\nIn some ways this game calls to mind Ed Wood.  Someone with no storytelling talent, directoral ability, or artistic vision who nevertheless managed to make some absolutely terrible movies that people still watch.\n\nSo, is this game bad?  Yes.

I’m always intrigued when you see a 3DS game come to PC (or even a console), because I’m curious as to how it translates. The last game I played on PC that was a 3DS port was Resident Evil Revelations, and it was pretty decent.\n\nUnfortunately, Dementium II HD is not as good a port. I didn’t play it on 3DS, so I have absolutely no opinion on how it was before, but as a PC release, it’s…not so good. It has its moments, but is overall a subpar game in what is already a crowded genre.\n\nDisclaimer: I played for roughly 90 minutes, in which time I got through the village, collected the dagger and returned to the prison, going through it a little bit, before I decided not to keep going. The remainder of the time was letting the game run to collect the trading cards from it.\n\nProsStory seems decent and is interesting to see progress\nFairly lengthy, should take you a couple of hoursConsThe game is ugly, which can be somewhat explained because of it being a port, but still it’s pretty bad\nAnimations are clunky, especially when firing the revolver; I have never seen a handgun kickback the way that does\nMusic is repetitive and has obvious loop points, such as when it cuts abruptly, only to start back up\nModels are all the same; the guards in the prison all use the exact same model, which would be explained if the prison were staffed by clones, but that is not the case. I suppose this could also be a limitation because it’s a port (based on the 3DS’ limited capacity), but it’s called HD, it should try to be that\nEnemies are uninspired and repetitive; the creature with the gaping mouth on its chest are the most common, and they all look alike, not even a color variation\nVoices, whether it’s the foreign speaking prisoners or the guards all sound phoned in, with a weird echo sometimes; the guy who speaks to you over the speaker is the only decent actor\nThe exploration horror aspect is ruined by the inclusion of those ridiculous horde segments, where you have to fight a group of monsters before being allowed to continue; it breaks immersion\nVery predictable; big open room with a few cases of ammo and an item you need to open a door? You just know what that means: boss fight!SummaryIt might be potentially unfair to review this as a PC game, based on its source material and the limitations of the system. But, the developer has called it HD, which would imply that it’s been improved, at least somewhat, for PC.\n\nThat does not seem to be the case. Which is a shame, because it looks like Dementium II has a good story to tell. But, if unlike me, you’ve played and beaten the 3DS version, you likely already know the story, so it may not be a big deal.","January 16","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

The first dementium is way better than this one and it's a shame that they didn't released it on pc.\nI think you should try it out, it deserves better than a 37/100.","April 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Half the time, when you press your attack button, it doesn't register, so you can't reliably perform quick 2 hit strikes, or 3 hit strikes with your melee weapons.  There are also several other differences between this and the original that can make for quite different experiences.  Generally the differences are negative...but...if you can hammer to your head that it's a remake of a NINTENDO DS game, you can find some entertainment here.

I'm a huge fan of Horror Games and my favorite is Condemned: Criminal Origins. I haven't found one that scares me the way Condemned did when I was 12. Imagine my excitement when I'm told by a friend that this game is a million times better than Condemned. I mean I bought this at full price. Without even checking the reviews.\nI was excited!\nWell apparently it didn't run on my old hand-me-down 16-bit windows 95 eMachine from my grandparents. So I had to wait. I built up in my head what this game would be and I waited and waited until I built my own computer that is, well not perfect, but the best I can afford at $10/hour. I nearly forgot about this game, but last night during a fit of insomnia I stumbled across it and decided it was time. After so long it was like a sign from God, this game is...\n\nTERRIBLE!\n\nPro's:\nThe graphics can be passible on the highest settings. Plus the game definatly leaves you feeling insane because you're still bothering to play it.\n\nCon's:\nThe music makes you want to drive a nail through your skull because its the same five mother-loving notes on an eternal loop that sound like they've been ripped from a $1-store Halloween CD.\nThe story is lack luster.\nThe voice overs are so terrible that I feel like not even Satan himself speaking russian backwards could make it creepy.","August 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

IN My perspective this game was amazing when I got it on Release back in 2010 on the Nintendo DS. The first game Dementium: The Ward was surprising at the time being that not many FPS were on the DS NOR Was Rated M like games like this. There was much you could do with a engine like on the hardware of the DS but what they did do was amazing and set up a very impressive atmsophere At the time it was release.\n\nthe Same latter was with this game. Regardless if it was 10 or the sale 1 dollar. I will say straight This MAY NOT INTEREST YOU AT ALL. I understand most of you will be turned away by the graphics, PC standards, crashing (which has not happen to me as of now) or complaining that killing a monster with a knife is a terrible way to start a horror game. The game is fine. To me you will have a nice experience depending on how you take it in.\n\nControls are clunky and feel like you take a Extra step when holding your moving down. Mouse Sense feel very odd at times with no numbers representing the section. and Granted Tediaces movement that is REALLY straight forward but I will say that if you havent played the first Dementium, that was even more so. Especially when it was easy to cheat the game once you know a passcode to a power sniper.\n\nIt works its nice, I was not expecting it at all. However I honestly wish they wouldh ave Redone the first and second game to make a more immersive experience and a better story telling of whats going on between the two. Besides that It may not be a game you would love but just like some games. You Dont Have to like them all. If you feel its worth it regardless, then go for it. but for most people who play Counter Strike, or Dota 2. I will say this is not a game you would like and more so complain how its the worst on steam etc, etc, etc.","October 26, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's THAT bad.\nHonestly, I was surprised because I read many positive comments about this game. I knew it was one of the most famous survival-horror on the Nintendo DS. Well maybe it is a good game on DS. But on PC, this is really bad.\n\nThe gameplay itself lacks any feelings or originality. The combat is very repetitive, and I was never really amused or being scared.\nThe graphics are horrible. I know it was originally a DS game, but right now it is a "HD" PC game (look at the title) sold for 10 bucks. Even Half-Life 1 in 1998 still looks better. It's not just about the technical aspect, even the art direction is bad. All the environments feel extremely empty, the lighting is ugly, the animations are laughable.\n\nAll the sound effects are very cheap. I especially like the combat music : it's a 3 seconds loop!! I'm not joking. 3 seconds. Even on the NES, there were many games with longer loops.\n\nAlso this PC port is full of bugs. Just take a look on the online complaints.\n\nThis game kinda reminds me of Cry of Fear. But CoF was infinitely better, and it was free.","February 15, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Story is not the most intresting,  but I seen worse *Cough *F.E.A.R. 3 *Cough* >.> , don't expect high end gameplay, graphics, or scares as it is a originally a DS game. Dementium 2  holds some insperation from Silent hill, (which im all for since silent hill is my favorite game series, Silent hill 2 being my favorite game of all time.) Dementium 2 is around 5 hours of gameplay, so save it for a rainy day. nothing special, but it's a nice little game. Without spoiling anything, il just list some pros and cons in my opinion.\n\n-Pros-\n\n-controls for a DS port are not that bad\n\n-good for a time waster, or a rainy day game\n\n-simple graphics that run fine on average computers\n\n- puzzels, simple and easy, but you can't have a horror game without puzzels, and some of them I ended up saying are kinda clever.\n\n- (optional) if you like the horrer genre, but not getting the ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you, this one isn't that scarry\n\n\n- chest maws are pretty creepy, if only todays graphics were imployed, that would have been amazing\n\n- around 5 hours of gameplay, not too short and not to long.\n\n-some insperations from Silent Hill\n\n-cons-\n\n-(optional) not scary enough in my opinion\n\n-weapons deal roughly around the same damage, or atleast don't make much of a diffrence, you can go through the whole game using your default knife, except for the last boss.\n\n-repetitive backtracking\n\n-Somewhat of a confusing story, they just jump you right in.\n\n-boss battles are not that inovative, ones a hack and slash boss, anothers a shot at a week spot, another is run for ur life taking pop shots on down time, ect ect... though the second boss was kinda cool, but roughly, same boss machanics found in other games\n\n- linier world\n\n-wibbaly wobbaly crosshair\n\n-dumb AI\n\nVerdict\nScore 6.5/10\nAverage horror game that has room for improvement, but has cought my eye. lower your perfect standerds, and just play it for what it is. save it for a rainy day. :3","October 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It continually crashed upon starting until I went into the computer folder for this game, checked properties, & found it was 'set' to run on windows XP, changed that to windows 7 & now game starts fine.\n\nAnother problem that needs fixing every time you start the game is video resolution from options menu. I set mine to 1280x720 because it fits screen, be mindful that certain resolutions cut out images/text, you know your res is right when you can read the full text [Reset to Default] instead of seeing [et to Defa].\n\nLast problem before I address gameplay, playing in fullscreen, it works great in-game after turning it on...until you turn game off & return to play later -it goes back to windowed mode. Go to options, you'll find fullscreen mode IS SELECTED & the [Apply] button is not visible, don't panic. Change the resolution in order to make the [Apply] button appear & set fullscreen, then change res to reapply desired res.\n\nReview:\nGameplay:4/10\nControls:9/10\nVisual:5/10\nAudio:8/10\n\nGameplay: I own 'Dementium: The Ward' for DS from which this game is a sequel. That said, the enemies are similar & equally aggressive for your blood, they will lock you in rooms at times and force you to fight wave after wave until victory or death. Half of the puzzles you have to find clues to solve, the other half are too easy. The game is also very short compared to the DS version.\n\nControls: They made the controls very proper for a FPS, hotkeys for all your weapons, looking at map pauses game, you can remap the keys to your liking. Only thing i didn't like was the lack of hotkey for health items.\n\nVisual: I rated this low because the game has HD in it's name & the only times this quality ever occurs is during cutscenes. Otherwise the game has a creepy appearance of sanity twisting, blood covered iron in between lucid moments of roaming a prison for the criminally insane. Aside from that, if an enemy is visually reeling from a bullet you just put into it & you shoot it again, it will occasionally pass through to the wall.\n\nAudio: I enjoyed the music and sound effects as they are straight out of the DS version I know so well. The worms still squeel, the bonesaw still has that satifying grate, & the dissembodied heads still scream in anguish just like they always do. That said, the main character never speaks, & the main villian never shows any emotion after revealing his true colors. Sad really, I wanted to hear his triumph, his fustration, his fear...or at least throw me a maniacle laugh, SOMETHING!\n\nI would recommend this game if you like horror shooting games & catch it on sale like I did, or if you've played Dementium: The Ward (not required to enjoy though)","November 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has 720/1080 etc, but graphics are really bad, overall a good job considering that it is just a port from NDS and we all know that graphics are a plus, good games not necessary come with good graphics.\n\nIt does not have replay value, since you are just going to finish the game once, probably twice and that's all.\n\nBugs are not going to have major impact in the gameplay, you can finish the game without problems. It took me 5 hours to finish the game, I bought it with 90% off ... so yeah, it was worth it.\n\nI strongly recommend the game. Plot is nothing special, enemies are tough enough,   stages are amazing  and bosses are just fine but try to get it with discount.\nThe game its overpriced, but if you can afford it and you don't mind to spend 10 bucks in a really short game that should be cheaper, go ahead.\n\n\n\n","October 28, 2014","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself isn't very long; maybe 3-4 hours depending on how much exploring, achievement hunting, and backtracking you like to do.\n\nInitially the game had a decent creep factor to it, but once you play a bit and get used to the game flow and setting it very quickly turns into a straight shooter with some cool puzzles along the way.  The enemies in the game were deceptively interesting.  For such a short game there is a bigger variety of enemies than I'd expected, but unfortunately there aren't any interesting mechanics to any of them, barring one, which I won't spoil.  The most you'll have to think about when engaging enemies is choosing what weapon to splatter them with, and sometimes that's all you want to think about.\n\nBe warned though: If stretchy textures and sluggish animations aren't for you I'd stay away.  No polish to be seen here, just a rough cut port from the Nintendo DS.","May 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dementium II feels like aged FPS horror games like the Suffering, although I wouldn't compare the two. Virtually no jump-scares here. Rather, the game plays like a haunted house, with spooky ambience and a handful of creepy enemies. Lots of blood on the floor and dead bodies.\n\nI liked the atmosphere of the game. The environments were very old-school in design. The sound design was what creeped me out the most. All of the monsters / enemies are very disturbing, mostly due to their sfx. The first two bosses had very unsettling sound effects which made the fights pretty intense. Heavy, spooky ambient noises permeate the game and provide some sense of dread. The background music is also very old-school, like Resident Evil 2.\n\nThe developers threw in a slight potential for backtracking / exploring to find better weapons, secret areas etc. so there is that.\n\nHowever, there were a lot of things about this game that really disappointed me. The weapons system is weird; apparently an early-game enemy can take 4 shotgun blasts without going down but a mere prison shank can dispatch it in a couple of seconds. There is not enough ammo in the game to truly enjoy shooting higher-level weapons like the machine gun. Most of the boss fights I ended up just using the shank to beat them. Also, there is a major weapon that the main character assembles over the course of the game, and when it's complete, it doesn't do anything special (from what I could tell). However, whomping monsters with your sledgehammer is quite satisfying.\n\nThe enemy AI is wonky and you shouldn't expect to fight more than 3 enemies at a time. When you kill them, a new wave of baddies will spawn. Rinse, repeat. Not very challenging there.\n\nBut I guess my biggest complaint is that there is a complete lack of coherent story, the ending sucked and the game was too short (I took my time and beat it in 6 hours). I know nothing about the main character or what's going on.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes I do recommend this game, but really only if you're a young gamer with little experience playing horror games. Try it out if you're looking for a quick classic horror game fix.","January 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Although graphics are not that good by today's standards (polygons count is low and textures are a bit bland), I assume they may have been left ''simple'' on purpose, as to not stray too far from the DS version yet feel more polished. Controls are floaty and hit detection is not perfect (although ennemies will turn red to indicate they're taking damages). Difference between walking and running is hard to notice but is nonetheless needed at some points in the game. In the end, since I haven't finished the game at the time, I'm glad I picked it up on sale for $ 1.00. Would not have paid 10 bucks for it. Also, french being my primary language, I can't say I was too impressed with the translation, so I can imagine other languages included in the game must have typos or syntax errors as well.\n\nBUY IF:\n-you liked the DS version and want to experience it again on a bigger screen with higher def and better textures.\n-it's on sale for $ 5.00 or less (as a bonus....piece of advice...)\n\nDON'T BUY IF:\n-you expect a rehashed version of the game with crisp graphics and revamped gameplay\n-you never played a DS game in your life and hope this game is a worthy contender in the FPS horror genre (the first F.E.A.R game does a better job at it and cost around the same.)","November 3, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You will need to rely on melee mostly rather than going guns blazing into any given room. even when you are in situations you'll be shooting in, the guns can feel serverly underpowered (namely the shotgun). All in all, if you are looking for an okay survival horror game and are on a budget, this game may be for you. its puzzles are not going to bend your brain, and its control can be alittle finiky, but it isnt a bad game by any means. better on the ds, okay on pc. check it out.","June 8, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

The scares in this game have a very wide variety anything from jump to disturbing scares are seen.

It's the first time I am unable to finish a game because of such a stupid glitch.\n\nAbout the game itself: You play as a guy who has ♥♥♥♥♥♥s when looking at red mirrors. Perhaps that's the reason he ended up in an asylum. As you progress you'll encounter annoying and terribly designed monsters (they somehow managed to make them less scary than their DS counterpart...). Fighting them isn't fun nor scary. All you have to do is to hit them while walking backwards, this way they'll never be able to hit you unless they somehow manage to corner you. The game atmosphere is boring and bland and every room feels empty. The original game was great but this port is just terrible.\n\n","February 3","false","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

Don't expect the graphics to be amazing, you will see some pixels. Dementium II is one of the only (good) survival horror games on the Nintendo DS. It started out as a Silent Hill game on the DS but Konami turned it down twice. The developer went back and created their own game, which was well-received. This is the HD re-release of it.\n\nYou start off in a prison after going through some brain surgery. Head trauma? You are being led back to your cell by some guards and start experiencing illusions. Before you know it you pick up a postcard and are in some hellish world. You pick up a shank and start killing Silent Hill-like monsters. That is the basic plot that you are given, which considering the DS, is not too bad.\n\nThe graphics look good for a DS re-release. They put a little effort into the PC port with a lot of resolutions, v-sync, and a graphics slider. On my 970 (About a 980) Dementium II runs really well. I would expect that due to this being a DS re-release. Yes, I know I am using DS re-release a lot, but that is because it is. I don't know much about the game.\n\nRating:\n5/10-Average\nSurvival-Horror Fans:\n6/10-Above Average (The monsters are definitely creepy)\nPick this game up while on sale/in a bundle or when you need a little survival-horror.","November 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First of all being the weapon animations. Choppy and ugly, just wow...\nSecond of all, the game looks dated but still has framerate issues, I feel like that shouldn't have been too hard to fix. Third of all, some of the voice clips are obviously rewritten from the DS format. They sound like an upgraded Intellivision voice synthesizer. Honestly, a few of the outdated sound clips make the game even more freaky, like the crazed prisoners yelling in other languages. The blank and dark feel to them actually boosts up the ambiance.\n\nYou might actually be better off getting a DS emulator to emulate the game on your PC, since the game is actually loads better for the DS (even visually in some aspects). The upgraded PC version actually brings some new flaws to the game, but for me, I'll just let them pass, and enjoy the game, because that's what it was made for.\n\nThis game is sincerely a "take it or leave it" opportunity.

Music stops playing/doesn't play when its suppose to\n2. Enemies bigger than they should be? I'm pretty sure the secruity guards aren't suppose to be taller than me.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with tons of settings, this is not the game for you.\nThe settings are very minimal, and there is NO FOV slider. So you have to deal with what you got.\nGraphical settings range from literally, Fast - Fantastic\nYou can't turn off any graphical settings, nor really change much.\n\n\nThe sound is either straight from the DS version, or barely changed.\nThe music is great, but the voices are really bad. (EDIT: In cutscenes the voice acting is fine)\nThe graphics are what to be expected from a DS uport, not great, but good enough, and it deosn't hurt the eyes, nor is it a crime.\nI actually need to congraulate the team on using some pretty high res textures it looks good.\nThe human animations are very, very stiff.\n\nAnother thing to note is that according to Windows Task Manager, we are playing the Beta version of this.\n\nTransition from CG to gameplay is done pretty poorly.\n\nGame controls okay, feels stiff and the crouching and walking to creep around corners thing feels werid. DEVELOPER SUGGESTION: Make it so we can press Q/E to look around corners instead of this weird I need to ♥♥♥♥ lets waddle in odd directions thing.\nPressing right click to pick up and open things is one of the weirdest pick up buttons I've seen. Luckily you can change the keyboard inputs.\n\nSo far I really like the atmosphere and the story actually isn't to shabby.\n\nUnfortunatley, even though I was excited for this, I just can't recommend buying this game.","December 17, 2013","false","3.2"," 27 of 58 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","27","58","0","0"

Well, Dementium II is kind of like that.\n\nIt must be said that a majority of aspects that make up the game feel underdone. The characters sprinting speed is horribly slow, character movement in general feels awkward, the AI is predictable and slow as well as the audio sounds like it's a 3 second clip on a loop when there is an enemy nearby - even firing guns didn't feel all that powerful, like the gun is muffled. But despite all that, the game does have its charms. The contrast in atmosphere in various stages is done really well - from a gloomy, depressing dungeon type setting to a desolate, tranquil environment full of glittering snow.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, having to ration ammunition so to speak, meant you had to be careful on how you approached different enemies depending on their strength and weaknesses. Because of this, it does keep the game relatively fresh in the sense that you don't really get trapped using the same weapon all the time even though the combat overall is clunky and underwhelming.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure this is really a horror to me, either. I didn't feel terrified or frightened like a lot of other horror games I've played in the past, in a way it's like BioShock, maybe? Scary? Not really. Creepy at times? Yes. One enemy (Wailers I think they're called?) let out this eerie shreiking scream when you kill them. But maybe that is just me, it does have all the elements which can be considered scary to others.\n\nIf there is one thing they really need to fix though, there is a bug from Chapter IV onwards where melee weapons don't work if you're using a gamepad. If you do, you're probably better off switching to mouse and keyboard because remapping firing from anything other than Right Trigger just doesn't feel right.\n\nBut despite all the flaws I never felt bored, or felt as though the game was a grind or a chore, and if you're looking for a fix in the horror genre you could do a lot worse, but don't expect a game complete with bells and whistles. It does have it's shortcomings like i've mentioned, but i enjoyed it all the same.","July 1, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teamtash/recommended/217100/","teamtash","Kritikos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teamtash/","352 products in account","Dementium II HD is a PC port of the surprisingly good DS game of the same name. If you've been playing Shadow Warrior, Rise of the Triad, or remakes of other first-person shooters, this game is certainly not on par in terms of graphical presentation. This is, however, forgivable for a low-budget remake of a DS game. It's only $15 so I wasn't surprised by it's low-budget nature and short length.\n\nThe visual concepts of D II might be a little confusing at first. The humans in this game are portrayed in a realistic manner, while the monsters, being 3D reimaginings of the monsters from the DS version, are very designed very much like cartoons. They don't feel out of place, though; the humans in the actual gameplay look pretty cartoony themselves, as well as everything else in the game. This doesn't hurt the experience, nor does the rather simple combat. I do wish they made the character faster; his run speed feels more like the walking speed in most other first-person shooters.\n\nD II is a pretty average FPS and it doesn't try to hide that fact. For that reason, the game envokes a sense of nostalgia. It's not a very difficult game; I suggest playing on hard if you're confident in your abilities. The puzzles are actually fairly well thought out and the combat, while not the most engaging or fast-paced, is decent for being so slow and goofy. The fact that it works well lends to the playability of the game, even though the combat isn't as satisfying as most well-known first-person shooters. I do question some of the encounters, such as enemy gauntlets in areas where you could be out of ammo and inconsistent difficulty here and there. Sometimes you'll be having no trouble taking out enemies, carrying plenty of amunnition, and feeling confident with all the painkillers you've pocketed. Other times you might find yourself running out of ammo in somewhat dicy situations, and there are a few instances where death - even instant death - will just surprise you. Thankfully, there are plenty of save points which heal you completely, and when you die while fighting a boss, you can continue from the start of the fight as opposed to the last savepoint.\n\nI have a few other minor complaints with the game, including the lack of advanced video options and the uneven sound effect levels. The volume of the sounds that guards, monsters, and paranormal phenomena are all a bit varied, while the gunfire is about three times quieter, which can kind of emasculate the gunplay. The grunts and groans the protagonist makes are often quite humorous, especially when jumping and landing, which can cause his vocalizations to overlap.\n\nUltimately, Dementium II HD is a relatively enjoyable game that feels neither pretentious nor incompetent. It's not the most impressive game out there, but it's fun. I'd never heard of this series before, and I'm sure this is the best way to be introduced to it. I hope to see more from this company in the future.","December 17, 2013","true","5.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

A lot (if I remember correctly) of people said that it is not living up to their expectation, but really I think the one to blame here is the inability of the marketing development to decide what part of their game they want to sell. It might be received better if they sell it as a nostalgia for people who actually played it on DS first, and really the game speaks more of that. From the enemy cheesy movement, laggy and seemingly less important cutscenes, and the atmosphere (hhehehe) is pretty much what brings me to DS version captured accurately in this port. In conclusion, if you're looking for a good horror game, this might not be your first option since it is better for someone who already played this game before.","December 18, 2013","true","2.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokachu/recommended/217100/","kokachu","kokachu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokachu/","43 products in account","I had actually been going back and forth for a few months to purchase the original Dementium: The Ward and Dementium II for the DS before noticing that there was going to be a PC port. I still have yet to play them, but now that I've completed the game, I'm certainly interested in buying/completing the originals, and for additional ports/sequels in the future.\n\n3.5/5 Controls: Iffy at times, but certainly not terrible by any means. The run would cut out (had it happened a handful of times, I would blame it on either my keyboard or my fingers; not the case) and walk was a bit too slow for my liking so I constantly ran. Part of this could be because I've been playing Damned too much and am used to the faster pace. A few of the doors/items wouldn't trigger with the right click unless done several times. These are easy fixes done through future patches, so I would take this worth a grain of salt once there's patches out in the future.\n\n4/5 Graphics: Very well done for a port, yet to keep the aesthetics of the original game it was decently well done. I did check out 1-2 hours of gameplay from Youtube, so I'm decently qualified to speak on it. I'm a horror fan (Doom, Alone in the Dark, Fatal Frame), but not so much of modern games. By no means am I a graphics snob, so obviously this isn't a turn-off by any means, especially since I play through all my old favorites all the time. If you do prefer high-tier graphics to use your fancy video card, go right on ahead to Outlast or other similar games. If you don't mind middle to middle-low range, you'll be comfortable with Dementium II. A minor thing I noticed from time to time was that some textures would either be misplaced (ie. above the surface it was supposed to lay on) or be removed. When gone completely, the game would lag, as if it was still trying to load them (ie. wood grain from stilted houses on ice when you were walking on the ice). It never happened anywhere where you'd be fighting, or where anything would spawn, so it's not too large of an issue. It may even be addressed in a future patch.\n\n3.5/5 Story: Decent, a bit repetitive at times, but with enough twists and puzzles to keep you going for the 4-6 hours to finish it out. Major gripe: I wish they would have did something a bit more special with the final cut scene. I understand what was going on, but it felt rushed and flat.\n\n3.5/5 Gameplay: The revolver was...strange at times, crosshairs laggy, recoil weird and clunky. Reloading was terribly annoying when guns were required (tab, click on held gun, wait for reload). I won't even talk about how annoyed I was with the shotgun. For the most part I stuck to my shank since I dislike shooters anyways. A few other glitches, but with a major patch coming either today or tomorrow, I'm going to withhold those since they'll most likely be address anyways. HINT: In doubt, just restart the game. It seems to fix itself a lot if you run into any issues.\n\n4/5 Music: From the quality I heard from the DS version to the reboot, I'm very happy with the changes. It's been said that all of the audio has been redone with this release, and it's all been for the better. I never had any issues with the audio up until the final boss fight, where it wobbled and shrieked a bit; I felt like I was in Lavender Town again. Again, most likely will be fixed with future patches, so I'm not worried about it either.\n\n3.7 Overall now, rounded to 4/5 when patches correct the most glaring issues. Most things are going to be updated with future patches, anyways, so don't let those critiques bother or drive you away from a solid overall horror experience if you like the old feel with some solid updates. Not to mention the dev's have been completely helpful, understanding, and rushing to get the game patched up as soon as possible, so no qualms whatsoever for me. Have fun and immerse yourself into the mind of the insane.","December 18, 2013","true","8.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Case in point: Nintendo DS games being ported to Windows PC's.\nDon't assume this is going to be one of the few DS games to come to PC (there is Resident Evil Revelations after all). What you can safely think, however, is that the vast majority of these games are going to be ♥♥♥♥.\nThe reason why the DS is such a successful system is because it has a nice gimmick behind it, just like other modern Nintendo consoles. The gimmick here is that it has a touch screen that's relatively easy to use, and almost completley unheard of when the system originally came out. Due to its initial surprise at launch the system now has a dedicated fanbase that will continue to buy the system and games for it, and now that 3D is added more people are buying it.\nAre the games good on DS? Yes. They're very good on DS, but why would that mean that they wouldn't be good on PC?\nWell, that's because PC's have had mouses since forever, which basically replicates the stylus controls on a DS. Why is that bad? The problem with this is that we don't give a ♥♥♥♥ because every game we play uses that. It's not a gimmick anymore.\nAnother part of being able to use a mouse is that games originally on DS that had some kind of difficulty in them are way too easy on PC's because a mouse is much more accurate and easier to use than a stylus and touch screen.\nSimply put, most DS games ported to PC cannot do what this game did and just make a direct port with slightly better graphics. The game is too easy even on harder difficulties and the level design is also extremely archaic and simplistic. That is not a good thing for a first person shooter, especially a horror game.\nResident Evil Revalations worked because it's ♥♥♥♥ing resident evil and also because the made HUGE improvements to the graphics and actually modified aspects of gameplay and control for PC in order to make it not easy as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow that I have that out of the way I'd like to point out that even without these flaws the game would still be total ♥♥♥♥ because it isn't even remotely scary and the monsters look ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious.\n\nI mean, people tell me the game was terrible on the DS, so the PC port is gonna suck even harder.\n\n3/10. Slightly more enjoyable than Bad Rats.\n\n","December 10, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Actually this game is a port of a Nintendo DS game from the far off year of 2006, and it's pretty friggin' good.  In this game you play as escaped convict murphy pendleton, who is trying to escape from Racoon City with his autistic son in law Josh.  Along the way you will explore such exciting locals as jail, super jail, and a maceys.  If you liked video games on the Nintendo DS, but not actually playing video games on the Nintendo DS then this game is for you.  If you instead don't like either of those things, and like circle strafing around spooky scary monsters, while you hit them with a two by four with a nail in the end, then this game is also for you.

Dementium 2 "HD" and i use that term very loosely because while the lighting and textures were clearly updated other important things were not. Animation quality, while smoothed out from it's DS counterpart, is still unchanged and looks very much like it came from a DS game. Fans of Playstation 1 horror games such as Resident Evil will get good nostalgic enjoyment out of this game, because for better AND for worse it is very much a callback to classic survival horror genre games such as Alone in the Dark, Dino Crisis, and such; bad voice acting, damage sponge enemies, safe rooms where you save, cheesiness and all.\n\nNewcomers that know nothing of this franchise will trash it hard for it's extremely primitive graphics and gameplay. And it's totally understandable if you know nothing about this game before buying it. It's because of this that I'm unsure on whether or not to leave this as a "Yes" recommendation or a "No" recommendation. I mean, this game is fantastic for a DS title, it's just not up to par with other PC releases. As I said, newcomers to this franchise will be VERY put off by the low budget looking graphics and gameplay. They should have implemented ragdoll physics and an FOV slider into the updated engine and given us more graphical settings for this to be a true "HD" rerelease.","December 17, 2013","true","0.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Except that the game isn't scary at all and the gameplay is quite awful as well...\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is pretty much anything but scary and possibly more comedic due to the very low quality models and animations that accompany them. Instead of being scared by a crazy person chained to a medical bed, you'll probably start laughing due to how ridiculous the animations are.\n\nAgain, the gameplay is pretty terrible. The very beginning of the game consists of mashing down left mouse since you're stuck with a shank and you just have to kill some zombies, guards, and weird demon creatures. Eventually you get some guns but they just feel terrible and it seems difficult to aim them, or perhaps the enemies just take a crazy amount of damage even if you get headshots.\n\nThere also seem to be no real options for audio, graphics, gameplay, etc. despite this being a PC game. The FOV is locked at around 80 degrees and the graphics settings is just a slider between different presets...\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game at all, even if it were on sale for 75% off.

Dementium II HD is a PC remake of that DS game.  And it's bizarre.  I mean, the concept of remaking a B-grade DS game for the PC is already pretty odd.  But on top of that, the game is a zany mess of brazenly warty oldschool sensibilities, simplistic handheld design, what may or may not be complete developer incompetence, and a few flashes of brilliance.  I... kind of enjoyed it.  But at the same time, didn't.  It's kinda good...?  But isn't?  Gah!  I dunno.

The game is repetitive at times since the game is just go here find a key etc,and since you start the game with just a 'shank' the melee combat in this game is just a spamfest sure you get guns later but your ammo is limited so you will probably just save it for bosses unless you need to use it.The plot in this game is very basic and it isn't really that known(you will find documents,post cards etc which will indicate what is happening however you probably won't care much for the story.\n\nHow Long Is This Game?\nThe main story in the game is only a few hours long (no more than 7 or so hours at least in my experience however if you are playing as someone who is new to first person/survival games it will take longer.)\n\n\nWho Would I Recommend This For?\nI wouldn't really recommend this game as there are better survival games out there like 7 days to die and resident evil 4 however I would only reccomend if you really want it then get it when it is 70% off or if you are an achievement collector who must have all the achievements on steam.","March 30","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are tons of games on this site that are worse and at least this runs, is kinda fun, and fantastic to kill an afternoon with. A game doesn't have to be perfect, sometimes it just has to occupy you.\n\nI have a bit of history with Dementium. I played the first game on the DS and it was fantastic. Somehow I never got around to playing the sequel on the DS, which I hear is the superior version. For me, the game is kinda hard to pick up so if you played the first game, or never got around to playing the original DS version of the second game, then this is for you as it is the best you are going to get.\n\nIgnoring difficulty level, the game isn't that hard and for some people that might be a turn off. But a very wise man once said, that a game doesn't have to be hard to be great. Sometimes you might want to kick back and relax with an easy game to settle down for the night.\n\nDepending on your amount of time spent on video games, this game can be beaten very quickly if you know what you are doing and despite the complex map layout, the game is a lot more linear than you might expect. If a room is red, you aren't going to go there, and if it is white, you don't have an item you need to get there. Chances are you can wonder blindly and you can still progress.\n\nThe story is there if you search for it, but really it is kinda meh with mediorce scares. Seriously, the game isn't scary. If you get scared REALLY REALLY easily that's one thing.. but it really isn't that bad. It is supposed to be reliant on Silent Hill type scares and atmosphere and it doesn't do quite as good a job so you shouldn't judge based on that.\n\nYeah, all you do is go around killing things and it is the same enemies after awhile but it is still fun and it makes for a mindless game that you can spend a few hours on.\n\nI got this for free and even if I had $4.99 I would say it is worth it. It's my opinon and you may want it when it is cheaper, but it really isn't awful compared to the pure trash that some indie games are like on this very site. I would say play it when you want a fun game that you don't have to put much thought into. That sounds bad, but really, video games are meant to be fun, they aren't meant to change your view point. They are meant for a time killer. Get this game, end of story. Or don't and declare this the worst game in the world based on the mixed reaction.\n\nI "wasted" 14.99  on the Remastered version of the first game on the 3DS and that game is loads inferior to the original (hard bosses... especially Mr. Gas Mask) but I still was loyal enough to the original version and if you, like me, like fun games, then this is the game for you.\n\nIt runs on my computer, I have fun, that's good enough for me and should be good enough for you. Don't play this if you have standards!","April 19","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
