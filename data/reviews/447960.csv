I cant record gameplay. I am playing on a vive and it is comming through the vive but the monitor picture is black. I would like to show people some gameplay! You cant see the menu in the vive at all or on the screen. The game wont launch normally unless you launch it twice meaning it wont play as a normal game unless i launch it while in vr mode(way to change settings)...it seems to shut down the vr version and start the normal pc version.  Game looks awesome just want to share!","June 6","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
