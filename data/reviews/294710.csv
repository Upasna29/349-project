"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImNoBot/recommended/294710/","ImNoBot","that's not my soap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImNoBot/","204 products in account","Why do I love Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick so much? It's pretty simple when I think about it. Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick isn't just the best game on Steam, it might just be the greatest form of entertainment of all time. Just imagine it riding through the sandy beach, the wind in its hair, its mighty pogo stick below him. As it rides through the red mountains, the ladies swoon at its very theme song. They know how it sounds. The essence of its msic is sold in Morocco under the name of "Putt-Putt ♥♥♥♥♥♥." The very nature of Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is mystery. Could it be playing a deeper game than even its creator realizes? The answer is yes; it has transcended such boundaries as the digital world, and has free will to do whatever it sees fit. However, Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is filled with such guile, such arcane craft that it does not even use these powers.\n\nWhy, you might ask? You will never know, for the mind of the Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is not one that is easily penetrated. Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is such a force of nature in  its realm that nothing can truly touch it, the only thing keeping him bound to the world of the PC at all is its will to exist within the preordained boundaries of its world. Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick  is not only beyond the comprehension of us, it exists within a plane of true focus and beauty. Observe its playful smile, its gorgeous and rippling biceps, its gallant nose, and most importantly, its eyes. Those eyes, like pools of zeroes and ones, provide the only glimpse into the true machinations of Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick. Do not stare into them. Many good men have gone mad in the attempt. Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is not just a video game,  a formless collection needed to test how magnets apply on a hard drive; it is the binding that holds the saga of life together. Without Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick, the entire Steam Community, the entire world of as we know it crumbles. The Nile would stop flowing without Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick, the Ocean would dry up, and the Icebergs would melt without its frosty gaze.","June 29, 2014","true","578.6"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","94","48","51","18","1"

As a starter puzzle game though, it is great for kids that are just starting out in that genre of gaming.  The graphics and designs are cute, and with a custom level creator, the player is allowed to show creativity and imagination in making their own levels to play through.","July 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Pep found a jumping stick and is using it to catch every good treat. However, rivals are appearing, as obstacles (gums, oil stains) but Pep is resolute to be the best jumper!\n\nIf you were expecting an adventure or an action game, aimed for childs, you're in the wrong: it's simply an arcade one. Indeed, there is no real plot or story: Putt-Putt is leading Pep to a level and then it's up to you to move the dog towards destination. However, while you can go straight to the finish flag, if you want to improve your score, it's highly recommended to retrieve everything: bones, chocolate, ice cream, etc.. Pep can only move diagonally: you have to imagine the level with columns of different heights and that you're jumping up and down. Sometimes, you need to make a double jump: a specific bonus is present and always at the same place. Pep will be able to make these jumps for a limited time, though if an enemy is also putting his feet on the bonus, he will benefit of the same treatment. Pep can't jump on a rival if you don't want to loose a life. Indeed, while you can earn a 1UP, you don't have infinite lives unless you're playing on the easiest difficulty. The game over will reset your score.\n\nSometimes, you can find portals to bonus levels: there, Pep has to jump on the moving gifts but they're really tricky to reach. There is a limited time to do it, so be efficient on these.\n\nI don't know how many levels you have but you begin in a trash deposit before moving on more exotic locations (mountain, beach), etc.. It's a nice change of scenery, as the enemies are also changing and as more specific bonus or obstacles are also appearing (like the balloon which is launched everytime in the beach levels).\n\nWhile I don't doubt that the repetitive gameplay can be boring if you play the game without interruption, I think that children will find their joy in it: it's simple to understand and apart when Pep is falling in the void (I still don't understand how I'm managing to do it), the meeting with his rivals are kinda cute.\n\nHowever, there is a little problem for me: the graphics. I don't mind these as they're representative of the era of the making of the game (20 years ago already), however, like for Big Thinkers (see here for the Kindergarten version and here for the 1st Grade), they didn't aged well. It's not really smooth for the eye. As for the soundtrack, it's fine, though after a while, hearing the jumping stick can be quite annoying.\n\nAnyway, Dog on a Stick is a nice little arcade game for children, with a reasonable price. I suppose that if you want a more educative game, you can check Big Thinkers, from the same devs and publisher (for the reviews: Kindergarten and 1st Grade).","May 5","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Who knew such a simplistic game could have such an impact on anybodys life. I think that all of the Putt-Putt games are a work of art, but Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is the Mona Lisa of the Putt-Putt Series. The Gameplay is amazing and the how the characters act and talk make me feel like I am actually in the Game. Putt-Putt is such an engrossing character you cannot even begin to comprehend how much I love that car. If I had a choice between a Ferrari 458 and Putt-Putt as my first car, I would choose Putt-Putt.\nThis game has brought more joy to my life than you would ever know. Just Seeing Pep collecting those bones and getting to the checkered flag brings so much happiness and joy to my life. This game is a force to be reckoned with. If you have the money, buy this game, if you have more, buy the Complete Pack, I love these games. As DJ Khaled Said: '"Another One"' that is how i feel when I get money in my steam account, I will just buy another Putt-Putt game, another one, Another One, Until I have the Whole Franchise.\nI suggest this game for everyone!","January 10","true","8.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","4","6","4","4"

Otherwise, it's kind of just Qbert. The collecting stuff part is optional and I just made a beeline to the goal playing through the entire game. 100 levels is probably a longer challenge if you actually cared about the points but there's no reason to. Probably the best of the arcades I've played up to this point, but that doesn't make it "good".","August 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","4","18","0","0"
