It starts slow as you must learn to resist your ingrained instinct to blow everything up but picks up steam and complexity pretty quickly. The bosses are fun and take different weapons and tactics to overcome.\n\nRecommended for fans of retro twin stick shooter games, even more fun and chaotic with local co-op.","May 13","true","9.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Can't wait to see what comes about in the future!","May 9","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Nice to jump in on a session and see how far I can make it (the answer: not very far).\n\nFavorite weapon is probably drunken homing missiles, though it kills pretty much everything when I use it.\n\nMusic is very fitting with the funky/quirky vibe of the game's story.\n\nLooking forward to the planned additions!","May 24","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this thing really shines when you play with other people - it has a chaotic/smash bros sort of vibe to it.  The zoo animals are pretty amusing and each individual level is pretty short and sweet (at least for quite a while).\n\nAlso - I had been playing this with WASD & a mouse --> but it is a much funner experience with a twin stick controller.","June 2","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Blow up aliens but don't hit the animals.  Would be better with a joystick but was fine with keyboard and mouse.  Levels are starting to get a bit challenging after 12+ or so..","June 5","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
