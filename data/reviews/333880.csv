Yes, it's not as complex Heroes of Might and Magic or King's Bounty, but it's a charming little game that's challenging in its own right. Also, it's a lot of the same as the original, but I think they added enough extra to the game to call it a sequel, especially for the price.\n\nIn the original the only way you can make gold is to defeat all the mobs around the land and if you play that game in hard mode, you have to be very careful about which battles you pick. If you lose too many troops during a battle and win, your overall earnings would be too low because it would cost too much gold to replenish your dead troops at the end of the battle. This means that you won't have enough gold left over to buy as many troops as you would need to finish the game at the harder levels because once a mob is defeated, you can't try again. This made it very challenging for and it stood in it's own right for a mini-King's Bountry/Heroes game.\n\nHowever, this one doesn't have the same restriction on gold and you can always have a full army every time you level before you attack the next set of mobs because there are cave battles you can repeat to farm gold. This makes the game a lot easier and you don't have to worry about strategically picking your battles so much. Also, with the addition of powerful spells, this makes the game even easier again.\n\nIt's still fun though and it balances the first game nicely if you play the first game too. The reason is because in the first game, battles can get a bit tedious mid-game and if you play them right, the end game is easy, but in this one the battles and game progression seem to flow better because battles aren't as tedious mid-game.","June 11, 2015","true","12.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Unfortunately I think it is even worst than the original. 3/10  (some repeats from my original review since it appears as though they kept the engine and just swapped in some new units)\n\nPros: nice graphics and pretty easy to pick out, this game reviews well so I won't elaborate too much here.\n\nCons:\n1) The PC price discrimination: Pricing in this game is especially egregious - It is $1 on google/apple store and $7 on Steam. Oh wait, right now it is "on sale" for $3. Wow. Price gouging to the max. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AS A PC GAMER.\n2) No PC optimizations: #1 would be ok if the developers actually put effort into the port, but as it stands there are little to no improvements. There are very basic features that the game lacks due to lack of will/laziness. One example is that you cannot find out the movement zone of enemy units - in typical strategy games you mouseover a unit to see how far it can move so you can stay outside the range, in this game, you need to look up its movement, and manually count squares. You cannot 'mouseover' on a phone, so why implement it on a PC? Right?\n3) Lack of strategy: Compared to the first title, I give the developers a little bit of credit in the new skill system. Having some choice in spells adds a tiny bit of strategic depth to the game, but unfortunately, the game is still almost devoid of strategy and a slugfest. The lack of strategy is especially evident on the Difficult difficulty since enemy units have more HP - sometimes you will have two units just standing there bashing each other for 5 turns.\n4) New feature - grinding: This is worse than the first game since the developers thought it was a good idea to add in grinding as a requirement on Difficult (not necessary on easier difficulties). As mentioned in #3, no matter how good your 'strategy' you are still going to take losses because you don't even get most of your spells until half of the game is over, and because many types of damage (ie, ranged) is basically unavoidable. So the game was tweaked so that even losing a couple units (ie, your kill ratio is 2:1 or 3:1 or better), you earn very little money. So with little money you end up losing more units the next battle, and even make less money, repeat. Eventually you make basically no money and will start losing. So you grind for money to buy troops. However, it is balanced that you can play a semi-challenging level and make almost no money, or a super newbie level and make almost the same amount of no money. So you play brainless levels repeatedly for 50-70 gold a pop so you can buy a tree dude for 500 or a fire wizard for 700. Fun.\n\nBottom line: No more punishing myself and I will not subject myself to the third of the series. As I stated in my original review, maybe good for a super casual player or a kid, but not worth the time for a fan of the genre.","October 19, 2015","false","26.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The gameplay is not exactly deep but still entertaining with a high enough fun factor that you don't feel bored playing.  This is the sequel to the first braveland, and I find that there is slightly more strategies you can utilize like combining multiple slowing abilities to effectively kite powerful units and waste turns of the lesser powerful ones while you focus fire an enemy down.\n\nMy only gripe is the inclusion of being able to grind in this braveland, so you cannot possibly run out of gold in this one.  As such I find it makes the battles a little less exciting as you suffer no significant losses you cannot recover from.  But that gripe comes down to a personal level and is merely a personal preference.  So all in all, it's a good time the 6-10 hours you spend on it depending on if you want to 100% the achievements.

The game is linear but entertaining with a cartoon style design and a nice background music.\n\nWizard is the second game of the Braveland trilogy. The three storylines are not related, so you can play them in any order. However, I would recommend to start with the first Braveland ( Here	), which is way better than the second one in my opinion, so you can familiarize with the game system and the different types of units. Plus, you'll be able to answer some questions in game at some point.\n\nThis story is about a freshly graduated wizard of the Academy of Magic, who must pass a final test to become a fully qualified magician. But of course, things won't go as planned. She will meet some nice people during her journey and get help in her quest from them. There are new types of units and opponents and this second game introduces dungeons that you can farm indefinitely. And this is the negative point of this game. On hard mode, you earn too few golds per battle, but you need lots of golds to fortify your squad in order to win unavoidable fights. Basically you will have to chain dungeons for a long time until you have enough money, several times during the game.\n\nDespite the excessive farming, Braveland Wizard is a fun game that offers around 8-10 hours of pleasure in normal mode. If you're going for the hard mode, prepare yourself for the same battles over and over again.","March 23","true","30.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Anyone with prior strategy experience ought be able to manage the hardest difficulty with no problems- in fact, even if you do suffer a lost battle, you suffer no penalties and get extra gold for your efforts.\n\n* Very short. This game won't take you more than 5 hours for a full run-through, and you can likely manage it in 3 if you're motivated.\n\n* There's a few 'wait till you're strong enough' side paths, but the game is essentially entirely linear.\n\n* Minimal character building (just straight stat level-ups that end up not being overly significant) and swapping army formation is incredibly limited due to a mix of limited unit selection and limited army building points.\n\n* Weird dialogue blurbs. This game has no story worth mentioning, but the developers did implement a basic plotline, with occasional npc dialogues. And each one of those comes across as an oddly mistranslated garble.\n\n* By its very nature of being a casual stripped down version of meatier titles, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre.\n\n* Game has a survival mode that benefits from being able to offer characters from the subsequent games, but really doesn't offer much reason to play it past initial novelty.\n\n\nCONS\n\n* The interface is often clunky and underdeveloped, making things more of a hassle than it ought be [or than is usual for more modern games in the genre]. And sometimes trying to get info on a game component isn't near as simple a matter as it ought be.\n\n* If you're looking for a strategy game of any depth, involvement, complexity, challenge, or a game with any story elements, this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nIf you go into this with the same mindset as playing a game of minesweeper, solitaire, etc, the game is quite enjoyable- and while it won't leave any lasting impression on you, it's a nice way to burn time when you've got no energy for anything too involved, or only have a few minutes to kill.\n\nIf you go into this with the mindset of a typical strategy gamer, you're going to be itching to use that steam refund option.\n\nCasual Game perspective: 3.5/5\nStrategy Game perspective: 2/5\nHere's what has changed:\n\n\nCONS\n\n* None of the interface issues from the first game have been resolved.\n\n* The dialogue and story are even more nonsensical and gibberish filled.  o.O\n\n* Poorly implemented occasional path splitting, where you're forced to pick between two exclusive battles/rewards with minimal insight into them. The idea is good, but the implementation feels too awkward and capriciously punishing.\n\n* From a simple, accessible system where you complete a battle/node and move on, the game has introduced dungeons that you're required to grind for exp and gold. "Well, okay, I don't mind a bit of grind," you say?\nHow about repeating the same dungeon 30 times each, and having a new dungeon every 8 or so nodes?\nIt's less a game about progression, now, and just one of 'If you farm enough, you get rewarded with a small bit of actual gameplay'.\nAnd really, the farming, it isn't fun.\nUnfortunately, it's blatantly obvious this was implemented with no actual intention of making it a playable gameplay component, but rather just as an artifical way of inflating game length without putting in the effort of doing it properly with additional nodes.\n\nFrom the discussion boards, I've noted most players advising to use the cheat program 'Poke' to adjust your stats. Having played with that, I can note the following:\n** If you adjust your gold but don't adjust your level, the game finally has some mild challege [on the hardest difficulty], as you'll be entering combat with a lower level than the devs intended.\n\n** Adjusting just your gold allows you to run each dungeon just a couple of times and move on.\nThe overall effect is gameplay very similar to the original Braveland, but actually more satisfying due to the increased challenge- which, of course, you can adjust as well by modifying your level.\nNote: The grinding seems to be mitigated on easier difficulties, but given how easy the game is on its hardest difficulty, that's even less an ideal option than just manipulating your gold.\n\nPROS\n\n* Braveland Wizard has its own set of units, but also includes original Braveland units as enemies. While army-building is still woefully underdeveloped, there's a lot more variety to opponents you face, now.\n\n* You have an actual skill tree on leveling, now. You begin with only two branches unlocked at first, but more unlock throughout the campaign. Some of the abilities seem rather oddly chosen, and there's no option for real build specialization, but there are some useful abilities in the tree that do have a noticable effect on gameplay after you get them.\n\n\nAs a Casual Game:  2 (3.5/5 with gold cheat)\nAs a Strategy Game: 1.5 (2.5/5 with gold cheat)","November 22, 2015","false","6.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

It has decent artwork but thats about it. There is no substance at all and the strategy is totally non-existant. You basically just click on the closest monster and t hats about it. The talents don't matter, your position on the board doesn't matter, the unit kinds don't matter. Nothing in the game matters, you just click on a monster and use some ability if it happens to be up and thats about it.\n\nThere are 30 year old games that are better than this.","December 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","20","43","0","0"

This game is more or less much of the same. They had a different way to level which was actually pretty nice. You have different points to invest in abilities/spells. They added spells which make combat feel much more like HOMM and I appreciated that. The battles seemed notably more difficult and there was the addition of repeatable battles which just meant more grinding. That was the only addition that I did not appreciate. I want to play more unique encounters, not grind to be able to move on. Solid game, but slightly worse than the original.\n\n6/10 Not bad, but the first was better.","October 18, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
