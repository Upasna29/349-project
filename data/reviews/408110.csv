You may also pick up upgrades for squad members and unlock new weapons for them.\n\nThe enemies are rather interesting and several pose a challenge, so you will need to use all the skills available to you.\nThere are three different difficulty levels to choose from if you find the game too difficult or two easy, although I find the default difficulty to be just right.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested.\nCan't wait to see it in its final form.","March 30","true","2.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

Let me explain what to expect while playing.\n\nAt the start, the game is very slow, and hard, but it gets better towards the second mission/level. The action speeds up and you find yourself pressing buttons, aiming weapons, using skills, and more. When your not playing as one of your soliders, they fight themselves, and are very smart. For example, the sniper moves back to avoid getting hurt while also shooting from long-distances. There are no other modes besides the story mode. Maybe there will be some kind of endless mode in the future. You can pick each of your soliders weapons once you get them. They can also be upgraded. The graphics are also nice.\n\nOverall, this game IS a tactical squad shooter. Even if it may not look like one.\n","January 10","true","2.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Have the designers even played it themselves?\nThe first few levels are sort of ok --- nothing thrilling but no big issue. With 1hr into the game the levels suddenly get none-sense. The one you see on the screen shots that is fighting the bugs in a swamp is basically walking-backwards-and-left-clicking for a dozen minutes because the bugs are freakingly tough and slow. The other one that you drive a tank to fight an eyeball spider is a dumb copy of angry-birds --- except that you don't see your trajectory before shooting, both you and the spider is moving and that there is no way you can dodge the spider's attack. Oh, and there are three of them, coming out one by one, followed by a boss whose attack you cannot dodge, neither.","May 8","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
