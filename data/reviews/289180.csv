"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TxN_RUS/recommended/289180/","TxN_RUS","TxN [ISIS]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TxN_RUS/","106 products in account","The one of the most undervalued games made by russian gamedev, in my opinion.\nGood story, stylish design, great music, big open world with own secrets.\n\nThe game about Artificial Intelligence, enclosed in small indestructible ball, which controls a large battle machines, designed to exterminate all what it considers as enemy.\nBut these robots doesnt want to kill all humans, it's too mainstream, moreover they would worship humans if they had them on their abandoned planet. But no one forbids them to fight each other. Or to trade. Or to be a courier.\n\nI strictly recommend you to also to play the first part of this game (AIM, 2004). In some aspects, it better than this part, better story, in particular. Sadly, we can't buy it on Steam.\n\nOn the other side - this game is a bit buggy. But i hope, it will be fixed in future.\n","May 25, 2014","true","12.4"," 69 of 72 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","69","72","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/playoftheyear/recommended/289180/","playoftheyear","playoftheyear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/playoftheyear/","142 products in account","I love this game as much as any other game in my Library, the game loves me back too, thats why its scary. Everytime I "die" in the game, I get a crash to desktop- no matter when or where, I have to shutdown system and restart. I thought the game was fluid and the floaty controls were excellent for hovership or Gliders thats what the game calls them. So I thought a game about Artificial Intelligences conversing and socializing with each other is quite weird in itself and it is. The story is undeniably quirky and lacking human feeling because there are no humans. How hard could it be to try and bridge the gap between fighting mech clans and unite them together for the sake of theirs and the entire worlds fate. Well the AI has its own AI, you see.\nMissions are granted at bases, most that I saw were standard fetch, delivery, terminate etc. There are game progression missions too, but sorting these from the rest is difficult and it should be so. Every mission changes the world, whether it be the economy which is always fluctuating, you can buy and sell as a trader or defeating a ♥♥♥♥ head mech that would allow you access to futher reaches of the zone, not to mention resolving parts of the story. It is a mystery too and quite intriguing in the respect that you do not have to worry about certain natural  dialogue occuring. You are unravelling a mystery and learning to understand how mechminds compute. It is all quite innocent and brutal at the same time.\nLike I said the controls were floaty, why so floaty? I will bet most refunds come from the tutorial. The glider they give you is atrocious. You will see if you play, luckily its only 5 minutes before you get right down and comfortable in a much better quality glider. Then the game takes off. I don't know if it would be so bad if there was voice acting. I think the environment would be fantastic if they had off kilter computer like voices, it would open up so much, but there is a ton of reading. Thankfully There is a ton of action and most is up to the player if they want to partake.\nIn finality this review is coming to an end. Beware this game is probably more than you asked for. If you believe in overcoming near impossible odds in an open world very foreign and very familiar GET THIS GAME and tell others. The Gliders are all upgradeable many times over, nothing for style, just don't try and read my mind after you play it. My short time so far has indebted me to write a review.","March 16","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Most machines just followed his program - moving to perfection.  For this they fought and traded. These machines could not die, because after the destruction of their "physical shell" - glider, all accumulated information and "computer center" - mechanoid remained intact. And behold, one momet in this world of eternal war without death, world of eternal race for perfection came mechanoid which first began to think about something that is not a direct consequence of  initial program: what it is? who are the creators? for what they have left them on this planet and where gone?\nbest expressed by one reviewer.

Interaction with enviroment is rather limited.\n\nThere are many gliders and upgrades to pick from, but they must be grinded for. Gliders and their equipment in hangar can be sold at the same price they were bought for, making amount of money (energy crystals) a substitute for an "experience bar" that measures character's (mechminds) progress besides the ranking system.\n\nControls are decent, and after getting certain add-ons and upgrading engine - it's really nice to actually glide over the sectors.\n\nCombat is fun around places with busy trafic but it never reaches a scale of war. Just random dogfights. AI isn't challenging either.\n\nClan managment is rather limited (having two sliding bars for adjusting role ratio)  and having clan doesn't provide any actual benefit as it simply serves as a plot point / plot key. Recruiting clan members just reduces things to shoot at, eventually eliminating the only source of action there is in game.\n\nSide quests are mostly unmemorable (there are few that reveals interesting bits of lore).\n\nWhile trading has the same patern acros all sectors and it's satisfying overall, each structure still has to be visited seperatly while searching for good oportunity to profit before starting trading runs, since there's no remote way to monitor stock even in captured structures that belong to the clan and that's bothersome. Without presence of the player in the sector economy eventually colapses - AI traders can't sustain sector on their own.\n\nGraphics are fine.\n\nLocalisation could've been done better.\n\nHad to disable music since it plays in loops due to some bug.\nExperienced movement bugs as well.\nGame crashes from time to time.","June 18, 2015","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
