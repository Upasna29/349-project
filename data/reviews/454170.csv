I'm not really fond of how the melodies sound. The editing is a bit awkward, too.\n- Not enough choices. The story is trying to give you multiple choices for each situation to make it more interactive but it's limited only to random conversations that don't have any affect on the plot.\n\nVERDICT: The novel's okay so far. Not as good as I thought it was in my head, though-- but hey, I'm still on the second chapter when I made this review. My opinion might change. Just make sure you have the volume off so you don't have to listen to the music.","April 14","true","5.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

In order to get it, he infiltrates the\nschool as student...\nPretty neat and cool plot, many dialouge options for perfect immersion (although most of them doesn't\nreally change the plot in a major way).\n\nEndings:There are 3 endings, one of the endings is quite hard to achieve without"help"(will explain in the following soon)\nI've played a lot of visual novels, in most of them there is a "good"(cool and satisfying) and a\n"bad"(unsatisfying, short, strange) ending...not here in XorceD, all endings are cool and satisfying.\nAlso in most other VNs it is hard or even nearly impossible to get a desired ending without googling\na walkthrough, but in this game the developers solved this problem in a very elegant and lore-abiding\nway, which ask you whether to completely reveal what to do exactly -or- just to give hints so you can\ntry to again yourself -or- to point out what you did wrong in the last playthrough.\n\nPresentation: Arts are nice, soundtrack is ok which catches the situation.\n\nPS: Don't skip the credits, there's bonuscontent after that. Bonuscontent is linked to every ending,\nso you get total 3 different bonuscontent which is in my opinion quite entertaining!","April 16","true","8.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"
