Especially with all the available DLC it has lots and lots of content to keep you busy for a long while and make sure you'll get money's worth. Like all simulations and simulation games it is obviously not a complete and perfect replica of the real world. Of all the Simulation-games I've played throughout my life it is one of the deppest and most realistic simulations though.\n\nYou should definitely not play this game if you're afraid to start over again many times until you reach one of the desired endings. There is a reason that the 7th word in the description is "dramatic". You'll often run into bad ends or simply won't reach the neccessary mission goals in time. A great idea can backfire and make you think twice about adopting it the next time around.\n\nThe game presents choices for every region in "cards". This makes it look like a card-game to some people but it really isn't. I think the game desingers just tried to find a name to summarize "Policies", "Research Programs", "Military Actions", etc. and then they though "Hey, those things are presented on stuff that looks like cards." So they went with cards. Don't be turned away becaues you don't like card-games. FotW is not a card game and it might just aswell be called "decisions"; There's no deck, no drawing of cards, etc, etc.\n\nPlay this game if:\n-You like mental challenges\n-You're not afraid to see our Earth go to hell (because of your decisions)\n-You think Trial-and-Error can be fun\n\nDon't play this game if:\n-You hate starting over\n-You hate going through menus and just want to "play play play"","November 26, 2013","true","11.0"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","58","61","0","0"

In charge of GEO, you are faced with all the global problems at the same time from floods and changing weather patterns caused by the global warming, economic crisis caused by the decreasing oil production rate and the social crisis caused by overpopulation. You tackle the problems by instituting 5-year plans. They are represented by issuing policies, i.e. "playing cards", each of which costs money and man power. And if you screw up, you will be lynched or disintegrated by a global nuclear war.\n\nThere are six card types, ranging from projects to several kinds of policies. Projects are special long-term actions that let you e.g. start space program or force people to go vegetarian. The policies allow you to do anything from e.g. constructing defenses against warming effects to using extreme measures of population control. These are used to affect the problems represented by charts and statistics available to those of you who want to see the concrete effects.\n\nAt first it feels easy to handle the problems. Then the economic crisis because of the lack of oil kicks in and you no longer have enough money to handle everything. Then you have to learn to prioritize or get lynched trying.\n\nThere are several scenarios to try out. The basic one, with several variations, is to try to survive until year 2200 battling the global warming and trying to save the humanity, but there's also a scenario where you're actually trying to destroy the world, if you're in a mood for some evil masterminding.\n\nMood and suspense are big things here, maintained by some awestrucking music and local news from around the world, listed by region. Interface needs a while to get used but most of the action happens anyway in choosing policies and judging, what you can afford and where to concentrate your efforts. One full game takes about two hours of intense thinking to play through, so by the time you're through with your first game you'll already know enough to try that much better again. It's exciting to try different approaches and once you finally manage to survive through the term (even barely), it's a total triumph.","December 3, 2013","true","47.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

To be honest, this game is rather difficult and not easy to pick up because alot of the terminology and proposed schemes for fixing Climate Change will likely be unknown to alot of people. There is some in-game information, but that still won't prevent this game from often being frustrating. Also it has bugs, with some of the achievements simply being broken with almost no chance of them ever being fixed since the devs for this game are long gone.\n\nIt's an informative little game that is often frustrating due to its difficulty and lack of adequate information. Another case where a simple "yes" or "no" just is not enough to describe my overall views on this game. Ultimately... I'm going to have to say no. It's interesting and a rare game dealing with real-world issues, but it's problems are just too annoying for me to recommend. :(","April 14, 2015","false","58.3"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","1"

To do so, you are given a whole lot of options and a large chain of potential tasks you can tell your lackeys to do.\n\nThe first problem then is obvious, you have no idea what these tasks(Displayed as cards) do until you try them, and often only a vague idea of how they'll effect the various things they're supposed to effect. This will be frustrating, and may lead to you just restarting several times just to see what your policies are actually doing, and what they're effecting. Trial and error gameplay will be the first thing you notice, but that is only after you have spend a turn building offices all over, which you need before you can even see what policies and programs you can enact.\nThere is no real tech tree equivalent you can find that shows you what exactly you can do after building one of such offices, or what leads to what other things.\nA real shame is that the game is excellent at hiding your options from you, and that it also hides the data behind a small tab in the top right. You can see practically everything you need to know about an area, but how your politices will effect it, or how these things interact with eachother is left completely behind the scenes. Only a few things you can do actually tell you the full extend of what they're going to be doing with the limited money you're spending on them.\n\nIn short, frustration. However, once you get over that and learn roughly what policies go where, you will find the game opens up to you, and lets you actually play it. And it is a much bigger game than it seems to be at first. Sure, it deals with global warming, and your goal is technically to stop it, but to focus purely on that is not going to help you. It's your end goal, while your organisation does not only have the authority, but also the responsibility to prevent wars, establish healthcare and education systems, manage economic growth, and fund technology. And all of these things are not told to you, and neither is it explained to you how to do them, you have essentially become the New World Order and everyone more experienced than you has died or quit. Indeed, one can ask what actual governments do in this game, and I so far haven't seen them bother with anything yet.\n\nWhen they said it was all up to you to stop climate change, they meant EVERYTHING. Make the middle east a stable place, prevent the global economy from crashing, fund space missions, create anti-flooding and drought systems, establish healthcare all over the globe, stop deforestation, ease the use of fossile fuel, and many, many more things.\nAnd to do this, you get barely a cent.\nAnd even if you do know what you're doing, even a little, you will have trouble. There is very little margin for error, as a few mistakes will send Africa into a continent-wide civil war(As opposed to how it is right now with only parts of it being at war all the time), and you might start nuclear conflicts in Latin America if you don't personally check up on them every turn to make sure they aren't getting ready to use your nuclear power plants for weaponry. Fate of the World is difficult in part because there are a lot of factors involved, and you are told about none of them until ♥♥♥♥ has already hit the fan.\n\nMake no mistake, it is a difficult game, but it is a great simulator. It simulates production of fossil fuels, transport, energy generation, industry, agriculture, economy, disasters and so much more. But it just doesn't tell you about any of this.\nAside from that, the moral lessons it tries to teach are questionable at best. As the only way so far that I have found to get close to succeeding every time I try is to start a genocide program targetting China, India, the Middle East, and if they keep complaining South Asia too.\n\nFate of the World teaches you(Or at least, me) that the only way foreward is to kill the asians(Except Japan), and to wipe the Middle East from the map. Africa is to be policed at all times and forcibly kept poor(but educating them) until technology exists to create emissions free power and industry for them.\nThe Americas and Europe are to be converted to renewable power, with media campaigns focussing on distracting them from the rest of the world. Japan and Oceania are pretty much empty as far as global population is concerned, so just give them a few defences against floods and occasionally some other protection if they need it.(To switch over ALL of Oceania's transports to electric instead of oil based costs the same as all of Europe or North America's for some reason)\n\nFate of the World is an interesting game that I would recommend for people who enjoy detailed simulators, and don't mind having to figure out everything themselves. But I would certainly not give it to kids.\nWorth 10 bucks? I'd say so, if you are one of those people into simulators, or if you've seen someone play it and think you can do better","September 9, 2015","true","23.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

If you dig deeper than the surface cards and their effects, there are massive amounts of data available for you to fine tune your economies and environmental efforts.\n\nI would have paid more for this game.","July 3, 2011","true","63.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I recommend watching a walkthrough of the game before you attempt anything beyond the first mission (tutorial).\n\nBut the main takeaway from the game is that it teaches you about the world, about the dangers of trying to deal with global warming, without actually trying to teach you anything.  It's amazing how that works out.\n\nI first played it early 2011 and as time moves on, I continue to see things happening in the world that I already knew about due to this game.  It blows my mind.  It's also a real shame the world seems to be so ignorant towards global warming and the future of not only life on earth, but also the planet itself.\n\nThis is a must try for everyone, no matter what type of gamer you are.  Even if you don't really like slow paced strategy games, you might enjoy how it unknowingly teaches you about the dangers of the future, and how painfully hard it is to manage the world.\n\nThe game's title really does fit perfectly.","December 21, 2012","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example, species go extinct all the time, Africa needs to be pacified by armed might before you can think about saving Rhinos, and nations will expel your global environmentalist super organization if your goals don’t mesh with their national interests.\n\nPersonally, I like it.

Very hard. The first mission's no problem, but I'm still trying to figure out the second one after three failures. The main problem is that you aren't given enough information to tell what affects what, or how you're supposed to react to certain problems. One false move in 2030 will leave India devastated in 2070, and you don't know what it was most of the time.\n\nIt's worth giving this game a try if you can pick it up cheap.

That's the good side.\n\nThe game idea is great. You are responsible for a new organization that has to take care of mainly the earth itself. Your moves are measured against the global temperature rise. You can reach your goal through different ways. Quite interesting is the idea of drawing cards.\n\nBut...\n\nonce you're diving deep into the game you will miss a sandbox mode. However, you might think that this is only a minor point. The major missing point is that you rarely know what impact your moves got onto the engine. This makes the game quite hard to play at some points.\n\nFor me was the "but" a big issue, thus I can't recommend the game.","November 21, 2014","false","12.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

(all of this on a very limited budget)\n\nI know that I wouldn't feel PO'd at the GEO if my country was erupting into civil war around me.  I'd feel PO'd at the government.  So, having the media and populace specifically targeting your staff and regional centers for something that your organization really Should Not have anything to do with, really raises my hackles.\nOn the same line of thought... Healthcare, education, and housing?  Why would people get PO'd at an environmental organization about these things when you can be PO'd at the government who's actually supposed to take care of it instead?  I just don't get it.\n\nAnd maybe that's the problem.

It makes things very fun (if often hectic and complicated), in that you have a huge amount of complicated interactions to explore, and the actions available feel like they're genuinely interesting as a result.  It also makes the game educational -- while not everyone is going to agree with the precise model they used (or the research they based it on), it gives a good overview of the various environmental and resource-related issues facing the world today, and the general pros and cons of each of the numerous ways we have to address them.  Most of all, it captures how complicated these problems are; even with almost complete control over the world's policies, you're probably not going to be able to solve them without a lot of attention to detail and careful balancing.\n\nThe drawback to all this is that its heavy focus on the real world means that the game eventually gets fairly repetitive.  It comes with a number of scenarios, and there's a lot of room to try different options, but ultimately you're going to be facing the same general problem with the same general tools, and once you've figured out a working solution the game is pretty much "solved" -- some scenarios may be harder or easier, or might tweak your goals a bit, but since the overarching situation of the planet doesn't change much, it's more or less the same game each time -- it lacks the replay value of Civilization or similar games that let you explore alternate worlds.\n\nWith that said, it's definitely worth playing for anyone who is interested in any of the issues it touches on, or for anyone interested in real-world management games in general.","June 22, 2015","true","35.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
