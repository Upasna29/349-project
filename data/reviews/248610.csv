(And I'm not using the word just because it's cool)\n\nHow would I describe Door Kickers ?\nThis game reminds me of older releases that change the way FPSes are played such as Rainbow Six and SWAT.\nThis is a slow and methodical game as it'll brutally punish you if a mistake have been made. Thought and precise movements must be taken into account if you wish for all of your troopers to survive that one bloody great gunfight.\n\nHow does this game differ itself from the rest ?\nFirst of all, it is innovative. This is done in the style of the briefing phase in Rainbow Six, but it is completely real time with pausing mechanics so you are able to change your plan on the fly other than having to exit to the planning phase and change your movements and start over.\n\nHow is this game tactical ?\nWell, the RPS 'Best Tactics of 2014' says for itself.\nNot enough, aye ?\nFine. Door Kickers is one of those games that shines during situations where you can't just go guns blazing.\n\nFor example,\nthere is a hostage taker standing right behind the hostage facing toward the only entry point of the room.\nNow, being the Top Down game that Door Kickers is, there is no third dimension so when your team step into the room, the hostage taker will open fire and hit the hostage before he hits you.\nSo what do you do ?\n1. Bang the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... I meant a flashbang. Blind him so your team has time to move around and neutralise him without harming the hostage\n2. If there is a window, you can send a trooper to flank him from a different angle.\n\nMultiple ways to problem solve, is it enough evidence that this game is tactical ?\nNo ?\nWell, the game has different kinds of situations that you have to adapt to, such as\n- Eliminate Hostiles : It's basically Terrorist Hunt. Go in, kill all the baddies, win.\n- Hostage Rescue : It's just like Terrorist Hunt, but with Hostages in it. Possibility of an Execution though.\n- Stop Execution : A baddie in the area is about to blow the brains out of someone and you have to stop them.\n- Bomb Defusal : Well, the name says it all.\n- Dope Raid : Recover evidence mainly dope, and dope papers.\n- Warrant Arrest : Again, name says it all.\n- Protect VIP : ... I don't really have to describe this one at all, do I ?\n- Robbery in Progress : Somehow, the devs know how lazy I get when I need to describe things.\n\nWhat ? Still not enough ? Are you kidding me...\nFine.\nThe game has an arsenal of trooper classes, weapons, and equipment to outfit your team to suit the situation\nClasses include (If you haven't seen the video above)\n- Pointman : Only armed with a pistol, has the highest mobility and is the fastest during entry, but isn't the best at range\n- Assaulter : Guy with the guns. Basically, guy that shoots all the baddies for you.\n- Breacher : As the name implies, he breaches door ways, clear rooms, and corridors in hasty manner. I like to call him "Hobo with a Shotgun"\n- Shield : The guy that you would want to bring when the baddies bring their big guns.\n- Stealth : Shhhh... I'm trying to think of a description for this one... Damn it, keep quiet! I'm trying to think!\n\nWeapons range from simple submachine guns such as the MP5A3 to meaner rifles like the G36C to a punch in the face like the Mossberg 590.\nSidearms ? No problem! Glocks, 1911s, and P226s, anything is in store! Just need to trade in your gold stars!\nOh, we got loads of equipments, Flashbang, Breaching Charges, Tasers, even a little handheld machine that allows you to picklock faster!\n\nSo as you can see, this game is completely tacticool...\nWHAT? NOT ENOUGH!? Bruh, I'm done. I got nothing else. You can go watch them YouTube videos and find them all out on your own. I ain't gonna tell you everything man.\nOh, but you want the know the truth !? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.\n\nAnyways, I love this game. One of my favourite games, as you can see, spent over 100 hours on this thing.\nIf I could rename my girlfriend, I would name her "Window Smashers".\n\nThank you for reading my Review. It's probably too long, but heck. At least I got it out there, right ?","December 17, 2014","true","367.9"," 582 of 610 people (95%) found this review helpful 205 people found this review funny","95","582","610","205","22"

It offers hugely evolving gameplay and a load of weapon combinations to suit your playstyle. You will be able to use armories from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, US, etc.) and also have different forms of each weapon (Silences, or non-silenced) for you to be able to in stealthily or blow your way into the enemy lines. You will also have the option of creativity as each time you do a mission you will want a new strategy, and it allows you to have multiple ways of getting into a room, from pick-locking a door to blowing it down with C4 or shottgunning the lock. You will also enjoy the challenging gameplay of only having a limited amount of men and will likely be outnumbered, forcing you to strategize and plan instead of rushing them like it's a Third-person shooter.\n\nAlso note this game is being created by a small, indie team. So you will not get updates every other day, but it seems so far they have been having extremely large updates every two weeks, which likely means they love there buyers so much they are over working themselves.\n\nIf you have the money, and enjoy planning and then watching your men burst in and dominate the enemy or have one thing go wrong and watch your team get slaughtered, then buy the game. It's fairly cheap and really innovative to the market, it's also in early access so there is so much more to come and it's completely playable and almost bug free in its current state.\n","December 7, 2013","true","45.4"," 163 of 172 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","163","172","0","0"

Sadly, this is not a joke :(\n- tons of missions and ways to complete them. I mean, TONS\n- slick and easy UI\n- mods support\n- mission generator + built-in mission maker + possibility to share it\n- this is how every Warhammer40k tactical game should look like, just change the skin and you got mindbreaking legendary crusade\n\nCons:\n- lack of narrative briefing for missions like story, characters and intrigue (remembering Gunpoint), just short descriptions\n- when multiple troopers paths are crossed it is becomes too hard to micro-command like look there, step here\n- RNG sometimes looks weird, like one try you one-shot everything and another one you're wasting whole magazine for one guy\n- sometimes your troopers AI just stuck stopping your unit before some doors\n- I know this is not the core, but I guess with some gorgeous graphics engine it would look just marvellous. Anyway, these guys did so amazing game, it's just very good VS best.\n\nVerdict:It was long time ago since I was so satisfied with some game.

This title has been on my radar for a very long time and I decided to pick it up during summersale. Now I have finally played it and I have to say that it's great!\n\nIf you enjoy games like Xcom you will most likely have fun with doorkickers, or if you have an interest in swat games and tactics planning. This game have so many levels and challenges you can complete. Also there's a story, although it felt just like the normal quick games I would say.\n\nYou can also create your own maps and download others for unlimited fun! Save hostages, kill bad guys and capture wanted criminals. Its intense at times but it's always fun to play!\n\nDoorkickers comes with all the neat steam features like achievement, steam cloud, etc. Game runs well and you have a good options menu. You level up your soldiers in game and unlock new classes and weapons.\n\nThis game is great and I would strongly recommend everyone to at least try it out at some point.

A little bit of information is given to the player about gameplay mechanics and the rest is left up to them to figure out through trial and error. This, in part, is why there's no "do it this way to win" approach to informing the player. Inspired by the planning stages of Rainbow Six, with a SWAT aesthetic, and turned into a feature length game, it all makes sense. A player must learn to play the game much like they must learn to understand how to deal with the situation in which their troopers find themselves. Or be left to suffer the consequences.\n\nAlthough it's possible to make arrests and to subdue assailants with a taser, that's not where the emphasis lies. The opponents you're dealing with are all presumed to be heavily armed and willing to kill you on site based on the knowledge that they most likely already have. Once you understand that, the gear and equipment options available in-game will make a lot more sense. That is why this game is more comparable to Rainbow Six than Swat 3 or 4. It's not about getting a conviction but dishing out the punishment because the verdict has already been made.\n\nI highly recommend this game. But that recommendation entirely depends on the type of gamer you are. This game is for the thinker. Sometimes you'll make a plan that will take a few seconds and so will the mission. Other times, you'll spend a few hours only for the mission to fail. It's not the game's fault, nor is it yours. That's just a harsh reality and simply a matter of learning from such mistakes. If you want mindless satisfaction, are looking for a game that plays itself, or were born yesterday, this is not the game for you. This game is a challenge, your enjoyment will entirely depend on whether or not you'll accept it as such and rise to the occasion. So the question is: do you accept the challenge?","September 8, 2015","true","437.1"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","89","94","5","2"

If you loved the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4, you'll probably love this even more. Fan of RTS and action games, you must give this one a shot. This is basically one of those games where it gets better and better as you get used to the mechanics and unlock new stuff.\n\nDoor Kickers is a tactical RTS game where you take control of a SWAT team and save the day through hostage rescue missions, bomb defusal missions, VIP escorts and everything else a SWAT-based game should have. The game can be played either by planning everything at the start of a level and watch as the team executes your orders (Rainbow Six style) or by taking control of your units in real-time. You can also do both, since the action can be paused at any time (recommended for starters).\n\nPROS+ Tactical SWAT gameplay at its finest. Assign equipment to each unit, plan and execute any way you want; easy to pick up and play.\n+ Many guns to choose from and different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n+ Very high replayability: lots of individual and varied missions, campaigns, map editor, random mission generator and great mod support.\n+ Awesome soundtrack and clean graphics that match the atmosphere of the game.\n+ Still gets updated with additional free content and bug fixes.\n\nCONS- Slightly frustrating at times\n- Some Workshop mods may be incompatible because of the new updates.\n\nPersonal rating: 9/10","December 3, 2014","true","40.5"," 97 of 109 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","97","109","0","0"

The survival of your officers is heavily based on your ability to control your tactical angles.  Real tactics, techniques, and procedures work (for the most part).  As an added bonus, you can create videos of your playthroughs, which you can then edit and use it to help train your team, whether it be a video game clan, paintball, airsoft, or even actual military and law enforcement.  By having a clear display of each officer's field of view, you can accurately portray sectors of fire and emphasize an understanding of the importance of angles.  Add to this that you can create your own levels with nothing more than some photo editing software, and you have the ability to create any training aid or game level you wish, complex or simple.\n\nCurrently, this game is in Alpha.   Right now, the game has a feel of many Android or Apple games, with a bunch of sequentially harder scenarios that you attempt to earn three stars on.  Time is the primary factor for achieving the three stars, which is somewhat counter to how a SWAT team actually acts.  Slow and safe is often preferred to fast and loose.  Things have gotten a bit deeper as the game has progressed through its Alpha stage, with the addition of different classes, levels of armor, rank progression of your officers, and training unlocks.  Updates have come at a very steady pace, and have consistantly added new great features that make me happy I bought the game.\n\nThis game can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.  Do you want to intricately plan out your entire team's movement with go codes and then press play and see what happens?  Or do you want to work through the scenario as it plays out, pausing and unpausing to make changes on the fly or control an officer's field of fire directly?  Either way works, and it's up to you.\n\nThis game is so much fun.  You can run through a quick scenario to get your fix, or you can try for the best score on a hard level for hours.  With new scenarios being added constantly by the community, and the ability to create random missions from any map, you have an endless amount of replay value.","May 13, 2014","true","155.5"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","2"

The game offers a large amount of depth and content with fully customizable SWAT team, weapons, gear, and classes. The game shines in the planning stage where you are put in control of laying out the exact movements and actions of each SWAT agent, choose whether to go in guns blazing and blast down the door, or take a more stealthy approach and use spy cams to monitor your enemy’s movements before entering. You can take as many or as few times as you wish to pause the game on the fly mid action and adjust your plans to adapt to the hectic battlefield that unfolds as your agents press forward into the enemies territory; however, by far the most satisfying and rewarding part of the game is when you preplan and successfully defeat all the enemies in single attempt without pausing to adjust.\n\nThe game has a very satisfying level of difficulty that will definitely force you to retry missions multiple times until you learn from your mistakes, which at times may feel frustrating due to the varying random difficulty spikes that you will encounter, but this only adds more to the level of satisfaction you will feel when you successfully complete the mission. Upon completion of a mission you are scored by a 3 star system that varies based on your performance, the stars you earn are then used as the currency to upgrade your gear and purchase new weapons. The game features a ton of playable content, offering tons of levels to play in single player, campaign, and both a level and mission editor to create your own levels and share them via Steam Workshop Mods.\n\nThe game offers an incredibly high amount of content and depth with a very high replay-ability value, the game is truly an indie gem that has done an excellent job at captivating the feel from the Rainbow Six series and bringing it to 2014.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","December 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","48","57","3","3"

It was added to steam on September 3rd, 2013. The game features a mix of real time strategy with a tactical stop and go pause mode that allows you to analyze situations, and make your plans for each map. There is a small amount of customization in the current build of the game but that is simply due to the early access nature of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty great, however it can be rage inducing at times. The main idea is to kill the bad guys and have at least one of your own team mates left standing at the end. In some cases there are hostages to rescue which can put a timer on the level. All the levels can be completed in a small time window . Ultimately you want to play a level as fast as possible with little to no casualties.\n\nThe game is a early access game and thus has many features missing. With that said the game is great as it is right now. Of course a few flaws that I’m not sure are bugs or overlooked design. For example there are times when I open a door and my character is looking directly at a person and will mow them and 3 other people down without being shot. Then there are times where the same guy will open the door and sing love songs to the enemies and thus getting domed (shot in the mother♥♥♥♥ing skull). It feels like r.n.g and less bug but who am I to say. This was the only real issue I had with the game. Especialy on the one level at the beach where I had one guy left, and there was one enemy left. My guy opens the door to the bathroom and both the ai and my character stand their in a stand off for about fifteen seconds before the ai shoots my guy in the face…..\n\nThe levels can be played in many ways, the best is just to find a style that suits you. For most of my levels I set a path for my guys to run and it worked. I very rarely had to pause the game after my initial plan. However if you want you can breach doors. After breaching a room, you can pause the room to setup what to do next. The breaching, and or DOOR KICKING is the core of the game. You have several ways to breach. You can just kick a door in and hope your guys don’t get blasted before they can see through the door. You can also breach with a flashbang where they open a door and throw a flashbang in. Again however if your guy is standing directly infront of the door you risk getting shot and killed so it is best to do it from the side. Then there is the breaching charge where you setup a charge on the door and can detonate it. This stuns most of the people in the room giving you an advantage. You can also use a snake cam to see under the doors.\n\nThe game has no multiplayer but the developers say it MIGHT come later. The game also has a mission editor , however I did not play around with that yet. It does mean the game will have many mods and games with mods are always better because of it! The game as single player is a lot of fun and I definitely suggest anyone who likes tactical strategy games to make this purchase. The game is worth every god damn dime. As far as early access games go this is one of the better ones on steam. I will of course do a re-review of the game upon full release of the game.\n\nYou want a score don’t you?

The controls do seem to be a bit difficult to master, but at least for the simple mechanics, you do catch on quickly.\n\nThe action is quite tactical, no nonsense. I definitely get the feeling that there is an incredible amount of depth in the game, and already I'm looking forward to playing again.\n\nThe built in mod-ability and mission generation, combined with the fact that the game is built around its solid mechanics (rather than any sort of linear narrative) seems to ensure that the "dollars spent":"hours of fun" ratio is quite favorable.","October 21, 2014","true","18.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

Its some of the best games for a quick casual "turn-your-head-off" after work / school and kills all the boredom.\n\nAnd for me it's just even more motivation that most achievments are more of rewards for actually good playing rather than grinding and more grinding and more grinding...\n\nSince I believe this game could run on ANY PC out there you dont need to worry about your Rig...just enjoy it if you like ~5 bucks for many hours of fun seems like a good deal, eh? :P\n","July 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","34","39","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HolloweDragon/recommended/248610/","HolloweDragon","RazieLight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HolloweDragon/","776 products in account","< Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nA tactical strategy game that you can play in 2 modes, Real-Time or Planning Mode ( Kinda like transistor ) and kicking doors never been so fun\n\nThe game has a very large set of levels and its possibly endless, Around 80+ levels on Single Missions, And Also a lot of levels On campaign mode, And a lot of community created maps (Via level editor) And Theres also a Random Mission Generator which is really cool!.\nyou choose the map size the scenario and the difficulty, so yeah I meant it when I said Endless...But the fun does not last that long well it depends on your taste, gonna get to this in a moment.\n\nYou can customize every Swat member of yours, changing their gear and what not, Changing from assaulter to breacher and stealth or point-man Pistols, or pistols+rifles or shotguns or swat shield...etc.\nFun to use equipment's, such as a spy-cam to peak through a door and you move it left or right, or a breaching charge to plant on a door and blow it up to knockdown/kill enemies, And of course flash bangs, Stingers and more.\n\nOn each level you get stars which you can use to unlock more Equipment's , Stronger/heavier shields or armors or weapons just an example.\n\nI really like the game control, You can assign your units to ( A(alpha) B(Beta) C(Charlie) D(Delta) ) And assign plans to each which they will execute after you press the assigned button on UI or keyboard, Really good to coordinate your unit movements ( Shields first, snipers last) and execute the perfect plan which takes some serious thinking.\n\nAt some levels you also get a sniper that auto-locks on targets on your sight, You can press Tab to order him to switch to another target and S to take the shot.\n\nThe enemy responds are pretty clever, they don't just mess around, you'd usually need to flashbang them or flank them or use any method to distract them to avoid allied losses.\nThe game music is very good and gives you the mood to focus on your plans, or pumps you up to go break sh*t and kill everyone.\n\nGame levels are pretty great, Although there are a lot of levels you don't see them getting repeated.\nGame difficulty is pretty hard, And keeps getting harder as you go on.\n\nSingle Mission Mode, Is a set of 80+ levels that you play each with its mission and different level layout, You could skip the first ones and jump to the last.\n\nCampaign mode, Has no story its just a set of levels that you keep on playing with limited swat units, when you finish a level with some causalities they don't come back in the next level so you have to be careful and usually restart when they die, Around 5 Campaigns each is about 4 to 9 Levels, with completely different layouts, It also has the caption ( More to come ) so thats good I guess, they want to add more.\n\nLeveling up your squad to the next level gets you access to the next Class ( Which I mentioned earlier the Stealth or Breacher .. etc )\nApparently there are (Doctrines) points that you get awarded by leveling up your squad level, And use them in a Skill-Tree to give you more abilities and accuracy and more.\nOf-course you level up by receiving the exp award at the end of every level.\n\nThe game has a lot of achievements, At first they are easy to obtain but the later ones are pure hell this is fun for grinders.\n\nLevel editor is easy to use, And power it with your imagination, Create a hostage rescue, Annihilation, DrugBust, Arrest, Robbery, Vip Secure, Stop the execution And of-course Defuse the bomb.\n2 mods that already exists that adds some levels and a few stuff ( Christmas mod, Template mod )\n\nThe Other SideSo now after all the good has been said let me tell you about the other side.\n\nAlthough the game is really good it has its own fair share of cons.\n\nSometimes my units becomes dull and throws the bomb although I specifically stopped the action by pressing the delete icon, and sometimes they also become very slow to react when an enemy appear that i'v been waiting for, takes them time to take the shot and sometimes they'd kill my units before they even reacted to seeing them, I don't know if this is how the game wants it to be just saying.\n\nI really dislike it when a unit throws a Bomb it has to wait before making a move, I understand that's how it works in reality but most of the time the delay backfires because it reaches them after the effect of the Flash-bang wore off, and it goes there to die.\n\nSome levels are fairly hard and others are insanely unfair and frustrating, reach the point where you just keep on doing it again and again and again and going full-throttle until your units mans up and takes the shot accurately and miraculously you win.\n\nReason why I said ( Apparently there are doctrine points ) Its because I saw it the first time I launched the game but forgotten about it, And the game has no hints or anything to show me or remind me to use it in main-menu, I was missing around my rank and accidentally saw it lol... Which brings me to the next point.\n\nLack of tutorials, I don't mind this but if you are the type that wont go without them just a heads-up (There is a how to play guide)\n\nUnits becomes stupid when they collide with each other, they just stop and do not perform their next action instead of turning around the unit or object.\n\nThere is a bugged level in campaign which made it impossible to me to finish the 2nd one ( so I skipped to the next one )\nIn which a mission where I'm supposed to secure the VIP and bring him back to the safe zone, And usually killing all hostiles gets the job done and leaving no need to get the hostages but this one required it, So I go set next to him so he'd follow me but he never did, Played it around 9 times already and never got to finish it....was incredibly frustrating.\n\nLIKE I mentioned at the beginning of the review after a while the game may gets boring depends on your taste.\nAs for me after around 7 hours I started getting really bored, Although the game has a lot of different levels, The feeling stays the same, Be careful and quick to finish the mission blah blah, Gets a bit boring in my own opinion, They should'v made a way to spice it up with more challenges and stuff, Again thats just me, There are people who played this for over 25+ hours and did not complain at all.\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to read all that\n\nPROS :\n1 - Tactical-type game that requires strategy and thinking, Difficult but fun.\n2 - A lot of levels to play, And a random mission generator, Campaigns and Community Maps.\n3 - A lot of Weapons, Utilities (Gadgets) And support gear to unlock.\n4 - Customizing every unit in every mission to make it best suitable for the current level.\n5 - A lot of achievements to grind on, Trading cards and Steam-Cloud.\n6 - Great game music and sound effects, gets that thinking mode of yours pumping.\n\nCONS :\n1 - Sometimes it gets kinda frustrating on how some levels are ridiculously difficult compared to later ones.\n2 - A few clunkiness in character movements colliding with each other and slow reactions in some cases.\n3 - A few bugs I found on certain levels which made some impossible to finish and the rest just 10 times harder.\n\n\nAlso something I really liked about the game.\nThe terrorists are not portrayed as Arabs, They always make terrorists in video games to look and sound like Arabs *cough*Cs*Cough* and more games ... It frustrates me makes me feel discriminated against sometimes although i love those games, BUT it was really refreshing and nice to see a game that made a different approach.\n\nTL;DR\nA game for the tactical shooter fans, definitely worth its full price, Hard as HELL and takes some LONG ♥♥♥ time to complete, and even longer to 100%, And to get all the level ups and unlock everything, i'd say 30+ hours.\nVery fun game Although this review might not show it but I enjoyed it a lot 8/10","February 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","49","65","8","12"

There's also some basic customization to get you a bit emotionally attached to your men (and women). However it seems that there are no female voices, so females will report in with male voices.\nNo mp or coop yet, but I think they are planning to add that after phone versions release.\n\nSidenote: If you use steam overlay a lot keep in mind that the shift key locks the path, so after you've been to the overlay press shift once to make the controls normal again.","June 18, 2015","true","39.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","21","21","3","5"

You draw your troopers' paths with your mouse, place waypoints and commands and then watch the action unfold according to your plan. There is also the option to pause the action in real-time and switch orders on the fly. The game went through many iterations and improvements during early access, both frequent and meaningful in content and changes / fixes.\n\nThe biggest draws of the game (apart from the obvious - existing in a great genre that is virtually abandoned) is the fact that it has Steam Workshop support and an integrated level editor allowing for infinite content. When the core gameplay mechanics are as polished and as fun, even simple user-made maps can add tons of replayability to a game that is already quite large in beta form.\n\nI bought this game in December 2013 and watched it blossom into the beautiful thing it is today, a couple of months before its final release.

It doesn't even require crazy APM skills!\n\nThis is a very enjoyable squad tactics singleplayer game, real time with pause for orders. It's like Swat and early Rainbow Sixes combined with Frozen Synapse with a bit of Xcom-like squad development and permadeath. Missions are quick and intensive deathpuzzles with randomized parts and there's already a pretty well functioning random mission generator that's probably going to get even better. The top-down 2D style is neat looking while functional and the environments are nicely detailed.\n\nCurrently there's about 70 normal (not randomly generated) missions so it's got lots of content. It's already felt like a complete product in alpha and beta so I find it impossible that it would become worse as the development approaches 1.0 and more features are put in.

The only thing that hurts it, is actually one of it's better points. That being that it is too open ended to be played any one way.\nThe level of challenge is up to you. Can you pre plan an entire mission without losing any troopers? Will you try to make arrest or just shoot everyone? Will you go the stealth way, the hard way, the quick way? Any way you choose will require very carfull planning. It's a simple game containing near infinite complexity. The one corner you fail to check, is the one that gets some one killed.\nSo what do you get for your money? Everything but multiplayer (which is still being considered). It's one of the most replayable games I've ever played. 100 stock single missions, 6 big campaigns with a hardcore mode that save permadeath of your officers. You can always do any of this more perfectly, or all preplanned, or step by step, and if you run out of fun in about a year or 2, there is a easy mission / map editor and if that wears thin, it's already modded and workshopped to epic magnitude. It's RPG, TDS, RTS all in one.\nIt shows you how to play, but never tells you how to play. If I told you how the game is played and a what I think of each aspect it would take 10 pages. Just watch the vids and keep in mind what I said. Best 20$ game this year. I'm gonna keep an eye on Killhouse. They seem to love the craft. I feel the feels inside for them.

I quote him directly: "The game will not be discounted lower than 50%". I like to think of myself as a generous man, but his comment on the price not going any lower only brought out my love and desire to take on a challenge. The waiting game began. Months and months passed, and the summer sale had begun. I see Door Kickers with a 60% off tag, but my excitement is contained. Not even a grin or smirk is shown. I wasn't going to give in this easily. It's 3 minutes until the new daily and flash sales begin. I refresh the Steam store at 6PM on the dot. I browse the deals, and to my disappointment, Door Kickers has not been discounted further. A week passes and the 60% is still there.  Not a single daily or flash has contained this game. My mind is filled with Vulpe's manic laughter, I hallucinate him & Gabe knocking at my door. I have nightmares where they tear my wallet from my pants and spend all my money gifting Door Kickers to people I'm not even friends with. I want to take the plunge, but my instinct tells me it isn't over yet. I've been sitting at my computer for 4 days straight now. Just waiting for new sales, refreshing over and over. I haven't slept.

A tear falls down my cheek, and I click add to cart. I pay £3.75 and the game is mine. I sit back in my chair as the game installs, and laugh like I've lost my mind. I did it, I thought to myself. I persevered and reaped the rewards.\n\nI'm 3 hours into the game, and I start crying. Vulpe, you were right; I can confirm this game is worth more than £7. Thank you for this emotional journey.

It may confuse people looking at the 2D grafics when I say this game is amazing in every aspect of it. But everything fits nicely: The grafics don't hide information and for me they manage to be detailed enough convey the narrative while giving my enough space for using my own imagination. The UI is simple and easy to use. The sound effects are subtle (which is important, as you are going to hear them way too often when trying to get a perfect rating on a map). And the equipment is surprisingly well balanced, and personally I prefer balance to realism (it is really hard to explain why two .223 rem rifles with 10" barrels, even if one is a long-stroke piston system and one short-stroke, would have so different power levels, but in the game, this makes both interesting). All leads to a very good immersion.\n\nThe difficulty level is somewhat self-adjusting, as most maps are easy to finish. But getting 3 stars, using only one plan, no interaction afterwards? That takes more than a lunch break.\n\nIt is not perfect yet, there could be some interface improvements when it comes to several troopers breaching the same door (whose tools are used) and a bit more synchronizing for cooperative action. And minor flaws like having female troopers but only a male voice set. And the three campaigns could do with some story texts. But these are trivial things that one will find in AAA productions, too.\n\nFrom a software developer's perspective: Recently, I backed three games (on Kickstarter and elsewhere).  Two (Wasteland, Jagged Alliance: Flashback) were a huge disappointment. Doorkickers was the only game that managed to continuously improve, seemed to have tight feedback cycles and was thought through from the beginning, so huge features did not come in late and were error-prone. And they polished their product before release. This speaks of a great development process and makes "In the killhouse" a company I would love to work with (if I were a game dev).","November 7, 2014","true","52.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Single missions (there are a lot!) allow you to essentially practice. The first few limit you to using only 2 good fellows against a small number of enemies with a mix of objectives. The objectives I have encountered so far are include (and you may have multiples of these on a mission) killing all the enemies, saving hostages, retrieving evidence, arresting a high profile suspect and escorting a VIP. There is also a random mission generator where you get to pick how big the map is and how strong the resistance is. Also you can create your own maps or download new ones from the Steam Workshop.\n\nThe campaign mode can be unlocked after levelling up your squad by completing single missions. In this mode, if your troopers get injured they will be out of action for the next mission to recover, if they die they are dead. Dead as a dodo. Luckily you can restart the mission (don't leave the mission though!). However, there is also a hardcore mode, which will prevent you from doing this.\n\nCompleting missions gives your squad experience (divvied up between the used members depending on how well they performed). As your squad levels up, you unlock more classes and also skill points to spend on improving the overall squad's reactions times and accuracy and a few other benefits. It also scores you out of 3 stars depending on how well you got your squad to perform. To get maximum score you need to and keep all your squaddies alive and complete all the objectives within the time limit. Those stars you can then spend on unlocking new weapons and equipment.\n\nSpeaking of which. any tactical shooter would not be complete without giving you the option to swap out your gear. Each man has a slot for a primary and secondary weapon, armour, 2 small equipments such as flashbangs, breaching charges or lockpicks and 1 large equipment such as a camera to poke under doors or a massive hammer to smash down locked doors. There is quite a nice variety of weapons and equipment but I have found that there are only a couple of weapons I use anyway. There is one caveat: different classes allow and/or limit the equipment each guy can have.\n\nThere are currently 5 classes playable: Pointman, Assault, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman, as far as I can tell, is meant for high speed and mobility encounters (as I found with the VIP missions – if you don't get to him fast enough they shoot him!). You can only use a pistol but if used correctly, or if you have some meatier backup, then this isn't a problem. The Assault class gives you the option to equip some rifles or SMGs and is pretty self explanatory. The Shield class drops the primary weapon in favour for a ballistic shield. The level of protection the shield gives depends on which one you use but don't leave him on his own, he can only use a pistol. The Breacher uses shotguns which allows you to quickly blow locked doors off their hinges and is obviously handy in close quarters. Just don't send this guy into a small room with hostages in! The final class is Stealth. Essentially you get some suppressed weapons, which (not surprisingly) reduces the amount of noise you make.\n\nSo what is the gameplay like? Well at the beginning of the mission you get to pick who you want to bring along and then place them in the predefined starting locations. Then you can plan out your mission before hit the play button. Once started you can pause at any time and make adjustments where necessary. The UI is very easy to use and entering rooms is far easier than any of the FPS games. How many times have you been trying to prepare a flashbang, only to accidentally open the door and have an AK47 in your nose? That isn't going to happen here (unless you like surprises and to go in all guns blazing).\n\nThe AI can be lethal and you will want to make sure you keep those doors and corners covered just in case someone decides to take you on. Surprising the AI is always the best option but once they know you're there they will usually be ready for you in the next room or sometimes kill a hostage or start destroying evidence so you will have to be fast. If they are ready for you, you won't want your guys stacking up in front of the door waiting for the flashbang to go off. Those few seconds can get your entire squad killed, get them in cover or stacked either side of it! Or if there are no hostages in there, just use and breaching charge and blow them all to hell.\n\nThis is definitely worth picking up and if you see it on sale, you have no excuse. Great game.","December 7, 2014","true","19.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Much like Hotline Miami, the theme of a SWAT team making dangerous and daring rescue attempts is merely a cover up for Door Kickers' core puzzle like mechanics. The awesome feeling of pulling off a succsessful three star rescue attempt, after carefully planning down to the micro level each individual action of our members is second to none.\n\nThe game presents you with several ways to access missions and earn currency (currency allows you to purchase different weapons and gear).\nPlaying missions in each of the campaigns (there are currently 6 campaigns)\nPlaying each of the over 100 standalone missions\nDownloading maps from the workshop (These do not get you currency)\nMaking your own maps (These do not get you currency)The unlockable gear allows you to customise each opertive and in the later game it often makes sense to give each of your opperative a weapoin tailored to what they will have to do. Alongside this, there are also 5 classes, Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. They each have unique weapons and some shared weapons, as well as unique equipment.\n\nThere is lots of good things to say about Door Kickers, but there are also a few issue at the moment.\nYou are not able to reshape the path of an opperative without getting rid of all the rest of the path.\nThe unlock system can be tedious at times and it can sometimes feel like a grind.\nSometimes when you spend a long time creating a plan in order to get three stars, and then you have to quit the game or you feel like changing levels. There is no way to save your plan so you have to remake it when you come back.\nOverall door kickers is a great game that will easily last you 20 hours, and most likely even more. It is a particullarly good game to just pick up and play for short ammount of time, once you have unlocked a few of the weapons.

I've been following this game since late Alpha and have enjoyed it since it's early form. The gameplay is quite simple, but is hard to master.\n\nBasically you give your team check points to go to through the mission area. You tell them where to go, where to face, what to use and so on. It's somewhat similar to the mission planning of the old Rainbow Six games but now in live action, with a live pause available.\n\nThe game features five classes that your officers can pick from. Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman is the fastest through the door, but only wields a handgun. The Assaulter packs either an SMG or an assault rifle and is best at ranged gun fights. Breachers wield shotguns and can blow doorlocks off. Stealth wield silenced weapons and move quieter. Shield men wield large shields that stop bullets. In my opinion, most of the classes are useful, but I don't really use the shields as they are slow, and are doomed if they are flanked.\n\nThere is about 80 single missions, 3 campaigns, a random mission generator and an simple editor so there is a lot of content on offer. The campaigns aren't very story driven, at all. There isn't a paragraph describing any story. I'm not saying it ruins the experience but it would have been nice to have that. Officers do take injuries during missions and can die, but this only really affects the campaign. The campaigns are quite short, but entertaining, and are worth replaying for experience points and stars (explained later).\n\nAlthough this game is mainly about planning, there is a bit of luck involved. I'd say it's 9/10 planning and 1/10 luck. Just know that ♥♥♥♥ poor planning leads to ♥♥♥♥ poor performance. One great thing about this game, is you can wing it, or plan the whole mission out (which gives a bonus in EXP).\n\nYou unfortunately do have to unlock equipment during the game. Troopers level up during missions, and your entire squad levels up as well. Leveling troopers grants them better speed with shooting and using tools and accuracy. Leveling the squad grants doctrine points which grant all members improved abilities such as accuracy boosts, and one shot door breaching. It also gives access to more classes, as you only start with pointmen.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that you have to unlock weapons, by acquiring stars during missions. You get one for completing, one for having all troopers alive and one for beating it under time. It can be challenging getting all 3 stars on some missions but the rewards are worth it.\n\nOne complaint I will make is that you have to erase all of your checkpoints ahead of a checkpoint if you want to make changes. This can make it more time consuming to change plans. I also find that sometimes I accidentally erase points which can be very frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is the new story mechanic. Some missions have multiple levels but to be honest changing between them is quite awkward in my opinion and I feel the game would be better without them.\n\nMy other complaint is that this game doesn't have a solid tutorial. Fortunately you can practice all you like on the single missions without an issue.\n\nThe graphics of this game are quite simple, but I honestly think it's unfair to expect better from a 3 man indie team considering the scale of this game, and it's certainly better looking than a Unity engine game and to be honest the menu background looks great.\n\nDoorkickers has been my first adventure into PC indie gaming, and easily the best. A small, and passionate team who actually listen to the players, and use the advice to develop a competent and entertaining game that was realistically achievable. I'd give Doorkickers a 9/10.","June 12, 2014","true","102.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Still pretty much a lot of fun. The developers have announced they are working on new updates expected before the end of the year to include an enhanced editor and more gameplay modes. So even if you aren't interested right now, put it on your wishlist and it might be on an upcoming Steam Sale.\n\nUPDATE: I'm posting a short update to this review. I've just passed eighty(80) hours in the game. The developers have released two updates, adding some new features and fixing some small bugs. The Steam Workshop community is very actively supporting the game (I have several mods there myself). Still highly recommended.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nIf you are at all interested in the subject you should definitely give it a look. The game is already well supported by the community and the Steam Workshop has some excellent mods, weapons and levels already. It's the old SWAT or Rainbow Six from a top down, 2D perspective that puts more emphasis on planning than quick reactions. Check out some of the Let's Play videos out there, or some mission video captures posted on my YouTube channel for more information.\n\nNow that it is in release, there are even more interesting features, the major ones being multistory buildings and drug busts where you have to race to seize the evidence before the bad guys dispose of it. Three campaigns have been added, which are a series of linked missions (also with some branched, optional missions) where you are limited to your existing roster. Without giving away any spoilers, there are a couple of really large maps set on a waterfront and a train station that combine long sight distances, dangerous approaches and unusual rooms and buildings.\n\nThe game is pretty much bug free due to the long alpha period, with only a couple of minor items that have to be addressed. There is an excellent level editor that works pretty well, the only really awkward part being the current need to edit the background image (which is the floor or ground of the map) outside of the editor, should you want one that isn't the default grey warehouse floor. The developers have stated that they intend to add that background editing ability into the in-game editor.\n\nAlso of note is the excellent Mission Generator. You select the size of the level and the amount of opposition and the game generates a random seed. Then you select either "KillHouse" (for a training map) or "House" (for a real world map) and the game generates a mission using one of the maps in the game. The mission could be just to eliminate hostiles, or escort a VIP, or run a drug bust, or rescue hostages. It's a real challenge because it's newly generated.\n\nOverall this is an excellent value for the price; three campaigns, 80 official missions (once you enable the two new missions via the Mods interface), a Mission Generator and tons of mods already in the Workshop. Highly Recommended.","October 6, 2014","true","119.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You will give each officer a class which you can change at any time before a mission starts. There are 5 classes total, 4 to unlock. You start with Pointman and unlock Assaulter, Shield, Breacher and finally Stealth. You then customize each officers class specific gear.\nOfficer Ranking and Squad Ranking\nEach officer has his or her own rank which increases as they complete missions successfully. Their skill level increases with rank. As your officers rank up so does your overall squad rank.\nDoctrine\nEach time your squad rank increases you gain a doctrine point. These points are spent on pistol skills, long gun skills and shotgun skills. These skills are passive and improve every officer regardless of their rank.\nDeath\nYour officers can die permanently and will be replaced with rookie officers if you choose to continue after a  successful mission. If you restart the mission you will still have that said officer for consecutive attempts.\nMissions and Gear\nEach mission has a 3 star rating system. Each star awarded is currency to unlock gear. Gear is unlocked for the entire squad once you spend the stars. There are single missions, campaign missions and a mission generator for random missions. There is also the mission editor and steam workshop. You can plan a mission from beginning to end before you start. You can also pause the game anytime to plan as you go. If you are really brave you don't have to pause at all. It is very rewarding to watch your officers execute a perfect plan. You can even save replays and export videos in game.\nConclusion\nIt takes 10 minutes to plan a mission and anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes to execute the takedowns. This game could probably be used as a training tool if given to the right people. Door kickers is all about tacticle planning and strategy. Very fun game to play! Easily worth the full price but if you see it on sale don't hesitate to pick this one up.\n","June 16, 2015","true","32.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

A friend gifted me a copy and I have to say Door Kickers is like drugs, once it gets a hold of you you just don't want to stop playing. Door Kickers has you managing a SWAT team with upgradeable skills and equipment. During the missions there are a variety of objectives such as collecting evidence, defusing bombs, saving hostages, or just eliminating hostiles. You set up your team at the beginning of the mission and then plan out what they are going to do, once you press play the SWAT team runs into action performing all teh actions you set before hand.\n\nNow in Door Kickers you can watch your plan play out on screen, hoping for the best and restart if something goes awry, however if you are not worried about getting a "perfect plan" you can pause and modify your actions for your team at any time! There are a few different options when it comes to mission modes. You have the single missions, for quick play, you have the mission generator that lets you generate missions based on a few different parameters, and then you have the campaigns. There are a good handful of playable campaigns each with a variety of challenges and difficulties.\n\nIf you couple that with the tons of different equipment and classes each SWAT member can have you are talking tons of gameplay and variation! If it did not sound like it could be any better Door Kickers also has mod and Steam workshop support!\n\nIf any of the above sounds interesting I urge you to check out Door Kickers, or even the upcoming Door Kickers 2!","March 8","true","48.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I love Frozen Synapse and the idea of tactical, top down, squad shooters. I dived in with high expectations from all the praise I saw. The result of this endeavor was to be disappointed more than I have been in a long time by a game.\n\nI will say now - the game is solid enough. However, I encountered certain aspects of the gameplay that just broke it for me. Primarily, the lack of any form of viable introduction or tutorial. I know it has some moving pictures and whatnot, but all that it covers is simple enough to figure out on your own. There is no explanation for how to time entries into a room with a flashbang properly, no explanation why equipping weapons to some of the troops just outright doesnt work. The secondary problems are... well... mentioned above. It is a massive hassle to control the squad. There are no elegant mechanics like in Frozen Synapse that allow for a time delay or no-aim movement. It also makes control difficult due to bulky command images that cross over and make clicking on them a chore. A lack of any explanation as to why upgrading your soldiers abilities doesnt seem to transfer into the tactical game also makes the game frustrating.\n\nIn short, bar the issues above, the game is spot on. Animation, sound, idea, everything. It is just a crying shame that actually playing it felt like work rather than enjoyment. Sadly I didnt enjoy the game at all and wanted to just make sure that the reason is out there.","June 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 62 of 112 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","62","112","6","11"

First, you take over a SWAT team that consists of ten members with varying attributes in marksmanship, assault shooting(close quarters), and field skills(a skill that speeds up the ability to disarm bombs for instance).\n\nSince the game is in the top down mode, you are able to script out the directions you want your team members to move, provide covering fire, which doors to breach etc...  This is done before the match, and if you realize you made a mistake during the fight, you're able to pause, and re-adjust your routes, and covering fire; or you can make adjustments in real time.  As I said earlier, it's not a difficult learning curve, once you realize it's about applying covering fire for teams moving in open areas, or stacking alongside a room you're about to throw a flash bang in.  There is limitless possibilities you can create within the scenarios.\n\nThe game offers 80 missions(and often, when updates happen, more missions appear).  You can also create your own quick missions with varying styles.  Which means you can go in just to kill the enemies, capture and arrest individuals without lethal harm, disarm bombs and rescue hostages.  The game offers 5 campaigns at the time of this review, and they each have an additional 5-6 missions of varying difficulty.  This is not to forget that Steam Workshop is enabled for this game, and you're honestly left with so many choices that just about everyone can find something they're comfortable with(ie: you can apply mods for military type actions, with military weapons , or extra police type actions for instance).\n\nThe game progresses your characters by the number of missions that they accomplish, and the skills being applied are done for you.  It's up to you, and the mission to decide which of your team members gets placed in the action(for instance if you're disarming a bomb, you'll want someone with high field skills).  You'll also get experience to level up, which then you can unlock perks from a tree of skills to enhance skills with firearms(pistols, shotguns and rifles/carbines).  The game unlocks after certain levels as you can get different character sets, like breachers(shotguns), stealth(silenced weapons and movement), and using police shields to add extra defense to your team members.  Yet there is even more, you gain stars by completing missions(1 to 3 stars depending on what conditions are met), which the stars can be turned into buying upgraded weapons, body armor, accessories(tazer, breaching kit for example.  You basically have full control on what your team needs to complete the mission.\n\nThis game doesn't have too many flaws(at least when I've played), and the developers are still really active in producing content for the game.  What I do find enjoyable about this game is that it feels satisfying every time I play.  I don't feel like I have to commit 2 to 3 hours a day to enjoy the game.  I can honestly play a single mission, or 30 minutes and I won't feel disappointed in what I've accomplished; and certainly there is enough it do in this game to have you lose track of time and play hours at a time if you wish.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you enjoy a tactical game where you're able to do all the planning and adjusting real time.

This game offers not only 6 seperate campaigns (With their own lengths and difficulties) 70+ missions (seperate from the campaigns) steam workshop availibility, but also your own map creator. Now honestly how many other games give you this much content for just $20\n\n2nd the A.I 8/10. The A.I. could use some improvement I will admit, but people saying that the A.I. doesn't fortify in a room are wrong, the A.I. do fortify in rooms, for example on the single player mission Cartel Beach Party (Unfortunately the chief wasn't invited and was very displeased about it, so he had told a small handful of the best troopers to go in there and end the party.) the A.I. do fortify, how they fortify I will not tell, you'll have to find that out on your own. There a multitidue of other misisons the A.I. fortify on, but this mission is the best example (at least to my knowledge)\n\n3rd replayability 10/10. This game is all about replayability, there is tons of ways you could go about beating every mission, want to go full stealth ops on every mission? Go ahead! Want to just shotgun the sh!t out of everyone? Be my guest! Want to try and beat every mission with your most well seasoned trooper? Do as you please, no one is stopping you! Other than the multitude of ways you could go about beating every mission you can also challenge yourself by trying to beat your old highscores on every mission. (Or at least getting 3 stars on every mission)","December 31, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

Since then the team has added loads to a very easy to learn but tricky and satisfying to perfect game model. It brings back memories of the early Swat games and the tenseness of entering a room is great. The balance between direct controlling units and ordering team mates via go commands allows for some immensely satisfying moments when it all goes slickly. Some times it doesn't and everyone dies, tough luck it was your fault not the game, you learn and then do it all over again slightly better.\n\nAll in all it is just nice to see a greenlit game that is well put together and well supported.","May 5, 2014","true","1.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I don't benefit at all by giving this a positive review, except perhaps by helping to share this great game and thus contribute indirectly to the sales and community - possibly allowing the devs to make it even better!\n\nDoor Kickers is a Fantastic Game!! -- One of the best I've ever played, and there's still lots more to come! Door Kickers offers an enjoyable, realistic and informative peek into the world of tactical response police and special forces that is very secretive and usually hard to find (portrayed even semi-accurately at least) in the entertainment world. In a simple, fun, and effective way it showcases realistic tactics, weaponry, gadgets, radio chatter and movements in a variety of hostage, bomb defusal, room clearing and even tubular assault scenarios.\n\nDoor Kickers is particularly enjoyable if you're into Police or Military Tactical Response/SWAT or Special Forces, but even if you're not, it's still an amazing and rewarding tactical game that enables you to think, plan and execute different strategies in a variety of different scenarios. It's NOT an exceedingly difficult game by any means, but there is plenty of room for perfectionist work if you so desire. Although the trailers play at full speed, there is a tactical pause feature that lets you think, plan and execute your strategies as fast or slow as you want.\n\nWould recommend Door Kickers to everyone! Lots of very cool new stuff is promised in the near future, such as Snipers, Ballistic Shields, Tazers, and a Campaign (in addition to the dozens of single missions currently available). The updates have been released very regularly so far - the devs obviously care about the game and have already implemented alot of suggestions from the community!   In short, you should get it!  You won't regret buying this game!    11/10!","January 7, 2014","true","61.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Worth every penny.\n\nIf you have played any of the previous SWAT or Rainbow Six games, you can expect a similar strategic style, albeit in a top down isometric view. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master type games, where you will constantly perfect strategies and re-run missions to achieve 3-star ratings. The game rewards your hard work with unlockables, specifically new guns and gadgets. There is also a level up system, similar to that of the XCOM series, where specific officers will improve their abilities as they are involved in missions. There is a mixture of both campaigns and time-trial based single missions and already an abundance of content.\n\nThe game already has a vibrant modding scene, which is great because this game lends itself to the creation of new maps and guns. It already feels like there is far too much to do in it.\n\nThe game is also extremely polished. There are a couple of small bugs here and there, but it's highly unlikely you will encounter anything game-breaking.\n\nHighly recommended!","December 19, 2014","true","26.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You normally control a team of 2-8 SWAT personnel and are charged with eliminating tangoes, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages and all sorts of other goodness.  The planning is intuitive & easy to implement.  It can be done entirely through mouse commands or by using the keyboard to trigger go codes.  Gameplay is fast and lethal - your SWAT wear body armor, but that doesn't mean they won't go down if someone empties a MAC-10 at them or if they step out in front of a shotgun.  As a result, you're constantly planning how best to win the fight before your man is ever in view - distracting the enemies by popping a trooper into view and then flanking them, stunning them with flashbang grenades or whatever other fiendish tricks you manage to pull off.\n\nEnemy A.I. varies from cautious (hunker down and wait) to aggressive (investigate gunfire/other loud sounds) and changes between playings.  Most of the more complex scenarios offer several possible enemy set ups, deemphasizing puzzle-based planning and providing a more organic experience (is that room to the left clear or can it be safely ignored?).  The enemies carry a full range of weapons and can even load up on heavy body armor - there are an unrealistically large number of tangos, but this yields a more satisfying experience and you'll find yourself going along with it.\n\nMoreover, I have been playing Door Kickers since the alpha and, with each new iteration, the game has continued to grow and evole.  The dedication of Killhouse Games to delivering the best product possible has been something to behold and I can say that from personal experience they are very receptive to feedback from the community.   They have worked hard to pack a lot of value into the package - at present there are over seventy single player maps, plus three campaigns, a random scenario generator and an editor to enable users to design their own maps.\n\nThe game itself offers a wide variety of experiences, from simple missions that can be knocked out in a few minutes (when you're just looking for a quick release during downtime) to large, complex hostage rescues which require both planning and precision to pull off.\n\nIn short, this is one of the best computer game purchases I have made over the last couple years - if any of the above sounds appealing then I highly recommend picking the game up.","November 1, 2014","true","33.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I love this game. It is a very cool experience for those looking for a tactical strategy challenge of commanding a swat team breaching a building. However, there are just a few things that ruin the experience for me in some cases.\n\nFirst: The AI\nThe biggest problem that I have with the enemy AI is that they constantly open doors and just run out of them without and moments thought instead of posting up and keeping there guns trained on a door as they should be doing. Watching my guys mow down half of the enemy on one level just because they kept moving down a narrow hallway instead of fortifying themselves really broke my immersion.\n\nSecond: Lack of Surrender Option\nIf I was playing a military game, I wouldn't have a problem with my troops just gunning down unsuspecting enemies, and inspite of what people might think, SWAT team members are NOT allowed to open fire first unless they give proper warning and demand surrender from the enemy. The fact that this doesn't happen, and for a game that I assume is supposed to be simulating SWAT team breaches, really is disappointing when you compare it to something like SWAT 4 which this game seems to emulate from a strategic standpoint.\n\nThird: Irratation\nNow while some people may get the joy of going through a level for an hour trying to create the perfect plan, that isn't me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to do a level only a few times and not have to rely on trial and error mechanics to complete a level. And when I do complete one I don't feel sastisfaction at all.\n\nFourth: Progression\nTo be fair, I'm not sure what progression system I would have chosen for this game, but I don't know if a star system like on mobiles games would have been the route I went. Really makes grinding extremely annoying. Plus I end up just not using most of the weapons and only go for the ones that are the best in the game.\n\nFifth: Hostage Death = Restart\nThis is probably this most frustrating aspect of this game. I'm not sure what real life SWAT would consider a hostage being killed a failure, but being forced to restart the entire level just because one hostage out of like 12 gets killed is overly punishing. Especially if you consider that the SAS (I know its not SWAT but still) raid on the Iranian Embassy was considered a success even though a hostage was killed in the siege.\n\nSixth: Price\nFor a game that is $20, it just doesn't feel like it is worth $20 in the end. (I would recommend this game for $5 when it goes on sale but no more) DISAVOWED. $5 definitely pick this up, $10 sure, $15 eh pushing it but would still recommend, $20 no (at least for me). Some people might think this game is worth $20, which is perfectly fine if they believe so, but for me personally $15 would probably be a better base price tag.\n\nOverall, its a great concept and a good game, but it needs to lower its price and work on some of its flaws before I can change my review to positive.","November 20, 2015","false","17.4"," 54 of 99 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","54","99","5","5"

Doorkickers is mostly about planning each mission to perfection, and at the beginning it's great- the maps are small, you can generally plan the whole thing out and make no alterations to that plan and it's wonderfully tense as everyone dies in a few hits.\n\nHowever, after around 12 hours it all falls apart- maps are larger and there are more enemies, so you have to be flexible and this means no more planning for the entire mission, it's more room by room. Gang members get bullet proof vests, high powered weapons and explosives (WHAT?!) so they tend to be massively over powered, and this ruins the balancing that was perfect before.\n\nReally, aside from some control issues and not being able to plan for team members dying the beginning of the game was a good 9/10 but after it was watching it slowly die off. I will recommend it for the fun that could be had but it really was disappointing\n","August 11, 2015","true","20.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/recommended/248610/","jlericson","Ichthydion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jlericson/","190 products in account","In the search for the ideal top-down tactical shooter, I've tried Hotline Miami (too twitchy), Forzen Synapse (too random), Monaco (close, but too gimmicky), and recent XCOMs (on the abstract side). None of them quite scratch the itch created by Julian Gollop games. Until Door Kickers.\n\nThe heart of the game is a series of buildings your SWAT team must clear of bad guys. Sometimes there's another objective such rescuing hostages or collecting evidence before the suspects can destroy it. These require various tactics and give the game flavor. But the core remains moving from one room to the next shooting people who are trying to shoot you.\n\nEvery character possesses some level of agency. Enemies (AKA, tangos) respond to sounds and other cues in reasonable ways. For instance, they might turn to face the door your pointman is forcing. Alternatively, they might decide to shoot the hostages or destroy the evidence. Your operators might ignore orders in order to respond to immediate threats. In fact, you don't order them to fire at all; you tell them where to go and they just take care of business.\n\nAs a result, you can set up a plan at the start of a level and let the game play itself. I know that sounds boring, but it really isn't. Plans involve dozens of little decisions, such as how to breach a door, where to toss a flashbang, when to turn to check a hallway and so on. You can charge though most levels with a lone shooter (there are achievements for it) or carefully coordinate a full team with go signals. If your plan works, the payoff is a minute or two of\nperfectly choreographed violence.\n\nTruthfully, however, perfect planning doesn't happen the first time around. More often I need to adjust because I failed check a blind spot or I blundered into shotgun crossfire. Plans can be redrawn on the fly or you can pause the action to give yourself time to think. Immediately after completion of a level, I find myself restarting it so that I can fine tune the plan.\n\nThere is an overarching game of unlocking tactics, roles and armament. Faster times unlock up to three stars for buying new guns, body armor and equipment. Officers earn experience points which open up new roles (assaulter, breacher, stealth and shield) and tactics. Missions can technically be played in any order, but the effect of the leveling system is to gate off more difficult levels. Skipping missions or forgetting to upgrade increases the challenge quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, once you have a stronger team, it's rewarding to go back to earlier levels and get an improved result. In addition, campaigns are unlocked once your squad levels up to a certain point. However, don't think of campaigns as stories since they are just missions strung together to force you to pay the consequences for deaths and injuries. I'd complain campaigns are too shallow if I weren't excited to play new maps.\n\nNot that there's any lack of maps. In addition to 84 single missions and 6 campaigns, there are user-created missions for download and a map generator. These mean you will never need to play the same mission over again, but they also highlight the skill of official level designers. Levels designed by other users are wildly inconstant in challenge and quality. The generated levels can be anywhere from boring to near impossible depending on which settings you use and how the random number generator rolls.\n\nIn the final analysis, Door Kickers provides copious amounts of tactical decision making with simple controls and plenty of chrome.","May 26","true","13.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

One such example is level III vs. IIIA armor. There’s a wide selection of gear to pick from (a surprise in such games), and purely picking based on stats and names will lend you a bad time.\n\nThat being said, 12 hours of gameplay certainly gets across the point of the game, and that’s where you should find yourself with a complete campaign, and all the weapons you want unlocked.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467759453\nUnlocks in this game are very much like other games in this genre, where points/stars from mission ratings allow you to unlock gear and weapons. If you end up doing poorly, you will obviously receive fewer stars and thus less gear and weapons.\n\nLevels and campaigns are unique and interesting – but just as in Breach & Clear – the maps could do with more dynamic elements to them. Perhaps this will be explored in Door Kickers 2?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=465789043\nTo tide players over until the release of the next game, Door Kickers extensively supports user generated content (UGC), where you can add more maps, UI changes, and core gameplay changes as well. The level editor could have used more polish, but certainly does get the job done.\n\nJust recently I have noticed stuttering in my game for a few seconds here and there. I haven’t been able to track down the source of this, but it’s manageable. Your experience will most likely be different in this regard.\n\nIf you are in a tussle in choosing between Door Kickers and Breach & Clear, I would recommend Door Kickers. You can see my review on the other game, as well as note the large difference in playtime I have.","March 13","true","13.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

But for me personally, it was a disappointment. I was really hyped about this game according to the trailers, there was no demo, and the game didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nI expected this to be more arcade-like, instead it's more of a planning/puzzle game. That wouldn't be a problem, but I don't like how it's implemented. There are basically two modes you can operate in: full-ahead planning or realtime mode.\n\nFull-ahead planning\nIn full-ahead planning, you try to plan the whole operation (or most of it) in advance, and then just hit play and watch the action. It takes a long time, but if it works out, it is satisfactory.\nThe problems are clunky controls and a lot of important stuff missing. Basic things like "look around the whole room in 360° angle and shoot all enemies then go on" are impossible. Instead you can look in one direction, then move a short distance, then look into different direction, then move a short distance, then look into other direction, ... until you cover the whole room. Even if your soldier encounters an enemy, he's happy to follow all the other orders including looking into a completely different direction, turning back to his enemy (what?!). So you need to use "thumb up" mark after every single move to make sure he actually kills the enemy before going away. That gets tiring quickly.\nA basic AI for your soldiers would be nice, but it's not there, you have to micromanage everything. So the soldier goes according to the plan even if there's a shootout 3 meters away from him. The soldier doesn't automatically take cover even though there's a cover spot half a meter away from him. People might argue this game is about micromanaging. Well, OK (I didn't expect that), but you can hardly do that in full-ahead planning, because enemy positions are random. And the developers give you no means to intelligently react to enemy encounters, neither in planning mode nor when executing the action (see the point below).\nEditing the plan in the middle is impossible. You have just spent 10 minutes carefully planning everything, and then you figure out that in the very second room you forgot to check the closet. You want to tweak the plan a bit. But guess what - you have to delete the whole plan after the second room, do the adjustments, and then re-create it again from scratch from that point forward. There's no way to edit the prepared plan in the middle. This is so glaring overlook then I can't explain it - for me, this was a showstopper for planning the action ahead. It also applies to real-time modifications to the plan (when you already started executing the actions) - no way to do that, it will destroy the rest of your plan. Say goodbye to intelligently reacting to unexpected events.\nSynchronizing actions from multiple soldiers is a major PITA. Something as basic as waiting for a flash bang to explode is not implemented. The soldier who threw the flash bang waits a bit (it seems), but the others do not. If you do not throw it through a door but around a corner, no one waits. So you need to do manual synchronization using ABCD codes. A lot of manual chore.\nIf you have two soldiers, one with a shield, you get the obvious idea - one can go in front, shielding them, and the second behind him, shooting from the cover when he sees enemies. But no, there's no way to instruct them to go as a group.\nRealtime mode\nIn realtime mode (well, almost real time, you usually plan just a few steps ahead and then unpause it), you need to micromanage everything, but at least everything works exactly as you intended - soldiers are properly synchronized, they don't rush into rooms before flashbangs explode, etc. However, if anything goes wrong and you need to restart the mission, it's an immense chore instructing them through all the rooms again, and again, and again. You can't save and reuse parts of previous plans. You can't toggle them to semi-AI mode and make them a bit smarter. So instead of spending a lot of time planning, you spend a lot of time redoing all your previous realtime instructions many times over.\nThe realtime mode pains could be save by allowing the player to do "snapshots" - quicksaves and quickloads, but that's not there. Or perhaps offering to save and recall short-time plans for individual rooms, but that's not there either.\nSo, in summary, I felt that I'm either frustrated by inadequate controls in full-ahead planning mode, or that I'm repeating the same short-time realtime plans over and over again, until I finally finished the level. I couldn't enjoy it.\n\nThere are some technical issues as well, which annoyed me:\nMultimedia keys don't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay.\nAlt+tab doesn't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. But then it glitches, and even though you are switched to other applications, Door Kickers are still displayed on top of them (so you can't see what you're doing). On top of that, you can't switch back to DK. That basically means you must try to kill the game blindly, or restart the computer, just because of using Alt+Tab (and of course you'll lose all unsaved progress). I'm using GNOME as a desktop environment, might be an issue specific to that.\nAside from the technical issues, I like sound effects of this game, music is OK, but I don't like the graphics. First, the absolutely top down perspective doesn't look good, just a bit of isometric view would work much better. Second, the graphics are ugly and blurry, and the texture quality (or artwork quality, however you want to call that) is low. I have correct resolution set, but the whole game looks upscaled and far from crystal clear as I expected.","November 16, 2015","false","8.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I was dissapointed by the previous Jagged Alliance (the kickstarter one looks nice, but time will tell), slightly bored like Frozen Synapse (which I might add, is a pretty damn good game, but the presentation didn't work out for me).  Door Kickers made the cut for me. Of course, we had the amazing X-Com. But there's something about Door Kickers. Is it the speed at which your plan is executed? The thrill of raiding a villa full of bad guys and unlucky hostages and making it out without a single casualty on the good guy side? Door Kicker is simply amazing.\n\nGreat presentation, sound and above all, gameplay. Amazing detailed top down views from your average training killhouse to villas and apartments. Great system for planning out your moves, and your swat guy armaments and tool are great, from trusty crowbar to m4s and boots of door bashing+1. Be it in real time or pausy-planning-unpausy-time, the gameplay feels rewarding. And it's always a pleasure taking down those horde of baddies :)\n\nDoor Kicker win the cake for me, as a rewarding, well thought out, tactical game.","July 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixleOrNick/recommended/248610/","PixleOrNick","Pixle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixleOrNick/","93 products in account","This is probably one of the best tactical games I've ever played.\n\nEvery mission requires precise planning, a good loadout for the situation, and teamwork. You can't just run in and shoot up the place and win. You must use your squad to execute precise maneuvers in order to complete the objective with minimal SWAT casualties. For example, using a spy camera will give you the upper hand when breaching a door, so you know the enemy positions before entering the room, and your squad will know where to aim beforehand. In other situations, using the spy camera is not the best option, because there might only be a small hallway on the other side of the door, and checking first might slow you down, as you are racing the clock. Most missions will have an objective time goal, which you must beat to get the maximum amount of points, so completing the mission in a quick, clean manner is the optimal goal.\n\nNow, twenty dollars might seem like a hefty price for a game like this, but there are three main campaigns, each with at least an hour or more in them, and a ton of single missions, mostly involving just clearing a compound of bad guys. The Steam Workshop offers many player-made campaigns, many of which are very well-made and add many hours of playtime to this game. In my opinion, $20 is a worthy price for this game, but if this isn't at the top of your wishlist, I would reccomend buying it when it goes on sale.","March 12","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Before the mission you picking troopers and gear like it was in SWAT4, and mission gameplay is very similar to Frozen Synapse, but here you can set pause whenever you want.\n\nThe game has a lot of content: 5 classes of troopers, lots of unlockable guns, 3 branches in perks tree, 5 campains, more then 80 single missions, level editor and level generator(!). If it's not enough for you, visit Steam Workshop, there are a lot of extra content created by community. As I can see the game is fully moddable - guns mods, realism mods and visual mods are available.\n\nGame control is very tabletishh, but as i can see there is no tablet version of this game.

Tactical, top down simulation game in which you are in full control of a highly trained SWAT team. Oh yeah, it's brilliant.\nThe objectives are usually very straight-forward: eliminate all hostiles (or tangos, as they call them), save the captives and/or apprehend the suspects(s). However, every level offers a new location, with unpredictable enemy spawns and new tactics to be developed. Over time and the completion of missions four new classes will be unlocked: Pointman (the starter  class), Assualter (essentially a Pointman with an assualt rifle), Shield (carries a tactical shield which takes most damage), Breacher (shotgun wielding units for close quarters combat and making dramatic entrances) and Stealth (probably the most dynamic, effective classes, although more difficult to design practical tactics for). Stars earned in finishing levels quickly and with minimal casualties can be spent on new weapons and tools.\nThe main thing to know is the freedom that this game offers. There are so many ways to fulfil objectives that it is unlikely that in a group of 100 people (maybe even more), one person will use the same tactics and methods of completing the mission. You can choose what units you use, where to put them, where to move them from there, how to enter a building, when to enter a building, and many more.\nThere are, however, a few cons to this game. For instance, it is very common for the game to quit responding while launching for the first time in a while. After quiting and relaunching all is normally resolved, though it is worth mentioning. Also, unit control occasionally will act up, allowing me to only control one officer at once. A simple quit of the level will normally fix the issue though. I am fully aware of how unimportant these are, and in turn will note these are not significant enough to be a reason to not purchase the game.\nAll in all, Door Kickers is a marvelous example of how games of the genre should be, and deserves more attention. I would give it 9/10. Well done, Killhouse.","January 13, 2015","true","22.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

A top-down/isometric strategic version of "SWAT", not the RPG/Action-based first game, but the squad-based TPS/FPS versions that followed. Unfortunately, "SWAT 2" was a critical and popular failure. Still, the promise of it kept many of us coming back to it, despite it's inherant design flaws, and managing SWAT vehicles was always fun.\nFresh from the fields of "Breach & Clear", a top-down & isometric military CQB mobile port (clear and away better than most AAA titles) I'm pleasanlty surpsied this takes that concept, though admittedly without trying to, and brings it to the real time confines of SWAT CQB situations.\nPlaced squarley between the simplistic, but involving "Breach & Clear"and the sophistication and complexity of (some might say, overly difficult) "Frozen Synapse", "Door Kickers" is "SWAT 2 - Re-Imagained" (without the vehicles, of course).\nAs "Breach & Clear 2" is going to ramp up the looks and gameplay for it's PC base, built upon it's on it's sales so far (taking it to preactically AAA standards), I have high, very high hopes that "Door Kickers 2" will finally be the ultimate "SWAT" tactical game we strategy nuts have always wanted.\nUnitl then. I have Tangos to take down, hsotages to rescue, and sitruations to control without being remonstrated by Samuel S. Jackson.

Did you enjoy that part of the game more than the actual mission? If you answered yes to these questions, Door Kickers is a worthwhile investment.\n\nThe game's core features right now are quite good. There is a slight learning curve to get your guys moving the way you want. Sometimes you will feel like you are micromangaging movements especially if you want to execute proper room clearing techniques. And occasionally you get angry at the pathing system since there are numerous house plants and chairs which create impassable barriers. But it is still fun.\n\nThere are definitely a good number of missions available of varying difficulty. Some you will breeze right through, others will be the bain of your existence until you get that perfect plan with 0 casualties working just right. Also the random mission generator is always good if you are looking for a quick challenge. As well as replaying missions trying to achieve the single-plan and hands-off achievements.\n\nThe loadouts are varied and offer a decent sized arsenal. It is mostly reflective of what a police SWAT team would have available. One gameplay feature I like is how your team really practices good trigger discipline (single shots if possible). While the bad guys will often go full auto at the slightest of targets. One thing that is not completely apparent in the loadout section of the game is what effects do the equipment have on your team. You'll notice in cramped interiors, it takes the man with the M4 longer to train his rifle than the man weilding his pistol. But for those long corridor or outdoor shots, your Assaulter with his rifle is far more efficient than your rear guard weiding his shotgun. Sadly none of this is explicitly described in the loadout menu and will take some experimentation to figure out what the ideal loadout is based on your style of play and the mission.\n\nThe graphics and sound are good for a game. It is definitely not a high fidelity sound and graphics visual masterpiece, but that really is not necessary. It is the gameplay which makes this game shine. There are various mods which revamp the sound experience if you are unhappy with the tone of the firearms.\n\nOverall, really fun game!","August 26, 2014","true","66.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What can I say?\n\nDoor Kickers to me is a superb, real time, action-filled, strategic and sometimes infuriating Police game. Fancy taking charge of your own SWAT team that can kick down (almost any) door or blow it up? Want to shoot people and be overly happy when you complete a mission that took AGES but you finally mastered it? Of course you do and Door Kickers is it.\n\nTo be serious though the interface is very intuitive if sometimes a bit fiddly  and the stop-time FTL style mechanic means you can keep on top of everything even in the middle of a firefight. The only major thing wrong with Door Kickers is that you MUST be prepared to be patient and repeat missions: on more than one occasion I have yelled and got generally angry with both myself and the enemies, so yeah, be patient, it is worth it in the end.

Takes a bit to get used to the UI but it works well once learned, it's not a standard rip-off of the Starcraft of C&C interface and this is why people might have a bit of a learning curve before you can get into the gameplay. It only took my an hour to get almost everything memorized, not that bad. This game has random maps, pre-made single maps and campaigns. Going through the single maps alone would take a long long time. Campaigns can take a while especially if you have to restart some particularly overly hard missions. Once you play all those most games would be done and become boring, right? Luckily there is a random map generator. You can set size and enemy parameters, and since you don't know exactly what you are going to run in to it ends up being fun for long periods. Even if I have 5 minutes I can run one or two random killhouse maps. Or if I want to spend 3 hours playing a tactical game I can and it still doesn't get dull.\n\nTactically there are various ways to overcome each scenario. You can lockpick a locked door or break it down, or you can use special tools to lockpick it faster or break it faster but these tools take up an inventory slot and are heavier. Or you could use a breacher with a shotgun, but that shotgun becomes the primary weapon and is only useful at short range. There is a give and take to each option and all are viable pending your playstyle and how you want to approach that whole level. And this is just locked doors. The constant variation in the maps and multiple ways to approach each type of situation keeps it varied. Some maps you cannot flank the armored guy and have to face him head on, if you do not have the right equipment you will likely suffer. Sometimes there are too many rooms to flashbang each one so you have to adapt to opening doors and clearing rooms in a different way sweeping around the corner from a wider angle. The game doesn't feel dull even after a long time playing. Gameplay is top-notch and the devs plan on adding to it with co-op and multiplayer eventually.\n\nThis game has longevity, it hasn't gotten dull yet and I have plenty of hours in it already. It can be played in short spurts or long sessions without an issue. It's a tactical game that requires some thinking. Controls are more than functional and become natural to use with a little bit of time in the game to do exactly what you want down to smaller details like how you want to walk around a corner with a sweeping curve instead of walking straight in. There are various classes that all play differently and can change your play style immensely from one map to another depending on team loadout. You can respec your doctrine points aka skills and you can change classes freely any time you want. I have nothing but good things to say about this game so yes I recommend it. It has been on sale a few times but even full price this is a good one to pick up.","June 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbro/recommended/248610/","elbro","Junta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbro/","579 products in account","Rainbow Six planning phase as a refined standalone game.\n\nThis is a top-down pausable real-time strategy where you guide a squad of special forces through various missions (hostage rescue, bomb defusal, arrests, evidence grab or plain good old terrorist hunt). Before the start of the mission you are able to set up a plan and then watch it play out - however you can adjust it to your liking at any moment and have a limited direct control of separate fighters. Furthermore every fighter is customizable with the ability to select a loadout suitable for various tasks (akin to SWAT4).\n\nThe game comes with several campaigns and a huge amount of single missions, as well as a battle generator. Missions have a degree of replayability due to random enemy positions and numbers each time. If that's not enough there is a built-in mission editor - meaning you can also download many great user missions from Steam Workshop.\n\nSteam Workshop further offers more variety by having mods that add new squad skins, new weapons and gear.\n\nThe only downside of note is an interface, which no doubt was affected by the mobile version - there's a lot of scrolling and clicking through to get to the stuff you want, especially after you've installed some mods. The game also gets repetitive after a while - same as its "bigger" brethren - classic R6 and SWAT series.","November 27, 2015","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbonebiggins/recommended/248610/","tbonebiggins","T-Bone Biggins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbonebiggins/","383 products in account","Great tactical game. Takes a bit to get used to the UI but it works well once learned, it's not a standard rip-off of the Starcraft of C&C interface and this is why people might have a bit of a learning curve before you can get into the gameplay. It only took my an hour to get almost everything memorized, not that bad. This game has random maps, pre-made single maps and campaigns. Going through the single maps alone would take a long long time. Campaigns can take a while especially if you have to restart some particularly overly hard missions. Once you play all those most games would be done and become boring, right? Luckily there is a random map generator. You can set size and enemy parameters, and since you don't know exactly what you are going to run in to it ends up being fun for long periods. Even if I have 5 minutes I can run one or two random killhouse maps. Or if I want to spend 3 hours playing a tactical game I can and it still doesn't get dull.\n\nTactically there are various ways to overcome each scenario. You can lockpick a locked door or break it down, or you can use special tools to lockpick it faster or break it faster but these tools take up an inventory slot and are heavier. Or you could use a breacher with a shotgun, but that shotgun becomes the primary weapon and is only useful at short range. There is a give and take to each option and all are viable pending your playstyle and how you want to approach that whole level. And this is just locked doors. The constant variation in the maps and multiple ways to approach each type of situation keeps it varied. Some maps you cannot flank the armored guy and have to face him head on, if you do not have the right equipment you will likely suffer. Sometimes there are too many rooms to flashbang each one so you have to adapt to opening doors and clearing rooms in a different way sweeping around the corner from a wider angle. The game doesn't feel dull even after a long time playing. Gameplay is top-notch and the devs plan on adding to it with co-op and multiplayer eventually.\n\nThis game has longevity, it hasn't gotten dull yet and I have plenty of hours in it already. It can be played in short spurts or long sessions without an issue. It's a tactical game that requires some thinking. Controls are more than functional and become natural to use with a little bit of time in the game to do exactly what you want down to smaller details like how you want to walk around a corner with a sweeping curve instead of walking straight in. There are various classes that all play differently and can change your play style immensely from one map to another depending on team loadout. You can respec your doctrine points aka skills and you can change classes freely any time you want. I have nothing but good things to say about this game so yes I recommend it. It has been on sale a few times but even full price this is a good one to pick up.","June 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The fact that I am writing a positive review for this game refelects how enjoyable I have found it.  I love the level challenges and find that the difficulty is set just right.  My biggest disappointment is that a very well thought out run can be won or lost by the random location of enemies and/or the enemies' marksmanship.  Sometimes you can blitz through a level with impressive results but re-run a level you only needed a minor tweak to, in order to improve your time, can result in you looping thorugh the exact same plan 30 times before it works again.\nThere are so many areas to work with and a varied set of levels, plus the ability to make your own or import others, that it keeps you playing.  The RPG like development of team members also adds a good dimension to the gameplay, especially if you play through all the levels with a single squad member\n\nOverall I'd give this game 8 out of 10, the effect of randomising the enemies being the main issue.

This game simulates a bust like on the Wire, or Hill Street Blues. Where the cops beat down the door and then run to catch the perps in the act, and stop them destroying the evidence, or killing hostages.\n\nI like how it builds up the anticipation of what lies behind a door, and then the thrill from the controlled burst of violence necessary to subdue whoever is in there. There are single missions and a campaign. The campaigns, so far, are really just loosely tied together single missions.  But, this is fine if you’re looking for action and tactics and not much story.\nThe game has many mods and comes with a cool looking editor, for those who want to get lots of replay.\nI would love to see a sequel set in Rio de Janeiro or somewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n","August 1, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Why? Anyway, I'll make it a moderate sized review I guess, TL;DR at the bottom. Instead of going over every detail like other reviews, I'll go over the little  nooks and crannies only , and not in any order, so let's get to it!  I have a lot more hours on Door Kickers than it seems, I've played the iPad version a lot and lots of offline hours.\n\nProgession\n\nThis game is pretty nice on progression to be honest. You have one class (I'll go over the classes in a second} and as your squad "levels" up, you obtain new classes,  until you get all 5 of them. There are also  stars , which you get for completing certain challenges, such as playing the mission using a single plan, or playing without ever pausing in real-life. With stars, you can buy  new weapons, armor and pretty much everything else . Every time your squad levels up, you get  doctorine points . These can be used to teach our squad special tactics, making them more effective.\n\nReplayablity\nThis game has a  nice freaking sheet  ton of replayablity. The AI makes  different decisions  and spawn in different preset spots (so they  can and will  repeat). There are a ridiculous amount of ways to complete each mission, be it with continuous sync throughout, splitting up to speed it up, or just trying out the best weapons for every situation!  Let's not forget that there's a  ♥♥♥♥ing mission generator  that ♥♥♥♥♥ out missions for you to play that feel like a normal one! Also the steam workshop is utilized pretty well so you can find lots of maps made by people using the level editor.\n\nMusic\nMeh.  The music is alright, but then it just starts turning into some dubstep crap, but if you're fine with a 60 seconds of dubstep or just love it in general, then you'll like it.\n\nGamemodes (WIP)\nThese are the gamemodes you'll play\n\nClear Hostiles\nHostage Rescue\nStop Execution\nBomb Defusal\nArrest Warrent\nDope Raids\nRobbery In Progress\nSome of the above, on a ship or plane or something really cool like that.\n\n\n\nWIP\nYEs, I'm tired, I'd appreciate a like or two pretty please though! I'll work on it very soon!","June 28, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/algojo/recommended/248610/","algojo","Algojo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/algojo/","50 products in account","*** I bought this game during the 2014 year-end Steam sale, and played when I got back to my uni before the finals week, most of the time off-line (>80% of my playtime) due to a massive flood disaster. So at the time this is written, I have played almost 100 hours offline, and only 13 hours with Steam online, which is why Steam only clocks me as have played only 13 hours.\n\nOh and one more thing: I like writing, so my review is going to be REALLY long.\n\nNow with that out of the way, I'm going to get to reviewing Door Kickers (DK).\n\nWhat is Door Kickers?You know what Rainbow Six (R6) is? If you don't, scroll down to the bottom of my review where I tell you a bit about R6. If you do, well, that's what DK is, except for three differences:\nDK is a top-down tactical shooter / R6 is an FPS tactical shooter\nDK is very easy and light to just pick up and play, whenever, wherever. Coffee break, lunch hour, taking a sh*t (if there will ever be a tablet version, which is very much possible if the dev bothers), doing your whatever thing with your laptop at Starbucks, etc.\nDK has you control a SWAT team with a considerably wide range of Law Enforcement Organization (LEO)-level gear / R6 has you control a bunch of hardened and specialized team of tacticool genius-level operator dudes and chicks bearing a very-wide range of military-grade toys\nThat's it. The rest, everything you remember from your fondest R6 days - choosing, equipping and leveling up your squads (with different classes), breach gadgets, planning your maneuvers, your button-hooks, wedges/pies, rescuing hostages, defusing bombs, capturing HVTs, retrieving intel/evidence, or straight-up delivering 'Merica to the bad guys - it's all there, AND THEN SOME:\n"Doctrine" system - a set of RPG-like skill trees, each specializing in different weapons and engagement discipline.\nDK is constantly updated with new contents such as campaigns and maps by both the devs and the awesomely capable community.\nDK has loads of awesome mods in the workshop. ATM there are: an R6-themed sound overhaul, loads of new military-grade weapons and operator skins for those who want a change in atmosphere, and tons of custom maps designed by the community.\nDK lets you watch a replay of your mission, record it with a built-in recorder, and even choose a point from your replay, and re-do the mission from said point.\nLEVEL EDITOR - need I say more?\nSo, with the basic features explained, what are the pros and cons?PROS:\nA mix of casual and hardcore: play how you want - easy-breezy, smash and shoot your way into the sh*t (which will most likely get your team or the hostage killed), OR take your time with recon (slow is smooth, smooth is fast), OR a mix of both (scout a bit, get in and improvise as necessary).\nLike R6, watching the result of your hardly-worked planning go down (especially when it goes right), like when your team is smoothly moving in, covering every angle, or when they smash in hard and fast and smack the bad guys who's having their thumbs up their behind, is simply indescribable.\nConfig files are easy to manipulate, which lets you alter the in-game assets (weapons stats and attributes etc.) to your preference, also makes modding easier\nReplay feature\nConsiderable replayability\nAwesome community-made contents\nDevs that DELIVARRRRS\nCONS:\nMIGHT get boring once you've aced all the maps and campaigns, and have run out of custom contents to play around with, but that's a given with any single-player games.\nLast I checked, the replay feature is still a little imperfect, where it sometimes "desyncs" and fail to play to the end.\nIMHO the breaching features can still be polished, in terms of set-pieces, such as a more snappy flash-entry or frag-entry.\nNot enough non-lethal options: so far there's only the taser-gun, but the workshop is quick to remedy this by offering a wide array of community-made non-lethal options (the super-painful-non-lethal-but-I-might-as-well-be-dead-if-I-get-shot-with-this bean bag rounds, rubber/silicone bullets, etc.)\nSo, do you recommend it?Does the leader of a popular religion defecate in remote areas of the forest?\n11/10 as far am I'm concerned, and I'm not even kidding.\n\nWhat in the hell is R6?You see, most of you who are below 20 most probably haven't heard of the R6 series, apart from the Vegas installments which are NOT what R6 really is. R6 is a hardcore tactical shooter where you control a team of counter-terrorist squad during various tactically-demanding operations, be it recon, seek & destroy, search & rescue, and bomb defusal. The R6 initiative, a fictional covert counter-terrorist organization born from the mind of the great Tom Clancy (a great, great author, despite the heavy political bias in his novels), specializes in going where the regular LEO can't go or has been terribly outmatched, where a swift and precise tactical intervention is severely needed, and where the faintest of the slightest hint of NATO involvement will stir up some real sh*t, so even the most specialest and tacticoolest of operators can't go. Oh, wait, that last bit is Splinter Cell. Sorry.\n\nYou see, at least as far as I understand from my various encounter with Hollywood pop-culture, there are a few levels of domestic LEO, which deals in different levels of criminal situations:\nSome drunk guy smacked his loud-mouthed wife about? You send out a dispatch so the local PD on his beat will go in and check it out.\nConvenience store in a stick-up? Local PD.\nA junkie with an illegal 9mm he got from Motherf*cker Jones is holding his neighbor for ransom because he can't afford his fix? You might wanna call the SWAT to back the local PD up, just in case it really gets out of hand.\nLocal gang drinking party turned into a violent shootout because of a domestic disturbance warrant serve turned a little too serious? A homosexual man and his totally straight crew decides to rob a sleepy bank, but it turned into a messy hostage situation? Definitely call in the SWAT, AND the FBI HRT.\nA maniacal cartel kingpin from across the border decides that the Narc, ATF and/or Feds have been too nosy and destroyed too much of their business decides to send a hit squad and shoot up a local PD HQ? An extremist militant cell rounded up and locked in a huge bunch of civs in a big library and set-off a timed dirty bomb in it? The UN conference was smashed in and every world leader is held hostage with demands of the US to hand over all their nukes? THESE, you call in the R6. Except for the last part with the UN? Yeah that's definitely Ghost Recon turf.","January 26, 2015","true","30.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The dip came somewhere between my 20th and 30th mission, where the difficulty started ramping up faster than I could cope with. I was quite frustrated for a while but kept trying to wade forward. And sure enough, once my knowledge of the game mechanics accumulated past a certain critical mass it was only upwards on that bell curve, toward permanent satisfaction. To limit the length of this review, I'd like to touch up only on things that I didn't like as I'm sure the positives are thoroughly described by others.\n\nthere are no collisions between units. While this makes the game easier, I kinda expected having to manage this aspect of CQB - avoiding a jam when moving in cramped spaces. And here instead you can stack your whole squad on one space like some sort of Shiva with 20 arms, wielding 8 guns, 2 tasers and a shield. And it's a very valid tactic.\nas an aside to the above, there is also no friendly fire though I don't mind.\nthere are multi-layered levels (ex. a house with an additional floor) but time moves forward only on the floor you are observing. This is an engine deficiency acknowledged by the devs and it's here to stay. Sort of embarassing.\nthe interface used for drawing paths is pretty clunky. It's hard to use precisely, and even harder if you're trying to map out a complicated plan in a tight space because of all the markers. It took me like 3 hours and some googling to figure out how to strafe. The option to "bend" an existing path is either missing or I haven't found it.\nthere is a fair amount of bugs, particularly related to handcuffing.\nin the hardest, endgame levels you are kinda undergunned and seriously struggling to defeat the body armor of enemies. I appreciate that police arsenals are not the same as military, yet it feels wrong.\nthere is a bit too much randomness in the outcome of firefights. Even the best plan will sometimes be defeated by RNG.\nBut yeah, in the end I agree with the Overwhelmingly Positive rating. This game will satisfy almost any fan of tactical combat. It's extremely addictive and feels rewarding to improve in.","April 19","true","30.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm glad it made it all the way through. It reminds me a lot of the tactical planner in pre-Raven Shield Rainbow Six games. You can carefully plan out your teams entry into an area swarming of enemies and maybe even hostages or adapt a plan on the fly. It can be pretty challenging too! The game has a fair amount of pre-made content for the price and also offers a stage builder to extend that further.\n\nKillHouse Games provided me with a review copy to produce a first impressions video.

Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.\n\nIf you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.\n\nThe idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.\n\nAdvancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and "Squad Doctrine" group training options.\n\nGear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.\n\nPOST RELEASE additional comments:\n\nThere are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.\n\nI've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.\n\nIf you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.","June 13, 2014","true","91.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 4 hours I've spent on this game have been some of the best hours I've ever spent on a game. As most people said (in which I agree) this game is a Top-Down SWAT 4, and I have absolutely no problem with that, since I play SWAT 4 often because it's on my computer, and it's awesome, and I have just as much (maybe even more) fun on this. My 2 only problems with this game are: The "random" map generator, isn't really random, but that doesn't bother me as much as this, THERE IS NO SHIELD OR STEALTH DOCTRINE. Now I realize there is a mod for a stealth doctrine, but I'm not too fond of it, so hopefully the developers can add these 2, my ideas for a stealth doctrine is hopefully it makes the stealth guys completely silent at footsteps, lockpicking, basically everything, and I hope in the shield doctine they add a shield bash ability, that'd be totally awesome. This is a great game overall and I absolutely love it and will play it all the time probably, good job developers, hopefully you'll see this and take my ideas into consideration, love this game though, keep up the good work!","October 30, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bravo, engage!\n\nPros:\n- Doorkickers has a very great tactical element to it, allowing you to utilize unit sight lines to spy corners before entering and taking out the baddies before shots are fired. Using multiple units for cover and movement through doorways, flashing, flanking is very fun and very satisfying when it all goes according to the plan in your mind.\n- The different classes to combine on missions is very interesting and with mobility meters could spell the difference between a good outcome on a mission or a very fatal end.\n- Utilization of "Go-Codes" is always exciting when you are able to time your plan sequences in a smooth, fluid execution.\n- There is a SKILL tree and Doctrine points to purchase weapons and gear (only once) for all of your units to use\n- Lots of maps and creatable content to share with Steam friends and community.\n\nCons:\n- I have to admit, sometimes the units can be a bit finnicky, and it gets a bit frustrating; there are two tangos in a large room on the other side of a locked door you cannot flashbang through - breaching with a hammer, lockpick, or breaching charge takes too much time to set up, you send a man through and direct his sight line to sweep, but instead of firing on the first guy he sees on side A, sweeps and shoots man in corner B instead and leaves the first man he sees in the shadows. Alongside the factor of friendly fire sight lines, its frustrating when you have 2 of your own units stacked on top of each other, but one will not fire in his designated direction due to a teammate being directly on top of him.\n- I've found that enemy units are able to fire simultaneously and hit my units while they are in a line, while my units cannot fire through each other. Something I think will be patched in the future.\n- Another issue I'm having is pathing selections: there are times where lines will overlap in a hallway and you wnat to change the sight line of ONE of your units, but you can't select his pathing line because the OTHER guys' line is on top of his. I tried to lock one unit's path with SHIFT, but doesn't seem to work. Something that can be fixed.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, I REALLY do enjoy the game. For $20? Sure. I honestly feel the game's INCLUDED content could have been more, the campaigns are a bit short, but the replayability with different tactics is refreshing. The focus on community map content is a bit harrowing, as I'm not one to really have time to download and configure all of it to work. I also feel that each class should have their own type of special ability in relation with the skill trees, instead of just access to a certain type of primary weapon. Different stat fluctuations, maybe? I don't know. It's still a great game to kill time and terrorists with.","November 11, 2014","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The top down perspective allows me to practice the tactics I training I received in the Marines. And you'll hear that alot from some players: that they play the game exactly the way they would react and conduct these situation in reality. It's no surprise to me that they've gotten a contract to create a simulation title specifically for military and law enforcement, the expressed purpose to be for training and small unit tactics.\n\nGuys, if you're into individual tactics and clearing a building room by room, as well as the intensity involved in jusst not knowing what may be around the next corner for your men, this is the game for you. I purchased the stuff of legends package from their site, which allowed me to not only have a portrait of me in the game for the troopers, but also gave me feature voting rights in the forums.

The ability to have multiple entry strategies whether that be placing a charge on the door, shooting the lock, or tossing in a flashbang makes the outcomes of just a single room almost immeasurable. The AI is great as well. If you take a more stealthy approach, the enemies may not be watching the door waiting for you. But if you charge through the house blasting everyone with shotguns, expect them to be in cover waiting for your squad to barge in. Also, even though on the menu it says its in the "Alpha" phase you could mistake this for a finished game. I've spent almost 4 hours in it I think and haven't seen a single bug or experienced an issue. The best 15 dollars I've ever spent. I hope its finished soon.

The action can be fast and brutal, or slow and methodical, with the multiple classes, dozens upon dozens of missions, and all manner of weapons and potential ways to win in the fast-paced gameplay of Door Kickers.\n\nOpen-ended tactical action with loads of potential gameplay, PLUS Steam Workshop and an active modding community. This didn't win 'Best Tactics 2014' for nothing (Rock Paper Shotgun), and I say it shows. Rainbow Six if it was top-down and you were a floating policeman god, some may say (There's also mods to make it Rainbow Six).

The game can be pretty frustrating at times, for example I don't understand the use of stealth weapons, it doesn't change anything, enemies hear you and come to investigate. I hate this, i like playing stealthy by as soon as one shot from a stealth weapon  goes off, enemies come to see what the noise was then ♥♥♥♥ turns into cluster ♥♥♥♥ central. I do hope they actually fix this, if they did then this game would definitely be on my top 5 game list.\nThere's this a lot missing from the game, for example not all of the upgrades are available, there's no campaign so you just go through different stages and shoot at people. One of the most frustrating missions are hostage rescue missions, at first they are nice and all but after a couple stages, they start executing hostages, so if you break a door or shoot at someone, you have 5 seconds to reach the hostages before they are executed,  which isn't easy in a big house/office... Also, it seems SWAT doesn't care much for hostages, if they see an enemy and there's a hostage in-between them, they just shoot at them and kill the hostage, which is especially annoying since if you kill a hostage, or a hostage dies, it's mission failed. Don't expect it to be a Call of Duty like game where one person takes on an entire building full of terrorists, you will almost always be out-numbered so you have to plan ahead of time, and be ready to adapt when things don't go your way.  I would recommend this game if you like games like XCOM but remember, this is still an alpha and there's a lot missing.\n","May 23, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ability to have multiple entry strategies whether that be placing a charge on the door, shooting the lock, or tossing in a flashbang makes the outcomes of just a single room almost immeasurable. The AI is great as well. If you take a more stealthy approach, the enemies may not be watching the door waiting for you. But if you charge through the house blasting everyone with shotguns, expect them to be in cover waiting for your squad to barge in. Also, even though on the menu it says its in the "Alpha" phase you could mistake this for a finished game. I've spent almost 4 hours in it I think and haven't seen a single bug or experienced an issue. The best 15 dollars I've ever spent. I hope its finished soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkansascharlatan/recommended/248610/","arkansascharlatan","arkansascharlatan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkansascharlatan/","69 products in account","First "tactical" game I've seen in a while that actually deserves the name. One of maybe three games I've played ever, wherein you could actually use real-world tactics, and those tactics not only work, but they work in-game, for the same reasons they work in real life. Button-hooks, cross-overs, "slicing the pie", etc. etc. This could be used as a kind of "sim-lite" for real-world operators-in-training, who just want to see tactics in action, while exploring why they work. Beyond that, it's a fairly entertaining game, giving you all the gear choices, squad-building, and planning that you need for a game to actually be "tactical", a term that is either misused these days, or avoided for fear of losing the instant gratification and hand-holding market. With both one-off missions, several campaigns (with more to come, apparently), random mission generator, and Steam Workshop support, there's endless hours of play available.\n\nI do have some relatively minor complaints, though. For one, any tactical game that uses a weapon and gear unlock system breaks my immersion just a tad. Real world units don't have to unlock weapons and gear. They simply use what they feel best fits the task at hand. So I kind of wish they would have gone the classic Rainbow Six route, where everything is at your disposal from the get-go. Also, there are some rather unrealistic balancing issues. Targets wearing body armor are human bullet sponges. I've watched in amusement, as my full-armored operator unloaded round after round of 5.56 from an M4 into one of these vested "tangos" at point-blank range, only to watch the target giggle, scratch his nuts, wink at my wife, and blow my up-armored operator away with a few rounds from his sub-gun. I'm sorry, but no vest exists that will stop a full-powered rifle round without at least incurring incapacitating trauma on the wearer. But no mind, it's just a game after all. Just frustrating at times.\n\nI've also gotten the sense that the developers understood "rate-of-fire" to be more important/significant than stopping power, which is ridiculous. I'm not claiming to be one of them, but if you talk to anyone with any experience in a job where firearms use and training was in the job description, they'll tell you that 99.9% of the time, you're going to use that full-auto weapon in semi-auto mode, and you're trained that way for a reason. Accuracy and stopping power are what keep you alive, and rate-of-fire negates accuracy, and therefor also negates stopping power (because you're not hitting anything), as it increases. But again, not a big deal. It's just kind of awkward when you get the sense that your MP5 on full-auto, is somehow proving more effective than that M4 with well-placed shots.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactics and planning! I've already put an obscene number of hours into this one, with many more to come!","May 24, 2015","true","204.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fairly easy to pick up and has a decent amount of depth. It actually has a surprisingly exciting tone, much more intense than most strategy games. You can spend qute a while perfecting your plan, but missions go down in a matter of seconds, which makes the game feel fast-paced. You can try to complete the operation without pausing for that extra challenge.\nAll in all, it's a really fun game. My only criticism is that it is a little bit *too* tight (insert your dirty-minded laughter here). Basically what I mean is just that the game can get tiring after a while because all the missions start to feel predictable, especially once you've analyzed the underlying systems.\nDefinitely recommended, but you probably shouldn't expect to get more than 10-20 hours out of it.","November 2, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a tactical strategy game where you customize your own squad, names, callsigns, loadouts, and roles (like shield, stealth, assaulter, breacher and pointman) and assign them to missions, and there are a ton of missions, premade missions, campaigns, community-made missions, mission generator and mission editor as well. The replayability is enormous and you can just keep playing different missions for hours.\n\nDifferent objectives like hostages, bomb defusals, pure hostile killing, etc, The design of the plan system is very nice and well-made, you can plan out tactics and pause at any time of the game. You can make a whole plan from the start of the mission, or you can play a more real-time playstyle where your plan is improvised as the operation goes, or a combination of both.\n\nIf you are interested in conducting anti-terrorist/crime operations(e.g. SWAT) and is not too picky with the graphics, you should definitely give this a try.  It's got the Rainbow Six/SWAT atmosphere but the gameplay style of XCOM converted to real-time.\n\n9/10","January 28","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is what you would hope for as the next installment of XCOM or Jagged Alliance 2. Gone are the tedious hour-hungry turn-based mechanics of yesteryear. Gone are the unnecessary numbers and virtual die rolls. Instead you get fast-paced, easy-to-play excitement from start to end. The end unfortunately comes too soon. More content would have been nice, and the third party downloads are unfortunately very lacking. I hope the sequel will provide much more. And - BTW - beware the almost uannounced permadeath in campaign mode!

Great mix of paused and real-time gameplay. Can't really say anything good about this other than what you've already seen in other reviews.\n\nThe downsides I've come across may be unique to my experience though, and are worth pointing out:\n\n1) The controls took quite awhile to get the hang of. I didn't feel like I had a clue for the first 3 hours or so of gameplay. This was off-putting at first. I almost stopped playing but was glad I decided to take a break and come back the next day and try again. It also helped a lot to turn on colored paths in the options menu. Not sure why that's not a default.\n\n2) Somehow I totally missed the "Doctrines". I'm not sure if this was ever explained early on in the game, but I was about 30 missions in before I realized that existed. I got to a certain mission that I had a really hard time beating, then was about to take a break. I went back to the main menu to quit and finally saw "Doctrines: 9". I spent those and then immediately destroyed the mission. They make a big difference! Missing it may have been totally my fault, but if it's not made obvious that they exist, it would be an improvement if they highlighted those at some point.","March 23","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked it as it was then (and it was well worth the rather cheap price at that point), and it has only improved. I see that it won best tactics game of 2014, and this makes me feel a little pride, knowing that I have supported it from the beginning :)\n\nYour team is pretty customizable. You can rename each trooper, select from a number of different portraits, choose each trooper's class, and also customize their equipment and weapon loadout. There are several different campaigns to undertake, each with different focuses, enemies, and situations. There's also a bunch of individual missions you can try.\n\nFor extras, there is a mission generator, map editor, and you have access to the workshop. You can download maps, etc from the workshop which is always nice.\n\nThe gameplay is characterized by pausing and unpausing (or, not). You can pause, and while paused click and drag each trooper's path through the level, designating actions to do once they reach a door (like flashbanging it and clearing), which way to scan when they reach a certain point, and so forth. You can map out as much or as little at a time as you want. There is a bonus if you successfully run through the level fully mapping it out in the beginning, and not interfering. There's also a bonus for completing the level with just 1 trooper. Hopefully this makes sense.\n\nThe selection of equipment and tools, combined with classes, can make for plenty of replay value. You could run 1 level many different ways depending on which troopers you use, what equipment they have, and how they enter a building, room, or area. For instance you might run the level very differently if you have one or two stealth troopers on the mission, than if you have a pointman with a pistol, assaulter with a rifle, or breacher with a shotgun.\n\nI certainly recommend this game.\n","February 11","true","38.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great mix of paused and real-time gameplay. Can't really say anything good about this other than what you've already seen in other reviews.\n\nThe downsides I've come across may be unique to my experience though, and are worth pointing out:\n\n1) The controls took quite awhile to get the hang of. I didn't feel like I had a clue for the first 3 hours or so of gameplay. This was off-putting at first. I almost stopped playing but was glad I decided to take a break and come back the next day and try again. It also helped a lot to turn on colored paths in the options menu. Not sure why that's not a default.\n\n2) Somehow I totally missed the "Doctrines". I'm not sure if this was ever explained early on in the game, but I was about 30 missions in before I realized that existed. I got to a certain mission that I had a really hard time beating, then was about to take a break. I went back to the main menu to quit and finally saw "Doctrines: 9". I spent those and then immediately destroyed the mission. They make a big difference! Missing it may have been totally my fault, but if it's not made obvious that they exist, it would be an improvement if they highlighted those at some point.","March 23","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fairly easy to pick up and has a decent amount of depth. It actually has a surprisingly exciting tone, much more intense than most strategy games. You can spend qute a while perfecting your plan, but missions go down in a matter of seconds, which makes the game feel fast-paced. You can try to complete the operation without pausing for that extra challenge.\nAll in all, it's a really fun game. My only criticism is that it is a little bit *too* tight (insert your dirty-minded laughter here). Basically what I mean is just that the game can get tiring after a while because all the missions start to feel predictable, especially once you've analyzed the underlying systems.\nDefinitely recommended, but you probably shouldn't expect to get more than 10-20 hours out of it.","November 2, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where this is probably a good comparison in terms of genre and what to expect, Door Kickers is far more fluid and boasts a rather active community giving the game experience a slight edge over Breach & Clear and perhaps a lasting experience.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple. You run a SWAT-like squad which you are able to level up through single missions ("training") and get to equip them with weapon and armour upgrades as you complete missions, level up your squad and gain "roster stars". These you spend on upgrades. You can also gain a type of skill point that you can use to improve the 3 basic weapon trees: hand-guns, assault, shot-guns. These all become bigger, brighter and better as you progress and start to unlock other roles for your squad: breacher, assaulter, stealth and a shielder.\n\nThe workshop community have already created a large array of mission rooms and campaigns, but there is also an editor in-game and random room creator that help to gain those level ups before tackling the storyline campaigns.\n\nThis isn't your Real World SWAT team. Don't expect negotiation abilities, or actual SWAT tactics to retrieve hostages. The game borrows from SWAT. Once you can accept that, then the game is pretty fun. You can stop/pause to plot within the mission or campaign, or run it fluidly which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Fog of War obscures rooms and areas, so trying to clear out a biker gang hideout, or safely escort a VIP from a train station can be daunting, exciting and full of action if you don't pick the right squad members or plot your actions carefully.\n\nLeave no door unopened. Even if it is a toilet. Tangos hide in toilets.\n\nOverall, if you want something harking back to the old SWAT games, you may not like Door Kickers not keeping to SWAT regulations and realism. Otherwise, if you like using spy cameras to check out rooms for the bad guys, breaching with a shot gun, or using a shield guy as a decoy whilst you flank from behind some cars in a parking garage, you will probably really enjoy Door Kickers.","January 1","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great mix of paused and real-time gameplay. Can't really say anything good about this other than what you've already seen in other reviews.\n\nThe downsides I've come across may be unique to my experience though, and are worth pointing out:\n\n1) The controls took quite awhile to get the hang of. I didn't feel like I had a clue for the first 3 hours or so of gameplay. This was off-putting at first. I almost stopped playing but was glad I decided to take a break and come back the next day and try again. It also helped a lot to turn on colored paths in the options menu. Not sure why that's not a default.\n\n2) Somehow I totally missed the "Doctrines". I'm not sure if this was ever explained early on in the game, but I was about 30 missions in before I realized that existed. I got to a certain mission that I had a really hard time beating, then was about to take a break. I went back to the main menu to quit and finally saw "Doctrines: 9". I spent those and then immediately destroyed the mission. They make a big difference! Missing it may have been totally my fault, but if it's not made obvious that they exist, it would be an improvement if they highlighted those at some point.","March 23","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No problem.\nOr rather a breacher? You got it.\nA stealther? Sure.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with certain aspects of the game, the modding community is doing their job for sure.\nFrom different/new weapons or armours, to completely new classes and obviously loads of user made maps.\n\nThe cartoonish graphics are definitely no throw off. You will be way too focused on your tactics trying to keep your officers alive than to check out the beautiful flower pots in the bathroom.\n\nJust don't go thinking "Easy peasy".

If there are any glitches or graphics aren't good (it feels like they are just amazing enough for this game) than I haven't realized any of that because I'm completely sucked into the window in the middle of the screen where all the action is happening.","December 19, 2014","true","27.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Great products like Rainbow Six and SWAT as they made their mark in the gaming world. You tend to look back on those games and ask yourself this question. Does anyone still remember those days? How they helped pave the way for tactical strategy in games?\n\nWhen Door Kickers came along, the answer couldn't have been more clear. "♥♥♥♥ yeah we remember!"\n\nWhat's good about the game:\n-The deep tactical planning, choose from a wide variety of weapons and equipment to plan your approach. (You can even change their names if you're into that sort of thing.) Use your troopers to their maxium potiental to get the job done and bring everyone home safe. Espically in Iron Man mode you will have to take your planning very seriously as every  trooper death only makes your job harder.\n\n-Open-ended planning, missions can be completed in several different ways. It will be up to you to determine what is the best course of action.\n\n-Random enemy placement. In most if not all cases, the odds will be stacked against you. You will face off against several tangos (bad guys) armed to the teeth and not knowing for sure of how many  are there or their location adds tenson to the action. Just because you have a plan figured out, doesn't mean things can't go wrong.\n\n-The ability to do two different playstyles. The first being a pause, plan, action playstyle. Before your troopers get into the thick of it, you can pause the game and develop a course of action for them. Tell who to go where, where to look, where to strafe, etc. Then watch it unfold when you switch it to real time. The second being what I call wing-it mode. You can play the entire mission in real time and make things up as you go. So players that aren't into the whole stop and think style aren't forced to play that way.\n\n-Numerous amount of missions and counting. There are several missions to be completed in this game, all of which have a lot of replayablity to them. Single missions, campagns, custom player-made missions, randomly generated missions. It feels practically endless to what can be done to have missions.  Furthermore, as of the time of this review, the developers are still adding missions, content, and improvements to the game.\n\n-Mod support. Something about the game you want to change up? Things like new weapons, gear,etc? Odds are there is a mod that fits the bill and there are quite a few to choose from.\n\n-The bits of comedic relief. Though this game has an overall serious tone, there are bits of humor thrown in that is quite amusing to lighten the mood a little when needed. It's not obnoxious or intrusive ethier, it's well timed and unexpected.  I'm not to going to spoil them as I'll leave them to be discovered yourself. ;)\n\nI honestly can't think of anything serious to complain about with Door Kickers. It's an overall well made and addicting tactical strategy game that is worthy of your money and time.  Even at full price, you get a lot for twenty dollars.\n\n\n","December 22, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neuronwake/recommended/248610/","Neuronwake","Neuronwake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neuronwake/","157 products in account","Bought this game quite recently, but already I love it. It's a great overhead 2D game where you control a SWAT team and have to command them tactically through hostile situations. Here's a quick overview:\nPROS\n(+++) Mission Variety -- There are many types of missions: there are "clear all hostiles" missions, hostage rescues, domb defusal, arrests, friendly escorts, and even a mode where you must collect evidence before criminals destory it. The game has plenty of "official missions", which are pre-rendered maps with variations of these missions; you can play these many times to improve your results and earn medals. It also has campaigns, which make the injuries and deaths on your squad have permanence and require you to safely lead your men through each mission. Most importantly, however, is the random mission generator, which picks maps at random and assigns varying scenarios and missions, or genreates maps for you to clear; this is especially fun when you set the genration options to random and aren't sure what you'll get in terms of enemy strength. Finally, there is a map editor and the ability to download other people's maps, and with the devs themselves adding new missions and campaigns as the game goes on, the challenges won't likely run out anytime soon.\n(++) Squad Scaling -- Throwing a little RPG into the mix, the game provides you with experience -- both for each trooper and the squad as a whole -- after each mission. These can be used to unlock skills for the whole squad, and each trooper will increase their own stats as you use them. You also unlock more weapons and equipment as you earn stars for completing missions quickly and without losing men, and its fun to level and gear up as you beat more and more missions, making armored or armed enemeies easier to handle.\n(++) Enjoyable gameplay -- The enemy varieties and randomness in each mission gives each scenario a freshness, and requires you to keep thinking through encounters instead of just doing the same thing over and over (although the restart button is there when you need it). It's a great experience if you've ever wanted to command a SWAT team and hear them shout "Clear! Clear!" as they systematically put bullets into hostiles.\nCONS\n(-) Controls/Interface -- Once you get used to them, the path-drawing/command-giving controls are fairly intuitive and work 90% of the time. However, as I've found with a few top-down tactics games, you don't always get the full level of control you'd want when working with your men. In certain cases, such as when two trooper's paths overlap or giving orders that stack commands on door opening, you'll misclick and put your shotgunner in front of your riot shielder or send a man through a door backwards. There are a few things the interface could do to alleviate this (such as perhaps showing unit paths one at a time, or giving a little more control over what order door opening actions are performed in) but overall it is a minor problem that usually causes little trouble once you know what to watch for.\n(-) Squad Scaling -- I know this was under PROS as well, but I found that my squad was fully trained and upgraded with the gear I wanted after only a few hours of gameplay. The rest of the upgrades, then, just felt like I was unlocking gear for the sake of using up my XP or stars, and now, though I still enjoy the missions, I've run out of things to unlock. Perhaps adding more unlockables or more squad skill trees would help keep advancement fresh as the game is played longer, though the focus of this game is on individual tactical missions and not squad progression.\nOVERALL\nIf you ever dreamed of virtually barking tactical decisions over radio to a SWAT team engaging hostiles, get this game. Hours of fun for sure.\n","December 27, 2014","true","62.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Attempting to complete levels using a single trooper or one complete plan is even more engaging and rewarding.\n\nThe game fails when you start unlocking further upgrades/weapons/setups and attempt some of the more complicated levels. This is where you need some intricate planning and split-second decisions and reactions count. And this is where the poor UI fails and where the design flaws start to actually matter.\n\nSome of the really annoying issues include:\n\n-inability to sync moves beyond the A B C D go-codes. Frozen Synapse does a WAY better job at that.\n\n-you can't change a trooper's angle of view and swap weapons/reload in the same move. One action will cancel the other so either you have to unpause, execute the 1st action, pause, and queue up the 2nd one, or you have to create a redundant move point in order to queue up your 2nd action. You should be able to queue up 2 such basic actions simultaneously.\n\n-you can't edit or move any waypoints in the middle of a chain. Everything after the point of edit is deleted and on those long complicated levels this is SUCH a waste of time!\n\n-in some levels, the game forces your troopers into very small quarters and trying to select them and order them around becomes a nightmare. There's no SELECT ALL feature so trying to get your troopers onto the 2nd floor is very annoying. Also the way the game selects which troopers are moved between floors seems pure random. I've failed so many missions because I kept switching between floors trying to get everyone in one place and end up being flanked and killed during the time I've wasted.\n\n-I've no idea how this game expects you to play it in real-time mode with such bugs and weird control scheme. Some keyboard hotkeys would be nice.\n\nI'm still recommending it because I've got my fair share of fun for the price I've paid; I got the game on sale for 50%. Until this game becomes more PC friendly, I wouldn't recommend getting it at full price. The ability to mod and create/share your own content is awesome but I really need tight gameplay and proper user-feedback to enjoy this game the way the developers intended me to.","April 28, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/recommended/248610/","Shadeball","Shadeball","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/","130 products in account","Doorkickers is a fun, challenging shooting puzzle game with a tactical paintjob and some forgetable RPG elements.\n\nLet me start by saying that Door Kickers is not what I really hoped it to be: a spiritual successor to the Swat line of games. Remember those? They were the counter to most shooting games because you could get the best victory with the fewest shots fired. A careful and well-planned approach was more useful than  running and gunning. Being cautious was almost always better than being fast.\n\nDoor kickers has none of that. The goal is generally to kill everyone besides your team that has a gun on the map.\n\nDK isn't a police simulator or even that much of a tactical simulator (for reasons I'll go into below)- it's a puzzle game. But it's fun and I found it delivered plenty. In general DK wants you to complete the mission without losing any of your guys and in the shortest time possible. This usually means killing all suspects but you're also tasked with preventing the execution of hostages and demolition of bombs. Keep in mind not only are the suspects absurdly numerous but they throw grenades at your guys. Yeah.\n\nThere are also some extra goals for each mission, like using a single trooper, not pausing, or using only one plan. These are sometimes neat little challenges but other times are frustrating or, sometimes, impossible due to the design of the mission (some impossible challenges have been removed in patches, I suspect more will be later). As I said there's not much cautiousness allowed if you want the full score for a mission. Instead you go in fast and if it doesn't work, just restart and try again. Repeat until you succeed below the time limit. It seems the newly added campaign missions are a little less strict for time.\n\nYou can build your squad but there's not much individualism there. You can put backer's names and faces in to personalize a trooper but that's it: no backstories, special skilles, interactions, etc. Fans of Jagged Allience (or to some degree Swat 2) shouldn't expect much here. Troopers advance in 3 skills as they go along but I honestly can't tell much of a difference between an expert and novice trooper.\n\nYou can gain your whole squad certain skills\upgrades which are sometimes useful but many are bizarre in that they replicate what should be normal behavior. For example: being able to hold fire when not under threat. Given the micromanagement elsewhere I don't see why it's even an upgrade instead of an inate ability. It's really tiring to be trying to do a stealthy approach and the guy you've armed with a carbine decides to blow away an enemy across the map who has no idea what's going on, thereby alerting everyone. The "skill" in question would also be much more useful if it were a toggle rather than the way it is implemented as a button that must be pressed every time one wants to fire. I'm also not sure how a squad needs to "learn" how to open doors instead of noisily kicking them. I've tried both, and opening a door is easier and more tactically sound!\n\nThere are lots of guns and devices. Most are redundent and add little but it's nice to have some variety. Some of the weapon stats are very unrealistic. It seems that a .45 caliber pistol is easily more powerful ('stopping power') than a UMP45, which is basically the very same cartridge in a longer barrel and therefore more velocity. Looking at the stats it might even be more powerful than a assault rifle! It doesn't make any sense and I'm not sure if it's as a 'balance' issue or rule of cool.\n\nThere really is no arresting necessary, except for those missions that present unarmed subjects specifically targeted for arrest. Nor is it easy to arrest suspects, as they never voluntarily drop their weapons and the troopers don't give them a chance to do so anyway. The only real way I've found to arrest armed suspects is to tase them and then cuff them while they are disabled. This is a tricky and very risky move when there's more than one suspect around and there's really no reason to do it since putting a bullet through someone leads to the same result.\n\nThe enemy AI is pretty dumb. There's a mod to leave dead bodies on the ground instead of having them vanish and I think I know why it is not the default... it looks absurd how many bodies will be lying in the same spot. You'd think once you kill the first 3 guys who walk out a door there would be a change in tactics. That would be a mistake. By all means, keep shooting them as they march out as if they're cattle. The only thing stopping you is the need to occasionally change magazines (from your unlimited supply) and the time ticking away. But on later missions the poor AI is hidden with absolutely STUPID levels of armor for the enemies who, while still dumb, will manage to murder your troopers immediately upon seeing them from 150 yards away. ♥♥♥♥, why don't we hire these criminals? They're vastly better than anything the good guys can do. Plus they never have to reload (had a guy firing a shotgun at me for 2 minutes without pause).\n\nFriendly AI is also robotic (the only thing giving the bad guys a fighting chance in addition to their absurd numbers and lots of access points). You need to micromanage everything if you want to get a good result, to the extent where you need to manually direct the troopers in a 'slicing pie' movement to clear a doorway (otherwise they'll tend to sorta just charge in and promptly get shot). Troopers will respond to being shot... eventually... but that seems to be the only stimulus that will get their attention. They seem to be of two minds as to whether they'll address a threat in an area not specifically designated as 'their' cover zone. Usually this means they'll ignore it if it's important and engage it like flies on ♥♥♥♥ if it's NOT important. So if there's two bad guys and one is disco dancing while the other is moving to shoot the hostage, it seems like the troopers go for the dancer. Well, okay, can't blame them for that, but I wish there was a way to designate a target out of several visible.\n\nSo if it sounds like I'm negative about this game, it's just because I wanted something a little more like Swat 2. But the game is addictive and if you buy it knowing you're getting a tacticalish puzzle shooter you can have a lot of fun. It's nice to play things out in slow motion and the RT\Pause action works quite well (on single story buildings). Watching the replay afterwards can be fun as it brings everything together. The dev-team seems responsive to the community and there is modding (as well as a mission editor). It strikes me as one of those games that just demands 'one more try' even when you should probably be out mowing the lawn. I believe I paid $15 for the early access and that seems to me to be a good price-point for the game.","October 28, 2014","true","81.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I have several problems with this game.\n\nEditing paths when making a plan  is a hassle.  I wish it was something I can overlook but since it's the main tool to use in the game,  I can't.  It's not efficient so you have to workaround the problems with UI. I really hope they clean this up with door kickers 2, if not then I'll be pretty disappointed with that game.  I don't think this game would have such positive reviews if everyone had to finish the missions without pausing since the there are several issues with UI.\n\nI like how the AI reacts to your actions such as busting down a door.  I'm not too fond of them being able to spawn in random/different locations.  The reason for this is because it can be tedious coming up with a solid plan as editing paths are a pain. If they imrpove the UI in door kickers 2 then I wouldn't mind random spawns for enemies.  You may find several problems with your plan if it involves flashbangs.\n\nSwitching between pause and real time sort of eliminates some of the problems that come up when making a plan.   It's cool in a way, I'm glad it's there, but then it's not really challenging.\n\n$15 would be a more appropriate price tag in my opinion.\n\nBUGS:\nAn obnoxious buzzing sound that won't go away happens often when loading a new level.  Usually, it goes away when you restart so it's not a big issue.  But I saw iron man mode? that you can enable and I believe it mentioned something about not being allowed to restart missions.  I don't know if it causes a problem there.","January 21","false","7.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

It's both about action and tactics. Unfortunately it's totally overrun with gamebreaking bugs that makes it almost impossible to play.\n\nThe biggest irony is that it's called "doorkickers" since the doorkicking mechanism contains one of the most severe issues in the entire game: You cannot place yourself in the doorway. By dooing that the dooropening UI hides the UI that allows you to turn in a direction, throw grenades or shoot until there is no threat.\n\nAlso, backing to the menu does not pause the game, so if there is a tiny flaw in your plan, you want to restart the mission, your entire plan might get eraised.\n\nAnother thing that drives me crazy is that it impossible to do small changes to your plan. Adjusting it early removes everything after that.\n\nSo all in all. This game have potential to be extremely good, unfortunately the developers decided to not employ a single tester.

It is good enough to not get a thumbs down, but it is not quiet what I expected. It's pretty fun and I will put more time into it when i'm bored, but so far in just an hour and half i'm ready to get back on frozen synapse instead. I find the controls very awkward in comparison to frozen synapse and breach & clear. It's definitely a more casual game compared to those others. The squad customization is very nice and there is a lot of maps / scenarios to choose from. This is a game that I would say is worth it all depending on the price. If I were to have paid 20$ then I would be extremely dissapointed, ended up only spending 4$ b/c I bought cards for super cheap to convert to gems. I don't think this game is really worth more than 10-12$ in comparison to other games in the genre, but those other games are more hardcore type and this has a more arcade / laid back feel.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things is that when you set multiple waypoints there is no key to delete the last WP and you can't hightlite it then hit delete key. The only way to delete every single WP is to click on then then right click and select delete. Maybe not a big issue for some of you, but go play frozen synapse and then try to not have that feature. There are no straight lines in this game when making your WP, you simply drag the mouse the entire length then go back and adjust how you want to aim a long the path. This of course ends up with somewhat wavy lines across the path which again is not a big thing unless you are use to better games which use straight lines that auto adjust more WPs when you hit a wall. To me it's a little annoying to have to hit A, B, C or D in order to pause a unit at said spot, but i'm also use to frozen synapse giving you a timer so you can have a unit go, turn, kneel, wait 2 seconds, stand up, turn around, go forward, wait .4 seconds, turn right, turn left, run forward, run past avoiding enemy and then target them from around cover all in one simple command.\n\nThis does have an option a lot of people will like which is being able to play it without really pausing it at all just drag the units quickly adjust them and switch units very fast. I personally don't like that, I prefer more tactical pausing with extreme level of detail, but it is a good feature allowing you to play multiple ways. I'm sure as I casually spend some bored time with this game that I will eventually get these controls down very well and enjoy it a bit more, but for right now it just feels clunky and awkward. It gets a bit tricky to see whos path is whos when you have more than 2 people.\n\nThis game could be great for you, it all just depends on what exactly your looking for. If you are really into the very detailed, highly precise tactical turn based games then you might be dissapointed. I would spend 5$ more and buy frozen synapse if you have neither of the 2 games.","December 16, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game tests your ability to adapt to unfavorable circumstances, and it often pits you against seemingly insurmountable odds in the form of armed thugs.\n\nAll in all it's great fun. Feels very rewarding when you craft a plan for a particular mission and you pull it off successfully. Would urge you to wait for a sale though, as the base $20 price dropped down to just $4 in this past Autumn Sale.","November 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Things I talked about may now be irrelevant. I will update this review in the near future as I have stopped progressively playing Doorkickers.\n\nAs much as want to enjoy Door Kickers, as I am a big fan of Tactic RTS's , this one has given me the most frustation yet, and not in a good, challenging way either. Although my hours spent on this game at the time of this review is few, the movement mechanics have already hindered a positive impression from me. Often times, the fault in my plans is not in my ability, but in the broken mechanics of the game.\n\nWhen things work out and bugs such as shooting at the wall because the target is to my characters adjacent isn't a problem, the game is fun. Watching my team swiftly move in and clearing the area under a designated time feel rewarding and I can see what the dev's envision. But, having a constant struggle with things like redoing my carefully laid out plan because adding a step would somehow erase the previous ones, or, being unable to peak around the corner of a doorway because the action menu of breaching methods block my cursor from selecting my move node, breaks the experience for me.\n\nAmong all my concerns however, the two big annoyances are when my team disregards the assigned command call (ex. Alpha, Bravo), and moves in on their own, and, when the units move before clearing a newly breached room. The work around for for the first issue is to redo my whole plan which, as mentioned before, is a chore that takes away from the fun.\n\nAlthough my review has mostly been negative, this is not a bad game at all. In fact, I would recommend you to give it as try as this review is soley based on my own critique. You may overlook these minor flaws and thoroughly enjoy this game. But for me, these minor issues were little details that became a major hassle as I played on.","December 19, 2014","false","44.4"," 48 of 98 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","48","98","3","7"

However, there are some serious flaws that made me not want to recommend this game.\n\nThe biggest reason is the nonsense "progression system", squad leveling and classes. It simply doesn't make that you only start with pistols, but later, once you have "progressed", you can replay the missions with more and usually *better* equipment! It just makes the game easier and more boring faster. The classes determine what equipment can be used, and it's pretty arbitrary. For example,the point man class can only use pistols. That is, no SMGs(!) It seems the reason is because the pointman has to be fast. But come on, not even a small SMG? And the speed brings me to another point:\n\nYour 'troopers' walk at different speeds depending on their class and loadout. This makes sense, but it causes trouble; if you want to keep some formation while moving you will often find some of your troopers either running ahead of the others or lagging behind. According to the loading screen tips your troopers can shoot over each other's heads when in tight formation, but there's no way to know if you've achieved that. The speed difference / lack of proper formation also messes up timing.\n\nSynchronizing actions is a real hassle. You get four (4) 'go codes' which can be used for synchronizing actions. This is not enough! For example, if you want to stack up at a corner, throw a flashbang around it and then have your stack move out you will have to use two go codes: One for stacking up before your pointman throws the flashbang, and another to keep the rest of your stack moving out before the flashbang has been deployed.\n\nThe planning editor is quite horrible. It's easy to make mistakes, and making changes is difficult or even impossible forcing you to delete potentially large parts of your plan.\n\nLastly, I *really* hate when your troopers say "no tangos". It's too easy to misinterpret as "tangos"!! It's quite minor, but it's been driving me crazy.","March 28","false","16.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It felt like I was just shoving my team members straight into a meat grinder the entire time and I found it nearly impossible to complete any of the campaigns. There are some serious balancing issues, the game seems to feel and react as if the player is supposed to be a master tactician; every mission feels like you need to play through it until you're sick of it, and then some. I memorized several of the single mission maps just in order to beat them and properly plan everything out.

The gameplay itself boils down to mastering a room clearing technique, and once you figure this out, the game becomes very simple. Not much variety in the inventory, and frankly, once you unlock the Assault class, you have everything you need to beat the game outright. The RPG elements that are introduced are very shallow and don't really differentiate your squad members. The various roles in the squad are pretty superfluous, and at later stages, Assault is the only really valuable role you can take. Cover system is very mediocre, with your troops more or less being a gun that you point with your mouse. No dynamic AI, no functional cover shooting. What you have is a game that consists of everything that made the old Rainbow Six games good, but without the same polish that made them fun. Fun diversion for a few hours, but not an 8/10 game.","August 26, 2015","false","12.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

Either way, I will take it. These guys deserve every penny.\nOne of the only truly great games to go through early access AND it actually made it to a full release AND it is still supported by the devs now.\nVery easy to just start playing, it's one of those games that is pretty easy to learn, but difficult to master, especially as the maps go on and get bigger and the enemy get smarter and much much tougher.\nWorkshop support is nice, and there are some truly stunning mods out there, such as the highly rated sound mod that adds almost 100% realistic weapon sounds to every gun in the game, or the many many weapon packs out there that add great weapons from P-90 SMG's to the aliens pulse rifle (ridiculously overpowered, but still good fun).\nThe progression system works nicely, the skill tree is good (although a little small), adding some nice "abilities" to your troopers, such as knowing how to use cover better, better aim with pistols or whatever, using double-tap to make sure enemy are put down quickly. All work nicely to bring your officers in line with the rising difficulty as you get to the tougher maps later on.\nI seriously can't recommend this game enough. Whether you want to plan as you go, pausing every few seconds, or you want to just go it in real time, dragging the path for your troopers and watching them follow as you go, or you (like me) want to plan everything from the beginning, hit the go button and watch your troopers die quickly :)\nThe game allows any one of these methods, or a mix of all at once, planning a mission from start, then pausing and starting a new plan in the middle (because things start to go sideways), and then just keeping it going in real time, moving your troopers around the map to pick off any stragglers and/or moving any hostages to safety that you couldn't see whilst you were originally planning the assault.\nThe game is great, does exactly what it says on the tin, and does it pretty much perfectly in every way.\nWorth every penny, and the devs definitely deserve their cash, 100%","December 3, 2014","true","43.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Gameplay mechanics are good, and the controls are very simple. They can be picked up very quickly without any kind of tutorial. This is fortunate, since the game does little to explain itself other than a few hints on the controls in the opening missions, and a "How To" that says the same information. Unfortunately, any further explanations of game mechanics, controls, or progression are completely missing. For what is a relatively simple game, this shouldn't have been an issue. However, after having to constantly minimize the game to try and search for answers to simple gameplay mechanics, it become frustrating for something that should otherwise be a quick game to play.\n\nAlthough this game doesn't do anything revolutionary, it is solid. If it had more polish, I would most likely recommend it, but there are too many small problems to justify what should be an easy-to-play game.\n\nThanks for reading.","October 23, 2014","false","13.1"," 27 of 130 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","27","130","0","16"

I love devising new strategies for maps, and the ability to change you orders rapidly and easily on the fly is what makes the game special.

Very enjoyable. Some minor problems with planning (editing/removing waypoints, synchronising some stuff like "do that when flashbang has exploded" is impossible, you have to manually put go codes.), maybe it's not bugs and just me misusing it, but then again it might mean it's not very intuitive.\nAll in all a great game, highly recommandable if you like rainbow six or swat for the tactical side, and not the action side.","January 31, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here you have to plan ahead and every room you clear matters. One unexpected event will often demand of you to re-think your strategy. This is NOT a game wher eyou plan, then hit "execute" and forget about the whole thing. Far from what it may seem from screenshots or short videos, this is a thinking man's game.\n\nAnother good part of it is that there's more replayability than meets the eye. The same scenario will vary from one playthrough to the next. You may encounter different number of foes, in diffrent places, with different behaviour, armament and patrol patterns than you seen in your last playthrough of a given scenario. There are a lot of scenarios on tp of it all.\n\nThere is also an RPG-style mechanic - your SWAT agents will rise in skill after participating in missions, you will also get access to more armor types, weapon and doctrines as you complete more missions. Doctrines act much as passive bonuses in mmorpgs. This works pretty well, although it is primarily a tactical game and the rpg elements are not as deep as in complex mmos.\n\nOnly two downsides I can think of are two elements from the SWAT games taht I miss here - there's no tear gas and there's little in the way of opponent morale - 99% of foes will fight to the death and not surrender.","December 30, 2014","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very enjoyable.

Door Kickers has very rich components, from its music to its tactics. The music is extremely atmospheric, making it feel like Payday 2, except you're the tactical advisor. The tactics are extremely rich, giving you so much space to establish the best path and tactic to get the mission done. And you have a lot of customization for the SWAT Officers on your team, whether he/she would be a pointman or breacher, wielding a shotgun or rifle.\n\nThe client is also very smooth and slick, allowing for uninterrupted and smooth gameplay. And with randomly generated doors to kickdown, the game is endless and can be educational. Making sure your officers never forget to check their corners and always stop before entering a room when your fellow officer hasn't caught up with you. This is a very realistic tactical simulator and is an essential game to stratagy lovers.","January 7, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've always enjoyed the planning of tactical operations.

Only had a small discount in the Summer Sale, but got it anyway. So glad I did.\n\nMassively addictive game and has that "one more go" feel. Just playing through the single missions trying to 3 star them all. Has that X-com trait of being protective of your leveled up guys.\n\nOnly criticism so far is that the guns seem too similar. There are 7 or 8 hand guns and the best one is easy to unlock so its pointless to even bother with the ones in between. The better Assault rifles have a better leveling up/unlocking range.\n\nDon't normally bother with game editors, but going to try on this - seems easy to use from the little play I had.\n\n","June 23, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a wide selection of weapons to choose from and there will be squad progression with promotions, etc. It's great now and it will be even better when all the features are implemented.\n\n----------------------------\n\nPost release UPDATE: The game is now better than ever.

On a bonus note - my computer science master's thesis was about CQB AI and squad tactics - but it was waaaay less complicated and thorough. If Door Kickers were around at that time I would probably be failed for a lame project ;) Keep up the good work guys!","January 9, 2014","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of the first Rainbow 6 game back in the late 90's but from a top down view. I played the heck out of that game back in the day. There is some great nostalgic feelings for me when I boot this one up. It's great to see the continued project like development as part of early access. If you liked the old Rainbow 6 or Ghost Recon games but always wanted to see your dudes from above in a strategic environment, this is the one for you.","November 25, 2013","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has 80!!! stand alone missions to practice with your squads. The game has a lot of awesome content. The interface is user friendly and doesn't take long to learn. While the game is paused you can give orders to your officers and design a route for them to follow.  You can play the game in real time too if you like to live dangerous. The squad members are kept on a roster and they sort of grow on you. I love this game.","March 28, 2015","true","59.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
