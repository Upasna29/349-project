It is a Alpha game so I did not expect something long and complex. I would say it is a very interesting puzzle platformer. If it had more content, which it will hopefully have upon its full release. I would also say that it might come close to Antichamber and Portal.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzle solving is really intuitive (Okay maybe that is just because I do know how to programm). In the tutorial section you were pretty much just guided through the levels because you didn't have all the commands available so it was pretty easy but I can see it getting really interesting when you actually have all commands at your fingertips.\n\nThe soundtrack is okay. It is nothing special but it is not bad either. Just somewhere inbetween.\n\nThe Movement is okayish but I would say it needs a litle bit more work because jumping doesn't feel right. But I can't really put my finger on why it doesn't feel right.\n\nI think a great addition would be workshop support and a level editor because if a game like this has these features it will never get old because there is always new stuff to download or to creat. I also think maybe creating your own more complex commands would be great but so far I think the game has all necessary commands you need to have fun with it.\n\nI suggest you buy it now to support the devs so we can get more features. I will also EDIT this review when the final Product is released.\n\nEdit 1: Jumping now feels good and not clunky anymore.","April 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","67","77","0","6"

Sick of "Press (x) to hack"? Then Glitchspace is for you! This game is one of the few in gaming that gets "hacking" in video games right. Rather than dumb down the experience to the point where you don't have to be concious to play, Glitchspace takes hacking to a whole new level. With an intuitive Node-based system, you can connect constants to mathematic expressions, multiply vectors together, or transform an object, all with the ease of a mouse drag.\n\nThe BadThere's just not enough of it! After one hour of playing, I had beaten the game, and was left yearning for more. Given the early-access state of the game, and the number of levels there are, I would suggest waiting until the game comes out with more levels and more functionality. If you just can't wait, I suggest buying it on sale.\n\nThe UglyThe game is graphically simplistic, but very interesting none the less. The random "glitching" of the hackable blocks can be distracting at times, but otherwise the game is very pleasing, both visually and auditorily.\n\nIn conclusion, I do recommend this game, but would like either more levels, or Steam Workshop level editing capabilities.","November 2, 2014","true","1.2"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","26","27","3","1"

The game is pretty good at providing visual cues to guide you, both when solving puzzles as well as when navigating through the game world.\n\nThe puzzles grow in difficulty and complexity as you progress. Usually the level design and available tools are a good hint for what the solution would be, but it is fairly forgiving when you make a mistake. Trial & error is actually the way you will probably learn a few things, as you will have to think outside of the box for at least a few of the puzzles.\n\nI bought the game in early access, but also got a review key just before launch to make a YouTube video to show some of the game. If you are on the fence about buying the game, have a look to see if you get a better idea what the game is all about:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BR6AzpO8N4w\n","May 5","true","3.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I got the game from a friend, redeemed it on the now dead Desura, and had a lot of fun. After that, Glitchspace got on Steam and I decided to give it some time to become a proper game. And here we are.\n\nGlitchspace is actually a pretty good idea. I actually love the art style and the game looks a thousand times better than before. It saddens me to say that the game didn't change much in terms of difficult compared to when I played it years ago.\n\nThe game is fun at first, but it is extremely simple and easy. There are no mind-bending puzzles, and that makes the whole campaign play like a chore. For the entire time you will wait for it to give you something mind-bending, but it just keeps delivering more and more easy puzzles until it's over.\n\nGlitchspace is not bad per se, but it unfortunately didn't deliver the entire potential behind the gameplay.\nIf you aren't particularly good at puzzles, I'm sure you'll find a nice game here. For the more seasoned veterans, Glitchspace will play like a children's logic book.\n\nThat said, there are lots of fun waiting for you in the sandbox mode, however if you are looking for a good campaign of hand-crafted puzzles, you'll not find it here. Go after The Talos Principle, The Witness and Infinifactory. These are the games that will give you that good feeling of solving a difficult puzzle. Glitchspace unfortunately holds your hand a bit too much, to the point you will know the solution just by looking at the puzzle.

It took me around 4 hours to complete story mode; however, take that with a grain of salt, I'm a CS student and I was frsutrated by some of the earlier levls and how the game tried to limit some of what you could do. I'd much prefered more freedom but harder challenges. It sucked to have to solve a certain puzzle through only a single veiw point. Also the game itself is definitely buggy, like in some of the earlier levels I broke stuff and had to restart, and multiple times I would get stuck in an infinite falling loop because it kept respawning me not on an actual plane so that's kind of annoying. Also it's somewhat frsutrating because their character controller is clearly capsule shaped, making balancing on skinnier surfaces annoying as you tend to slide off. But I loved the last 5-6 levels so much, I was laughing and smiling as I raced through puzzles and really loved that. So I'd love to see a longer more complex story/challenge mode and perhaps more bug fixes, so keep that in mind and try to be patient with the game.

It's essentially a puzzle platformer where the primary puzzle mechanic is working with programming logic. Need an elevator? Turn the block in front of you into one! Need a bridge? Program your gun to stretch blocks and make one.\n\nSurprisingly addictive and the programming is presented  in a way that I think even non-programmers will be able to understand. The complexity of the problems -- and therefore difficulty -- gradually ramps up.\n\nCan't wait to see how this one progresses, but it's very much worth picking up now.","June 20, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s all about maths or something, you have to make sure numbers add up or whatever, I don’t know. I’ve never needed programming before in my life, so I leave it alone.\nBut then this game comes along, it calls itself Glitchspace and it’s all about programming, so normally I’d just ignore it, especially since it isn’t even finished yet. But I don’t ignore it, why? Because it’s made by the developers of (the rather brilliant) 9.03m, because it’s different, hell, I don’t know, but for whatever reason I buy this game. This programming game, Glitchspace.\nOh man, you really have to play it. Maybe you’re intrigued by this whole ‘programming’ malarkey, maybe you don’t really care, you just have to play it. See, this isn’t the boring kind of programming, the kind where you have to make sure everything adds up and doesn’t explode or whatever (although the exploding sounds quite exciting), this is programming as a puzzle. A ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle man, I can tell you’re going to love it.\nYou like puzzles, right? Sure you do, everyone likes puzzles. Puzzles are hard, you have to think, have to use your BRAIN. Sometimes you get stuck and it’s a pain in the ♥♥♥, I know the feeling. But then it just clicks, and it’s insanely satisfying. Puzzles are the most advanced form of ego massage, and I love them for it.\nSo programming becomes this puzzle, this giant ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle you have to solve. You’re in this 3D world, it’s like a 3D platformer you see. But anyway, to go on you have to programme the walls and floor and ♥♥♥♥ to make you jump super high or not get in your way or move forward and stuff. The point is you do this through programming, that’s right – the boring friendless programming that I kept my distance from all this time. But it isn’t boring, that’s the point. It’s challenging, it’s complicated, it’s satisfying. It really, really is.\nOh man, this game. This ♥♥♥♥ing game. It made me renew my relationship (or lack thereof) with programming. It made me think. It made me feel clever. That’s it, this is a game that makes you feel clever, in my case by making me clever (or more so than before). Oh man, this game. I really can’t wait for the full game to release. I’m going to do so much ♥♥♥♥ing programming, and I can’t wait.","June 1, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There isn't really any story, except for the fact that you're some kind of square robot with a glitchy gun working your way through the glitchspace, by modifying red squares to do your bidding with all sorts of programming-inspired features to do so, and I found myself wanting to play more because it's an addictive puzzler that even includes a little parkour.

You can basically edit red blocks to translate, rotate and whatever the other ones are (reflection or something). BUT this game is still in Early Access so it is very short, but whats there is amazing. There is a story mode, where you need to complete tasks with a small amount of blocks, and sandbox, which turns out to be a massive track of blocks where your free to use any coding. The gun therefore comes into play where you can repeat the same code on different blocks. It is a shame though that the gun cant be used YET, I hope, in sandbox mode.\n\nApparently you can use the Oculus Rift or whatever other VR stuff is out there with this, which you wouldn't expect it with this type of game. Nonetheless, if it uses Oculus, it must be amazing.\n\nFor whats there are the moment, its absolutely amazing and is super cheap for an Early Access game. On the other hand, it is really short since I completed it in maybe under 10 mins, having already familiarized myself with the mechanics a few months earlier. Hopefully the game will be receiving updates for new levels very soon.","April 14, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The plain untextured environment is okay, not exciting but not distracting. Nice ambient music that also isn't distracting.\n\nThe game's featured mechanic, the ability to edit and "program" different platforms and obstacles is pretty neat, but it feels like a lot more could have been done with it. It would have been interesting if there were more things to interact with, like robots with editable behaviour, or trigger type objects that could be loaded with their own configurations like the gun. The whole "Story mode" is more like a tutorial for Sandbox mode, which is unlocked at the end.\n\nThat being said, I'm not disappointed. It's very enjoyable, though the main story is short. Still in early access, I'm looking forward to what might be included in the future!\n\nUPDATE: One little nitpick; the sandbox mode does seem oddly restrictive. It includes many cube platforms that either have their settings locked or simply don't include all of the possible functions. What's the point of having moving platforms if you can't invert some of their movement patterns with a simple negative function?

Hopefully, it will be improved upon in development to become longer and more challenging. As it is currently, it seems to be a simple (but effective) introduction to the various mechanics offered by the game.\n\nWith the lack of content aside, most of this game's potential can be found in the sandbox mode. Upon first entering it, one would notice that they have unrestricted access to all of the programming elements seen in the story mode. They would also notice that they have unrestricted access to many more that were not present in the story mode. These include more complex mathematical and logical functions, as well as more objects (like the player) and object properties.\n\nThere's no actual goal to the sandbox mode, of course. There is, however, much more to do. What's fun is setting a goal that's advanced enough that you'll be wrangling with the restrictions of the visual programming system. That's where it becomes a game. It's like more conventional programming, but the lesser amount of functionality forces you to think and create your own loopholes and systems to achieve your custom goals. That's not to say that the game's systems are severely limited. There's certainly enough functionality for it to be enjoyable and clear.\n\nIf what you're looking for here is a logical puzzle game, you'll have to be prepared to get involved in your own arbitrary goals or wait for more content to be added to the story mode.\n\nEDIT: It's worth mentioning that, as of writing this, Space Budgie continue to update and improve the game.

I feel like a few more features are necessary before it's really something that would be worth buying. Not to say that I didn't enjoy playing it, but with how it is the amount of time I got out of it was less than an hour, probably 45 minutes at best (wasn't keeping track, so not sure). It is in early alpha, of course, so that's to be expected, but I reccommend just following the progress of development at least until a code-saving ability, functions feature, and additional levels are added. (When this happens, I'll make sure to update my review.)\n\nThat said, I absoutely love the ideas, mechanics, and overall design of this game. The visual programming mechanic is great (although it could use some tweaks, mainly the addition of a function feature I mentioned a moment ago), and the puzzles you have so far are fantastic (although, again, more incompleteness; there could be some much more interesting challenges)\n\nThe one big complaint I have that doesn't necessarily relate to its being in alpha is the coloring of the game. More specifically, the very bright grey color that the non-programmable objects are. It starts to hurt my eyes after a while, and in some cases it can be very difficult to see where I'm going (especially in small gaps between them; I often fall through because I don't notice the gaps are even there). I get that you're going for a minimalistic style, but I feel like some sort of texture needs to be applied to it so I can SEE them.","January 2, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core mechanic allows you to manipulate objects in the game using rudimentary programming functions and logic. This is primarily utilized in various platforming puzzles, requiring you to move objects into favorable positions, make objects apply force to launch the player, etc. The game presents a good progression of complexity and does a good job of both teaching and challenging the player. Some of the puzzles required very topsy turvy thinking. Overall it's a very creative and interesting puzzle experience.\n\nThe most obvious complaint for this game is that it is a bit short. The "story" mode is only about three hours long, and unfortunately feels like it ends just as it's starting to get devilishly complex. Additionally I encountered a few physics glitches which messed up my attempted solutions for puzzles a few times, but I would imagine most of these will be fixed in future patches.\n\nOverall a fun, creative, if somewhat short puzzle game.
