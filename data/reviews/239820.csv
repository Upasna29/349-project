I started off on my second full playthrough of the game having some knowledge of how to play it already. However, this time I was doing something different. I named my company "Activision" and set out to reinvent the First Person Shooter, starting with Call of Duty but not going overboard with it. Call of Duty was a great success with reviews and sold millions of copies! I made a few sequels and once I had enough cash and enough skilled employees, I decided Call of Duty had outlived its usefullnes and decided to stop making sequels. I was now ready to reinvent the shooter, it was going to be a cyberpunk adventure FPS with a focus on story and characters. The idea was great in my head and we even spent millions on a new engine for the game to really shine. I pressed the "Finish Game" button and was expecting 9's and 10's. What I got was nothing of the sort. My heart sunk when I saw the 3's and 4's saying that "Cyberpunk" and "FPS" don't mix well and was even more nervous when I saw the low sales numbers. We were nearly bankrupt damn it! That engine alone cost us  millions and the game took a huge amount of money to develop! I paused the game and sat there, thinking what we could do to save "Activision". I then looked at my game history. We had a few games that sold alright but nothing that sold as well as "Call of Duty" that's when I did the unspeakable. I clicked the "Make Sequel" button and made yet another "Call of Duty" game. I felt sick as the reviews came in with 8's and 9's, saving the company and making millions, but stomping on our morals and values. The entire reason I made the company was to avoid such a thing, when in the end I had become what I had set out to destroy!\n\n10/10 for realism","October 20, 2014","true","23.8"," 1,716 of 1,771 people (97%) found this review helpful 613 people found this review funny","97","716","1","613","29"

While many gamers think they understand the tremendous amounts of skill, passion and balance required to make a great game, one trip to a message board usually exposes how little some of them understand about the process and challenges of game development. Greenheart Games has delivered a simulation that illustrates just how many compromises are made in the developmental process by emphasizing the budgets and time constraints that most titles are developed under and just how disastrous it can be to misappropriate time to features that are not central to the type of game that is being developed. Game Dev Tycoon comes together to form an accessible but insightful view of game development.\n\nLike any entrepreneurial endeavor, it all starts with giving your budding studio a name before setting up shop in your garage and plugging away at your keyboard. Aside from providing a facsimile of running a studio, Game Dev Tycoon is also a bit of a history lesson with the in game timeline chronicling the release of fictitious consoles that are based on the real life machines that many of us gamers grew up on. The demographics an traits of these platforms is represented as accurately as possible, meaning that a family friendly casual game might be best suited for a mobile platform while an intricate simulation will probably have the most success on the PC. Likewise, pairing an appropriate theme to your game's genre will yield the best sales and reviews. Developing a medically themed action game is a great way to go belly up. In this way, Game Dev Tycoon isn't interested in giving players the freedom to create eccentric titles that carve out their own niches, so developing your own Katamari Damacy or Mr. Mosquito is not a dream that this game is meant to help players fulfill. It's about business—moderating costs and selling as many copies as humanly possible. To do so, you can hire and fire staff, develop your own digital distribution platform, choose appropriate marketing campaigns and research new features and technologies that will earn new fans.\n\nDeveloping a game in Game Dev Tycoon is somewhat reminiscent of playing Civilization, each member of your team has a Design rating and a technology rating. Each area of game development falls into these categories. Programming AI is all about technical experience while graphics are about design. As your game goes through each stage of development, your team will generate tech and design points and how many they generate depends on their rating in each category. The higher their rating, the faster they will produce these points. Balancing your point output to meet the needs of your game is imperative and team members can be trained to bolster their tech or design rating. The more experience a team member has the higher their level will be which also means that they earn a larger paycheck. Having six level ten developers working for you may sound like a recipe for success until your operating costs dig deeply into your profits. Fortunately you can hire and fire employees at any time. To manage costs.\n\nCosts also mount when researching and developing new technology. Technologies can then be implemented into your studio's in house game engines. Keeping up with the tech curve and developing proprietary game engines keeps your studio on the cutting edge and can help generate sales. Bear in mind that the costs of new tech are not limited to implementing them into a game engine—each title you develop utilizing  special technology costs extra so spending the money to integrate surround sound into your latest text based adventure is ill advised.\n\nRounding out the fantasy of running your own development studio are PR and marketing opportunities. As your studio grows, the press will want to know about your latest products and your answers to their questions can earn additional fans and sales. Exercising unrestrained bravado and overhyping your games can earn your studio a Peter Molyneux sized ♥♥♥♥♥ slap, loosing fans and hampering your sales. Having a rabid fan base ensures a certain degree of success since loyal fans will line up to buy your newest project—even if it's titled Grass Growing Simulator or Guitar Hero: Nickleback. Also integral to the PR song and dance is having your own booth at industry trade shows. Having a booth requires a chunk of cash but with enough exposure, your studio can earn additional fans and prestige making it worth investing in. Investing in a marketing campaign will also boost sales potential but timing is key if you want to get the most out of your marketing dollar.\n\nWhile Game Dev Tycoon integrates almost every major element involved in bringing a game to market it does have a few faults. The largest of which is the lack of randomization. The proceedings are rather predictable, so don't expect any calamities to come along and shake things up. Your staff is always compliment and unlike real life they don't seem interested in seeking newer more lucrative opportunities, you never run into major development snags or delays that would force your studio to cancel a title. Combine this with the fact that running out of money simply means having to take a loan out from the bank and you have a sim experience that is far more forgiving than most. The genre and theme combinations never change nor do the demographics for genres and platforms so once you have discovered a few successful formulas in one playthrough, they will certainly work in an additional playthrough. All this comes together to make Game Dev Tycoon far less repayable than other titles in the genre.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon is an enjoyable game that offers a bit of insight to the process of creating games and it even gives younger players a bit of history about gaming. It's clean and colorful visuals keep the mood light and it's mechanics make it far more accessible than other simulations games. The downside is it's predictability and lack of variation make it difficult to come back to after a dozen or two hours have gone into it. While it's price is set appropriately, fans of other simulators may be left wanting.","April 30, 2014","true","14.6"," 369 of 415 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","369","415","0","3"

The efforts to console her were as pointless as our failing relationship.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. We grew up together, her and I. We learned so much from eachother, I can't even imagine being the person I am today without her. All the while, my cowardice refused to show how I'd felt deep down. The dread of knowing what we had wasn't going to last forever never showed its twisted skeletal frame during the time we spent together.\n\nIn the interest of moving this review along I should say that the early days were coming to an abrupt end the night she caught me playing Game Dev Tycoon. It was a slow summer day at the office and I did some reading on the game. I was blown away by the brilliance of the developers who allegedly snuck in a bug in the leaked pirated version that made it impossible for your game company to succeed due to piracy. Irony deserves my money just as much as I do, so I made the purchase.\n\nThat night I came home and sat down with her. She suggested I continue Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I told her I'm not in the mood. She then pleaded, what about Bioshock Infinite? You've only put 2 hours in to it! No thanks, kinda really want to try this new game, Game Dev Tycoon. I've heard good things about it. It took minutes to finish the download and needed no update; she gave me the that's it? look. Ignoring her slights against the game's file size and dismissing her huffs against it not even warming up the AMD Radeon 7850, I continued to enjoy managing my way to become the next Valve. Figuring out the best game combinations and platforms is surpisingly addictive. The changes in the hardware industry brought back so many fond memories of the everlasting GameBoy and the all-too-brief Dreamcast eras. Hours later, f.lux triggered, my screen shifts to softer colors and that's when I realized what had happened. I was enjoying a casual game. That's the moment I knew her beautiful core i7 powered brain would never look at me the same way again.\n\nI tried not to cry. I cried alot. Her 500GB SSD would never want this memory of me, so I formatted her shortly after in the hopes that at least one of us will forget what we had. Goodbye my sweet BitFenix Prodigy build 01, may you forever dream in code. Oh, that and I didn't want to activate Windows 8.1. That OS is complete sh!te and you should stay away from it.","January 28, 2014","true","26.7"," 1,011 of 1,216 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","011","1","3","35"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/recommended/239820/","Emperor60","Raptor Jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emperor60/","265 products in account","I enjoy this game so much. Whenever I'm bored, I just play this game over and over again. When I first bought this in May, I was lost at why I wasn't doing good and kept going backrupt. I then had to go to the wiki to write down and memorize the algorisms to do well; at the beginning it was a b***h, but later I got used to it. Then once the 1.4 update came out it added so much more to the game like multi-platforms, new consoles in the timeline (mBox One and Playsystem 4), and so much more! When they changed the algorisms which kinda disappointing but made more sense when you logically think topics and development phases through such as world design being more important in RPGs and not as much in causal games. However there's something about this game that makes me wanna keep playing, it makes me want to challenge myself and use different approaches to developing games.\n\nI believe the best part of this game is trial and error, the use of editing almost everything, and the replay value. I love greenheart games for the approach and philsophy they took towards this game. No microtransactions, no charging extra for the essential items that complete a game, just a straight 10 dollar game from developers that give you what you paid for. I highly recommend this game to anybody to at least try it. I'd give this game a 9.5/10. The reason for that is although I could play this game for hours on end, there are some realistic functions that this game is missing that I'd love to see. Such as company functions, combonations of different topics and genres, and ect. This game still has some work to do like all games; however, I can guarantee that you will find enjoyment in this game. Good Luck to Greenheart Games!! :)\n\nUpdate!: I have used mods recently, I recommend you DO NOT use them. The mods are currently in beta however they seem to just add consoles and far too many sports topics (Eg; tennis, ice hockey, hockey, unnecesary pointless topic that go under the catorgy "sports" for a reason). Feel free to try them to enhance your experience of the game. I just didn't enjoy it myself.\n\nUpdate (9/25/14): I waited until the steam workshop was added onto this game and I must say, the mods have made the game 5x better! You have from new topics, to pie charts, to making your own prices, to new consoles, and so many more! I now highly recommend them THROUGH THE WORKSHOP! I cannot say downloading them from the developer's website is the best solution, mainly because the workshop is optimised for the game and best for those with little to no mod knowledge. But I will say the mods have made this game, easily, one of my most favorite games and my choice for best modern tycoon game to date.","November 25, 2013","true","289.7"," 293 of 360 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","293","360","0","0"

See Conclusion\nNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)\n\nINTRODUCTION:The first game developed by Greenheart Games, Game Dev Tycoon is a Simulation game that, not just tries to mimic the events and hardships of game development studios, but also teaches the player a little bit of history on how our favorite pass time (or hobby) grew into this giant of an industry we see today.\n\nSTORY (No Spoilers):Game Dev Tycoon places you in the shoes of a start up developer who will be making games for the different gaming platforms. Starting from the early days of the PC and Govodore G64 (Commodore 64), the game will send you through history up until the Console wars of the MBox One (Xbox One) and the Playsystem 4 (Playstation 4). Make games, hire staff members, research new technologies and build yourself to be the most popular and successful Game Developer in the world.\n\nPROS:+ Very nice 'Fash' type Art Style and animation\n+ Surprisingly fun game mechanic\n+ Relaxing and pleasing sound effects and music but...(See CON #1)\n+ Great Re-playability\n+ Fairly accurate historical progression on the video game industry's history\n+ Good Value / Play time ratio\n+ Minimal system requirements\n+ Steam Cloud and Workshop Support\n+ Devs trolled pirates of their game (They uploaded a cracked version of their game that, if played, would backrupt the player's company ironically due to piracy.)\n+ Relatively cheap (at $10 or your regional equivalent) for its highly replayable game time\n\nCONS:- Could use more Soundtracks\n- Could use more randomized and recurring events\n- Limited Staff\n- Game Review is a bit lacking on information on why your game did well (or poorly)\n- A bit predictable if you followed the Game Industry's history since you can easily bet which platform would be most successful.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Easy to understand and easy to learn but very difficult to master. It is a game that both Hardcore gamers and casual players can both enjoy.\n\nWORTH IT?For $10 (or your regional equivalent), the game is well worth its full price and should be a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Playing this game gives a great feeling of satisfaction as well as a bit of understanding why game developers make the decisions they do.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

You start in the 80’s and make your way up to modern times with new and innovative technologies.\n\n\nAs far as the story goes, Game Dev Tycoon kind of lacks one, but in this instance, thats a good thing. The gameplay is your custom character sitting in a desk making games and sometimes doing contract work. After you make a large sum of money from a large selling game, you move up to a more spacious office, instead of your garage. After time, you progress further, making new games, developing new game engine’s and making a name for your company.\n\n\n\nThe sound in the game is good overall, the music fits well. The sound of the research bubbles is oddly satisfying, but may get annoying over time. The graphics of the game aren't the best, but aren't needed for this sort of game.\n\n\nThe way the player makes a good game is based on complex math algorithms, but the player can check trends in the market, and experiment with different combos of game styles and genres in order to appeal to the masses\n\n\n\nGame Dev Tycoon does some things wrong\n\n\nThe lack of story after completion makes the game boring\n\nIt’s easy to go bankrupt from a few bad games in the first 3 areas\n\nSome employees early on are useless unless trained, costing a lot\n\nThe random events sometimes get in the way of game production\n\nThe game isn't always as realistic as it could be\n\nIts slow to start\n\nSometimes you start with bad gamestyles\n\nThe games achievements aren't very easy to most\n\n\nGame Dev Tycoon does a lot right too\n\n\nThe feeling of going through the years is satisfying\n\nThe ability to name your games and company\n\nIt’s a satisfying feeling getting a high score on a game\n\nThe game makes you want to keep playing\n\nThe researching is realistic\n\nThe game has playing cards and a steam workshop\n\n\nGame Dev Tycoon isn't the best tycoon game available, but i would argue that it is the best game dev game. Its an Indie casual game made to kill some hours, and that is just what it will do.

The idea is quite innovative since you are literally taking on the role of making games inside of a game itself. Not such an attempted idea as the infamous 'Superheroes fighting against Villans in a large city' where the hereos always win. Anyway, back to the game. As a developer you choose the name of the game, the audience, genre, topic, which staff member focuses on what part of the game (such as Jeffery does most of the Graphical work, Stephanie focuses on the Sound and so on) and basically allows for mass customization. Heck, you can develop a racing game without any DLC's and that focuses on actual gameplay instead of pretty graphics that you will look at for 2.3 seconds before crashing due to high speeds. Keep in mind, the game tries to take itself seriously, so a game that focuses too much on one thing, too little on another, will recieve lower ratings (four gaming reviewers will rate your game x/10.) and therefore less sales. As you get more cash and more staff, a larger studio will become mandatory unless you want a smaller but more trained workforce (yes, you can train every worker to be good at a particular subject, such as Technological workers and Designers) so less workers will be stressed out enough to need a vacation (bad for business, games are meant to be made at a gaming company). You can plan out a strategy for your workers if you want, I remember I used to be a researcher due to a high speed rating (speed levels can make your worker to research/train themselves faster and become more efficient) and let them create the games.\n\nGameplay\nQuite fun if you ever considered doing this as a job or a hobby. The game can be classed as educational in a way since now you know not to mix Racing with RPG or some other, terrible combination.  It's fun because it shows brings you on a journey of a once single developer living in his (parents') basement and how their hobby turned into a job, granting them a lot of cash, workforce and vice versa. You choose how it plays out, choose terrible combinations and take it as a joke; you will stay in the basement. Actually pick something innovative; you will succeed in game development. Other than having a moral, the game is still fun no matter if taken seriously or as a way of passing time by since you can accidentally create an AAA game by raising all the sliders to full priority and watching the crowd go crazy racing to the nearest Gamestop. Quite hilarious.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\nGreat fun\nMoral\nCheap\nRealistic situations\nDecide the story outcome\nQuite useful for future devs\n\nCons:\nHuD is quite huge and not very attractive\nTL;DR\nGreat game for a great price which is a great buy for a great deal of tips. Definitely worth considering on sale or buying the discusses sequel.\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

As I can't do this, I decided for negative.\n\nThe problem is: when I just mark this review as "positive", no one ever reads about negative remarks in this game. But currently there is barely any negative rating or posivite review with a "contra" that has more content than "I don't like this" (although there a quite a few funny ones ;) ).\nSo I write this to show people like me, who read negative comments first, that this is a good game in general. But still not 100% recommandable.\n\nAlso, after reading the wiki about the rating mechanic, I really thought about stopping to play. Unfortunately (?), I'm kind of a perfectionist, wanting to finish the game at least once...\n\n\n\nSimulator + PC = Great\nEveryone/Mature + PC = Great\nDesign: 100, Tech: 80\n\nThat's basically the main flaw of the game:\nThe Design/Tech Ratio. Design is great / Mechanics, for a sim, not!\n\n\n\n\nDesign:* Love the artwork, the productive bubbles and sound.\n* Also love all those somewhat ironic texts, scam mail ( I am nubian princess with lots of money for you :D ).\n* And fu**** love all those hidden references to lots of games and even movies (seriously, back into the future!)\n* Nice touch with moving from garage to office to bigger office and lots of things you can do.\n*And, of course, the relation to real world PC and Console over the past 30 years.\n\nAwesome, guys!\n\n\n\nTech:* Great Sound\n* Beautiful graphics.\n* Moving around feels a bit sluggish and menus not always responding, but that's still ok.\n\n\nAaannd here comes the big fat but (one "t" only):\nThe calculation of game scores.\n\n\n\n1) As you're the only company in this game, your scores are always calculated against your own.\n\nThis effectively means 2 things:\n- You need to improve your score from game to game. Not too fast, only steady improvements. So if you make some awesome RPG with great Tech/Design ration and then an potentially great Simulation - the latter needs to have a bit better Tech and Design values (according to ratio) than the previous game.\n- That leads to times where it is better not to make a huge jump in quality, as it then is harder to improve further. But instead to leave bugs in the game for decreasing it's rating, and making it easier for the following game topping the score again.\n\nThis is a really annoying part of the game in my opinion, as you cannot focus on good values and features, but might have to "sabotage" your efforts if you see the game might be "too" good.\nMaybe something regarding the engine features would've helped here (like a new game should not miss certain features games before from the same genre had )\n\n\n\n2) Tech/Design ratio mechanic\n\nNo matter how great your design or your tech is, you will get bad scores if the ratio is not perfect enough.\n\nIn general this makes kind of sense, as a simulation needs more tech focus than a casual game.\nBut let's see this: I make a 10/10/10 game with 100 tech and 160 design (like RPG). Then I make another RPG with 200 tech and 250 design afterwards. This will get worse ratings than the previous, as the ratio is not 1.6, but 1.2.\nSo lots of improvements, yet the game sucks. Ah-hah.\n\n\n2.5) This is especially annoying if you take the sliders into account, as the granular settings mean nothing (which maybe could've eased up the previous problem).\n\nAfter you make a lot of post-release game research, the game tells you how important one thing is for what kind of genre. Like Action games have a "+++" (very important) in sound, whereas RPG only have a "++" (for example, don't remember exact values right now).\nBut when developing a game which needs a ratio, let's say, 1.5 (more design than tech) and you have only a ratio of 1.0 in the end of the 2nd development phase...The sliders might tell you that you should put "++" in tech (e.g. sound) -> but when doing so, you will usually get an even worse ratio!\n\nIn the first playthrough I failed in the 2nd office, because after having a couple of successful games, where I adjusted the sliders to my general game knowledge, I used the slider recommendations (e.g. --- for nothing, +++ for full, ++ for half) and now the ratios were complete wrong.\nIn no tutorial or whatsoever I found the reason for my mediocre games.\n\n\nOnly after reading a couple of wiki pages about the ratio thingy I started to ignore the game recommendations and only adjusted the sliders depending on ratio I needed. Which is usually 100% for 2 of them and 0% for another (even if that 0% is according to game "+++" !)\nThat's it. Combine this with a couple of staff trainings after each great game and you're done.\n\n\n\n3) Sequels\n\nMaking a Sequel in nearly 1 Year after another brings BAD scores.\n(if it's around <1 year - did not measure exact amount of weeks).\n\nLike 1/1/1 BAD scores.\nUnless you use a major upgraded engine. Then you might get a 3-5.\nNot major upgrading the engine for a sequel in general is also bad, even if the previous game was made a couple of years ago.\n\nReally?\nEver heard of Call of Duty? Or Fifa? Or... ;)\n\n\n\nSummarum:\nGreat game!\nIf you like sim games, definitely get it.\n\nBut there is still room for improvement!\nTry a better tech/design ratio next time, Greenheart Games.\nAnd remember to upgrade the Engine and wait >1 Year or so ;)\n\n\n\nPPS:\nIf you're bankrupt some text similar to this appears:\n"Fortunately, Electronic Mass Productions has bought your studio.\nFans cry and bury their hopes."\n- Guess the reference :D\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE Dev Response 2016-01-26\nFirst, thank you for your comment.\nGlad to see that you care even about an older game here on Steam :)\n\n\nI believe you when you say you changed that behavior.\nWhich, however, confuses me somewhat: as I did play this game some time after the Steam release (and only installed it then), most of your tweaks should've been in there by then.\n\nWhen using said imbalances I found in the wiki, as outdated it might be, to my favor, I was:\n* able to consecutively get great game scores (>8 average) while not listening to (most of) the ingame +++/--- report evaluations\n* failing most of my games (<=5 avg), when listening to the evaluations -> common in the last dev phase, where the ratio gets fu.. mixed up.\n* feeling that, beside said sliders, most other things like engine features had diminishing influence\n* still having that first game after every 9,x hit which was 90% of the time way worse in game rating (esp. when not having a real perfect ratio). Best seen after a hit or having very high scores, for example, right after adding a good team member and/or lots of staff training in one go\n* seeing sequel mechanic somewhat lacking\n\nMaybe my wording in this review here was somewhat biased in the end after reading about everything. Too much time since then, can't really recall, sorry.\nStill the mechanics (and my "what the heck am I doing wrong?") at that time where the reason which lead me to even look into a wiki in the first place. So in the end my experience was still the described one:\nWhere I found the core tech/design mechanic to be too indistinctive about the seemingly huge possibilities of not only slider adjustments, but also team, engine etc. Thus making my game scores a total mess or, after reading and comparing my own game scores, very predictable.\n\n\nThat being said:\nYour are mostly right, that those problems are somewhat overstated for many players. Which is also the reason I still say that simulation fans should still try it. And I really hope your game (still) is a success.\nJust for some players like me, these issues are like an itch in the eye you just cannot ignore.","August 15, 2015","false","20.8"," 239 of 341 people (70%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","70","239","341","32","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/239820/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","There are a plethora of “Tycoon” games on the market.  The smartphone market is flooded with them, Steam has a ton, and there are new ones hitting the cheap deals stands at Walmart on a near constant basis.  Lemonade Stand Tycoon, Airline Tycoon I and II, Chocolate Tycoon, Zombie Tycoon, DinerTown Tycoon, Offshore Tycoon, Hotel Giant, four Prison Tycoon titles, and Zoo Tycoon doesn’t even begin to cover 1% of the Tycoon marketplace.  When Game Dev Tycoon hit the market, you can imagine that it didn’t even make it onto my radar because that genre is so saturated.  You can imagine my surprise when some of my friends simply couldn’t stop talking about it.  After more than a decade on this side of the fence, it was time to see how the other half lives – it was time to become a Game Developer.  Much to my surprise, it was time to review a Tycoon title.\n\nStarting off in a small garage all by yourself, Game Dev Tycoon casts you an aspiring game developer.  You’ll kick of your career like most indie devs – mere feet from boxes and your tarp-covered car.  Picking a name for your game, a topic, a genre, a platform, and an engine to power it are the building blocks for pushing a title out the door, at least in the beginning.  With humble beginnings you’ll only have a few topics to pick from – sports, medieval, military, and space, but a great many more are just waiting to be unlocked.  Similarly, genres are fairly limited in the beginning, giving you action, RPG, simulation, and strategy to start.  Much like the real thing, in the beginning there is only PC as a selectable platform because consoles and handhelds haven’t been ‘invented’ yet.  It’s nothing if not simple in the beginning.\n\nAfter nailing down the elements of your game you’ll work through the development process.  There are three phases to releasing a game.  In the first phase you’ll chose how to divide your time and resources between story, gameplay, and the engine. The sliders for all three can be drug all the way to the top, but this does extend the development time of your game dramatically.  When you are a one-man shop with very limited funds, this is a dangerous gamble.  The second stage of development asks you for the same decision on dialogues, level design, and AI, then stage three gives you the same thing for world design, graphics, and sound.  As your fingers dance away at the keyboard, your development bubbles up game points towards technology, research, and design.  It also bubbles up bugs – bugs that will cost additional time and money to fix…that is unless you turn a blind eye to them and hope your fans do the same.\n\nDuring development you can also add additional features.  The pool is pretty shallow to start, but like genres and topics, you can use research later to unlock many more.   These can be mono sound, 3D graphics, joystick or steering wheel support, and other bullets you might see on the back of a real-world game box.  When the game is finished and all the features are locked you can release it immediately, but you might want to think about fixing those bugs first.  The longer your game dev goes, the more points will bubble up towards all of the development areas.  When it’s said and done you’ll earn experience in all of the areas where you’ve focused, as well as personal experience for you as a developer.  Publishing the game brings the moment that all developers absolutely love, anticipate, and dread – reviews.  Shortly after completion you’ll get a stack of four reviews from a random slice of fake game reviewers.  They all come with a short blurb and a score from 1 to 10.  These scores have a direct impact on the sales that follow, so putting out a well-reviewed product becomes important quickly.  You’ll earn more fans with a great game, and build your fanbase with great releases.\n\nAs you develop you’ll also earn research points that you can spend on learning new topics and genres as well as new features for your basic engine.  New topics, multiplayer, online support, and much more can be attached to the engine, eventually transitioning it to a fully-3D system.  The best dev houses out there build their own engines though, and you’ve got an opportunity to do exactly that.  Building an engine is a costly proposition, both in terms of development time as well as researching and building features.  Adding stereo sound to your custom engine instead of just mono might not be all that expensive, but moving to a full orchestral soundtrack is a colossal undertaking.  Your engine won’t take you forward year after year though, so you’ll end up making several over the course of the game.  You can’t switch engines mid-development (Prey, Duke Nukem Forever, Anachronox, Too Human, etc – pay attention) so selecting the right features and sticking with it is your only choice.\nSitting around cashing the dwindling paychecks from your freshly-released game might be great, but when it dries up you’re gonna have a bad time.  Your game will only stay on the market a limited time, and audiences get awful upset when you release a sequel immediately (e.g. Left 4 Dead 2), so branching out gives you a slight bonus to your experience as well as a better reception with fans.  Spending research points means not spending time developing games, so you might find your cash beginning to dwindle. To help keep your shop afloat you can also take on contract work.   The contracts ask you to generate a certain amount of design and tech points in a specific timeframe.  Failure to hit your contract goals forces you to pay a penalty, so biting off only what you can chew is critical.  Given that new contracts only pop up every 6 months, you’ll have to use them wisely.\n\nPeople don’t want to work in your stinky, greasy garage.  To begin your development in earnest you’ll need to build a team – you can’t do everything yourself for long.  Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff and develop their skills as well.  At this stage you’ll have access to books and classes that help build up your design, speed, tech, or research skills, as will your staff.  Just like time developing an engine, it’s not being spent on building games, so balance is key.\n\nHiring talent isn’t cheap or easy, so advertising the job will cost you somewhere between 20k to 2 million.  Getting a good mix of specialists and generalists will help you create a team of world-class game developers, but balancing budgets and payroll against income starts to affect the types of games you make as well as development time.  Strategy really begins to kick in here. When you get to the point where you can start making Engine specialists, Level Design specialists, and other disciplines you’ll have to carefully plan to not tip the scales too far in any one direction.\n\nThe game industry is in a constant state of flux, and platform leaders have a chance of changing with the introduction of new devices.  Snarky plays on the real world give you things like the “Play System”, “Ninvento TES”, “G64”, and many more that I don’t want to spoil for you.  Developing on these platforms means paying a huge lump sum to the parent company before you can even start, so building a game on a new platform could be costly.  That said, if that’s where the market is, you’ll have to join the fight where it lies.\n\nWhen I finish some games I smile, nod, and then shelve them forever.  Once I completed Game Dev Tycoon I immediately fired it up for round 2. For the price of a cup of coffee you can pick this game up. Don’t be one of the 97% that pirated it.  Game Dev Tycoon is the one Tycoon title worth buying.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 30, 2014","true","48.4"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","68","82","6","2"

(Starting a new game might resolve this bug)\n- To me personally, the game feels lacking, don't get me wrong, it is amazing as it is, but I feel like it could have been  so much more.  What would be nice is maybe building your own OS, creating your own software and maybe have the game expand more on the consoles you get to make. I understand that this is a  game dev  tycoon but I see this game more as an amazing base for a computer industry tycoon and I really do hope that the devs do something and try to expand on this.\n- The Steam Workshop feels lacking, while there  is  a Steam Workshop, do not expect too much from it. Unless you want a more accurate translation to Chinese or Russian it might not be for you.\n\nTL;DR This is an amazing game and absolute worth however much money you happen to spend on it and will grant you many hours of enjoyable playtime and yet feels lacking in some areas.

The lack of a randomized console marketplace means that if you know anything about the game industry, you can just make X type of game on Y console at Z point in time and easily crush the marketplace, over and over and over.  And while that's fine for one playthrough, the whole thing plays out the same every single time you go again, meaning there's little to no replayability due to the predictable nature of the game.\n\nVisually it looks nice, audio-wise it works out well.  There are a few confusing gameplay elements, things like MMOs and how/when to release expansions aren't explained very well to the player (with some trial and error you can figure it out, but you might bankrupt yourself while you attempt to understand it), and sometimes it's hard to get a sense of what else is 'happening' in the industry as a whole, so you can't really respond to it.\n\nIf the game added random marketplace behaviors and simulated other companies alongside you(instead of just releasing X game at Y timestamp every time), it would be fantastic and very replayable.  As it stands, I can't recommend it for more than a cheap steam sale purchase.\n\nThough there are some mods available for this game that could potentially alleviate some of these issues, it would be better if the developer dealt with them themselves.  Unfortunately, they seem to be done updating the game and there are still some core design decisions here that are unfriendly towards repeat playthroughs.","December 7, 2013","false","9.5"," 437 of 682 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","437","682","5","19"

The goal is simple you begin to develop games and try to become more and more successful. Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff.\nAt the start, income will come mostly from contract work. Research which you gain during gameplay can be invested in unlocking new game topics, technology and leveling up the abilities of your staff. Development itself is divided into several stages.\nOnce you have decided a name, topic, genre, and console platform, the player is prompted with three screens of development factors. Each screen has a slider with three different elements, for example world design, sound and graphics. You can equalize all elements or focus on one.\nThe player can later buy licenses to create games for "Ninvento" and "Vega" consoles, new challenges are introduced in the form of managing a staff, dedicating money to researching new technology and following current market trends.\nThe game has a simple interface which makes it easy to jump in and play. Each run takes around 6-8 hours of gameplay. The game is very predictable, bet on history and you can not go wrong.\nThe graphics of Game Dev Tycoon are very basic and it is fairly a quiet game in terms of sound effects.\nGame Dev Tycoon feels like a polished and very absorbing online flash game. But I have to admit, it is an addictive little game that eats away your time.\nSo if you are looking for little game to spend your spare time you could try it with Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nSounds 3/10\nGraphics 4/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","August 22, 2014","true","7.6"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","41","47","0","0"

Game Dev Tycoon lets you replay the history of gaming by starting your own company in the 80's and start from nothing and become the most successful company in the video games industry.\n\nLike in any other business, you wanna reach the top in that industry, you wanna make a name for yourself that people will remember! But in order to achieve that, you have to start from scratch and from nothing. You start the game in the 80's, a time when the first PC's just came out and when the gaming industry was growing fast.\n\nThe Game\n\nGame Dev Tycoon lets you start your adventure as a company in a small garage office as the only employee of your new company. With a small budget of only 70k, you finally start the action and start creating your first video game.\n\nThe first step in developing your game is to pick a topic, a genre, a console to run in and of course, a catchy name that will attract the attention of gamers and game critics.\n\nWhen you are happy with what you picked, the 2nd part in developing your game is to choose a graphics engine for your future game. When you just start the game you can pick 1 out of 2 graphic engines. The simple text-based engine or the more complicated and advanced 2D engine. Later on you can research better versions of a 2D engine or a 3D engine.\n\nAfter being done with that, the more complex part comes. You are now creating the game itself, you will need to choose how much time to put in each part of the game. Let's say you are making a fantasy RPG game, in it you will want to spend more time on the dialogues and level design and less on the A.I. or if you are making an airplane simulation game then you will wanna spend more time on the engine and gameplay and less time on the story and quests.\n\nIn order to create a good game, you need to know where to focus on the right elements. This can be mastered by trying and failing. or by basic knowledge (e.g. gameplay/engine on a military action game).\n\nWhile developing your game you will see design and technology points starting to generate. These points will determine how good the game is on design and on the technology. To get a good game you will want this to have a balance and not too much on design or too little on technology.\n\nDuring development, you also generate research points, as I said before, research points are used to get new engines, new game topics, new things that will help your company and its games grow such as marketing and a target audience.\n\nAs you progresses in the game, new platforms will be released with their own target audience. Companies like Ninvento, Voony, and Mirconoft (A funny small spin-off for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft) will start releasing their first gaming consoles with each focusing on different audience types.\n\nAfter a few successful games, you will leave your garage and move into a small office building or your own company headquarters that will let you start expanding your business and increasing your games potential even more.\n\nWith this move, you will start making larger games, hiring employees and more opportunities to stand out in the crowd and finally start making that name of yours.\n\nHiring new staff is an important thing that has to be done; each employee will be different, each with his own skills in design, technology or a balance between the two. Training your staff will improve the chances of releasing larger and more complex games that will require more money and better employees.\n\nIf you don't have enough fans to create a large/AAA game (100k fans), you can use the help of a publisher who will grant you a small percentage of the total sales if you meet their requirements. If you fail to deliver the score for the game they asked for, you will have to pay a penalty.\n\nIn your first few times you should aim to create games that are not that much different so that you would know what staff you would need so that you don't buy employees that have too much design and not enough technology skills will make your game fail cause as I said before, to get a good score you need a balance between design and technology.\n\nAfter your game is completed you will get a review from 4 critiques. The review system is not that good and will not provide any in-depth information on why your game got that score. When you get the score, they don't dont tell you why you got that score or tell you what had a major impact on the score.\n\nEven if your game is bad, you can create some hype around it using marketing campaigns. The more money you invest in that campaign, the more impact it will have on sales. You can also attend the G3 (like E3) convention to promote your games and boost sales and make lots of hype around your company and the game you are working on.\n\nIf you need some extra cash or some research points you can accept a contract that you will need to complete within the time limit or you will need to pay the penalty like with a publisher contract.\n\nLater on in the game you can create your own research and development lab (R&D) that will grant you access to new projects like a digital distribution platform - Grid (like Steam), MMOs and even huge AAA titles.\n\nCreating your own hardware lab also has its advantages; you will be able to develop your own console and compete with other platforms and maybe even achieve the highest market share.\n\nThe graphics of the game are decent for this kind of game, they are not meant to impress you but more to give you an idea of how successful you are, what are your works doing, etc...\n\nThe sounds of the game are nice and are good for the background.\n\nThe game also now offers people to use Steam Workshop to share thier mods and download them through steam.\n\nWhile playing the game I have found no bugs at all.\n\nThe Good\n\n- Game Progression\nMoving on in the game, watching the video game inustry evolve is a lot of fun.\n- User Friendly\nThe game is simple and easy to learn, features a tutrial at start, the rest is easy.\n- Sounds and Graphics Serve the Game Well\nThe basic sounds and graphics of the game are more then enough for it.\n- Simple Gameplay\nNot really complicated and can be mastered by the average player.\n- Variety of Things to Research\nTopics, consoles, engine features, etc...\n- Easter Eggs\nConsole names, posters, etc...\n- Steam Workshop\nYep.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Repetitive (Steam Workshop helps with that to some, didnt help much to me)\nAfter a while, making a game is something you do by instincts and becomes too easy and simple.\n- Reviews for Your Games Are Not Detailed Enough\nYou get a score, you at least wanna know what for.\n- Not Much Place for Creativity\nIf you try and do what is not what people are use to like a simulation RPG about pirates you will fail.\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\nGame Dev Tycoon will take you back to the roots of the gaming industry and will let you start your company from scratch and get to the top. The game has a big selection of platforms and has a great game developing management and the "story" itself is good.\n\nThe game has a few easter eggs that would take you back to the old days or remind you of some cool games you probably use to play, sounds and graphics that serves the game well and simple and fun gameplay.\n\nOne thing that really bothered me was that a major thing in the game development is knowing how to improve your future games and yet the game fails to show you how to do so. It does offer you the option to write a game report but that wont tell you why you got that specific score.\n\nI highly recommend this game for any one who likes tycoon games or wants to just have a good time and open his mind to new games or be creative and make cool things such as engines, games and platforms.\n\n8.5/10 - Must Play","October 2, 2014","true","33.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","5"

You hite staff, They each have four stats that increase with experiacne nad training, speed, research, design, and technology.\n\nAfter you have you character and your staff good to go, you start making games, by choosing categorys, themes, genres, platforms and then deciding how to use your time developing graphics, gameplay, world design, etc.  Your research decides what you can make, so the more you research the broader and more complete games you can make. The default game runs your studio through 35 years of development, though the game has full mod support on the steam workshop, and has custom games.\n\nI recommend Game Dev Tycoon to indie fans, or anyone who thinks it may be interesting, its really not that bad.","October 20, 2015","true","9.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","32","38","3","1"

You might even call that game 'Xzibit's Exhibit'. Maybe.\n\nYou start as a lone game developer in your garage during the 80s, you work away making basic games and hoping they'll be successful. For legal reasons real life consoles and PCs names aren't used (however this is easily changed with mods), but the game does a good job of hinting at which 'console era' you're working in.\nIt even has loose story elements as it recreates historic console releases and events, so if you know your gaming history you might be able to plan around these accordingly.\n\nAs you progress through the game, and with each game you make you gain experience, which you can use to learn new aspects for your games as you create the 'perfect game engine' for your crazy creations. You might want to have a one-use-for-all Engine, or you might even create Genre Specific engines. However, you'll soon realise that time and resource management will become an issue the bigger you aim with your gaming projects.\nYou can choose a Topic and the sub genres within it - Sports RPG? Zombie Simulator? Then within that design process you choose where to allocate time and effort - gameplay? Sound? Level Design? What's more important to you?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201694098\n\nI do wish it went a little deeper, but what it does offer was good enough to spend 6+ hours in the '35 Year' Storyline playthough.\nIn short it's a fun game, and the fun comes from your imagination and sharing your creation with friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/239820/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Game Dev Tycoon, or GDT, is a video game about developing games. Game Dev Tycoon was developed by Greenheart Games and released in 2012.\n\nGDT is a very simple yet beautiful game. The game is user-friendly and it reinforces this by a clean UI that packs many features in a simplistic tone. For example, the menu button would have a research tab, a developing games tab, among others. These features would be packed in a list of sorts where a click to each individual tab brings up another small window. It allows for the player to quickly understand the various features without feeling there is too much.\n\nCreating a game is very nice and rewarding. The development of games is easy in that you have a few sliders and you produce a game to how you feel it would be best. For example, making a music game? Choose the music genre and move the various sliders to how you feel is best in getting a 10/10 on a game. The idea behind the sliders is that the more importance you have on a particular slider, ie. gameplay the more your employees and yourself focus on that aspect.\n\nHowever, the bigger picture in determining whether your game will be great is the list at the top of the menu that are bubbles. These bubbles mean four different things. One is bugs, the amount of bugs in the game you are making. Another is technology, how much your employees incorporate into the technology side of things in developing your game. Another is design, how much your employees incorporate into the design of the game like story, and research. Research allows the player to research more features to place into a game and to unlock new things throughout the game. But to summarise these four bubbles, they affect your game. You want the least amount of bugs and the most amount of design and technology points to ensure a better chance of getting a higher rated game. The best way to produce more is to train your employees. If you have not noticed it is a cycle that is easy to understand once you get into the game. So the gameplay is simple. In a short summary, you make games. You imprve your skills making games. You hire employees to help on games and you train them to accumulate more design and technology points, which garners you higher ratings for games.\n\nThe game is pretty limited. The features list is basic and has less depth than the newly-released Mad Games Tycoon. The You will get a good thirty years in game, which is a few hours, but there is essentially no late game. Just a full-on sandbox experience that has replayability, but not a ton. To use myself as a benchmark, I played about 40+ hours of GDT when it was released then purchased on Steam and stopped at eight hours. So for the price of $9.99, you will get value out of the game.\n\nOverall, the game is a really good game. The clean UI and simplicity of the game allows the user to enjoy playing the game instead of attempting to understand the game for several hours. The gameplay is a cycle and everything is rewarded from continously developing games to hiring employees and even making your own console. The gameplay is basic, which makes it fun and easy. At $9.99, I recommend the game. 8.5/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Ostensibly, this is a game along the lines of AeroBiz or Railroad Tycoon, where your job is to run a company and make lots of money, in this case by developing video games. It's got a cute, quirky aesthetic and some interesting pseudo-RPG elements, which is neat, but...\n\nWell, frankly, this game seems incredibly, frustratingly random.\n\nTo wit; I spent about an hour bankrupting my company by making what seemed like completely rational, reasonable choices for a game developer to make. Making text adventures for the PC seemed like a good idea, for example. But it turns out text adventures are a dead-end because you can't level up other areas, which cripples you long-term. It also seems to penalize actual CREATIVITY; for example, I can think of a half-dozen awesome ways to do a Wild West-themed strategy game using SNES-level tech. However, Wild West and Strategy, as far as this game is concerned, Do Not Go Together, so no matter how WELL I make the game, it will tank in reviews and sell nothing.\n\nFrustrated, I decided to look up guides of game/genre combos, and discovered that you pretty much have to make certain TYPES of games to have any chance of success.  So, I tried again, this time slavishly obeying the standards of what genre/theme combos were optimal, setting development resources to the 'perfect' levels... and my games still tanked and sold like crap. The algorithm for how a game reviews seems to have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the actual Design and Tech points; I've had games in the 20s for Design and Tech earn millions and games where they were both high-60s get scores of 4s and 3s, during the SAME YEAR.\n\nI feel like there's a significant difference between how the game ACTUALLY works and how the game TELLS YOU it works. Like, design and tech score obviously mean SOMETHING, but WHAT? There's no context for what '1 point of design' actually SIGNIFIES. And when you introduce the Hype Factor and the Review Scores, both of which are different numbers that are factored in different ways -it doesn't explain to you-, the result is a game where you're basically comparing three different types of numbers measured on three different scales which all clearly interact, but how that interaction actually occurs is completely opaque and arcane. Then you stack the game engine add-ons, none of which seem to ACTUALLY contribute much to overall finished product as much as 'not having this thing by this in-game year will tank your scores.' It doesn't feel like a game so much as a random number generator with pseudo-meaningful choices.\n\nI can't make sense of this game. I tried playing it blind, and I tried playing it with a guide, and both options resulted in roughly the same end-result. As much as I like the concept and aesthetic, I just can't really recommend it.","June 22, 2014","false","4.0"," 58 of 89 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","58","89","2","1"

If you like Tycoon games you will probably like this.\n\nLong Version-15 hours in and it still has my attention. For a non-action game that is something impressive. For me this game is perfect during long lectures on my school laptop. kept in windowed mode you can switch to another window easily and it pauses on its own when you do this. The sound is somewaht unnecissary for this game so it is fine to play muted. Small download with minor system requirements means that this game can be installed and run on just about any computer. The gameplay itself is engaging, with multiple genres and topics and consoles to work with there is allways new combinations to experiment with. the achievements are a mix of introductory awards, easter eggs that are rather witty and some downright challenging achievements associated with game sales. Although the game is rather inexpensive i personally waited until it was on sale to purchase, and i would probably suggest doing the same if you are on the fence about this sort of game. In all honesty i was not expecting to get as much enjoyment out of this game as i have and i can understand the hesitation about buying a game set in a seies of rooms with your avatar sitting at a desk pushing buttons while small decissions are made about what game to make. While action fans are going to be turned off by that the fans of tycoon games might be dissapointed by the lack of visual stimulation that could be gained in games like zoo and roller coaster tycoon. In the end this game serves an niche audiance but i suggest that anyone on the fence gives this a chance because it is more ingaging and fuffiling than words or the trailer can describe.\n\n8/10","March 26, 2014","true","24.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/239820/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:The first game developed by Greenheart Games, Game Dev Tycoon is a Simulation game that, not just tries to mimic the events and hardships of game development studios, but also teaches the player a little bit of history on how our favorite pass time (or hobby) grew into this giant of an industry we see today.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon places you in the shoes of a start up developer who will be making games for the different gaming platforms. Starting from the early days of the PC and Govodore G64 (Commodore 64), the game will send you through history up until the Console wars of the MBox One (Xbox One) and the Playsystem 4 (Playstation 4). Make games, hire staff members, research new technologies and build yourself to be the most popular and successful Game Developer in the world.\n\nPROS:+ (Surprisingly) Complex: -The game calculates different factors such as design decisions, time and resource allocations, technology, hardware trends, economic booms, staff expertise and experience and many more considerations, to which, in the end, will determine the overall quality of your game and overall reviews scores. Behind the flash like graphics is a complete mathematical number wars.\n\n+ Great Re-playability: -The player can do whatever he wants with his own studio by choosing which genre to specialize in, which platform to prefer, which game features to add. You will find yourself spending hours and hours trying to make the perfect game.\n\n+ Pleasing Art Style: -It has, what I like to call, Flash like art (Flash Animation style), the developers clearly gave a lot of effort into the art design while keeping it simple yet effective. All of the featured artwork and design is high-resolution that looks great at 1080p.\n\n+ Good Value / Play time ratio: -With a price tag of $9.99 (or your regional equivalent), this game is truly worth every cent. It gives dozens upon dozens of hours of game time. (see above on Re-playability)\n\nCONS:- Could use more Music: -The generic track given is nice but It would have been awesome if the music would change depending on the decade you are in OR have a radio with different tunes on it.\n\n- Could use more randomized and recurring events: -The game features in-game events but most of them occur only once. It would have done well if certain events like Piracy, Economic drops, or Copyright claims happen in a recurring fashion and accompanied by heavier penalties.\n\n- Limited Staff: -Yes you can hire your team members and yes they grow as you grow in both skill and specialization, however, the maximum team size in the actual development of the games is limited to 7 people, including yourself. The guys at the R&D and Hardware Lab does not count since they don't actually directly partake on the development of video games.\n\n- Game Review is a bit lacking: -After the player and the team makes a video game, it is subjected to review which would directly affect the sale. Unfortunately, the reviews only give a number rating without specifically pointing out what made a game "good" and what made the game "bad".\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and well worth the money. Playing this game gives a great feeling of satisfaction as well as a bit of understanding why game developers make the decisions they do. Easy to understand and easy to learn but very difficult to master. It is a game that both Hardcore gamers and casual players can both enjoy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The game mechanics are simple, yet not everything is clear from the beginning (sometimes that's good, sometimes not so much). It's not always that clear how a good game is made, I often have it that a "test title" is a huge success, while other titles I planned to become good flop.\nI once invested 70 Million in an AAA MMO, it totally flopped.

Create best selling games. Research new technologies and invent new game types. Become the leader of the market and gain worldwide fans.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon is a great casual game, and for the price I really can't complain. It's an indie endeavor, and while it doesn't achieve great technological marks it is very entertaining and will keep you occupied for hours (unless you pirated it! Shame!) as you progress through the different levels of the game. The mechanics can be a little obscure at first, but once you master managing your staff and achieving balance it becomes much easier to produce hits and dig into the deeper end-game level content.\nI could play this game for hours and days.

It expands on Game Dev Story overall, but not by very much, and not particularly well. The visuals are prettier, sure, but only if you look past the terrible interface. Oh, and as for the game development part - the in-game review system is so insane that you'd have to randomly lace cereal boxes with narcotics to get the same type effect in the real world. I agree that Game Dev Story wasn't really realistic in that department, either, but at least it had some logic to it - you were always getting better, so your games, naturally, were always getting better. I suppose I should applaud this Tycoon game for at least attempting to be more realistic, audience-wise, but it takes it to the point where you can't really understand how to reproduce good results. Seeing as I generally try to be successful at the games that I play, I found myself reading a multi-page printout from the web just to know how to configure the sliders correctly for a (hopefully) positive outcome. Multiple pages of tables with numbers, combinations, probabilities, all that nonsense, and yet, I can't say it made much of a difference. And at the end of the day, I have to believe that life can be better than that. Over time, just like Game Dev Story, Tycoon remembers good combinations and makes it easier for you to produce good results... but even so, why is it so complicated to produce even semi-consistent results? Perhaps there's just something in the cereal.","January 28, 2014","false","13.9"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","29","44","4","4"

From the post-console crash of the 80s to modern gaming scene, you run an indie game studio from your garage, aiming to become a world-renowned developer team.\n\nPros: You progress through different location, from your garage, to small office, to upgraded small office, to a larger office allowing expansions. Plenty of freedom in game type, select one (or later two) genre, a theme (from a huge amount), a target audience, a game engine (which you develop as you research new technologies and assemble new engines) and a platform (allowing multi-platform later in the game). You can hire additional staff members (while keeping a balance of design and technology), train them, and specialize them if the various fields you focus on through the various development stages. As you progress through the years, the game parodies events from actual gaming history, a nice wink to “old school” gamers.\n\nCons: The game is very, very simplified. There is no clear competition, no way to determine how much you concentrate on tech use (besides selecting whether or not you use them at all), no way to grow to a larger company (the likes of which, say EA did, from a small indie studio to one of the largest publishers). Topic/genre/target audience combinations are fixed no manner how good your game’s specs are (and I’m sure you can think of actual games that broke those conventions and were great successes). The difficulty grows with your success: hit a 10/10 game and make your life hell for the next few games until you develop better techs and train your team more, until you eventually peak and can’t continue without restarting a new game.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis is a fun and addictive game! Sure, there are games that dig in deeper into realism (such as GamersGoMakers), but if you just want a casual game you’ll play an hour or two (or more) at the time, give this one a try!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 13, 2014","true","104.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/239820/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","Game Dev Tycoon is a game that can be challenging at first, but is extremely satisfying once you get farther. When I started out, I really hated how all my games that I thought would be really cool came out with crappy reviews and awful sales. I didn't like that to the point where I decided to use guides on the internet to try and improve my games. I don't regret doing it, because I really hated playing the game without it, and it helped a lot.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it's really hard to get started. It takes a long time to get all the hints and then to know how to use them to the best, and I still haven't unlocked all of them after creating Game Reports after every game. I've still been continuing to use guides, and it's been improving the game for me.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is how random the game reviewing system still feels. Sometimes I will follow the hints and guides exactly (and since I'm using the hints too, it's not just the guide being wrong) and the game will still come out with a 6-7 review.\n\nI think it can be challenging to determine what I should be using my research points on, and even more so as I'm getting farther in the game and I need to start having specialists in certain areas. I know this is something you have to learn on your own, but this is a situation similar to getting the topic-genre-gaming device right where it's not worth the effort to look into, and it's a nice thing to know in advance.\n\nThe one thing in the game that has bothered me the most, however, is the lack of a reminder to name your game. My biggest issue for a really long time was forgetting to name my games, and I know you aren't reminded to do that because it affects the reviewing process, but I feel like if you got a little reminder to name a game it could go a long way. In my opinion, it doesn't even make sense to let a game called "Game #38" onto the market anyways, it doesn't sound like a game at all. The way I finally got myself to remember to name games is by being in a skype call with my friends and getting them to select from a bunch of options to develop my games, and then getting them to name it to make it more fun. Other than that, more than half my games have been unnamed.\n\nHowever, this game is still really fun. Where it does have it's downsides, there is still something that keeps me playing. One thing might simply be that I haven't completed the game yet, or that I want to get more achievements, but one of my favourite things is easily how satisfying it is to make a successful game.

First, you get to experience being the manager. Managing is really hard imo, but this game can be a motivation for some because it requires skill and hardwork in order to succeed in the game. Second, it enhances one's creativity. You get to choose genre and categories to create the game you want. You can even name it. Third, You get to see the evolving technology of the consoles starting from G64 and such. Lastly, you get to have millions of fans lol.\n\nWhat I didn't like in the game is that the last of the achievements. I have 31/33 achievements and the rest are based on luck.

You select games of different genres (action, adventure, RPG, ect), differnent topics (Sci-fi, fantasy, history ect) and then you empaphasize different elements of your game (graphics, gamplay, dialogue, ect).  Every game you make is given a review on a scale of 1 to 10. Depending on your choices your game can be a massive hit or a total failure. The object is to make good games by combining the right combination of genres, with good emphasis, and good timing. Right?\n\nUnfortuantely, no. The math is a bit complicated, but essentially the game is always comparing your to your highest score recieved for a previous game review. The game review score you get is based on a hidden score, and then compared to your highest previous hidden score. This make it possible to produce a very high quality game, get a great score, and then to produce a game that is very nearly as good for every game you make after and get poor score. The optimal way to play is NOT to maximize your score every time, but to start low, that is to intentionaly produce a bad or mediocre game, so you can easily and gradually impove on your scores as you go.\n\nIf you figure the system of bonuses out early and nail a couple of games it actually hurts you in the long run, making for a very confusing and counter intuitive experience. You can end up in scenarios where you intentionally sabatoge your game by releasing it with more bugs or by skewing your ratio, so that you don't accidentially create something much better than anything you have previously done. This turns the game into a confusing and tedious set of spreadsheet functions, instead of what it really ought to be; a game simulator that rewrads you for making good games.\n\nI really enjoyed Game Dev Tycoon in every other respect. Its clever, and well put together, and icrediably addicting. Unfortunately the underlying math of the game forces you to think along lines that are counter to what makes Game Dev fun in the first place. For that reason, instead of being an amazing buy, it is instead a bitter disapointment.","March 12","false","70.1"," 67 of 121 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","67","121","5","7"

It's cute to see the "PlaySystem" launch or to see the "Gameling" dominate mobile gaming for a long time, but putting a real-world analogue into the game is inviting meta analysis. I'd rather see random platforms and performance for an alternate universe feel.\n\n* Once you get into the groove, the game becomes exactly as much fun as Microsoft Excel.\n\n* The game tries to punish you for making the same game over and over, yet doesn't seem to encourage experimentation and risk-taking.

Although enjoyable for a while, there is not a lot of depth in the gameplay. You basically choose a combination of genres/topics/platforms for a game, researching and improving your skills along your journey to make more complex (and hopefully better rating) games. The better the ratings after release, the more money you get to grow your business. You will progress from your garage to corporate office and hire employees along the way. There are also a few other basic things you can do like training employees, research new tech, marketing & sign with publishers. Game Dev Tycoon uses some play-on-words to 'loosely' follow historical references to progress the game through release of new consoles and hardware to modern day.\n\nGaming combinations that might be popular in real life don't necessarily correspond to a good game in Game Dev Tycoon and there are also some strange ones you can choose. Mastering the game really come down to memorising what combos works (through trial & error) which starts to detract from the experience after you have played a few games. What you have learned in previous games can be kept for future games to help out.\n\nI was really hoping there would be more strategic depth and more varied tactics you could use to change the game outcome and wanted to be able to go all the way to an EA or Valve type of game dev. Regrettably, you can only have 6 employees and is not designed to be open ended with a fixed end point finalising your game. A game on making games is a great concept. Fulfilling many gamers fantasies of developing their own unique games, but this needs more content, more detail, much more customisation & strategy to become something special.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon is still a decent bit of fun, despite it being simplistic and with limited replayability so gets the 'Thumbs Up' from me!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","December 11, 2013","true","20.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You might not think so at first but as time goes on you begin to realize that the mechanics are extremely simple yet arbitrary in unnecessary ways. Accomplishments really seem to come all at the same time in each play through and failures are too common for unnecessary reasons. You will find yourself constantly building a company and then watching it come burning to the ground because you released what you thought would be a high ranking game. Game Dev Story on the mobile platforms is far superior to this copy-cat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDonovanViper/recommended/239820/","TheDonovanViper","thedonovanviper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDonovanViper/","763 products in account","I was originally given this game as a gift by a good friend of mine.\n\nUsually, I don't tend to delve into Steam at all, I have been pro-console all of my life, until I played this game. After being a fan of simulation games on consoles (with the occasional PC port here and there) such as Football Manager, The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon to name but a few, I was skeptical going into playing this game, but boy was I wrong.\n\nThe game starts you out in a lowly garage with a start-up cost of 70K. Now to some, that is a lot of money to start of with in any game, (well, from your Garage at least) but taking into consideration the fact that it takes 8K a month to run the costs of everything, we can say it is justifiable. You also have the start-up option of running your games from a G64 (a hat-tip to the Commodore 64, which was obviously name changed due to copyright reasons) or the PC. There are also five game topics you are given to start-up with such as, Fantasy, Dungeon, Sports, Surgery and Military, but these can vary when starting up a new game, you could even get topics like Alien or UFO! It all depends on what the computer decides it wants you to have at the beginning.\n\nYou are able to unlock further topics by 'researching' them with the points you have accumulated for creating games, these points can also be spent on other things such as, improving the games engine, sound (or later on in the game) quests, among others. You are also given the option of choosing which marketable area you would like your game to go to once you have unlocked the 'Marketing' option once you have released enough titles to warrant these, or enough time has elapsed, there are split into three categories E (Everyone), M (Mature) or Y (Young), I only ever used the 'Everyone' option, but that worked well on every topic I did indeed choose.\n\nAs time progresses, you and the consoles around you do too, shortly into the game, the 'Ninvendo TES' (a homage to the Nintendo NES) comes onto the market, (which in some respects is a good thing as the consoles evolve, just like they did in real life) the G64 comes off of the market and later on you are introduced to other consoles, such as the in-game SNES, Master System, Playstation and eventually, the PS5 (the in-game names now allude me, I apologise).\n\nOnce you have reached the 1Million currency mark with creating games, you are offered to move into a bigger office, with much more space (I would personally advise this to be taken when you have about 10-20M in the bank, as you'll more than likely go bankrupt if you take this option too early on in the game). You accumulate the money by releasing good, titles (ratings with 7/8s are what I was getting until I released a Racing Simulator game which gave me 9s) which are rated by four gaming magazines. Now, if you're going for the achievements of 'Perfect Score' you are more than likely going to get it during the larger rooms, not necessarily in the Garage, I haven't personally seen it happen as of typing this.\n\nNow, you should have enough money to advance to the next room, where you can employ people, a maximum of four is allowed in this room and this is where the fun starts to really kick in. You have the option of training them once you have employed them, if this doesn't happen, you will be stuck producing the same scored games for a while, also, switch up the genres once in a while too, its amazing how much a well researched game topic can jump from 4s to about 8s from the last time a game was made and a word to the wise, DO NOT make two game genres the same one after another, your fans will not like that and would probably end up losing some as well as money.\n\nI could go further into the last room, but that is something that you need to find out for yourself to play, create your own consoles, release an AAA title and have up to 6 staff members, that is all I am going to let you in on there!\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody and I am ashamed I never bought this myself and waited until I mentioned it to a friend to buy it for me as a gift, otherwise I would have bought it day one.\n\n11/10.\n\nLoved every minute of it and the achievements leave you wanting more.","June 27, 2014","true","46.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You have to mix and match different genres to find what sells best. After you figure out what genres work well, you have to target an audience for your game. Then you have to decide what your going to work on more: gameplay or story? Dialogue or level design? Graphics or world design? In the end, all of your choices will be what makes or breaks your game.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon is definitely in my top ten favorite games. I have played many playthroughs and enjoyed each one. It is also relaxing to watch all of the design and tech bubbles float to the top of the screen.

Not exactly fun.\n\n- during game development, you are tasked with assigning various employees to various apsects of the game, but the game does not mention which employee's talants are better suited to which task. Design? Tech? a Combination? again, bring back the "oh, look a wiki" problem.\n\n- game trends are to short. often less then the cycle of developing a single medium-sized game. resultng in it being impossible to play into them.\n\n- later in the game you can develop your own console and various tech lab options, but these parts of the game as so extreemly limited in the possible interactions you can do (2 console looks/3 colors and a few options is all you have) that it actually brings down the experience.\n\ndoes this make the game a bad game? No, but it certainly makes it a game with it's share of (not so small) problems.\n\nI hope the developers expand or further this game with a possible expansion, a sequel or DLC in which they expand the various parts of the game.","November 28, 2013","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

At first you start small in your garage, but as you make more and more successful games you can change offices, hire staff, and upgrade your skills through training.\n\nWhile it is a simple concept, game dev tycoon is promising, in the sense that it keeps adding variety to your game making process and letting you make more complex choices as you progress through the game. The graphics and music are quite simple and not really an asset to be discussed for this game. Its gameplay largely consists of you adjusting sliders so as to decide which concepts you are going to give emphasis on while creating each game, such as sound, graphics etc. You also witness the emergence and disappearance of several types of consoles and decide where to release each game, while also keeping in mind the market trends.\n\nThe most prominent problem with this game, would be that you get to decide based on trial and error more often than not, and the feedback you get about the choices you made is not entirely helpful for you to choose better next time around. The existance of a wiki for this game has made it so that tons of people end up following just that, since it is way less frustrating to progress in this way. Overall, I wouldnt call game dev tycoon a bad game, but a game that could use some polishing to shine.\n\n+ great genre/topic/platform variety\n+ easy to grasp, hard to master\n\n\n- game choice feedback is vague","February 26, 2014","true","10.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I bought this title because, I want to be a game developer.   The Premise of Game Dev Tycoon is, rather... well you are a game developer, and you play through the ages and generations of video games, starting from the NES era of gaming and work your way through today.\n\nThe game progresses from you working alone in a garage, to a small team in a smaller office, to a massive corprate headquaters where you can pump out tripple A titles.\n\nSo the question is thus, what about the game development part.  Well basicly there are three parts to game development, and three sliders per part.  Pending on Genre and type of game pends on how the sliders need to be set, where you need to spend your time and resources into making a good game.  Then you watch bubbles (With one of the most addictive sound effects) float up into a compleation bar.  That's about it.\n\nSo in all honesty theres not much to gameplay at all, its simple, it's straight foward, and I quite like it, personally after hashing out a few sequals it makes you think on what you are creating, and has given me some neat ideas for games just because I kept pumping out sucessful sequals in this game.\n\nSo All in All, I recomend this game, it is a handy timewaster, it is fun in it's own way, a little addictive, and is easy on the CPU.  So by all means give it a whirl.\n\nNote to the Developer: I think a demo of the first garage era would go a long way for this game to get more people to play it.","August 30, 2014","true","38.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

However, I feel like the game would've benefitted from more customization options for characters and the actual businesses. The graphics are so simplistic that more customization probably would've been pretty easy to pull off, making it seem a little lazy. - 7/10\n\nAudio:\nI like the music but I'm pretty sure that there's only 2 or 3 tracks playing on a loop so it can get pretty repetitive if you play for hours at a time. The music that is there fits the game well though, I just wish there was more of it. - 7/10\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is really unique and can get pretty complex, providing a great challenge for both new and veteran players. However, it can be a bit difficult to tell what was bad about certain games because specifics are not always offered and the review system has always seemed a little off to me.I think that there are enough unique aspects to keep the game engaging though, and you're able to hire on new team members to attempt larger games in the later stages, which are the most fun imo. - 8/10\n\nStory:\nThere really isn't one. It's a typical tycoon game where the story is just "one day you decided to start making video games and become successful" - nothing too deep. The cool thing is that you start making games in the very early stages of the gaming industry so you actually get to see all the “now-legendary” consoles released and make games for them! It can be pretty funny too since the developers had to come up with some pretty creative names in order to avoid copyright. A story isn’t really necessary in these types of games but it would’ve been nice to see your company presented with various choices or something. - 7/10\n\nReplayability:\nLike any tycoon game, you can play as many times as you want and it can also be pretty easy to fail so you might even have to start over a couple of times anyway. The beauty of a simple concept like this is that it never really gets old and I, personally, keep the game installed on my PC just in case I'm ever in the mood to play it, which is pretty often honestly. I’ve completed the game a couple of times now and it’s always fun to play, just don’t expect a totally new experience each time you play it. - 8/10\n\nOverall:\nOverall I was very impressed with this tycoon game, especially considering the fact that it was made by a 2 man team and was released for the extremely low price of $10. There’s a lot of fun strategy to be had here, but only if you like the tycoon genre, and only if you actually have an interest in the gaming industry. If you’re bored by either of those two things, this game has nothing to offer you. Also, there are mods for it now. - 7.4/10","July 22, 2015","true","38.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You start off just a single guy making games in a garage with a computer, and as you expand and grow you get the options of making game engines, hiring employees for certain jobs in creating in each game, making your own game console and creating a World of Warcraft rip-off called Planet of SurvivalCraft. Although this game is crammed with alot of content and fun, it really only lasts for 15-20 hours. You could probably speedrun this game in about 5-10 hours.

You start off in a garage and work your way up to an office and employees. It's obvious that the creators of this game has knowledge about the gaming industry, both when it comes to gaming history and game development. There is a steady storyline (although not the most intriguing) throughout the game, where you, your company and employees evolve aswell as the gaming industry. I have never come across a tycoon game with this theme before so I was glad to find that the tutorial was short and easy to understand. Also the tutorial is only mandatory upon your first game.\n\nWhen creating a game "you" have no knowledge about what subjects, theme and platform works together, but as you develop games, the game register the outcomes which helps you make better games. Personally I think this function isn't ultimate and would prefer a full register (for example a grid) where you clearly can see what works and what does not, instead of having to click everything and see if the game tells you it's a good combo.\n\nOverall this is a great game. Even though the story doesn't change, I keep playing! I would like to see the creators make a sequel or an upgraded version because despite my criticism, there isn't really anything wrong with the game, there's only a lot of room for improvement. Considering this is their first game, that's impressive!\n","April 7, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

If you think about it, it's not about the graphics or music - it's about the strategy and the satisfaction you get from that successful achievement of being, well, successful. This is one feeling we all have deep down inside and it can come from anywhere, real life scenarios, or video games.\n\nRather you're fishing and finally got a hook, or moving to the next stage in this game it's the same feeling of accomplishment. The only thing the game lacks is maybe a higher time frame between console releases. It seems to be a little too fast-paced when you're actually sitting here playing it. This game could also use a meter on how fast you'd like time to pass rather it's real-time or 100x faster for example.\n\nPros:\n-Addictive gameplay\n-Allows your creativity to fly\n-Good engine\n-Basic controls (Rather you're a gaming veteran or a newcomer, anyone can play with ease)\n\nCons:\n-No control on the time flow\n-You'll mostly always feel rushed\n-Could use some more tweaking\n\nOverall, I'd give this a 8/10. I can tell this took some time to actually develop - as I said before it's not about the graphics or music that made this the game it is today, it's the gameplay. From what I can tell, it took awhile to actually make this game fully functional which needs to be credited. This could be a text-based game and I'd still enjoy it.\n\nWould I recommend it? Maybe, I wouldn't say $10 USD would be worth Game Dev Tycoon, however I'd say around the $4.99 or lower range (on sale) would be reasonable. Some have regrets about buying this game, you need to give it time or maybe start over. The point is, have fun.","October 15, 2013","true","15.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So very recently, I've got myself my first Steam Acount and played only Level 1 of this game. So was the game good as I remembered it when I played the DEMO or a waste of time?\nSounds:\nSo the music sounds okay. I can hum a few tones from the game.  6/10\nGameplay:\nSo this is a business tycoon game. A really popular concept. Now I've heard that there is another Game Dev Game, but I think that this game is better. Plus I'd never played the other one people talk about. You are going around making games and getting fans and money. And if you make a hit game, you may get an office. Now I haven't played the office yet, but holy crap is this game fun.\n\nIt also makes you think sometimes. If I had a few flaws, when you start the game you may get a white screen unless you clear the cache or something. Also it is pretty hard to come up with some ideas but that is a realsitc concept so maybe I am bashing it for what it is. The games really fun and I think you should play it! 8/10\nStory:\nThe Story is just epic. While I don't think younger gamers would really understand it (unless they look in the history books), it well be faithful to some gamers. Due to copyright issues they changed the company's names but you can get an easter egg if you type one of the Offical Names. I hope it gets better! 9/10\nGraphics:\nThey look pretty darn good. They look very smooth and maybe a little generic but I don't have a lot of complaints. 7/10\nReplay?:\nThis game is something that you may play a few times after 43 years in the game. It could be very fun to create a ton of games. And maybe you would like story. Just to be fair I will give Replay: 7/10\nIs this game Good?:\nYes it is! It is a game that I think every video gamer should play unless they hate tycoon business games. It is fun and faithful to gaming. I'll give this game 8/10 A must buy!\n","May 29","true","3.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Grabbed it during the Holiday sale and do not regret my decision. This game is pretty darn accurate as far as the video game industry works. Sure, it's just a simple simulator but you have to make decisions based off what gamers will like in the game that you are developing which cannot be taken lightly. It takes awhile to get used to the fast-patced mechanics and hectic lifestyle of a developer. You must pay attention to every detail when making a game and make sure that what you are developing is top-notch or otherwise the game will flop.\n\nIf you fail a few times and go bankrupt in the game, learn from your mistakes and try again.

Those memories were brutally shattered after two playthroughs. At a certain point, about seven hours in to the game, reviews change instantaniously from 8.5 and more to 4.5 or less. On two different save files this happened, so I went online and read up on what games to create and great consoll, genre and audience combinations. Regardless the effort, getting back the sales and reviewes that had been given consistently since "the garage" was impossible. The twoes and threes kept coming. Fantasy/RPG, you name it. Bankruptcy on all attempts. So I jumped back on both save files and tried following game creation guides from a point where it all seemed to be going great. The reviews where flying all over the place, 9.75, 9.5, 9, everything was going great again, I could finally get that fuzzy feeling again when Game Dev Tycoon came to mind. But on both occations, with everything researched, the reviews turned sour at the same point as previously. So I do not recommend the game as it now appears. There is no logic in the difficulty patched by the developers of this game. If you crave for a great game dev game, Game Dev Story is much better.","May 4, 2014","false","38.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","1"

It is a very good game at first, despite a lack of polish here and there (inexplicable error message on first launch, the odd spelling/grammatical error in the dialog boxes, etc.). Therefore, I think it is worth getting on sale.\n\nHowever, it quickly gets old; mostly, I think, due to its cyclical mechanics and unrealistic time scale. As a simulator, these factors take away from the experience. For example, a game may take as little as several months to produce, bug-free, and is "on the market" for only a short time, even if it is a smash hit. The result is that you must constantly churn out game after game, whereas I naturally tend towards producing 3 or 4 titles that I can release the next installments for periodically -- not unlike real life. By the fourth year, having produced several hits and sitting at a cool 4.4 million, with a new office, an employee, and lots to research/train, I said to myself, "Just 31 years to go...ugh".\n\nSo that's basically it for me. Something tells me that I stopped right when the game was about to get its second wind. I've no doubt that I'll pick it up from time to time to tinker with. It is well made and fun as far as it goes, just not something I can really sink my teeth into and feel satisfied. I'm flagging this review with a "Not recommended" just so that people can see an alternate perspective amongst the sea of absolutely glowing reviews. I'm interested to see what Greenheart Games will come up with next. :)","June 28, 2015","false","7.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

Starting from a guy in a shed in the early 1980s and watching the company of your own name (in my case, NotEACorp) growing into a company releasing games about ninja princesses and getting punched in the balls by critics is wholly satisfying, except for when a critic pans your game, which only makes you want to make a better game to impress him/her/it, thus contributing to the addiction.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is that, for a game made up of a load of 2D sprites, the randomly appearing framerate drops, while suprising, are more annoying than anything. I understand that indie games aren't the best optimised games on the market, but this is giving me horrifying nighmares about GTA 4 all over again.\n\nVERDICT: Go do everything you need to do in your life, gather a stash of food, then buy this game.

If you're a fan of simulation games/tycoon style games, this one will be right up your alley. The game starts basically at the dawn of early gaming starting at the Commodore 64 (renamed G64) and PC, working all the way down history to the Xbox One, PS4 and even simulating new "future" consoles.\n\nYour goal is simple: make quality games and lots of money to move out of your garage and eventually start your own game studio. Trying out new genre combinations for games is interesting and deciding where to allocate your resources for best effect (for example, you generally want to go with Fantasy for making an RPG game, Military for Action games etc). Eventually the process gets more and more involved as you have to assign team members to work on games and train their individual strengths deeper. Eventually you can create MMORPGs and "research" projects like a Steam-based platform, and even develop your own console so the game depth only increases as you go along.\n\nMy only gripes with the game is sometimes critics will be all over the place in regards to their scores. When creating what you thought was an AAA title, they may only end up rating a 7-8, whereas a title you didn't put as much money into, might score 9-10s. Critic score generally dictates how much your game is expected to sell. Also, you move through the eras a bit too quickly, as I completed the game before I was even able to start researching some advanced technologies (like Steam). Though, you could chalk that up to it being my first playthrough.\n\nOverall, you're likely to get 6-7 hours out of it your first playthrough assuming you make it to the end without bankruptcy. There isn't a whole lot of replay value but if you're an avid gamer, it's definitely worth it on sale alone for the tongue-in-cheek gaming humor and entertaining gameplay!","June 26, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Video games haven't even developed shading yet, but you're still giving it your all and trying your best. You make a few good games, a few bad ones. You veer dangerously close to the line of poverty and you bite your fingernails in anticipation of the inevitable failure that is sure to consume you. But then..\n\nIt happens.\n\nYou make that game. Maybe it's a game about butts evolving into aliens and attacking people. Maybe it's the most sophisticated, most complex idea you've ever mustered up and you may have just crossed the intellectual threshold into ascendance and are on your way towards demigod status. But you do it. You choose that magical Genre/Topic combination, you slide those sliders into juuuust the right spot, and then you watch the reviews.\n\n10's. Maybe some 9's. Your jaw drops and your eyes open wide. You look towards the income menu and see hundreds upon thousands of people are buying your game. 100k. 400k. 750k.

You get a notification that a new office has opened up and is ready just for you and your company. With the most trepidation you've felt since your first day at school, you accept and move on.

For the first game that came out by the Greenheart Games developer, they did spot on. Going through the years and seeing the game industry change from a developer standpoint (all be it their off brand versions. i.e. Vonny = Sony) and even getting to develop your own console at some point is massive fun. It's can be very challenging trying to figure out their interpretation of various genres and play styles, and getting that 10/10 on a game feels very rewarding. They even go so far as to incorporate MMO's, sequels, and expansion packs, all with roughly accurate feelings of how their development and distribution is perceived.\n\nVery eager to see if they come out with a sequel, as there are a ton of features I would like to see implemented and current ones that I would love to see expanded. For instance, basic and advanced accounting statistics, expanded skills and point values, and a feedback system for your games, just to name a few.\n\nAwesome game, played the hell out of it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a game to just chillax a bit.\n","March 3, 2014","true","28.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meddlingmiddleman/recommended/239820/","meddlingmiddleman","Mr. Needful","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meddlingmiddleman/","137 products in account","I've been playing this game for only a day, and I already want to have its babies. It's the first game in two months that made me stay up late so I could keep playing it. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, allowing you to get right to the important business of building and customizing your games. And when you finally get that first 10 rating, and that first million bucks, everything has been worth it. Greatly looking forward to sequels/updates/mods/finishing the game.\n\n-----\n\nThis is five weeks and 40 hours of additional gameplay after that first paragraph. I still recommend this game, but with a lot less enthusiasm. The game gets very repetitive after a while, especially because financial success hinges on putting out one near-perfect game every few years or so, with everything else just being filler. I absolutely hope there's a bigger badder sequel in a year or two, one that addresses the following issues:\n\nIdiot Publishers: Your mid-game is overly dependent on using publishers so you can make larger games for more money and fans. But more often than not the publisher will either ask for a game you haven't researched, a format you don't have rights to, or a terrible topic/genre combo. I get that it's supposed to make you take chances and expand your options, but if I'm desperate and need a medium game fast, I'd like to actually be able to make one.\nEmployee Stagnation: In order for their skills to improve, your employees must train. Making games gives them nothing; you MUST spend time and research points and capitol on boosting their skills. And you have to do this a lot, which means that you can't be constantly working on games - or researching new topics/engine elements.\nChronic Indie Mindset: Even once you hit the late game and become an industry juggernaut, it's still just seven dudes cranking out a game. Yes, you can eventually develop a hardware lab and an R&D department, but they don't directly assist in game-making. I want to become a monster, with dozens - or even hundreds - of employees, making multiple games at once, training some people while others are dedicated to improving my engine and so on.\nResearch Bottleneck: As mentioned above, you need research points to train employees as well as to research new topics and game engine elements. The only way to generate RP for most of the game is to make more games, a newer engine, or generate a game report. As such, you often end up falling behind in either training or engine (or god forbid, both) as you struggle to devote enough points to their multiple needs. I'd recommend being able to create an R&D lab much sooner, thus giving the player many more points to work with, rather than reducing point requirements.\nHardware Focused: When I first started playing, I really loved how the game told the history of gaming consoles, as it's not something you hear about a lot when researching gaming history. But consoles are almost exclusively the only outside influence on your game-making. Nothing about software or legal battles or any of that. Just console development. And while interesting, it's such a small part of the story.\nForced Conformity: One of this game's mechanics has you matching game topics to genres; the better the match, the better it sells. In other words, you can't make a unique game. For example, according to GDT, Prison/RPG is an okay combination. But what if I want to make a stellar Prison/RPG? Instead of just stating that such-and-such a combination is good or bad, it should be up to the player to make it good or bad. Also, the entire nation of Japan would like to say something about Romance/RPG not being a great combination; I have 60 hours of gameplay and that still messes me up.\n\nAnd yet despite all those flaws, it's still an enjoyable game. In my last playthrough I jokingly made a Vampire RPG called Count of Calypso and it got me out of the basement. The three sequels got me into the final game stage, paid for my R&D lab and new game engine, and became the game I was known for, respectively. I created the Fallout franchise with the help of Dave Johnson, head of Departure Science. Tom Schoffer is somehow a tech genius and became my first AI specialist. I made Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and won the game before I could releas Half-Life 3. There are so many good stories that come out of Game Dev Tycoon; I just wish it were less frustrating to create them.","November 28, 2013","true","87.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The graphics while somewhat simple are actually quite a nice touch. In many respects this is not too disimilar to many other Tycoon based games. There are some really nice touches like how the pcitures of the different cosnoles acrtually look like the ones we all knew and loved (original NES, SNES, Master System ect). Overall the game is quite addicitve, especially once you get into developing and releasing MMO's and expansions.\n\nFor the price its well worth picking up. It does have its moments, but I think once you have played it thorugh a few times you are probably done. Certainly not a timeless classic, but none the less a decent tycoon / sim game which you should get a few weeks of enjoyment out of. There are some mods you can get from the steam workshop which would probably add a bit more longevity to the overall expereince so well worth going there and checking them out.

Also working with "medium" and "large" games you can't really seem to tell that clearly what is necessarry.\n\nAlso while the game gives you "hints" as to what's good for that game or not. It isn't really straight forwardly defined and it forces the player to make "judgement" calls i mean it IS a tycoon game after all\n\nWith modding including this game has limitless, endless fun. However it is sad because much like Skyrim. This game should've had a lot of these good mods in the game to begin with and not as something the modding community has to do.

The tutorial is short and simple and gets you right into the action. The menus are well designed and there is not much clutter on the screen.\n\nThe social commentary and satire on the video game industry is great at times. The main problem this game faces is that after you have beaten it a few times nothing will really surprise you. Even then you will get hours of enjoyment from the game.\n\nI would purchase if you have looked at the screenshots and thought it looked like fun.

I get lost for hours upon hours and it stays fun and exciting the entire time, the visuals are cute and simple but the core of this game is what makes it one of best PC games I've ever played, it truely is the pinnacle of how fancy graphics are not needed to make a perfect game.\n\nI grew up with Atari, Apple II, Commedore 64, NES, SEGA, etc.etc. so this game just pours on the nostolgia with the sounds and style plus the hilarious alternative universe gaming console lineup for you to develop on, create your own world at your own pace and develop games you always wanted or you can play it like real history, pretend you were on the ground floor of Valve, Sega, Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft, create the top games of all time and see how filthy rich you can get while having a blast + training your brain all at the same time!\n\nI have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, instant classic and one of my all time favorite games.\n\n11/10 - it's that good!","November 29, 2013","true","30.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Slightly high price (considering the simple game mechanics).\nThis feels more like a $5 title than a $10 title.\nHowever I bought it at nearly full price to support the developers and its well worth it.\n\n2. Repetetive music - If only they'd get more music variety instead of the same couple of 2 minute tracks on repeat.\n\nThis is the only game in the world that guilt trips piracy! They get bonus points for that :)\n\nTL;DR - Great game, addictive as hell, BUY IT! 9/10.","August 30, 2013","true","53.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

That's what I like about this game. It has feeling even if it's a game with no actual story. It's made something so brilliant I can't understand it.

While many games can be reduced to the math to some extent, the art of hiding this, or simply increasing the complexity to the point where optimization is no longer feasible due to multiple constraints and varying situations, is crucial.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon has nothing to do with making games. It is solely concerned with making the player drag around a set of sliders to find the optimal combinations, in the pursuit of ever larger numbers. The window-dressing of a game development studio is immaterial, as it impacts precisely nothing.\n\nThis is not to say that it is a bad spreadsheet, in and of itself. The game is perfectly functional, and the puzzle of searching for ideal combinations might satisfy an evening, or more for the kind of person that enjoys the optimization challenge. However anyone who does not find such appealing would be well advised to find something else to do with their time.","December 23, 2013","false","6.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

Ok ok let's release the game, if it fails I'll be bankrupt and that will be the end of me.\n\n7, 6, 6, 8\n\nOk not too bad! I'll live to make a new game! Well do I make a new game or upgrade my game engine!? Should I hire new staff or train existing staff? What to do what to do?\n\nThese questions and more will be up to you and your new game company.

All of these things and more are awaiting for you in this lovely gem of a game. You may even learn a thing or two of the history of consoles, even if they are using fake names.\n\nI picked this up during the 2013 Holliday sale and wasn't expecting much, but what I got was a "just one more game I need good reviews!"

Even with multi-genre mixups it's pretty self-explanatory on how to allocate your time during development. Past this thin surface level of gameplay, there really isn't enough depth to keep you going.\n\nA lot of seemingly obvious features are missing from the development process, probably to keep the game simpler and more accessible, but I feel like a lot of replayability is lost in their absence. For every step in the development process of a game, I found myself wanting more concise control, but this is by no means a game of micro-management. You market your game by pressing "market" and have little to no input on HOW your game is marketed, for example. The success of your game winds up relying on when you release your game, and how you allocated your time. It's so bare-bones and minimal that the sense of achievement wears off quickly and you begin to feel like you're not working for your success.\n\nThat being said, I still played for about 10-12 hours before it was effortles and mundane, so I think I still got my moneys worth. If you're looking for a simple game to relax to where you don't have to do much aside from click through menu's, it's a great choice, and that's really all I wanted.","November 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

PREMIS: You a game developer (starting out in a garage) who starts their game dev career in the early 1980s. You go through to about 30 to 40 years. In that time you upgrade your HQ add other game devs to your team. GAMEPLAY: Click anywhere on the screen to go to a menu usually I either reserched or devoloped a new game. When you develop a game you pick a topic, pick a genre,( two later on) what console it will be on, the engine, and the name(which doesn't effect the game at all). When you start developing something it'll have these dots( either orange: design, dark orange: bugs, blue: technology, and dark blue: research) they will go to these tabs and these also depend on how good your game is. Also these menus pop up where say you can only have 99 jelly beans. Which Those are divided into 3 parts (3 times for a game) you can only have 99 jelly beans so, say if you want to focus more on graphic than sound then sound could be like 66 jelly beans and the other two are 33. Overall this game is very fun( also there are mods) the first time you beat it you feel acomplished. But the second time you can keep your hints about what goes and what doesn't. 9.5/10","February 16, 2014","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Playing it on the PC doesnt have the same feel to it. I expected more options and interfaces on the pc version and was a bit dissapointed on how much it was the same. There are minor differences in the PC version but none that are worth mentioning.\n\nAlso another issue I have with this game is that, it is a time table game, so you only have X amount of time in the game to see how far your company can go and see how high you can raise your score within that time frame. They do allow you to play past that time frame but to me it just wasn't worth it and that factor just seemed to ruin the game for me.\n\nAt least hose are my thoughts, others I know really enjoy the game. I simply suggest trying the phone version before jumping onto the PC  version.

Game Dev Tycoon uses real life events like the Gameboy, PS1 etc. It has pretty much every main console that was released in the last 30 years including the Xbox One and PS4, it even has a go at future consoles. While the game does have many problems such as large unpredictability wheather your game will be reviewed well, which tells you how well your sales will be. While the game does take many elements from the iOS and Android game Game Dev Story it improves and modernises most aspects of it to a higher level. I'd give this game a 8/10\n\nScore: 8/10","December 19, 2013","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You begin the game by naming your character with limited customization and naming your company, then with a very helpful tutorial system, you're off to create games as you see fit.\n\nWhen you start, the only thing you can do is create a game, you can make it text based or 2-D gameplay, but as you progress through the years you will be able to research new things such as the ability to make a 3-D engine, better A.I., environmental effects, all that stuff. To get these research ideas, you must get research points by making a game, engine, or doing something like creating a report on what you did wrong when developing your game.\n\nWhen you begin making your game, you can choose the genre, which topic it will be based on (Ancient history, ninjas, spies) and choosing which systems it will be on\nYou can also create your own engine with many of these research skills, which can cost quite a lot sum of dosh. When developing your game, you have to use 3 sliders to see how much time you want to spend on a part of a game, for example, do you focus on the story more than the game or vice versa? Graphics or sound, A.I. or Dialogue? As you develop your game, Journalists will ask for interviews and ask on you're opinion on things such as what's important in a genre of a game, you can also hype up the game by saying stuff like "*Name* will be one of the greatest", you can also sign missions such as a plan to get women into gaming which will cost you, but earn you a lot of fans and respect. Once you've created your game, you will gain experience in pretty much all your skills such as your story writing, gameplay designing, sound and graphics, etc. The game will also then  be reviewed by 4 reviewers, you may start by getting 5s, 4s, and probably 2s, but once you've managed to get your first 10 out of 10, you will want to raise your hand in success.\n\nIf you've done badly, you can generate a game report which can give you advise, such as the Commodore 64 has a large adventure fanbase, or the PC community has a large strategy fanbase, and whether things such as dialogue is important for certain genres.\nHowever, if you still manage to do badly, you will enter bankrupcy and will have to take a loan from the bank, fail that, game over.\n\nAs you earn more money, you can move into bigger offices where you can recruit more staff members as well as make the place look very pretty.\nAs you make good games you will gain fans, who will definatly buy your games and if you got 100K of them, you'll be able to self publish your games, you can also sign publish contracts with companies such as úbersoft or Electronic Mass Productions to gain notice in the industry, but they'll call the shots on what you make.\nLater in the game you can also build your custom console to release onto the market.\nI gotta say, the gameplay is pretty damn addicting, so much so I've been spending 6 hours into a single play session which I never really do a lot, and that says something for me.\n\nNothing to say in the visual department, it looks clean and reminds me of a few flash games.\n\nThe sound is pretty good too, nice beeps and bloops and the music keeps a smile on my face 99% of the time.\n\nAs far as complaints go.....well, there isn't any on the top of my head to be honest, I was too occupied in making games and having too much fun to notice any.\n\nOverall, Game Dev Tycoon is a brilliant game and you should absolutly purchase it as soon as you can.\n\nI'd play it for decades.\n\n9/10","January 1, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.\n\nEspecially at first, it's fun creating the games.

You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.\n\nAs times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same "feel" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose.

Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.\n\nThe bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev.

You start alone in garage, and end as boss of big company. There's many reaserch option, and making the game isn't always easy. You have to take risk of letting someone overwork to end the game, and you cannot always have everything you want in the game - choose wisely. There is game reports mechanic that allows you to gain insights about released games (like the x topic is great with x genre or like ai is very important for x genre games).\nThere are plenty interesting events that makes a game more interesting, but there isn't many of them. You can make your own consoles from scratch as like a engine. There are many options but i feel like some things aren't balanced good, but maybe only  I've got that feeling. The game is also short. Sometimes you don't know what some options are to. For example, why you can don't have/have online play in MMO? MMO is MMO O_O. The stupid thing is that expansion packs to MMO are made exactly like games. So you can have worse graphic in the same game in DLC. Beside that this game is really fun. If you've seen some videos on Youtube from it and you liked it you should get it. Maybe not for full price, but definitely on promotion.

PREMIS: You a game developer (starting out in a garage) who starts their game dev career in the early 1980s. You go through to about 30 to 40 years. In that time you upgrade your HQ add other game devs to your team. GAMEPLAY: Click anywhere on the screen to go to a menu usually I either reserched or devoloped a new game. When you develop a game you pick a topic, pick a genre,( two later on) what console it will be on, the engine, and the name(which doesn't effect the game at all). When you start developing something it'll have these dots( either orange: design, dark orange: bugs, blue: technology, and dark blue: research) they will go to these tabs and these also depend on how good your game is. Also these menus pop up where say you can only have 99 jelly beans. Which Those are divided into 3 parts (3 times for a game) you can only have 99 jelly beans so, say if you want to focus more on graphic than sound then sound could be like 66 jelly beans and the other two are 33. Overall this game is very fun( also there are mods) the first time you beat it you feel acomplished. But the second time you can keep your hints about what goes and what doesn't. 9.5/10","February 16, 2014","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiskyyCS/recommended/239820/","RiskyyCS","✪ Riskyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiskyyCS/","36 products in account","The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine.\n\nWhen you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.\n\nOverall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)\n\nI rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).\n\nThanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)\n\nDaniel","February 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/recommended/239820/","hazardgaming","hazzaricks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/","88 products in account","Game Dev Tycoon is a wonderful game for what it represents. The plot is fantastic and I love how it uses true events with slightly renamed consoles and games, far better than if they made up all the consoles and games. The game gives you a lot of choice, is very simple to understand and with so many different possibilities and outcomes, the game has yet to become stale for me so far.\n\nHowever, in my hour so far of playing, I am already finding it very hard to make perfect games. Whilst game reports are a very good way to get information about good and bad combos, the reviews are lacking in depth with some simply saying things like 'Enjoyed it' and 'Good'. If the reviewers went into more depth like they sometimes do when mentioning things like 'medieval works really well with strategy' then I'd much prefer the reviews and actually find them useful, however, as it stands, the best way to get information on your game is to file a game report.\n\nWhilst I have not played this game for too long, my first impressions are for the most part very positive. The game is very simple to play and is perfect for some relaxing late-night gaming. The game adds enough challenge with its numerous choices and certainly does require a lot of thought into some decisions in order to maintain enough money to save yourself from going bankrupt, however isn't impossibly difficult to grasp.\n\nOverall, my opinion on 'Game Dev Tycoon' is very positive, however I do feel the lack of in-depth reviews really does hinder its potential. But this is one con among many pros and should certainly not put you off playing this wonderfully unique experience.\n\nRating: 3/4","December 25, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I mean, who didn't dream at some point about creating their own super-amazing game - Game Dev Tycoon somewhat delivers.\n\nOn the mechanic side I believe it really shines with simple presentation and doesn't bog the player down with charts and statistics typical for the genre. Graphics are neat and do the job just fine.\n\nPersonally couldn't see the replay value after "completing" the game but then considering the price of the game during any kind of sale, it's not really expected either.

There are so many great mods in this game, but I have not invested in these too much yet.\nI recently played through the game in a 6/7-hour game and actually discovered several features which I had not previously discovered (such as the homage to this service which is dubbed 'Grid') and, not only was it fun to play, but the experience was different; and no two files will likely have the same development path for topics, as all of the topics appear in a random order.\nThis game is one of my personal favourites, not only for the hilarious titles that can come up, but for the achievements which bay homage to classic games (such as Pong and Doom). I would recommend this to any casual gamer who is happy to spend countless hours playing this legendary game.\n\n10/10","December 28, 2014","true","53.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I mean, who didn't dream at some point about creating their own super-amazing game - Game Dev Tycoon somewhat delivers.\n\nOn the mechanic side I believe it really shines with simple presentation and doesn't bog the player down with charts and statistics typical for the genre. Graphics are neat and do the job just fine.\n\nPersonally couldn't see the replay value after "completing" the game but then considering the price of the game during any kind of sale, it's not really expected either.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterfireheart/recommended/239820/","masterfireheart","Masterfireheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterfireheart/","282 products in account","This game is awesome. Period.\nGame Dev Tycoon is a game about starting from the bottom to rise up the ladder and become a sucessful Game Developer. There are many various events that occur during the timeline (early 80's +) like new consoles, office upgrades, offers from "Agent Blowfish" to savatage other game companies, and scammers from other countries. It is very easy to play and understand, but can be hard to survive the years without going bankrupt.\n\nWhen I started playing, I started 2 or 3 saves and went bankrupt in the Garage on each one. Then on my 4th, I survived long enough to move into the first Office. I stayed there for a while and even managed to survive to the first Office upgrade. But alas, I went into the land of Bankrupcy once more. Then, I got the gist of the game and tried again, this time with some new stratagies. Now, I'm waaay past the last event and the console lab. All my employees are 1000+ on every aspect and still going strong. In my games, I make maybe 4-6 new games during the start, then I just keep making sequels of them (For Example: I make a Music/Simulation game called Musik Maker, then I just keep making Musik Makers on and on every now and then (Musik Maker 2, Musik Maker 3, Musik Maker 4, etc.)). I may occasionally make another new series but I usually stick to the same games, and all my games are always named after real games! :D\n\nAnother great thing about Game Dev Tycoon was Mod Support. If you go on the Forums, there are plenty of Mods available and being made (The game was made in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so it shouldn't be too hard for Programmers to mod). And you are probably thinking, "HACKS, CHEATS, UNLEGITNESS! NO MODS FOR ME!". It turns out, most of the Mods are just Expansion Packs adding new consoles or events or options. To my knowledge there is only 1 Cheat Mod, and it's called Cheat Mod... :P It's actually pretty fun to use on a seperate save (Call it "CHEATERZ" or something) because you can skip to any place in the timeline and when you are developing a game, there are little plus sign orbs below that add points to your game design and technology (I have made games with 50K points each :D). I'd reccommend Mods to users who have played Game Dev Tycoon a lot and are bored of the origanal and are looking for more and for those who just want more.\nThe game itself takes maybe 5+ hours to squeeze all the story out and is actually a bit short (But with expansion mods, Game Dev Tycoon = MOAR FUN!). Some of the achivements are really hard to get (Oh yeah, MODS DONT DISABLE ACHIVEMENTS! So if you are REALLY stuck, the Cheat Mod comes in handy :} ) and a bunch of them are Easter Eggs (I'm not spoiling :)).\n\nOverall, this game is really worth getting. 10$ is a BIT much, but it's so worth it. If it's on sale, EVEN BETTER! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET IT NOW!!!\n\n11/10\n\n"Achivement Unlocked: Turn it up to 11"","February 26, 2014","true","34.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterfireheart/recommended/239820/","masterfireheart","Masterfireheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterfireheart/","282 products in account","This game is awesome. Period.\nGame Dev Tycoon is a game about starting from the bottom to rise up the ladder and become a sucessful Game Developer. There are many various events that occur during the timeline (early 80's +) like new consoles, office upgrades, offers from "Agent Blowfish" to savatage other game companies, and scammers from other countries. It is very easy to play and understand, but can be hard to survive the years without going bankrupt.\n\nWhen I started playing, I started 2 or 3 saves and went bankrupt in the Garage on each one. Then on my 4th, I survived long enough to move into the first Office. I stayed there for a while and even managed to survive to the first Office upgrade. But alas, I went into the land of Bankrupcy once more. Then, I got the gist of the game and tried again, this time with some new stratagies. Now, I'm waaay past the last event and the console lab. All my employees are 1000+ on every aspect and still going strong. In my games, I make maybe 4-6 new games during the start, then I just keep making sequels of them (For Example: I make a Music/Simulation game called Musik Maker, then I just keep making Musik Makers on and on every now and then (Musik Maker 2, Musik Maker 3, Musik Maker 4, etc.)). I may occasionally make another new series but I usually stick to the same games, and all my games are always named after real games! :D\n\nAnother great thing about Game Dev Tycoon was Mod Support. If you go on the Forums, there are plenty of Mods available and being made (The game was made in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so it shouldn't be too hard for Programmers to mod). And you are probably thinking, "HACKS, CHEATS, UNLEGITNESS! NO MODS FOR ME!". It turns out, most of the Mods are just Expansion Packs adding new consoles or events or options. To my knowledge there is only 1 Cheat Mod, and it's called Cheat Mod... :P It's actually pretty fun to use on a seperate save (Call it "CHEATERZ" or something) because you can skip to any place in the timeline and when you are developing a game, there are little plus sign orbs below that add points to your game design and technology (I have made games with 50K points each :D). I'd reccommend Mods to users who have played Game Dev Tycoon a lot and are bored of the origanal and are looking for more and for those who just want more.\nThe game itself takes maybe 5+ hours to squeeze all the story out and is actually a bit short (But with expansion mods, Game Dev Tycoon = MOAR FUN!). Some of the achivements are really hard to get (Oh yeah, MODS DONT DISABLE ACHIVEMENTS! So if you are REALLY stuck, the Cheat Mod comes in handy :} ) and a bunch of them are Easter Eggs (I'm not spoiling :)).\n\nOverall, this game is really worth getting. 10$ is a BIT much, but it's so worth it. If it's on sale, EVEN BETTER! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET IT NOW!!!\n\n11/10\n\n"Achivement Unlocked: Turn it up to 11"","February 26, 2014","true","34.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also, there seems to be a pretty active mod scene but I didn't go into that.\n\nThe concept is a simple simulation or Tycoon type game where you play as a one man indie game developer who slowly grows his/her company into a major game developer woth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThis is done through a really simple interface. You just pick the topic and type of game you're making and then allocate resources to various aspects of game development such as artificial intelligence or level design. This gains more nuances as you advance in the game but game development remains the same simple core mechanic for the whole experience. There's also other things you can do to benefit your company such as contract work, marketing, etc. There are also random events that can hurt or benefit you depending on how you respond to them a la FTL.\n\nIt's a fun experience overall if you enjoy these sorts of business simulation games. It also strikes a special chord with a lot of gamers who can take the opportunity to name their games after popular franchises or just push stupid crap onto the gaming audience.\n\nI do have a few gripes though. Although the game does retain some information on how certain games should ideally be made the game doesn't really tell you a whole lot. There were several times where I thought I was following the instructions on how to make a successfull game but it flopped and I had no idea why even after doing a game report. Also, I think it's unfair that certain topic/genre combinations can't be successful if handled properly. I personally think my Werewolf RTS game would be great. Also, I think it's unrealistic that 1. People in this universe seem to follow game reviews very closely and 2. It's not possible to have a huge success with a bad game, that ♥♥♥♥ happens in real life all the time.\n\nHowever, although I might pick it up again eventually, especially to try out some mods. My biggest problem with the game was that it got very boring after a day of play. Overall though, it's a strong recommendation for anyone who's a fan of old school Tycoon games.","December 30, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Made only by 2 people Game Dev Tycoon proves to be a very positive start to Greenheart Games, providing smooth and addictive gameplay.\n\nGameplay: Simple to grasp and very diverse it offers a good in depth look at the game industry and allows you to make repetitive COD games and watch them flop as they should. Gameplay is heavily addictive and makes you want to keep playing until you make that big block buster game and then keeps you striving to best that one. I have nearly 10 hours in just two days which is a rather high amount.\n\nPros:\n\n-Game has workshop support and there's lots of mods on the shop I can't say if they're good because I'm too busy with the base game to get into the mods atm but I'll update this review later. *UPDATE* so ive broswed the steam workshop for this game and there is a fair amount of mods that add some nice content to the game. That being said the workshop support definetly adds to the games worth.\n\n-Very easy to get the hang of.\n\n- Has real life consoles (renamed to avoid copy right) and has some real game industry history behind them like the PS2 putting Sega out of business or the Sony VS Microsoft feud.\n\n- Allows you to make mobile and handheld/portable games (I.E. Apple Phone,Nintendo DS,PSP. ETC)\n\n- You can make your own console to compete with other developers and then make games exclusivly for your console.\n\n-Can take part in industrail sabatage.\n\n-Real life hazards. (I.E. Credit Card Fraud, Games not living up to hype resulting in poor sales, People pirating your games. ETC)\n\n- Played for 10 hours and havent incountered any bugs or glitches which is a big PRO.\n\n- Very diverse and has a lot of depth and really provides some cool insight into the game industry.\n\n\nNeutral:\n\n- Can feel like good ratings are luck based at times but in the real game industry thats sometimes the case so not a negative or positive.\n\n- It can feel like a bit of a grind to increase the stats of your employees (I.E. increasing Tech, Design, Speed)\n\n- You Can't set the price of your games. Games sell at fixed rates which doesnt ruin gameplay but takes away from the immersion a little.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Game can eventually feel repetitive.\n\n- Not a lot of generes (I.E. When making a game you can pick from only a few generes that are popular ones but none the less you have limited selection and no way of unlocking more (you can unlock the casual games but thats the only one to my knowledge) ***Will update if I find a way outside the workshop to get more***\n\n- *** No more cons that I can think of currently for game dev tycoon. If I find some I will post them here.\n\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\nExplanation for Rating: Game Dev Tycoon for its low price of $10.99 (CAD) offers solid gameplay and gives you your moneys worth. For a game made by two people it sure was well developed and thought out. The game has no major bugs or glitches that I have encountered yet. Greenheart games have given it Steam Workshop support which more game devs should follow suit in as its an easy way to allow fans of the game to continue to add to the game by making mods which double as free DLC. If the game had the things I mentioned in the neutral section and found a way to maybe fix the cons this would easily be a 10/10 but for their first game a 9.5 is solid better than what I did in Game Dev Tycoon I got a meazly 5.25.","March 22","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codex14/recommended/239820/","codex14","Codex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codex14/","6 products in account","Genre: Casual/Simulation\n\nOverview: While the repetative nature of this game will limit the amount of fun you will have in subsequent replays, the initial playthrough was incredibly fun and addictive and took me somewhere between 6-8 hours to "finish" the game.\n\nReplay Value: After you are scored, you have the option to continue playing, but past this point no new technologies, systems, etc. will appear in the game and you are left with making games for whatever the last gen of consoles is (or for your own console). After playing around with various combinations of genres, you can import the effectiveness ratings for any new games that you make in a new playthrough.\n\nGameplay: Many people who pick up this game have likely come across Game Dev Story from Kairosoft. Obvious influence aside, this game adds its own flavor to the game dev "genre." Without spoiling too much, eventually the game opens up to give the player many options through building a research team. The progression is streamlined and feels complete. The player starts in a garage and eventually finds himself the head of a major gaming corporation. With this progression, the complexity of the game changes drastically, but, for the most part, these changes are largely cosmetic in nature. The core gameplay is not particularly deep or even challenging. Any gaming vet will know which combinations work vs. which don't through common sense alone, without the need for a guide to hold your hand.\n\nPrice/Value: Overall, expect to invest somewhere between 10-20 hours on this game. If this is something you deem fair for a $10 price tag, then by all means go for it. Those 10-20 hours will be a lot of fun. However, if longetivity is your concern, then perhaps wait for a steam sale. At the time of this writing, the game is on sale for $5. At this price I can wholeheartedly recommend you pick it up.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 31, 2014","true","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was waiting until Steam Sale to purchase this game, due to lack of reviews/people talking about it. You see, I'm a big fan of Tycoon games, and its easy to play one of this genre and see a lot of mistakes/bugs ruining the gameplay. This is not true to GDT. If I knew what I know now, I'd purchase this game right away.\n\nCombining a good mixture of good design and gameplay, Greenheart Games made me feel like the little guy in the garage building my first game. You see, with Tycoon games you usually see yourself as the manager or some kind of God Like creature. In this title I felt so compelled to strive that I couldn't wait to release my major game and everytime a so-so review came in, I felt dissapointed.\n\nThe pacing is great. Along the years you see consoles rise and fall and new technologies appear. Eventually you move out of your little garage and a office takes place. Then a fellow co-worker or two...And when you realize, its been 20 years already and you're a multi-million game dev studio, with lots of employees and each one with a different skill.\n\nAlthough the interface is not winning Design award of the Year, it's still very user friendly, and will leave no room for doubt as to where things are and how they work.\n\nThis game takes me back to the time where I found a sentiment of "wonder" in games. Greenheart Games, thanks for the experience.\n\n\n"I can't wait for the sequel!"\n- Tarik Ventura","December 6, 2013","true","19.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

In the beginning you startup like almost every Indie-developer, in your own house(in this case a garage). You have a relative small budget to start off with, and few variations on which platform to publish your games, but the thing is that every single thing in this game evolve with time.\nThe first time you play it, you only have a few good selling games, and when I say a few, I mean like 1-5 max. But when the world understands what great games are, then you just have to figure out know when they are ready for different genres and specific platforms.\n\nAfter the first time I opened the game, I played for 6 straight hours nonstop. I had so much fun, and every single detail in the game made sense and I was nervous for every single review.\n\nIf you ever feel bored, and want to try something new, buy this game, you won't regret it... it's way too much fun.","December 1, 2013","true","20.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After playing around with various combinations of genres, you can import the effectiveness ratings for any new games that you make in a new playthrough.\n\nGameplay: Many people who pick up this game have likely come across Game Dev Story from Kairosoft. Obvious influence aside, this game adds its own flavor to the game dev "genre." Without spoiling too much, eventually the game opens up to give the player many options through building a research team. The progression is streamlined and feels complete. The player starts in a garage and eventually finds himself the head of a major gaming corporation. With this progression, the complexity of the game changes drastically, but, for the most part, these changes are largely cosmetic in nature. The core gameplay is not particularly deep or even challenging.

The game does well in some aspects such as money management, giving you wild genres to have fun with, and is suprisingly a lot of fun because it lets you make games with awful titles and doesn't care. I would love to see an actual in depth game like this, but Game Dev Tycoon fails on major issues like actually giving you feedback on the games you develop.  It's basically a hit and miss with games you make, sometimes you can make what you feel is a really good game, yet get awful scores and no reason on why it was terrible, giving you no way to improve on your skills. Then the game doesn't go into depth in the right places like what you're putting your work into during the dev stage, is design going into the style of the tracks, or is it going to the whole overall game including the scenery, people cheering and such. I like the game, it's fun, worth the four dollars it was on sale for (even though it was gifted to me), it has nice music, it gets a bit boring after awhile but still nice, and sort of gives you the basic feel of being a dev, I went backrupt a lot but that was mostly because I didn't have any idea on how to improve my games. 6/10, get it maybe during the Holiday Sale if you can.","December 7, 2013","true","24.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Serius deh, gue berusaha banget untuk mencari review atau testimonial tentang game ini. kenapa? karena gue gak pengen menghabiskan $4 untuk game kelas mini yang wtf banget. yup gue orangnya emang segitu pelitnya. tapi gue bukanlah tipikal gamer yang "grafik ftw" selama "gameplay ftw" dan ternyata... begitu pertama main, gue langsung 8 jam duduk didepan laptop gak bergerak! anjir ini game bener bener asik gila!\n\nGrafik: MINI GAME FACEBOOK. Lo inget gak farmville, Texas Holdem Poker, atau Ninja Wars? Yup itu adalah game game di facebook di era tahun 2010an. Grafik yang ada Game Dev Tycoon pun satu kelas dengan game seperti itu. Screen shot yang lo liat di store adalah keseluruhan dari game. Yup. bener bener gitu aja. selama 9 jam gue memandangi kantor gue tapi anehnya gue gak merasa bosen. Justru sebaliknya, gue bahkan BERMIMPI berada dikantor itu saking kepengin untuk bermain lagi.\n\nGameplay: MASTERPIECE. Nah ini baru game yang bener bener game. Tujuan dari game ini adalah membuat game paling ngehit sejagat raya.. untuk bisa melakukan itu lo butuh pegawai, data research, pelatihan, fasilitas, contract, console, waktu yang tepat, marketing, daaaaaaan masih banyak lagi. sampai sekarang pun gue belum bisa menguasai semua faktor yang ada ddalam game karena BUANYAK SEKALI variasi yang bisa muncul dari game ini. percaya deh, 9 jam kurang main beginian.\n\nGue berani kasih skor 8 dari 10 karena game ini benar benar mengunci perhatian. Lo bakalan dituntut untuk membuat kerajaan yang besar, kerajaan yang menguasai pasar pasar game. Kerajaan yang mengikuti milyaran pemuja. kerajaan yang... besar deh pokoknya.\n\nSerius, untuk harga $5 ini bener bener worth banget.","June 22, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You are supposedly warped back in time to 1985 to a reference-filled (hint: flux capacitor) garage, where you begin your endeavour into the gaming history books. Like any developer who travels in time to 1985, you are absolute ♥♥♥♥ at programming because the technology is so different.  You have a computer that's literally worse than a modern graphing calculator, yet you decide to make games. If you are successful, you can grow your garage into an actual company, with actual people, and actual results. You have to strategically market your games for specific audiences (you know, like "T for Teen" or "E for Everyone") and try to match genres to different gaming platforms to different audiences.\n\nFor example, kids. In the real world, devices like the Nintendo DS (which reminds me, tell you later) or the great old Gameboy are very popular. Add a role-playing/ adventure game like the Legend of Zelda, and you're all set. Target marketing at young people, and kaboom: ez skins, ez life. Although "skins" probably means nothing to the world of the 1980s and 90s.\n\nSo, now, about the NDS. The developers, in an effort to give you a good laugh, and avoid copyright infringement, have sort of parodied every console on the market. If I'm correct, the Nintendo GameCube's counterpart is the GameSphere. It's actually kinda freaking amazing.\n\nI'll give GDT a solid 8, maybe an 8.5 because of the extensive workshop mod support.\n\nTL;DR: Time travel to 1985, make games, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es, get money. 8.5/10","May 13","true","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","0"

Its a truly interesting game becuase it shouldn't be this freaking fun! The game is both interesting as you are a game developer but the game is still limited by the developers budget nonetheless and the whole game shows that. However, it can be a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend that people pick it up. The onky issues are its oviously limited gameplay mechanics in regards to its game design and its set up but nonetheless once you ahve beaten it there is still much to play but they is depending on your own opinion.\n\nFinal Score: 80/100","January 2, 2014","true","37.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Go ahead! What about a School Adventure game for the expy of the PS4? Sure! You can do that! Hell, even naming these games is humourus on its own, such as a hit from my pre-steam version of the Game: Mary Teaches Sleeping, which got 10s across the board.\n\nWhen you've played long enough, you can create a custom console, which, in all sakes and purposes, practically becomes a Steam Machine, in which you'd want everything on your own console and PC only, as that generates profit, either that, or you can create MMOs, which are costly as all hell, but if you can maintain enough balance to keep them running, you'll be a Trilionaire\n\nAnd Acheievements? There are a ton of references to Gaming Culture in here, like making a game that includes Red Barrels, or taking up an offer from a Cave Johnson Expy, or even the silly achievements like "Take too long coming up with a name for your game" or something along those lines.\n\nTo put it simply, Game Dev Tycoon is one of those games that unleashes your creativity, and if you're silly, or insane, or just have a downright hilarious imaginaton, this game is for you.","December 13, 2014","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game 2 days ago because I happened to see it was on sale and I figured I should try this.\n\nI have not opened any other game besides this one for the past 3 days. What's surprising is that this is the first game (after a few years) that has had me glued to seat just playing for hours on end. That should tell a lot about the quality of this game.\n\nThe only thing I regret about my purchase is that I should have bought this a long time ago. I was hooked for hours. I had to restrain myself from playing because it's just that addicting.\n\nIf you're a fan of business simulation games and are somewhat familiar with the game industry, you should definitely give this a try.","November 30, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I quite enjoy the simplicity of it, granting the player a great deal of freedom while always having their own goals and targets. In many ways this game returns to the heart of what made simulation games good, back when simulation was the top of the industry. To think that this quality of process was given by a couple of previously unheard of programmers really puts the flaws of modern industry into perspective.\n\nPick this up if you want a simple yet addictive game to toy with the idea of developing other games...

It's quite simple really, just develop games and hope that it is succesful. But what Greenheart Games has accomplished is more than that. This game turned out to be very addictive and I ended up playing around 30 hours of it before I started to get bored. The graphics are nothing to smile about, but the gameplay is. As you get better at game development you unlock better things to make your games better. There are also funny spin-offs to real life companies and the game also taps into the rivalries aswell making it unique and new. There are lots of things that you can do in this game and there are some easter eggs which I will let you find for yourself. However it can be quite repetitive at times aswell as  your development team that can get annoying aswell. Personally I think it was generally a good game but I wouldn't recommend to people who are not into game development as it is this games only target audience.\n\n8/10","October 18, 2014","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes several playthroughs before you know enough about all of the various systems, genres, and concepts to really be constantly churning out good quality games, and even then you will often release a game that you just can't believe didn't get better reviews.

You start out solo as a freelancer and thus cant make your AAA games early on you need to recruit others howver you cant do that in the tutorial (since you are ecantially making games ain your basement to start) you do eventually upgrade to skyscaper and get to make the games you dreamed of (well since its a simulation game like sim city its not like you need to do everything yourself)\n\nOk hows the gameplay? Well first you get 4 random topics (like horror, mystery, etc) then you pick a genre then you have to go though the enire process of making the game from beginning to end its automatic however you have to distrube your funds and effort to different things in order for your game to work. For example RPG dont need high quality music you need to focus on gameplay and story nearly 100%, however a dancing game its a very bad idea to ignore music you are asking for the game to take your money. you must spend research points to unlock more (which is rencondmended)\n\nThe object of the game like I said above build an empire starting in the 80s (yes the 80s and see the entire gaming intrustry evolve around you) in 1992 the snes comes out, in 1996 the n64 comes out by then are you good enough to make games for that system?  Its not easy you lose money every week but you can gain massive money back if you get a blockbuster. Its a good idea to memorize what happened in real life will you invest in the sega cd or the dreamcast uh....The sad part is every event happens in the same order on every playthough but you can try to make different games to see how it goes one game you can try lots of RPGs another go for more Action games its all up to you.\n\nThe game uses a rating system remember gamespot and ign? well they are all in game yes with pardoyed names but every time you make a game and delete all the bugs (its a bad idea not too) they rate you depending on where you put the focus on the most. Also they take into effect the system you publisjhed on (they are graphic you know if you dont keep up with the times they will destroy you with their rating of 1-3/10 ouch >_>) Trying to please the pro gamers is very hard and part of the fun getting a perfect score is challenging and there are so many factors that can lower your score. Overall it makes the game much better too..\n\nOk some game hints since this is a very hard game and you probably wont make it to the end on a 1st playthough. First you need to figure out what kinda game you want to make (dont do same the types of genre in a row however do keep focusing on that since you can level up in that style <for example doing lots of RPG skyrockets your story, world building, and dialogue exp bar a lot while doing lots of Action skyrocket your graphics, gameplay, and level design exp bars>)\n\nremember once you unlock sequel this is a huge opurtunity to do it since if its a sequel to a 10/10 you did earlier but with better graphics/sound/ and features the reviewers are going to love it and you gain lots of hype since the gamers know that you are making a game to a game they loved in the past.\n\nAlso another mistake beginners make is recruiting way too good employees dont go for the best of the employee you do pay them all by the month (in addion to rent costs) starting with low skilled employees and then training then over time allows the costs to remain reasonable and overall make sense in real life (no newbie company hires top tier employees they cant afford them but the employees that stay with the company for a long time gets better and can even surpass the so called great employees that demand crazy monthy prices.\n\nAlso another mistake beginners make is not make games for publishers until they get a fanbase (usually around 100k fans is a good number to start making your own games without help) when you are making games for other companies like Nintendo, tecmo, and many others. You only get a % of the money but your fans skyrocket really its much better in the long run so ya...once you move out of the basement its best to work for others for a while to get the fans to know you.\n\nsince the quality of the games is on your employee skill levels you should train them until they are in the 500's in design,tech, and reseasch.  With stats that high they can specialze which allows you to make even better games. Once you get 6 employees spend the time to get employees with over 700 in either tech or design (this is the only time you should hire top tier employees if you need a specialist asap and you can afford his outragous monthy price) and pay to make him a specilist (which is 200 research points and a million dollars and 3-6 weeks training) they will pay off in the long run once someone has 700 design (or you hire him) and you pay for the training you unlock the design area where the final two graphic upgrades and otehr amazing upgrades are. a 700 tech that you pay the price upgrading him can unlock the area where you can make your own gaming system which will be much better then even the playstation 5, xbox1, and wii u yes you will dominate everything once you make your own gaming console.  Some speicists require 725 tech or design <_< though.\n\nRemember the main character (you) has amazing stats 300 in everything and 0 monthy costs. Never gets tired ever. But he still can get confused (stops the bar while you scratch your head its random) Train him well hes the best character in the whole game by the end its not uncommon to have him with 600 in everything (even speed which is the most useless stat) while remaining free and has infinite stamina (no need to go on a vacation). And the best part he can specilize :D totally worth it to do that too.\n\nOk the another hint I'll give is marketing it is really useless in the beginning (since you dont have many fans) however once you start making bigger games (esp the AAA games) you need to market or else no one will know you are working on the game and thus all your hard work and effort will be unknown. Yes marketing is great and all however the big opportuny to gain media attention is the G4 (A parody) You can choose a small,medium, or large booth once a year and this generates so much hype. Once you are a multi millionare and is making a huge game with lots of features picking the big booth will skyrocket your hype and make tons of fans to buy the game day one rather then wait. Yes you will get the money you spent on marketing back if you do a good job.\n\nLast hint If you get a 10/10 game and you see the words the other publishers are giving jealous looks the pro gamers from then on will lower your overall score. Yes they are comparing all your future games to that masterpiece it can ruin the rest of your game. A good tip is dont go for your magnum opus too early or else the reviewers will expect too much from you and kill your score on the next game. Since the game lasts 35 years on an avg playthough go for the best of the best nearing the end.\n\nThe biggest component is your graphics always keep that up to date and make new engines to run them (you need a design specialist with 700 design points and pay the requirement for the upgrade) to get the final two upgrades for graphics with the final one being holographic technology which is really cool.\n\nOverall its a great game little short but at only $10 you get to expierence the gaming world from a game maker pov from the 1980 all the way to 2015 (yes the future) once it reaches that the games over your high score is tallyed and the game ends...on a first play though getting straght 10/10 ratings from all the pro reviewers is really a pain in the neck but its so rewarding once you finally see the 11/10 and the AAA badge for making a masterpiece game. OR if you're adventerious try to make an MMO without getting a game over that is very hard to pull off...","April 19, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Does it matter?  I don't think so, should no one else be allowed to make a city simulator because Maxis made SimCity first?  The fact is this game is a lot of fun.\n\nPROS:\n-Good graphics.  Really pretty.  Not going to max out your gpu, but the cartooney style looks nice\n-Sound.  Its hard to explain but the music and all the little sound effects are really pleasant.  It'll keep you from getting fatigued.\n-Re-playability.  You might put in say 10 or 20 hours and feel like you have done it all, but like other sims you should be able to come back at a later date and have lots of fun all over again.\n\nCONS:\n-Some of the genre/topics don't work when they should.  Like Werewolf and RPG is a terrible combo - Why?  Ever heard of "Wolf Among Us?"\n-The game isn't very random, you could basically play THE EXACT same strategy and turn of events each play through and have the same outcome\n-The whole game is based on your title's scores.  The scores are based upon your previous scores.  I really don't like this, by the end of the game it becomes harder and harder to get titles earning 10/10 marks.  In other words, to get a second 10/10 game it has to be better than the previous 10/10 game.\n\nOverall - this game is really fun and I definitely recommend it to sim fans of any type.","January 19, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Totally worth the price, sometimes sort of stutters and sometimes when you click buttons they dont work until you click them 5 times, hope the developers release some updates to fix these small glitches :D A great game recommended to anyone who is either curios about game development and/or a fan of tycoons :D","December 1, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked it.  It's not as good as Game Dev story, though.  Very similar, for sure, but it tells a story of (your) game company more than anything.\n\nIt's very simplistic and easy to figure out, though.  Bit of a rough start because nothing is really explained, but once you start figuring things out, yeah, you kind of just blast through it.\n\nMy biggest gripe -- and this holds true for game dev story as well -- is that this is just a number simulator.  There really isn't anything going on that makes this experience specifically about video games.  You build some characters and they do things effectively and then you win.  Raise the numbers and then all the things.\n\nI liked it enough to play through a couple of times, though, and I suppose that's saying something.  It's a nice game to chill out with.\n\nOne thing: some of the achievements for this game are super convoluted and suck to get, and a few are really, really RNG based.  I don't really like achievements that go along the lines of "just keep doing this and maybe you'll get lucky!"  Meh.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty niche game so don't be surprised if you end up not liking it.  The entire game is, literally, about raising numbers.","July 3, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thinking it would be a game that would collect dust in my Steam librarary, I was surely proven wrong when I started this game up on my Mac due to a lack of Mac compatible games in my library. My first experience on Game Dev Tycoon was frustrating. I spent my time trying to figure out why I couldn't make a game that could get more than 4 stars. This made me more determined to succeed. After about three restars of my game company, I finally was able to efficiently manage my research to create games that got 7+ stars. You would think that a semi-linear game that has the same events occur at the same time through every playthrough would get boring but I found myself only getting more and more addicted. The micromanagement and depth put into developing games on this simulator will keep you hooked for hours. I still find myself wanting to continue my adventures on Game Dev Tycoon after vesting 21+ hours of gameplay into it.","July 20, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From there on out you have to use your limited budget to try and develop games, grow your fanbase, and hopefully move your company out of your parents garage.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple and user-friendly which is fantastic for the beginning player but can get a tad tedious once you're on your 7th or 8th run through of the game, that's not to say it makes the game less enjoyable but it would have definitely been a plus if the game let you get a little more hands-on at points. As the game progresses you get to choose which consoles you want to purchase a developing license for, as well as create new game engines as new technology becomes available to you. Careful portioning of your budget is vital to gameplay and a rash spender will soon find themselves bankrupt and bought out.\n\nThe game is incredibly simple but has a fun, addictive quality that certainly kept me playing for a good long while and I'm sure that most of you will enjoy as well!\n","September 18, 2014","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can make awesome games, engines, and find some easter eggs in the game too! Basically, you start off in a small garage and make a game, which can be about any of the 4 random topics you recieve (ex: Post Apocolyptic, Aliens, Pirates, Evolution) and go with those. You can make lots of different combos, hire staff, get awesome offices, and maybe even hire someone famous!

BUT, and for a "tycoon/sim" type game this is a huge BUT.\n\nYou can't change the speed at which time flows.\n\n8 hours of game play and 35 Years later (if you don't go bancrupt) and the game is over, technically. I would have loved to have been able to slow the time down because there are lots of things to do in the game but as soon as you hit year 35 and the game tells you that you did a good job, well done, it doesn't feel like it's worth continuing anymore just to make further technical achievements, but you can continue, you can keep going even though you shouldn't be able to live that long (achievement for worlds oldest game developer?).\n\nAnyway. Had the game not run at lightening speed throughout I would say this game is really, really awesome. Sadly that's not the case, It's not quite perfect but I would recommend it - even if you can finish the 35 Years in one day if you were so inclined.","August 17, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players are tasked with starting a game development company and controlling the development and release of games as the years pass. New technology is introduced as time passes, which can play a role in how you wish to develop your games and company. The game is scripted to have release events of real consoles (named slightly differently for copyright reasons I am guessing). The release of these consoles is actually quite comical- you'd just have to play to see what I mean.\n\nGames can be named, sequels can be made to games. Research can be done to unlock tech, employees can be selected and hired and trained and their roles can be specialized so that areas such as "World Design" or "Artificial Intelligence" can be professionally implemented in your games. You can control which employee works on which part of the game and how much time they have to spend.. different types of games will favor you spending more time in different areas. For example, RPG games will require you to allot more time in World Design and Story/Quests.\n\nOverall, the design mechanics are a bit repetitive, but if you wish to have a lot of variety you can choose to develop different kinds of games. I was continually pleasantly surprised at how much detail was in the game and how much you could actually control and do. You can eventually create your own console, MMO's and even expansion packs.\n\nThe economy of the game is forgiving enough for new players, but in order to succeed to a high degree you would need to think carefully about what you are doing.\n\nThe first night I played, I played almost all night and managed to basically finish the main story line. That being said, I felt like there was a choice of pathways. I could go back to this game and not feel as though it was the exact same experience. Is there unlimited replayability? The short answer is no, but if you have a good imaginination, you could have fun almost every time you decide to play.\n\n","December 27, 2013","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much going in, but it had a fun idea and it was on sale so I gave it a shot and have ended up loving it.  It has just the right balance where it's pretty easy to learn, difficult to master and despite a simple and user friendly interface and design it can get challenging and has a relatively fast pace and in game clock and while I will admit I think it maybe moves too fast  in that regard as even the most successful of your games won't stay on the market much longer than a minute and a quarter.  Still, there's a flow to the game and its worth toying with and has a nice depth and I do like the fact that it gives you more control over the actual services the company you run provides, in fact the game actually eschews the model of designing your building and micromanaging dozens of employees almost entirely in favour of static levels (Though you still have win conditions based on how much moolah you have and how effecient your workers are) and instead puts the meat of the game into having a direct influence on your studios games from naming them, creating custom engines for them, selecting their marketing, choosing who develops what aspect of a game (At least when you get to medium game projects) and researching new development aspects and parts for your next in-house Engine.\n\nAdmittedly I'm pretty bad, I have finally gotten to a point where I can usually make it up to the release of the "DreamVast" and "PlaySystem 2" but almost always lose all my capital right around the time the "mBox" shows up.  I honestly don't fully know why, it seems I could take a winning formula and give it over 120 points in both areas, set a record, and then still get scores of 1 and 3 and then watch as my fans and my money get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ away.\n\nOh well, it's still a lot of fun and that's the point, ain't it?

You re on your own, in your garage / working station, creating your company somewhere in the late 80's, with a passion to make it to the continuously evolving gaming industry. Your only tool is your pc and your only companion is your creativity.\n\nThe game progresses through the ages, following loyaly the evolution of gaming, providing you with news from the companies as to their upcoming plans for gaming and technology to support it (both on consoles and pc) as well as the current tendencies of the gaming audience (i.e. there is a current tendency for strategy games), giving you opportunities to deliver something that will appeal more and more to your growing fanbase.\n\nAs you are becoming more and more successfull on what you re doing, the game allows you to "evolve", taking your company to new, bigger offices and with the potential of hiring the first members of your company's staff. Each of them can be chosen based on their specialties (design, technology etc) so that they can provide a valuable asset to what your company needs most at any given moment.\n\nBut for me, it s the little details that make this game shine. As your company is getting bigger and more successfull, the game provides you with random, sort of "pop up" choices that do fit to how a gaming company can handle certain things. From fan requests to possible "foul play" on your companies side or staff requests. The decisions you make have an impact on various things. Fanbase, staff productivity, market acceptance etc etc.\n\nTo sum this up (and not spoil the fun this game can deliver), if you want to take a break from "hardcore" gaming and want a casual but funny and addicting game dev simulator, I highly recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Low system requirements\n-Escalating but enjoyable difficulty\n-Gives the potential of going in depth to it but not as a necessity\n-Amusing way of avoiding copyright infringements\n-Personalised skill development for each of your staff\n-Steam Workshop support\n-High replayability potential\n\nCons:\n\n-Could give the player a little more insight as to what you re doing wrong or right (although you can figure out things... through "pain" :P )\n-Sometimes it gives you the feeling that the years go by really fast, making developing titles for particular consoles a bit pointless. Unless you re willing to keep buying licences for the next gen consoles that their companies make.\n\nOverall score: 9/10\n\nFor what this game is and does, it s a gem!\n\n\nPersonal note / tip for new players\n\nRight now my company is in a big office, with 7 people as staff (me included) and we ve made a name in the gaming industry, being currently at the 15 spot (out of 100) in game conventions, with a 70+ million budget and still going. So my advice to you is to be, think and act like you want the real gaming companies to be.\n\nBe modest.\n\nOnce you make a couple of successfull titles and see the money filling your bank account, don t go cocky. Don t start buying expensive, highly educated personel (more than you can afford), in the hope that your next title will also be a success. Or you ll be in for a surprise... Take it slow instead. Listen to your fanbase, fulfill their requests as long as they are logical and keep it like that. When you re giving an interview, don t overhype your games. Cause if you do and the game doesn t live up to the expactations, it s gonna be double the fall. Don t worry about growing your fan base. Fans will come as long as your company stays true to it s original ideals and passion for gaming.","March 15, 2015","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A simple and helpful interface and straightfoward goal along with the rather realistic random events and procedures all help make this game very replayable for hours. If you are interested on what it would be like to be your favorite dev team or just want to be in charge of a company without the stress, then this is the game for you. However, this game could use more options for running the company, such as realeasing alpha or beta versions of a game or allowing preorders. Just my opinion, though.

Now this first sentence maybe enough to make you want it, if it does get it, trust me. However if you are still unsure here is why you shouldn't be:\n-This game features you making games starting from the 1980's meaning you go throught the whole gaming history from the start of gaming jsut being a text adventure to the 3D AAA games we get today.\n-Your games get reviewed which adds a huge amount of replayability to the game as you really want to get that 10/10 game and feel like a genius.\n\nHowever this game does fall short in some aspects it's biggest being it's extremely casual gameplay and graphics. Most of the game you will be simply pulling sliders up and down and while this is not a bad thing it would be nice to maybe have seen a more advanced game making system.\n\nOverall get this game if you have ever wanted to be Game Developer or in fact just like strategy games because this game is quite a good one at that.\nFINAL SCORES:\nSound= 7/10 Graphics=3/10 Gameplay= 7/10 Replayability=9/10 Overall= 8/10","April 19, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This review will just air out a few points of mild contention; perhaps my half-cocked ideas will inspire someone  more capable of realizing my dreams than I am.\n\nI have played and replayed this game to exhaustion, so my point of view may be coloured by the fact that I've seen just about everything the game has to offer, but... it doesn't seem as deep as it advertises.\n\nSure, you can research a ton of things to improve the quality and popularity of your game, and even make your own console. I won't deny that making a library of your own game titles is cool. Unfortunately, the game-making process in GDT isn't a very visual process. The graphics quality is represented with a version number and a price tag. How nice does 2D Graphics V3 look? Is it Super Nintendo level? Is it Playstation quality? The sound quality is a single button. You never see any mock up of the game's visuals or a sample of the game's sound. I'm not saying it needs to be particularly complicated, but a bit of sound sample coming from the staff computers during development, and maybe a mocked up screenshot added to the game review page, would be a good way to make the game a little more immersive.\n\nA deeper timeline of the game industry wouldn't be too bad, either. GDT seems to be trying to preach about how hard it is to be a developer while giving the "opponents" during the random events (the basement modders, the software pirates, All Your IP Are Belong To Us, etc) enough of a twirly moustache to say they've at least thrown a tea cozy over the message. It's "subtle". Maybe I've just seen it so many times that it feels obvious. I'm not opposed to the notion that making a video game these days is not exactly a picnic. What I would like to see are a few things that are more dramatic. I'm willing to bet everyone who has bought this game wanted to be a fledgling Nintendo humiliating the out-of-touch Atari - or to be the scheming Wile E. Coyote-style Atari trying to undermine Nintendo's rampant success. Or they wanted to be Sony eating up Microsoft's embarassing press coverage. What we get to be is a game developer with seemingly no competitors, no partnerships and no "friends in high places". Just publishers commissioning games and some government contractors who want your little game studio to calculate their space shuttle launch stuff for them.\n\nWhat I like about the game is that every library of games you make will be different in terms of combinations, titles, and levels of success. What I don't like is that you don't get attached to any of it. My save files for GDT are very disposable and I am constantly overwriting them with new games.\n\nHopefully a sequel or an update will add more depth, because I think it deserves it.","October 16, 2014","true","92.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have any interest in tycoon/business games even if you have no experience with them, this game is perfect for you. The game gradually builds up so learn as the game progesses but it never gives you the overwhelming feeling from being too complex. The game actually follows the history of video game consoles pretty well, even going as far as making realistic predictions of what the next generation of consoles will be (After the Xbox ONE and PS4). So those also interested in video games (which if you're on steam then you probably are) will enjoy the history lesson that's incorporated perfectly into the game.\n\nYou really must try this game out and it is definitely worth the $10, and if you manage to get it while it's on sale then it's a steal. Try the game out you will love it and spend countless hours building your game dev empire.","December 22, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is so simple, yet there is so much to do. I wouldnt say that this is the kinda game where you get to explore new stuff, like minecraft. But once you get to the 3rd office things start to get really awesome. I like the idea of how you go through the gaming industry, starting in the early years, and not only get to develop games, but also gets to put them out on different consoles and give them different topics and later also make AAA and ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. It is also awesome that you get the research and hardware lab, though i think som tweaking to the hardware and research lab would be needed, so that you could use them for more stuff. I also think that they could give us more opportunities, like instead of the same offices you could every time you played invest in a different office, lets say you hit the 1M it would be cool if you got the opportunity to move into the techonolgy park, or to move into a industrial part of a city, and the different places would be cheaper or more expensive and have different perks. Else i cannot think of much more i would like to have added to this game, all i can say is that i cant wait for Greenheart's next game.\n//Freddy","November 28, 2013","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
