"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/441060/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: The conclusion of the mystery crime adventure trilogy, with about 2 hours of playtime.\n\nI'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible. I will do some references to the first and second Chapters and spoiler-tag as necessary.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is likely biased in some way since I was a beta tester in the late phase of the development. This means that I saw the main product a couple of weeks before the release and produced a log of bugs I found. I put out writing this review for a long time because of the fact but I think my opinion can still be valuable to a potential buyer and does not conflict with my relation with the developer, whom I asked whether it's okay for me to write one.\n\nIt's time for the epic conclusion! Silver Creek Falls - Chapter 3 tells what happens to the protagonist of the series, detective Sara, and her pals after the murder investigation they did in the preceding chapters. If you played Chapter 2, you know that Lee is alive and knows way more than you - the story picks out from there immediately.\n\nComparison time!\nMy main complaint about Chapter 2 was that it lacked focus. That is not an issue here: instead, SCF3 keeps the pace up and story proceeds rapidly the whole time.\n\nFor instance there's no aimless wandering around the town looking for a certain place like previously. Instead the locations are usually nicely compact, albeit linear. The scenes might still be big though, so remember that you can run by pressing SHIFT (Cpt. Obvious here: I played it on keyboard).\n\nI congratulated Chapter 2 for its awesome sleuthing puzzles. With a more focused and consequently more linear story, it's no surprise that the puzzles are now more immediate and frankly easier, with both less complexity and intrigue to them.\n\nIt follows that this time you probably won't get stuck for a long time on puzzles. However, one puzzle had long corridors and it would take 10 minutes to run through it even if you knew what to do already.\n\nThere's a lot of dialogue. Dialogues are like before: good but quite long, bringing out the personality of the talkers. Characters are expressive and talkative. Sara comments on virtually every bin and bush you care to inspect.\n\nBy expressive I mean that in the dialogue the characters' expressions change and show their emotions over the dialogue. This is a cool and important detail that I now both expect and usually miss when playing other RPGMaker/adventure games that lack them.\n\nSpeaking of which, mind you that RPGMaker engine unfortunately limits the resolution to 640x480. Also, screenshots are troublesome to take because F12 resets the game and Steam Overlay doesn't work correctly with it (you need to find the instructions for screenshots and uploading them at the forums).\n\nEpic (?) conclusion\nAlong the story many questions have risen. Mysteries, conspiracies and secrecy unfolds over the story in Chapter 3. However, the climax of Chapter 3 and the epilogue rise new questions, and admittedly the climax is not the stereotypic "all's good and solved, let's go home" type that one would expect.\n\nI didn't mind it but some players might be disappointed by the ending, leaving some new critical questions unanswered, especially with the epilogue. While it is certainly an ending, there's a sort of cliffhanger there. This opens space for a sequel or a spin-off.\n\nEpilogue\nI think the game took me about 2 hours to finish the first time. This is difficult to assess exactly since I played it in an extremely slow pace, exploring and stopping here and there to test and write down stuff for bug reports. Afterwards, I completed it in 1 hour when just going for the achievements but by then I also knew all the puzzle solutions by heart.\n\nI obviously got the game for free for beta testing but I think the 5 € price is pretty good if you don't mind the relatively short length of about 2 hours. Especially if you liked the first two chapters, just go for it: you won't be disappointed.","May 2","true","9.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started by playing Chapter 1 thinking it would be a nice way to burn an hour in between going to lunch with friends then going to the gym. I ended up skipping the gym to buy and play chapters 2 and 3 because I was so hooked.\n\nThere is a power to story heavy adventure games done in 2D that just doesn't always happen in 3D and this trilogy definitely has it. The graphics have a unique charm and the music is awesome.  That ending really got to me.\n\nOne little thing though, I do recommend that future players play all 3 in sequence as there are so many details and pieces to the mystery and you'd only understand the final bit if you you paid attention and remembered all the details.","April 16","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is a puzzle that is a bit of a chore to do, but once you work it out and write notes so you can do it correctly (instead of pulling up the menu then inventory then selecting the item to look at lots of times) then its not too much hassle  :)\n\nI would recommend this game (and the other 2 chapters!) and REALLY look forward to the conclusion of the story/the offshoot ideas planned for the future!","May 18","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magistrmdc777/recommended/441060/","magistrmdc777","MaGistR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magistrmdc777/","31 products in account","I watched the Let’s Plays of Chapter 1 and 2 of this series on YouTube and it looked like so much fun that I decided to buy Chapter 3 myself so that I could have the pleasure of finishing the story at my own pace. As you know, adventure games are all about story, and you won't be disappointed with this installment in the series. It has that same pulp mystery movie feel to it that Chapter 1 and 2 has!\n\nI have to say that I was surprised with the ending! Even though a lot of it gets explained very quickly at the grand finale I was pretty satisfied overall, that is until they had the cliffhanger after the credits!\n\nThe overall feel and gameplay was very similar to Chapters 1 and 2, so if you liked those then this title will definitely not disappoint. Now it is longer than Chapter 1 but is shorter than Chapter 2. I’d say it has more “content” in terms of following the main story arc, but has far less open world and has no big maps like Chapter 2 had. It’s a lot more linear but still has a few tricky puzzles and collection quests just like the previous two titles.\n\nBecause of the intrigue behind the new cliffhanger I went ahead and listened to the director’s commentary (comes free with the game and is under your music page on steam). It was interesting, spontaneous and often hilarious, I definitely recommend it to anyone who has become a huge fan of “Silver Creek Falls” (like I have) and wants to know a bit more behind it’s creation! Anyway, as I was saying, I gave it a listen and the director did say that they were thinking of doing a spinoff with Mark/Phil as the protagonist and that more of the mystery would be solved there. So I’m looking forward to that and for any of you that have more questions I really recommend you give it a listen.","April 17","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Rpg maker games are HEAVILY in my opinion reliant on story and this series does not disappoint, fascinating character development and interaction and intrigue that kept me wanting more..especially at this "ending" I suggest this game to anyone into old school well written rpg stories and game lovers in general. The folks at Sapphire Dragon I hope keep going with these type of games as I'll keep playing and making videos on them :)","April 17","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
