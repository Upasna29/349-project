I took the bullet for you. Refunded after 12 minutes.\nGo buy a hammer, and break all your fingers. Money better spent that way ;)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aktrZssFPCA","May 15","false","0.2"," 217 of 236 people (92%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","92","217","236","93","23"

I was expecting something like the flash based games I enjoyed in my youth like need for madness and the like. Turns out those 10 year old browser games are still superior in terms of gameplay, and, suprisingly, even graphics.","May 18","false","0.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","0"

The headlights might be unnecessary during the daytime and the speedo might be out of sync by about 70mph with the sense of speed.  There's also a very good chance I will never play this game again, other than launching it for the requisite 5 minutes so I can write this review, but given that the game was made by one budding developer over the course of 7 months - for that, it deserves a thumbs up.\n\nHowever, the price also needs to be realistic and relative to the quality, therefore it needs to drop by about 80%.\n\n:o)","May 16","true","0.1"," 12 of 40 people (30%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","30","12","40","4","7"
