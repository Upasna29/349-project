The game puts you in the shoes of a scientist Lester Knight Chaykin. A lightening strike messes up one of his experiments and he is transported to a brutal alien sci-fi world, where he is pushed into fleeing from the alien inhabitants with the help of an unsuspected new friend. This is basically all the game has to offer story wise, but this isn't an issue as the game doesn't need an amazing story for you to stay interested.\n\nThe new art style is beautiful. While the game always had a beautiful art style, the 20th anniversary edition cleans up a lot of the pixels and replaces it with jaw dropping smooth backgrounds bringing a breath of fresh air to the cult classic. Although the few characters the game has may seem basic in design, they still offer charm and hold true to the original game. A smart choice the devs of the 20th anniversary edition made, was allowing the players the ability to turn the classic graphics on, for all those that get a nostalgic boner replaying it in its purest form.\n\nNow of course before you go out and buy the game, I must warn you. This game is very veryy hard, and expect to die and die again. Now for this game I would recommend using walkthroughs whenever you get stuck as there is many different paths you can go down that may get you confused and frustrated. Hell even if you use a walkthrough I'm sure you are still going to have a little bit of trouble with this game. Frustration aside, the hard difficulty is very rewarding whenever you finish a puzzle, and it won't feel like you've wasted your time when you reach the end of this journey. With a walkthrough you should be able to finish the game in around 1 hour (Unfortunately it is quite short) and I imagine without a walkthrough the game would last you maybe a couple more hours... Maybe. But to me the game is worth it.","November 26, 2013","true","4.0"," 202 of 223 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","202","223","0","2"

At the time though, it was pushing the envelope with its use of polygons and 'pixigons' and broke with many established motivational paradigms of the era, relying on a desire to explore and drive through the story rather than achieving a score or preserving lives.\n\nIn spite of its vintage, there are things that developer Éric Chahi was able to achieve in Another World that I believe are still relevant, enjoyable and worth aspiring to, even twenty one years after its release.\n\n\nUpon launching the game, the first thing that stands out is its atmosphere. Within the first moments of the intro cinematic, much of the game's tone is set, as the protagonist Lester (who is only named in the credits) is depicted arriving in his Italian sportscar at an isolated lab on a dark and brooding night. Lester immediately comes across as being successful, independent and yet lonely as he is greeted by the lab's AI and seats himself at a solitary workstation. The cinematic's score echoes this, playing an eerie isolated melody leading up to Lester's appearance, which is joined by a purposeful military percussion as he enters his workplace. As the experiment begins, rhythmic tensions builds before suddenly and unexpectedly, Lester and his desk are vapourised, leaving a charred crater with dissipating charge arcing across its surface.\n\nThe game itself begins with Lester and his desk materialising beneath the surface of a deep stone pool, a stark contrast to his technically advanced (and air filled) lab. The sense of displacement is real and highlights that Lester is no longer in an environment that he controls.\n\nAnother world has very little incidental music, using the intro cinematic to provide an initial sense of tone and pacing before giving way to sound effects. The first several scenes offer a full soundscape, with forlorn wind whistling through a rocky canyon, punctuated by seismic rumbles. All of the game's sound effects feel raw and visceral, adding to the game's air of danger and urgency. As the game progresses, ambient audio becomes more sparse, relying mostly on footfalls and laser fire to fill in the space. As a result of publisher pressure from Interplay[1], the SNES port (and derivatives) feature additional in-game tension music that deviates significantly from the style established in the cinematics. In addition to being out of place, I feel that this also detracts from some of the game's sense of loneliness and isolation.\n\nIn contrast to many other games of the era (Civilization, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Lemmings, Street Fighter II and Sonic The Hedgehog, for example) Another World has a comparatively understated 16 colour palette with recurring dominant blue hues that help support its atmosphere of isolation and loneliness. Its muted tones depict an not only an unforgiving and unmoving world (in which Lester with his red hair stands out), but also one that can be eerily beautiful.\n\nThe game capitalises on its low-fi presentation, using implied detail over actual detail in a way that allows the player to project and interpret things rather than have them explicitly defined. It's difficult to know how much of this is a happy coincidence due to technical limitation of the time and how much was intentional minimalism, though there are a number of moments where the game gives the player fleeting glimpses of something separated from normal gameplay (using the short city view or black monster cutscenes as an example), enough to only give a sense or impression of what's shown.\n\n\nLester is presented for the most part as a "silent protagonist", leaving his character open to player interpretation and projection. Beyond highlighting how out of place he is, the only definition the game gives Lester is when he is shown briefly emoting during his first encounter with members of the alien race (who presumably are indigenous to this planet, leaving Lester the real alien).\n\nThere's a degree of history and heritage to the indigenous people depicted within the game, who at once display aspects of technical advancement alongside cultural barbarity, with energy weapons and teleportation providing a stark counterpoint to the apparent slavery and bloodsports.\n\nAll three lines of dialogue are delivered in an alien language, two delivered by aggressive guards and one by the companion encountered by the player early in the game. This companion is shown to be amicable, caring and resourceful, and is undoubtedly the most developed character in Another World.\n\nThere's a degree of implied co-dependence that Lester and his companion share, and though Lester does not show direct response in game, the manual included with Another World contains a page from Lester's journal expressing concern.\n\nI'm yet to see someone play through the game without feeling a sense of connection to this character, empathy which I believe speaks to the success of Lester's "silent protagonist" role.\n\n\nThe pacing of Another World's gameplay is structured so as to heighten the impact of the game's tension centrepieces. The placement of encounters, obstacles and save points gives the sense that flow and pacing were heavily in mind as the game evolved.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the game relies on players using trial and error (often resulting in death) to explore possibility space and discover solutions. For example, most players' first death will occur whilst they are absorbing the shock of Lester's transition from an air filled lab to beneath the surface of a murky pool. Invariably, all first time players I have observed are quickly pulled down into the depths by a mass of tentacles reaching from below. This first death introduces the notion that this new world (and the game itself) is not a friendly one, and that Lester's immediate task is to survive.\n\nIn modern context, this death oriented learning would be considered a negative aspect. At the time of release, the popularity of titles like Dragon's Lair and Sierra's line of adventure games, which heavily featured player death, made this much more accessible. To help make death feel less negative, many of these games employed special death animations or cutscenes as a reward. In particular the death messages/puns and animations in Sierra adventure are highly celebrated. Deaths with cutscenes in Another World are short and in line with the survival horror aesthetic, showing a glimpse of tightly framed jaws or claws in a way that implies the violent outcome without directly depicting it. Several types of deaths don't feature cutscenes and tend to be more graphic and bloody, though the zoomed out perspective gives them lesser impact.\n\nUnlike Dragon's Lair however, each death in Another World (with the exception of combat encounters and platforming obstacles) provides a learning opportunity, and as such, technically isn't an end-state. This perspective feels to be an important aspect of finding Another World enjoyable and rewarding.\n\n\nTwo years before Another World's release, Jordan Mechner's Prince of Persia solidified what would be known as the "cinematic platformer", a style of platformer known for relatively realistic movement and more maturely constructed storytelling...\n\nContinued on Cheesetalks[cheesetalks.twolofbees.com]","September 15, 2014","true","39.2"," 99 of 108 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","99","108","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/233550/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","Jordan Mechner, Steve Meretzky, Roberta Williams...Eric Chahi.\n\nIf you don't know who Eric Chahi is, or why I breathe his name with a palpable aura of reverence, buy this game immediately. This is an enduring piece of computer game history that remains as beautiful, stark, striking and unique today as it was when it burst onto the scene in 1991. This is a landmark computer game.\n\nSo what, you say? So was Doom, and very few of us are still playing it today. So was DONKEY.BAS, the famous early IBM game with the racecar switching lanes to avoid burros in the road. So was the Crowther and Woods Adventure. The history of computer games is littered with significant milestones, making for a very cluttered highway to the past. Right. I understand. But when you find one that's still fresh and avant-garde exactly as it is, today? You could drop Another World into the indie game market anew, and it'd still turn heads and inspire conversations. The adjective "timeless" is overused, but this game is truly timeless.\n\nIt's an action adventure game. There are no instructions. You're meant to jump in, blind, and interact with the world around you as a mystery. There's no inventory, and precious few 'save points.' You used to be a scientist working with a particle accelerator, driving a Ferrari, then...well, something happened, and you ended up Somewhere Else. Somewhere bleak, hostile, cold and inhospitable to its denizens, let alone to an outsider. What does it all mean? You will never be told. You'll never receive an explanation, never encounter a single creature who speaks or understands your language. You will interact with many objects, and figure out what they are and how they work on your own. Good luck! You'll need it.\n\nThis is Eric Chahi. This, right here, is what this man does so very, very well. The immersive simple-controls action adventure game, set in a bleakly alien other world. Chahi is Bill Watterson's noir doppelganger -- the stylized clifftops and mesas of Spaceman Spiff cartoons become bleak obelisks in a desolate and hostile natural wasteland. His ecosystems are shadowy and predatory, but tantalizing. Exploration into a very nasty and hostile Mother Nature's parlor has never been so deliciously tempting.\n\nWhen we played the original Broderbund Karateka, Mechner's freshman masterpiece, there was always a bit of dread wonder as to what would come down the pike, what would be waiting to meet us and attack us. He was the inventor, as far as I know, of the video game cutscene, and Karateka was one of the first games to introduce us to enemies "down the way," seen before they were encountered directly. But while Mechner foreshadowed, Chahi *teased*. His natural "other world" was silent, grinning, waiting for you to get stuck in its deadly web, and it offered you few if any clues as to how to survive it.\n\nIf you made it to the second scene of Another World, you felt quite accomplished.\n\nThere are few rest points to breathe. The action is breakneck and maddening. You will feel the protagonist Lester's heart pound and his lungs ache from exertion. You will savor the first quiet moment and rest, because you'll need it! This game is short not only because it's an older game, but because the player couldn't endure hours and hours of it on end. If trial and error in realtime isn't your thing, if repeating the same scenes over and over to get them just right frustrates you, if you want the game to work with you as opposed to standing over you silently and smirking...this may not be your action-adventure game. If you want the game to end with all questions answered and all mysteries put to rest, this is definitely not your game. What you learn about this amazing and very thoroughly developed alien world, you will have to infer from your breakneck trip through it, unguided. You will be left with many, many questions.\n\nThe game "Limbo" could never have happened without Chahi's work in its cultural DNA.\n\nIt really doesn't matter if this game is "for you" or not -- it's a legend, and a work of art that every gamer ought to engage, at least once in his or her life. Love or hate the White Album, you have to have listened to it to call yourself a fan of rock music. This is the Mona Lisa of action-survival games of the 16-bit Renaissance, and the fact that it stands as a great game twenty years later, with only minor updates to address the huge resolution jump in modern displays, is telling. Check this out. Even if it's not your thing, it's a game you should know about, and that everyone should own.","February 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","51","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/233550/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","One of the first games I ever played in ye olde times of Amiga and unsliced bread, Another World is one of the giants of that era, standing tall over other games at that time for its art style and cinematics - both in real-time and in cutscenes.\n\nThe basic premise of the story (if you aren't aware of it) is scientist Lester Knight Chaykin (weird name huh) went to work, experimenting at what appears to be a cyclotron facility. A lightning storm interferes with the particle accelerator, there is an explosion, and Lester finds himself and his desk on another planet.\n\nThis Anniversary Edition is good in that it retains the art style of the original game. The graphics are a bit chunky, but pleasing to the eye - if you can put up with Minecraft graphics then this is even better. I have it on Windows 7 and have experienced no issues, which is miles better than trying to play it on an old, glitchy Amiga, where you're trying to figure out which Kickstart disk will actually get it to boot.\n\nFor its time, Another World pushed the boundaries. Even though there is very little music, what there is has been done well, helping to immerse gamers with passable sound effects and beautiful scenery.\n\nSo bam, you're in this new, strange world. Thankfully the controls are easy enough to work out. Direction controls, jumping, sprint, and attacking. It's a world full of dangers, and there are various ways to die, but I wouldn't say it's hard.\n\nIt can be made trivial these days with the ease of access to guides and walkthroughs through the internet, but Another World's interface was very much a 'work-it-out-for-yourself' at original release. There is no HUD of any sort, except a breath meter when you're underwater. There are no clues as to where to go next, or how to do it. Even the aliens speak another language, as you would expect.\n\nIt can sometimes take a bit to get used to the controls - the laser pistol itself is complex enough. Rapidly tapping fire will shoot numerous lasers, holding it down briefly and then releasing will form a brief energy shield in front of the tip of the gun, and holding the trigger for a while before releasing fires an epic laser bolt. Naturally the enemies you encounter have the same options available to them, thus combat can get tricky fast if you don't know what you are doing. Enemies also have plasma grenades that can roll straight past shields - while I've heard Lester gains access to them later in the game I've never used it.\n\nThe gameplay is broken up into several types, not just combat though. There is escaping from jail, rolling through air ducts, messing around with the weapon controls inside a tank, running away from a tidal wave, kicking aliens between the legs ... it has stood the test of time admirably, and is truly fun in every sense of the word.\n\nIf you've never played such a classic, old game, then here's a place to test your tastes. Whether you like it or not, you will walk away enriched by your experience.","August 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","58","65","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twerty/recommended/233550/","twerty","Twerty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twerty/","288 products in account","Another World has been remembered for over two decades now because of the uniquely cohesive experience and sleek vectorized visuals it offers, from a time where graphics and storytelling were often terse and stilted.\n\nWhile this game is short, not much longer than two hours, those two hours have been solely designed by French artist Eric Chahi, and intimate attention has been paid to the detailed backgrounds, foregrounds and animations. Pacing and level design have been carefully decided to fit the overall theme.\n\nThis comes from an era where all this fit on two floppy disks -- this entire game had to fit in just under 3MB. So while music and sound may seem sparse, and some areas seem underpopulated or underdetailed, just realize this entire game was the same size as a modern-day high-resolution background image.\n\nAs a result of being designed around these limitations, what the game does have and does do, it does very well. Another World is a game that manages to have both atmosphere and style, in a tightly-knit package.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it is enjoyable -- combat is intense and quick, leading to frequent deaths but the kind of feeling that will keep you on your toes. Puzzles are sometimes unusual, I think more an indication of the era the game came from -- puzzle logic even in most story-driven games for the time (point-and-click adventure games) were often unforgiving and exacting. So while this game has some odd puzzles, its quick respawns and common checkpoints often allow you to figure out the way through quickly without too much frustration from quick successive deaths.\n\nOverall, a surprisingly unique and strong narrative for the time, relying on virtually no written or spoken word. As for it's price point: 10 dollars is not unfair to ask, and those who have played this before might be willing to drop that much for the nostalgia factor. For most other people, 10 dollars can certainly get you a lot more than two hours of gameplay. But, as a milestone in video game history, and as an experience that still stands on its own merits, it's still worth giving it your time -- it doesn't ask for much.\n\nP.S. Another World will likely be going on seasonal sale at 2.50USD from its current 10USD price point, as it has during the Summer 2014 Steam Sale. If you're on the fence, I'd strongly recommend picking it up during the next wave of seasonal sales.","October 6, 2014","true","2.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

Explore an area.\n2. Be killed outright by something without warning.\n3. Watch a death animation.\n4. Restart just before the bit that killed you.\n5. Execute whatever actions needed to progress with zero room for error, hoping you get it right this time.\n\nRepeat until annoyed.\n\nNot a big deal the first few times it happens, but after a while you realize that you're spending more time waiting for the game to let you back to it than playing it. Trial-and-error puzzle platformers still exist today but they tend to make up for their shortcomings by keeping things as frantic and fast-moving as possible, where the pacing here could best be described as glacial.

As a narrative experience is a complete masterpiece, an art piece in bits, with an exquisite design, setting, action and scenes. As a game its major flaws is the lack of response in the control, understandable by the time, but not in this re-edition, that can become a very frustrating experience, and more than once would make you want to throw the whole PC through the windows. The comic like level design also force you to do exactly as the developers thought in order to complete an scene, so basically no level of freedom here.

This isn't really it. I would reccomend the Sega CD version over this. Heart of the Alien isn't a very good game (and was made without Eric Chahi I think), but it's there.\nNever played this before? This port is decent enough, but it's short, and you will probably dislike the game for the puzzles being really obtuse compared to modern games. It is difficult to suspend disbelief storywise that the main character did exactly everything he had to do without dying, from to all the sidetracking to get past unforseeable deathtraps.\n\nPROS:\n-The new HD backgrounds are pretty, though sometimes looking hastily made on closer inspection.\n-Comes with the Sega CD version's soundtrack (Though so does the Sega CD version, since they're just tracks on the disc, and the Sega CD version includes Heart of the Alien soundtrack which is just more of that)\n-Plays as it should. The game is Another World. They didn't George-Lucas-Special-Edition-up the gameplay/story or anything.\n-New Hard Mode adds some new surprises for people who played older versions to death like I have.\n-No need for passwords. There's now a scene select with actual names for the different "levels"\n\nCONS:\n-Plenty of glitches. I found about 6 different ones in less than an hour of play. The achievements are especially glitched, but the most annoying is probably the cursor vanishing until you restart the whole program if you have the pause menu mapped to a controller button and press it twice in succession.\n-No music during gameplay. Eric Chahi prefers it without, but come on, man. Let me choose. I grew up with ports that did have music and was looking forward to seeing what soundtrack this version used.\n-HD mode is extremely polygonal. For example: The workers in the background of the first screen of the prison are entirely made up of sharp rhombuses. The corner of Lester's lower leg often juts out from behind the knee. While standard definition mode is really pixellated, sprites come off a little more organic, especially when the pixel edges were masked by the blur of an SD CRT monitor/TV back in the day. I'd say "The sprites in this game looked better in SD on a CRT" is a pretty major con for an HD re-release.\n\nWho should get this:\nOld fans who need to own every version or have no access to any other legal means of playing it. Or if your fondest memories are of the Amiga version (since you can effectively make it just like it).","June 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

First, you get the original creator of the game to work on it, none other. He still has the original files of the game programmed on the Amiga, so what he does is this: he loads an amiga emulator in the present to open the original files and edit them...yeah....\n\nThen you try to upgrade the game in every possible way...without changing the game (!!!) Meaning, this is still the original game, the same gameplay and sequences of the original. The graphics are still made the same way of the original (commodore amiga polygons) but taking advantage of modern hardware, putting unlimited color, 1080p resolution, upgrading the sound effects and music to digital where you can, replaying the music in high quality, and just leaving the few voices in game just as they were. Adding tiny details in the backgrounds screens whenever possible without changin the original... and on top of that, you just add the option to push a button in game to look instantly the original non remastered version to see how it all changed (and not changed at the same time) in all levels.\n\nThis is how you make a remake (remaster) of a game. I still won't pay full price for a 20 years old game... but with a little discount it's a total steal.\nI say this because ive played the original another world in it's sega megadrive inception, in 1993, so if i buy a 20+ years game, that i loved, it's because i want to have that same game, no other modern sh...but at the same time i want to have maybe (if possible) some perks, some upgrades, that bring the original to modern age gaming (besides being compatible with current computers).\n\nThis 20th anniversary edition does all that. Totally recommended if you played the original. If you didn't ,also recommended , as a trip to the origins of adventure gaming, and as a different experience.","February 22","true","4.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game is magnificent. It's tight, clean and to the point. Nothing feels superfluous. In fact, everything feels deliberate.\n\nThere are only two buttons; one to jump, and one for anything else. You only have one gun, which has three abilities: single shot, barrier shot and barrier destroying shot. It doesn't seem like much, but it's everything you need. The game is carefully crafted, from the precise jumps, to how your shields are projected just close enough to you so you can shoot around them.\n\nI could carry on listing things this game does brilliantly, but you just don't understand it until you feel it for yourself. I'm gobsmacked that this game was made by one dude. It's just brilliant. Never once did I feel like it was the game's fault for me dying. It was either me or the Xbox 360 controller to blame.\n\nJust get this game, seriously. If you're good you can finish it in about an hour or so, and that's my only complaint about this game.

But all the little pieces of interactivity on are there for some reason.\n- I think this anniversary edition feels great. You can change with the press of one button the visuals from the original version to the remastered backgrounds and polygonal characters.\n- Also you can choose a from a remastered audio or the original with or without music (the creator, Eric Chahi, said he prefers his game without music).\n- Modern controllers works nice (I recommend DualShock 3 or 4 digital directions for a better experience).\n- It has bonus content (Artwork, Making of and PDF's with scanned development notes).\n- Hard difficulty is harder than the original.\n\nCons:- It has some new checkpoints for newbies and sometimes they mess with your game state. So you have to kill some enemies again (and I don't mean the ones re-spawn because you need to complete a mandatory task).\n- We WANT "Heart of Darkness" please!! :)\n\nI plenty recommend this game for nostalgic people and those who can handle old games like Prince of Persia for instance.

This was coming from an era when the most graphically impressive game by comparison was the original DOOM. It was in a class all on its own. It paved the way for the more cinematic games of today.\n\nAll that said, this Out Of This World/Another World does not stand the test of time, at least as a 'game'.

I never owned the full version back in 1992 (just the shareware) and I intend to finish it.\n\nIn the 20th Anniversary edition there are enhanced/remastered visuals and sound.

I say slightly because even though they smoothed out the blocky graphics and animations, it still holds a dear place in my heart as they kept the original art style for the time that the technology would allow. Playing this game brought back a lot of memories as I remember playing this on my brother's Sega Genesis 20 years ago! And, most annoying of all, I never beat the game back then! Time restrictions due to tv-limits and homework, coupled with the fact that there was no save option, made the game nearly impossible for a kid like me to beat. So, proudly, I am now able to say I beat the game!\n\nSure, it doesn't have the snazzy graphics, enthralling plot (there's no real talking throughout the whole game), or variation on gameplay that many of today's games offer, but it was a great game for its time and I can remember that thanks to this anniversary edition. What the game does very well, is pull the player into 'another world' through an immediate introduction of a science experiment gone wrong that transports the player. The characer has no personality, but the goal of trying to guide this lost soul through a strange world is enthralling enough to pull a player in, and forgive the game's lack of contemporary graphics. Infinite respawns upon death, back to the last checkpoint, make the game fun to play and explore, although the game is short. A skilled player could probably beat the game in under two hours upon their first attempt. Quickly executed button pushing requires a certain amount of skill, and some of the puzzles are fun to figure out. A few of the puzzles will most likely require help from this new-fangled contraption called the interwebs...probably a fad :P\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants to see what a great game from 20 years ago (that can still hold its own) is like!\n\nRatings out of 10: 1 = low, 10 = high.\nGraphics: 4 (a 9 if this were remade today)\nSound: 8 (sound makes up a huge amount of the game's atmosphere, especially since there's no talking)\nStory: 8 (I may be a bit biased, but I can see this as a great sci-fi novel)\nGameplay: 9 (Experimenting your way through a foreign world was a puzzle in itself)\nExecution: 10 (Gotta give credit to the game for being such a well-done game for its time. Didn't really see much in the way of glitches or problems. Getting stuck on a puzzle doesn't count!)\nOverall: 8 (I'd love to rate this game higher, but today's gaming landscape is so far advanced compared to 20 years ago. Many indie developers could probably make a game similiar to this if they put their hearts into it.)","September 20, 2014","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a short, 2-3 hour game, and it's pretty hard when you're playing this for the first time. Took me by surprise. Think of Another World as Prince Of Persia (the 2D platformer) with guns.\n\nThankfully the game saves at certain checkpoints, even though it's not always clear if it saved the game before or after your progress. So you regularly have to double check if you already did something.\n\nThe story is pretty cool and the way the game tells the story is quite unique, especially if you take into consideration the fact that this was released 20 years ago.\nWhile playing you're able to switch between the new and upgraded graphics, or the original graphics. A nice feature that I frequently used.\n\nIn the end I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're looking for a challenge or a cool story.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","April 7, 2013","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I don't think this game aged in a bad way. It still preserves its atmosphere. Forget about hard timing duck and jump, this game is more about the feel of exploration and a bit of puzzle. There are checkpoints all over the place, no imminent threat of rage quit. It has actually nice level design. Even you're not in a nostalgic mood, this might work as a great way to learn some bit from videogame history.\n\nOnly downside is the separate soundtrack. I would rather hear it in game.\n\nAll the controls you'll need are the arrows plus the action button, but it seems to me, dev has forgot to mention how the gun works. Press CTRL for fire, hold briefly to deploy a shield, hold longer for the plasma burst.\n\nAlso, achievements hunter alert, you will get all 100% of the achievements just by playing, while finishing the game easily under 3 hours. It isn't particularly long, but you'll be tempted to play the game all over again. It does worth the price. Grab it in the next sale without a second thought.

We're dragged into another dimension, much like our protagonist, Lester, as he is forced to react and adapt to this strange environment he's been thrust into by accident. The graphics were excellent for their day, and the action is intense throughout. Some of the puzzles are a little dry and uninteresting when played through now (the underground sequence is my least favorite aspect of the game), and this particular version does not have the wonderful score provided for the SNES version of the game, but it's still an updated version of this classic.\n\nHighly recommended.

At the time of release it was an innovative game with its use of cutscenes, set pieces and cinematic sequences.  This was particularly impressive for a game from 1991.  This new edition remains true to the classic visuals, only making very slight changes.  This means the art direction is retained, helping to bring a gem from the 16-bit era to a new audience.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, with a minimalist story and great art direction.  Surprisingly, most of the problems with this game can be found in the actual gameplay.  A lot of it is trial and error.  If you have never played this before then I will say it can be very frustrating being halted due to a cheap death that was almost unavoidable.  I remember the same feeling when playing the original.  I would still say that this is a game that should be played if you are a fan of the original game or if you want to experience a classic game from the past.\n\nThe game can be remarkably short though and it would be hard to recommend this excellent HD update for full price.

If you haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing this title in the past two decades, then you owe it to yourself as a gamer to do so as soon as possible.\n\nUsing vector graphics to produce in-game cinematics that tell a minimalistic story of a scientist who is transported to, you guessed it, Another World, you are forced to try and survive in this harsh and unforgiving environment. While the title was brutally challenging, it provided one of the first truely interactive cinematic experiences. You can feel this game's legacy in franchises like Uncharted and Heavy Rain.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary release of this masterpiece brings it to a new generation of gamers with the added features we take for granted, such as checkpoints and achievments, while keeping it the same game we know and love. You can play the game in the original resolution, or play with upgraded graphics. The new graphics don't hurt the original either, as they keep to the same art style we remember. The checkpoints are useful in that we don't have to finish the game in one sitting like we used to, (though alot of us know this game well enough that it wouldn't take very long). The achievments are great for pointing out things you might not have known about the game, and this version also comes with a host of bonus items, like the ROM of the Amiga version, a behind the scenes video, artwork, and soundtrack.\n\nI honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this game. It's well worth the money, even if you've purchased one or more of the dozens of ports that have released in the past, thanks to a plethora of new features and bonus content. Playing Another World yet again brought memories of a simpler time flooding back, and I never grow tired of exploring this alien planet.

Even now it achieves an incredible atmosphere despite being technologically ancient. But what lets this game down is the same thing as similar games of this vintage (like Shadow of the Beast) is the terrible trial and error gameplay. I know most people will forgive this for nostalgia reasons, but there's no excuse for a game where your survival depends entirely on a random choice. Yeah you can keep trying but it just makes you hate the game after a while. It's also hard to figure out what you're supposed to do. Shoot a random dot? Ridiculous. If you want a nostalgia trip then fine, otherwise this is at best a history lesson on how not to do gameplay.","September 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

There's a lot that modern games owe to it, it's short and full and it's in my top list of games. And apparently, now it comes with an easy mode, so it's not even that frustrating to figure out the first time 'round.\n\nThis version actually seems a little worse than the 15th anniversary edition that came out a couple of years ago. There's less customizability resolution-wise, for one. I was told the hard mode is actually more difficult than the original game. Well, I didn't see it, except when being chased at a certain point, the game drops some extra enemies on you. The entire game felt exactly the same otherwise. But yeah, the game's gorgeous and pretty much the same as the original home computer versions. It lacks the SNES version's alternate soundtrack, but I can't claim to miss that annoying incidental orchestration.

In that way, this game has a lot in common with Sierra "quest" games, which can all be beaten in a very short amount of time if you know exactly where to go, but each minute of progress takes 5-15 minutes of trial and error gameplay to get through.\n\nThe design and storytelling were completely groundbreaking when it was released in the 90s, and are still fantastic to this day, although the sound design doesn't really hold up as well as all of the other elements.\n\nGreat as a lesson in game design, but $10 for what is 15 minutes of gameply stretched out to 1.5-2 hours of trial-and-error is way too expensive nowadays.

This may have been a great game back in the day, and for people who didn’t experience the original, this is a good way to get introduced to it. However, if you have no interest in experiencing the game at all; this edition of the game certainly won’t change your mind.”\n\n5/10 TJBs","March 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not sure if the problem is too widespread, but for my computer (GTX 650, 64bit W7), the game crashes every 3-5 minutes.  The game is quick to put you back to the last checkpoint you reached, so it is not terrible, just frustrating, and I have not found a solution to fix the problem.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it seems decent.  This is the type of game where you almost always fail a puzzle at least once before you will know how to complete it, which I am not a fan of.  It is still fun and rewarding for each segment you complete.\n\nIn addition, the controls seem kind of sloppy.  It is very easy to make a mistake that you didn't intend to do, despite knowing full well what it is you're trying to do.  This makes it difficult to determine whether you are failing a segment because you aren't doing the correct action or because of the controls (usually ended up being the latter).\n\nOverall though, I do like the game.  I like the art style and the minimalist story is interesting.  I likely would have completed the game had it not been for the crashes.  From what I hear, it is a very good game, so you may want to try it for a different platform.

Flashback has made an extremely favourable impression, even though it was a weirdly localized version with nonsensical gibberish for text. Of course, it was also one of the first games I played, so I certainly idealize it in my memory.\n\nBut Another World... I don’t know. Call me corrupted by the games I’ve played since then and incapable of enjoying this one in its purity and simplicity, but it is exactly this - I wasn't able to enjoy it.\n\nWith all due respect, nowadays it plays and feels quite awful. I am not talking about the visuals (good artistry is always stronger than good graphics, and Another World looks quite nice in its simplicity, with or without modern glossing-over). I am talking about the game itself.\n\nProbably back then it was a breakthrough, a cornerstone of a genre that didn't exist before it. But now you can't help but see that game industry went a long way since then. Controls are clunky, unresponsive and just weird. Fighting is erratic and is mostly ruled by chance. Correct decisions can hardly ever be deduced - the game presupposes you to try over and over again with little to no though behind your attempts, until you stumble upon a right decision. It is difficult, yes, but its difficult is not challenging (which is pleasant); it is baffling, incomprehensible and annoying.\n\nSo, if you have fond memories of Another World and Flashback… better leave them be. Let these games forever stay fresh and perfect in your memory, do not ruin the impression by trying to unearth these impressions.","May 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Without really knowing what to expect, I dove in... and died. And died again. And again. To be honest, it didn't feel like the game liked me at all.\n\nI can accept the idea of being in a hostile environment, but I dislike the lack of context and information that is given. A certain amount of unknown is definitely part of the game itself, but more and more often it felt like I would run into where I couldn't understand visually what I was seeing or run into some bug (the game doesn't always pick up pressing ctrl (the default action button) nearly as regularly as it should).\n\nI do have to say some of the graphics were probably downright astounding back in '91. As they are today, they are retro and fine mostly. It does have a low framerate, but that isn't the problem. The graphical glitches where the z-order gets messed up fairly regularly does take away from the environment.\n\nBut in the end, this game is all gameplay since there is no dialog or particularly story going on other than escape/survive this new world. And the gameplay is a strange mix of "puzzles" and platforming without precise control. There were plenty of times where telling the character to jump or not to didn't seem in the cards, and I would die again. There are plenty of checkpoints, but I still ran into places where I wanted more so I could not do another part again. And those checkpoints seem to sometimes forget that you did something earlier.\n\nThe puzzles themselves seem more like a collection of trying what seems to do something until you run into a dead end and back tracking to see what might be different. I never seem to have an idea what I was accomplishing on a larger scale, but since something happened, it was probably right. There's no satisfaction in a puzzle that you didn't know you solved or you can't see a connection between your actions and what needs to happen.\n\nIn the end, I did not find the game fun.

The difference is that Flashback is actually good. This game's harsh trial-and-error-style is rigged to kill you at least once on many obstacles regardless of caution, and annoying checkpointing means you'll be trying the same sequences of luck-of-the-draw shooting and dodging many times over.\n\nPerhaps Another World was a gem of the 90s, but in 2014 there are better games to spend your time on.","May 31, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I find that the controls of this remastered edition are a bit clunky with the XBOX controller, and that when Lenny is swimming the game begins to stutter for no reason at all? I did not try to play with a keyboard to try.\n\nNonetheless this is a classic, the game jump starts your imagination about the utopian and rather dangerous world Lenny is in, and the society that lives in there.\n\nThis anniversary edition comes with a few extras, including concept art which looks really good.\n\nRemember that this is a one-man game, (besides the music). Eric Chahi was truly an indie pioneer.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get killed half a hundred times, this platforming action never gets old :)","September 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

The 20th anniversary special stays true to it's original form, though updating graphics and sound for a slightly more crisp feel. While it satisfies some gamer's needs to return to the roots of their childhood, it would simply fail to impress the standards of most in today's hi - tech gaming market.\n\nThe controls are awful with a capital A. Seriously 'deadlight' has better controls. It constantly feels like your controlling a character who is wearing some type of invisible tin man costume and whose jumping ability is seriously limited thanks to a prostrate operation.\n\nGame play is similar to other classics like Dragon's Lair, but make no mistake this is definitely not Dragons lair. The difference? Dragon's lair would often give you visual clues on where you need to jump to, point your character to etc. This game is so obscure and obtuse you'll spend most of your time watching cut scenes of your character being thrown into the fatal end of a worst case scenario.\n\nGame play is short 18 mins to complete game, but with the difficulty of the game including watching walk through's as your Yoda master, you will probably get 2 hrs out of the game at max. There are three settings, 'easy' which is hard and walk through needed, 'medium' which is  harder and will have you raging till you blow blood vessels and 'hard' which is really Impossible without Valium constantly pumped into you through a iv tube.\n\nThe whole 18 minute story is completely told through cartoon animation about your character Professor Lester who is able to play around with space time thanks to a particle accelerator experiment and get transported to an alien planet where everything is his foe. Seriously! Literally everything from rocks, worms, water, everything wants to kill him. The only saving grace is a lovable alien your locked up with and who you bond with simply because your able to rock a cage and release him and then listen to all his grunting noises.\n\nProfessor Lester takes on this Alien world like his John Mc Clane with a Star Trek Pistol being helped by every cliche under the sun until closing credits where he wonders off into the sunset and lives happily ever after.\n\nThis 1990 remake gets a thumbs up for those like myself who reminisce over the yesteryear's of playing it, but when I place myself into a gamer's shoes playing this game for the first time, I cannot help but give it a thumbs down especially in comparison to normal price of $10.00. It's not worth that much. If you really would like to experience this part of gaming history for yourself, definitely wait for a sale...","January 24, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

And then there's things like this where they were off to a great start and just stopped caring halfway through. The graphics have been beautifully done and in theory the new presentation with custom graphic and input options are perfect. The problem is that this entire thing plays like it's still in beta.\n\nThis game crashes with such regularity it's not even funny. Also, the checkpoint system is absolutely atrocious. I've seen some mind-bogglingly dumb check point systems in my day and this one can hang tough with the dumbest. At one point you get a check point every other screen and then by the caves it's like 5 minutes of perfect game play to reach one new point where you hopefully can try ONE thing before getting wasted and having to repeat the sequence just to get a shot at figuring out the next step. Another World / OOTW may be a classic, but this just doesn't pass for good gameplay anymore.\n\nIf you know the game already like the back of your hand, this might not be an issue, but for anyone going through the first time or for the first time in a while, this is exactly the kind of thing that would make you kick it to the curb. The stupidity is just overwhelming to me. How hard would it be to just let players quick save? Or just auto save every screen or two screens? What would that take away from the game? Absolutely nothing other than inflated BS playtime. Throw in the fact that this thing runs about about a stable as a bomb on stilts in Windows 8.1 and you have a recipe for rage, when revisiting this classic should be a joyous occaison.","October 4, 2014","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That's for sure. But I kind of like it for that. If you can rise up to the challenge, what you have here is a very atmospheric and unique journey. It reminds me of the original Unreal (another game I really love); you really do feel like you're in another world. And despite essentially being a one-button game, there is a lot of nuance in the gameplay. Once you get your laser gun, that is. Lots of good platforming and shooting and puzzles, and with such a unique visual style. It impresses me with its beauty even today, after freaking... freaking 22 years, apparently. You can switch between the original and remastered graphics too, as well as the sound. I always like when games have that sort of function. You'll be able to see how truly groundbreaking it was for its time, considering that the remastered graphics are largely just a higher resolution and less pixelly version of the original. I've never seen such sophisticated animation from a game of that time. And what's even more amazing is that this game was made pretty much entirely by just one lone guy, Eric Chahi! Major kudos, Eric Chahi.\n\nAnyway, it's a quite a brief game and it will have moments that aggravate and confuse you, but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. It's challenging, engaging, immersive and, frankly, simply beautiful. And beautifully simple. And that's coming from someone who has played this game for just the first time, with no nostalgia bias.","December 16, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not without it's difficulty however, as I have spent many times dying and having no clue as to how to continue. The story to it is simple and with no dialog, but it explains what's going on through simple visuals. Your character goes to work doing a scientific test with a hadron collidor, but at that same time a lightning bolt hits the machine and the mix up of energy causes a explosion that teleports you to a distant planet for away and everything after that is chaos. The creatures are strange and in many cases horrorfying as they can kill you quite easily.

Now this doesn't mean I don't find it good or dislike it completely, but has its charm. I will explain some of the good things I like in this game and in the end, why I put a dislike checkmark.\n\nSynopsis: The game was made by a french guy name Eric Chahi and was made for the Amiga which was a really old computer back in the days, so you can imagen this game is also old.  The game was praised by the interesting cutscenes and plateform interaction. You play as Lester (the unlikely) a ginger guy who had a lab accident and sent to an another world (insert family guy reference) You meet up with a humanoid looking Sangheili (if sangheili and human had a baby) named Buddy.\n\nI don't know if Lester called him buddy since they don't speak the same language but I always thought it was Mysaruba since that's the first thing he spoke to you, then again maybe he was saying thank you. The plot is really simple, excape from planet...Tatooine from mine slavers (I think) and that's about as much plot as you can say, it was a simple interaction plateform game.\n\nGood: Is a cinematic plateform and I can see why it was pretty interesting about the cutscenes and the atmosphere the guy put into the game, The graphics is good in fact it looks more like "alone in the dark" graphics, for the time and the backgrounds were ok, but only better if is HD. The music is good atleast the very few of them and the controls are responsive.\n\nThe game has no hints so holding your hand is a no, but I like it because you're a human and in times you have to make real quick decision to escape and using your mind to see if the object will do something, so is a good brain exercise. Also since you're only human you die once but that's ok because the game doesn't start over it just reset to where you're checkpoint land so which means you have unlimited lives and plenty of checkpoints.\n\nBad: The game IS hard, NOT by gameplay, no is very easy to navigate and such, hard by being confusing at times which I'm talking about the puzzles themself. The game really doesn't hand holding here so you're on your own. Is good at times when you want to accomplish something on your own but in times you just don't know what to do.\n\nI know Eric did this because the game is really short if you completed with breeze, you could completed in an hour or twenty-five minutes! The average for those who doesn't know how to beat the game it would probably be a few hours or even days which again I could agreed the difficulty but then there's just some unfair stuff. Like I mean there are some areas you have to complete or do in order to progress it and you tried to think hard and press anything but you just couldn't so you look up in the guide or if you're a 90s kid talk to a friend and see if someone have the answer.\n\nThen you know the anwer and say to yourself how the hell should I know that this rock would rigger this or that stupid lamp will fall at the soldier's head!?! Yes, this game is more of trial and error but the puzzles that throw at you just made me want to say, is this right what I'm seeing?\n\nYes, again I don't have a problem with thinking on my own but for those of us who wants to move forward to a new area and doesn't want to look at the same frame over and over again, with countless deaths on enemies or stuck by a dead end it grows boring fast. Especially when there is not much plot in the game and the two characters are one-sided, there is not a lot of immertion to the world! Like really do we know any of this Lester guy? I don't know his name after I looked in the Wiki, do we also know a reason why he build a portal? Who are the aliens, why did they want to enslave their own kind, how far are we, what planet are we from! These are things that left unanswer, and don't give me excuse that there are no dialogue or no characters to interact, is a cinematic game! just add a few cutcenes showing some plot detail or some area backgrounds that explain the plans of the aliens or the very least a journal that Lester could carry him along to read?\n\nThere is little plot or immertion to feel about Lester's situation or the new world as much as Half-Life 1 can tell-and that game explains better than Another World in terms of show don't tell. Now I'm not going to complain about that issue all day, oh no that's not the full reason why I returned it that's just a big slice of it.\n\nGoing back a bit on the difficult I would say for those who wants to move on a bit faster, should add a highlight system to highlight objects, now there is the difficult setting but I don't really find a difference to the settings? I don't see a two hit settings to not go back again to the checkpoint or less enemies, none? Unless I'm missing something than I apoligies. One last thing and this is a small nitpick is that they don't include like a laser bar to track how much ammo you still got or when you're swimming you don't know how much air bubble you have so you have to guess.\n\nNow all of that should include the 20th anniversary of the game and frankly I find it lackluster of the "special edition" No commentary of the original creator? No concept arts and most importantly no Heart of the Alien which is a sequel to Another World, why? I know Eric made the game but didn't want to include the credits and I heard the game wasn't really good but still, the ending of the Another World is a cliffhanger so it should include the sequel in the package, the game is becoming rare since it was a Sega CD game.Honestly when I saw a LP of this and I thought the sequel looks a bit better than Another World in terms of more cutscenes and details to the world. Buddy as the main protagonist and the ending for me was a bit surprise for me and I like it, though maybe that's why it wasn't popular for the ending I guess.\n\nAt the end a graphics update and a remaster music isn't worth 10$ is not even $2.47 worth because it didn't show it was worth the price if they include both the games. for those who want it for nostalgia then sure why not. but for those who are curious and still wants to try it wait for a price drop. This game gets a 2.5/5 star ratings, It's more of a mix feeling toward the game and I wish I could put a mix check mark but I think a down check is a bit worth it in my gaming experience. Maybe I don't really see it but I've played a lot of old-school gaming but this just have to pass off by the lack of contents and unfair frustrating difficulty.","September 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","5"

The game plays with a lot of trial and error, some confusing segments, as well as poor jumping controls. This makes the experience poor and the game's events are not too notable. This is the heart of things, though there are some novel positives. The weapon uses only a single button to produce a shot, shield, and charged shot via how long it is pressed. The few cutscene animations are smooth and beautiful; you'll likely treasure them and not want to blink.

I feel, however, that after 1.8 hours I've seen as much as I need to of the janky controls, horrible combat, and all around mediocrity of this fossil.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I respect how original and revolutionary this game was, I really do.  I completely understand why it recieved such a following in 1991.  It's cinematic storytelling style was incredibly interesting at the time.  This having been said, it's not aged well.  The story (at least the first couple hours) is shallow and not especially gripping.  The controls are awkwardly designed, almost as if they were restricted to only using 2 buttons and the arrow keys to do everything they wanted.  The core mechanics are unintuitive, the combat is as aweful and irritating as it is frequent, and the platforming is highly disinteresting.\n\nOn top of this, the 20th anniversary edition offers an "HD" graphics mode that actually makes the game look worse.  The walk cycle looks weird and broken, the backgrounds look extremely unpolished (sometimes even unfinished), and weird sprite layering issues which aren't visible with the original graphics (because of the limited colour palette) become painfully clear.  I'd heard that this update of the game contributed little of value to the original work, but I wasn't expecting this truly pathetic display.  It looks alright in the screenshots, but believe me when I say that when it's fullscreen and things are moving it looks horrible.  That's probably why there's no video on the store page.\n\nTL:DR\nAn interesting peice of gaming history that is probably better kept in a museum.","January 8, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/233550/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","I love classic adventure games, 2D platformers, and re-releases. So when I saw the 20th Anniversary Edition of Another World (a.k.a. Out of this World) on sale, I swifty snatched it up. I have fond memories of playing through it on (a) SNES (emulator) as kid. I cannot deny that it's a very charming, ambitious and cinematic game, but I also cannot deny that I found my (incredibly short) time with it insanely frustrating and immensely disappointing.\n\nI'll start with what it gets right. This game is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere, settings and sound design are immaculate. Éric Chahi has crafted a brilliant alien world here, oozing with originality and depth. The characters are loveable, the cutscenes are groundbreaking and well exectuted, and the environments are varied, colourful and stunning.  The game is very minimalist, but not in a righteous, narcissistic hipster way, featuring no dialogue or heads-up display. Lester can jump, run and attack. The story is basic, but endearing, and is definitely aided by the cutscenes. You play as Lester, a scientist who screws around with some complex technology and lands himself on a planet, with a hostile alien race (and environment) out to get him. With the help of a rogue alien (lovingly nicknamed Buddy), you must escape. Simple, but effective.  To think that this game came out in 1991 is amazing, and still makes my jaw drop. Another World is definitely ahead of its time.\n\nBut so, so much holds it back. The game itself is ridiculously hard. I love a challenging game, don't get me wrong. But I like to be punished for my own mistakes, not because I didn't somehow know not to jump down that hole, but that other hole. When you get everything right, it feels totally organic and satisfying. But when you die 5 times before realising that you're not doing what the game wants you to do, it's fricking annoying. Here's a scenario I found particularly irritating. The following is an internal dialogue I had with myself, with many expletives removed:\n\n"How am I supposed to know what this lever does before I pull it? Maybe I should press it now! My buddy is being beaten up! Okay, I'll pull the lever. What the hell? A beam of light? Oh ♥♥♥♥, the guard is coming for me. Yep, dead. Well okay, obviously I have to kill the guard with the beam of light. Oh fricking hell, now I have to do this whole section again. At least I know what to do. Guard, beating me up, COME ON LESTER CRAWL CRAWL CRAWL JESUS YOU'RE SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SLOW. Okay, lever pulled, guard's down, what should I do now? I'll pull another lever. Oh look, a hole in the ceiling. Alright then. Guess I should crawl back, but how do I get up there? Oh ♥♥♥♥, I'm getting shot at! HURRY THE ♥♥♥♥ UP LESTER! ♥♥♥♥ING HELL I'M DEAD AGAIN NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS ENTIRE THING AGAIN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ #$%*#@#!"\n\nOne thing that drew me to Another World is that it looked similar to the first two Oddworld games, despite the obvious theme difference and aesthetics. But while the Oddworlds were quite difficult, they were at least fair; you could at least SEE what was going to kill you. In Another World, there is so much trial and error, and when you screw up, you get booted back to the last checkpoint, which in some cases is irritatingly far back.\n\nAnd the length, good God the length is pitiful. I know it says I've played for 2 hours, but I haven't. I probably passed the game in half of that. The other half was dealing with the constant, and I mean constant, crashes. Word of advice: don't play this game with an Xbox Controller. Otherwise you'll have crashes literally every 2 or 3 minutes. Play it with the keyboard, which will at least minimalise (but not remove) these crashes.\n\nAnd for being the 20th Anniversary Edition, there really isn't much here. You have the ability to switch from the original Amiga/SNES graphics to a HD redo in-game, à la Halo Anniversary, which is nice, but it looks so... out of place. You have beautiful backgrounds juxtaposed with blocky South Park-esque characters and it just doesn't flow. It's like having cartoon characters on a live-action background. It looks wrong. Sticking with the classic graphics is the best bet for visual consistency.\n\nThere's no post-game content either. And a lot of the music is removed from other versions of the game, and in its place is... nothing. What? 20 years? I mean come on, I get that you wanted to use the original soundtrack, that's fine. But in areas where there's no music, why couldn't you just add a couple of songs in from other entries for a more complete experience? In fact, I'd go so far as to say as this is one of the more incomplete versions of the game. The SNES version had more (and far better) music, a more consistent (however slow) framerate, and had more cutscenes, which help establish the backstory. Come on, guys! It's been 20 years! I'm not asking for the world here but when I think of a re-release, I think completeness, not stuff cut out.\n\nIt does come with some good extras, but these aren't even accessible in-game. There's a making-of documentary, which is actually really interesting and I highly suggest you watch it. There's one picture and a soundtrack (what's left of it), but most interestingly, Amiga ROMs of the original game, which I find incredibly cool. If you want a more coherent, classic experience, then give that a try. But for me, there just wasn't enough here. The achievements are arbitrary, the presentation is lazy, and there's really nothing at all here for fans of the original game (in fact, there's less). I really wanted to like the game, and I still appreciate it for what it did for the adventure genre all those years ago, but I cannot get past its ridiculous difficulty, bugginess, laziness and lastly, the price. This game is definitely not worth $10.\n\n2.5/5","November 14, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The controls are terrible, there is little to no gameplay, the animations are very cheap and the story is just... indescribably awful, not to mention the FULL game lasts around 40 minutes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, this game has been remade not once, but three times and this edition has little to no improvement on the previous disasters, other than some new key bindings for PC support.\n\nYou may have heard that this game is incredibly difficult, but to be frank, it is not at all difficult, it is simply unfair and the controls are unresponsive, leading to a frustrating experience overall. If you're looking for a fun, interesting 2D side-scroller, please, for the love of God, look elsewhere.\n\nTo elaborate (read: pour salt over wound), the gameplay consists of jumping (read: hoping the jump button works), running, setting up shields, knocking down other guards' shields and shooting your laser gun, that sometimes seems to run out of ammunition before requiring a visit to a electric room (read: ammo-refill checkpoint) so that you can progress with this awful waste of space.\n\nI wouldn't recommend that you buy Another World - 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nOn the technical side of things, there is Steam Cloud support (which is almost unnecessary considering the amount of content in this game) and Steam Achievements support.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/233550/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","Another World is one of those games that divides people squarely into "those who played it and it blew their mind", and "Those who didn't and are now looking at it thinking, 'why are all the people who played it raving about it so much?'".\n\nIn its day, AW was simply astonishing.  Other games for the PC at the time simply didn't have the stylish graphics which were becoming popular on the consoles.  Most stuff for the PC was either a straight 16-colour sprite-based port of an Atari / Amiga game, a simulation of some kind, or text-based.  There were a few notable exceptions, but nothing which came close to touching the graphics of AW.  Genuinely "next-gen" games were released for consoles, and the PC was left for the geeks.\n\nThen along came AW.  It brought proper sound, console gameplay and nice-looking graphics to the PC screen.  It played like the sort of game your mates had on their NES.  Not only that, but it made their NES look rubbish to boot!\n\nSo, it's 2015 now... How has it fared over the years?  Well, to be honest, not bad.  It's still got that stylish quality it always did, and with modern games circling back round to the "silent protagonist, plot through action, not dialog", games are looking more like the trend AW (sort of) started.  Also, with the plethora of indie games bringing the graphics back from the DirectX11-fuelled power-hungry pixelfest, to a more garage-made polygonal flat texture-level, AW is looking very cosy in my steam library.\n\nThe gameplay was always fairly minimal, you can run left and right, shoot, jump (in certain places), kick, and do a rather cool alt-fire-shield-thing.  The controls are even more minimal than that, with just arrows, action, and "jump".  Getting used to the controls can take a few screens, as usual...  All that sounds very 'meh'.   Where the game pulls you in, is the story.  Like a lot of "fish out of water" plot hooks, the surroundings are familiar-yet-different.   On a tatooine-like planet, with nasty and good aliens, you have to navigate the linear levels, unfolding the storyline.  It sometimes feels more like a stylised Visual Novel with action elements.  Think of Abe's Odysee but with polygons, rather than sprites.\n\nThe beginning of the game really sets the tone of the game.  The gameplay prompts you to learn three new skills on the first three screens, just to survive... then, just as you're thinking "Okay, I see where this is going", the game stops you and then the real story begins.  The addition of Steam Achievements is a nice touch, as they gel nicely with the  flow.   As you progress through the game, each area feels different, gives you different puzzles, and it's seldom that you feel bored.    If there's one gripe, it's the save feature which makes some of the harder puzzles a little repetitive.   Unlike modern games which have floating boxes saying "Click this button!" and dumbed-down stuff like that, AW has an (effectively) mute sidekick who you work with in parallel to solve puzzles.  The hint is usually him just pointing at something then running off, leaving you to figure it out.  It's frustrating when you die, then have to re-watch a short (2-4s) cutscene, or re-do a simple task that can take 20 seconds, only to run onto a screen with something hard, and die in 1 or 2 seconds.  Rinse, Repeat 4, 5, 10 times.....   It's quite old-school in that way, and some of the puzzles do make you grind your teeth as you have to re-start for the umpteenth time.  But it's immensely satisfying when you do get it, and find that (unlike Prince of Persia), the next section is completely different.\n\nThe ending hints towards a sequel, and I know I, and many of my friends were absolutely gutted that one never appeared in the UK.  They apparently made a sort-of-follow-on for the SEGA, but it never appeared on the PC properly.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a very finely crafted game. The 25th anniversary edition upgrades the graphics, and tweaks the gameplay in minuscule ways, but doesn't affect the charm at all.   My advice is to clear your diary for an evening, shut the door, turn out the lights, grab a can of Cola, and settle in for a jolly good adventure.\n\nI ended up buying this game three times.  The original, the anniversary, and then again on Steam, I love it that much.   I've probably completed it four or five times too.     A wonderful, atmospheric, stylish well-paced, well thought through game.  I can heartily recommend it.","April 7, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another World had that same tight gameplay and non-verbal storytelling with far less graphical technology behind it. It followed the same vien of Prince of Persia and Dark Castle where measuring spacebar jumps and timing spinning blades and falling rocks was the difference between life and starting the level over. Another World had me frustrated at first, but had me wanting to uncover the whole story. I've finished this game on three platforms so far...imagine my joy (and continued frustration) to find that it ended in a cliffhanger that would be resolved in a sequel.\n\nAnyone who beats this game and doesn't immediately seek out the sequel title must have a heart of an alien.","December 31, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I played this game in the early 90's, I just thought it was neat.  When I played this game again recently, I was still impressed, even when I removed the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.\n\nThe mechanics are simple, and although there is little direction given, it is not impossible to determine the course of events that need to occur in order to advance.  Sometimes it does require trial-and-error, but the checkpoints (or chapter breaks) were frequent enough to not be too much of a nuisance compared to other games of the era.\n\nOf course, the presentation is still out of this world (sorry). The storytelling in this game is probably the best example I could give of what got me hooked into having a video game tell a cinematic story.  The story itself may be basic, but the fact that you could show a story that did not rely heavily on dialogue or narration and have a flow that kept interest in the game throughout almost the entire journey blew my mind as a kid, and I was still impressed when I booted it up months ago.\n\nIf you haven't already played this game before, I still recommend it. I can't say the same for many of the other games that I have played in the early 90's.","January 1, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/recommended/233550/","Tribeman","Tribeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/","452 products in account","This game is also known as Out Of This World, it follows the story of a professor named Lester who gets transported to an alien planet after a particle accelerator test goes haywire. I still own this game on Sega Genesis and this 20th Anniversary remake is true to its predecessor.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nI love the art-style in this game, it is unique and at the time of release was WAY PAST advanced. It was unique unlike any other game and still is to a large extent. The colors are vibrant and things that you need to notice stick out pretty well. Since you are on an alien planet the drawing and color of it really brings forth that imaginative environment. I recommend playing this on the highest settings it will let you, it looks a lot better than the original game. You can switch settings by pressing Y on your controller or setting it that way so you can see what it was like on Genesis. It makes it pixelated and takes away a lot of the background scribbles that really give the environment more life, I recommend playing on high quality.\n\nSound: 9/10\nI only really noticed the music at the beginning and at the end, the game could have used a little bit of ambiance, but it is no big deal, not many screens are empty and there is 99% of the time always something going on that requires you to either sit back and think and analyze what is going on or, most of the time, requires you to have fast reaction time. Anyway, the sound effects are awesome needless to say, the game in my opinion could have used a little more ambient music but it isn't something you really notice.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSo, let me be honest. This game is TOUGH. Much like a lot of classic games from back in the day. They are unforgiving and only TRUE WARRIORS OF VIDEO GAMING can overcome it. If you beat this game without using a guide, kudos to you. I did it way back in the day when I was younger, today I needed it for a part that I ALWAYS get stuck at. I use an XBOX controller so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this section. You get your direction buttons, an action or shoot button, and a jump button which is basically your up button. Holding A makes you sprint while you are running or charges your gun. You get 3 gun levels, basic shoot by pressing A, holding it until a little ball appears gives you a shield for a brief time, and holding until a LARGE ball appears gives you a super blast to destroy shields and breakable walls. It isn't a hard game to pick up and play, it IS a hard game to beat however.\n\nStory: 10/10\nFor what the game is, I think the story is amazing. There is no voice acting, but you do have your alien companion try and communicate with you in a tongue you won't understand. Your character tries to by friendly at first with a raise of his hand in attempts of "hello" but it falls on deaf ears. Without spoiling anything, like I said above, you end up on an alien planet, you have to explore a bit and outrun a beast, then you get imprisoned by the alien inhabitants. The story follows you, Lester, and his attempt to escape from this world. The story very much relies on the alien you befriend toward the beginning so making sure he stays alive is just as important as keeping yourself alive. The puzzles are challenging and you will have a tough time figuring out every little detail to move on, especially toward the middle of the game, but stick with it. This is one of very few games that really make you feel accomplished when you beat it.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nI'm debating between an 8 and 9, but I'll give it the 9. It is a unique game that has an original art-style and story that are really entertaining and well done. Like I said, it could use a little ambient music but that is okay, and just beating the game is a big challenge in the first place. If you pick this up, I recommend trying to grab it on sale, it'll be worth the money. At time or writing I think the default price is $10, which isn't bad and is about what the game was worth when it released anyway.\n\nAlso I would like to add, this version of the game comes with achievements. Most you will unlock with story progression, one or two of them you'll probably come across anyway but require a tad bit of extra "exploration" (or standing still for 30 seconds *wink wink*).","January 2, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also known as Out of This World in America. Is a Platform/Puzzle/Action Adventure game made by Eric Chahi. You might know him as "Dat guy who made From Dust".\n\nYou play as Lester, a scientist who messes up an experiment and finds himself teleported to Another World. And on the "Another World" there is big mean weird shaped head guys/aliens who don't like you. "Probably because you're ginger". They imprison you with another alien guy.\nBut this guy seems to be friendly and wants the same thing you want. Freedom. The game does a fantastic job making you grow attached to these two characters, using these Beautiful cut scenes.\nSpeaking of cut scenes,\n\nThis being the 20th Anniversary Version, it features Re-mastered HD Graphics which look Fantastic and you can choose to play with the original Amiga graphics. Which is a cool added bonus.\nGameplay wise, if you found Hotline Miami hard and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥, then you're going to love this. This is one of the hardest games you will ever play. You will die over and over again. And half the time you'll most likely go "WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DO I DO?"\n\nThis game can probably be beaten in around 20 minutes...It took me nearly 3 hours.\nBut past the frustration, when you eventually get past a choke point, the satisfaction and relief is brilliant.\nThis is also one of those games that you won’t forget any time soon after beating it.\n\nAnother world is a very short, very frustrating, But Beautiful and Fantastic game. I would recommend it to everyone but £7.99 for a 30 minute game?\nIf this goes on offer anytime soon I could not recommend it enough.\n\nPersonally, I love this game and I enjoyed every frustrating minute of it. 9/10","April 17, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would regard this simply as a masterpiece that bridges the gap between "cinematic" and compelling gameplay.   It uses beautifully rotoscoped animation and minimalist art direction to create a game that feels filmic and timeless.\n\nSurprising, it's also a game that is rumored, a la wikipedia and some questionable old interviews, to inspire and influence a few noteworthy Japanese game designers.  I could definitely see the influence of Another World in Ueda's titles like Ico and Shadow of the Colossus which ended up inspiring other games such as Assassin's Creed, Red Dead Redemption,  Mirror's Edge, The Last of Us and a plethora of indie or Ubisoft titles.","February 7, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/recommended/233550/","Tribeman","Tribeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/","452 products in account","This game is also known as Out Of This World, it follows the story of a professor named Lester who gets transported to an alien planet after a particle accelerator test goes haywire. I still own this game on Sega Genesis and this 20th Anniversary remake is true to its predecessor.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nI love the art-style in this game, it is unique and at the time of release was WAY PAST advanced. It was unique unlike any other game and still is to a large extent. The colors are vibrant and things that you need to notice stick out pretty well. Since you are on an alien planet the drawing and color of it really brings forth that imaginative environment. I recommend playing this on the highest settings it will let you, it looks a lot better than the original game. You can switch settings by pressing Y on your controller or setting it that way so you can see what it was like on Genesis. It makes it pixelated and takes away a lot of the background scribbles that really give the environment more life, I recommend playing on high quality.\n\nSound: 9/10\nI only really noticed the music at the beginning and at the end, the game could have used a little bit of ambiance, but it is no big deal, not many screens are empty and there is 99% of the time always something going on that requires you to either sit back and think and analyze what is going on or, most of the time, requires you to have fast reaction time. Anyway, the sound effects are awesome needless to say, the game in my opinion could have used a little more ambient music but it isn't something you really notice.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nSo, let me be honest. This game is TOUGH. Much like a lot of classic games from back in the day. They are unforgiving and only TRUE WARRIORS OF VIDEO GAMING can overcome it. If you beat this game without using a guide, kudos to you. I did it way back in the day when I was younger, today I needed it for a part that I ALWAYS get stuck at. I use an XBOX controller so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this section. You get your direction buttons, an action or shoot button, and a jump button which is basically your up button. Holding A makes you sprint while you are running or charges your gun. You get 3 gun levels, basic shoot by pressing A, holding it until a little ball appears gives you a shield for a brief time, and holding until a LARGE ball appears gives you a super blast to destroy shields and breakable walls. It isn't a hard game to pick up and play, it IS a hard game to beat however.\n\nStory: 10/10\nFor what the game is, I think the story is amazing. There is no voice acting, but you do have your alien companion try and communicate with you in a tongue you won't understand. Your character tries to by friendly at first with a raise of his hand in attempts of "hello" but it falls on deaf ears. Without spoiling anything, like I said above, you end up on an alien planet, you have to explore a bit and outrun a beast, then you get imprisoned by the alien inhabitants. The story follows you, Lester, and his attempt to escape from this world. The story very much relies on the alien you befriend toward the beginning so making sure he stays alive is just as important as keeping yourself alive. The puzzles are challenging and you will have a tough time figuring out every little detail to move on, especially toward the middle of the game, but stick with it. This is one of very few games that really make you feel accomplished when you beat it.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nI'm debating between an 8 and 9, but I'll give it the 9. It is a unique game that has an original art-style and story that are really entertaining and well done. Like I said, it could use a little ambient music but that is okay, and just beating the game is a big challenge in the first place. If you pick this up, I recommend trying to grab it on sale, it'll be worth the money. At time or writing I think the default price is $10, which isn't bad and is about what the game was worth when it released anyway.\n\nAlso I would like to add, this version of the game comes with achievements. Most you will unlock with story progression, one or two of them you'll probably come across anyway but require a tad bit of extra "exploration" (or standing still for 30 seconds *wink wink*).","January 2, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/233550/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","Another World is one of those games that divides people squarely into "those who played it and it blew their mind", and "Those who didn't and are now looking at it thinking, 'why are all the people who played it raving about it so much?'".\n\nIn its day, AW was simply astonishing.  Other games for the PC at the time simply didn't have the stylish graphics which were becoming popular on the consoles.  Most stuff for the PC was either a straight 16-colour sprite-based port of an Atari / Amiga game, a simulation of some kind, or text-based.  There were a few notable exceptions, but nothing which came close to touching the graphics of AW.  Genuinely "next-gen" games were released for consoles, and the PC was left for the geeks.\n\nThen along came AW.  It brought proper sound, console gameplay and nice-looking graphics to the PC screen.  It played like the sort of game your mates had on their NES.  Not only that, but it made their NES look rubbish to boot!\n\nSo, it's 2015 now... How has it fared over the years?  Well, to be honest, not bad.  It's still got that stylish quality it always did, and with modern games circling back round to the "silent protagonist, plot through action, not dialog", games are looking more like the trend AW (sort of) started.  Also, with the plethora of indie games bringing the graphics back from the DirectX11-fuelled power-hungry pixelfest, to a more garage-made polygonal flat texture-level, AW is looking very cosy in my steam library.\n\nThe gameplay was always fairly minimal, you can run left and right, shoot, jump (in certain places), kick, and do a rather cool alt-fire-shield-thing.  The controls are even more minimal than that, with just arrows, action, and "jump".  Getting used to the controls can take a few screens, as usual...  All that sounds very 'meh'.   Where the game pulls you in, is the story.  Like a lot of "fish out of water" plot hooks, the surroundings are familiar-yet-different.   On a tatooine-like planet, with nasty and good aliens, you have to navigate the linear levels, unfolding the storyline.  It sometimes feels more like a stylised Visual Novel with action elements.  Think of Abe's Odysee but with polygons, rather than sprites.\n\nThe beginning of the game really sets the tone of the game.  The gameplay prompts you to learn three new skills on the first three screens, just to survive... then, just as you're thinking "Okay, I see where this is going", the game stops you and then the real story begins.  The addition of Steam Achievements is a nice touch, as they gel nicely with the  flow.   As you progress through the game, each area feels different, gives you different puzzles, and it's seldom that you feel bored.    If there's one gripe, it's the save feature which makes some of the harder puzzles a little repetitive.   Unlike modern games which have floating boxes saying "Click this button!" and dumbed-down stuff like that, AW has an (effectively) mute sidekick who you work with in parallel to solve puzzles.  The hint is usually him just pointing at something then running off, leaving you to figure it out.  It's frustrating when you die, then have to re-watch a short (2-4s) cutscene, or re-do a simple task that can take 20 seconds, only to run onto a screen with something hard, and die in 1 or 2 seconds.  Rinse, Repeat 4, 5, 10 times.....   It's quite old-school in that way, and some of the puzzles do make you grind your teeth as you have to re-start for the umpteenth time.  But it's immensely satisfying when you do get it, and find that (unlike Prince of Persia), the next section is completely different.\n\nThe ending hints towards a sequel, and I know I, and many of my friends were absolutely gutted that one never appeared in the UK.  They apparently made a sort-of-follow-on for the SEGA, but it never appeared on the PC properly.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a very finely crafted game. The 25th anniversary edition upgrades the graphics, and tweaks the gameplay in minuscule ways, but doesn't affect the charm at all.   My advice is to clear your diary for an evening, shut the door, turn out the lights, grab a can of Cola, and settle in for a jolly good adventure.\n\nI ended up buying this game three times.  The original, the anniversary, and then again on Steam, I love it that much.   I've probably completed it four or five times too.     A wonderful, atmospheric, stylish well-paced, well thought through game.  I can heartily recommend it.","April 7, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He boots up his computer, drinks a beverage containing hallucinogens, and then trips out for about 2 hours, thinking he's in outer space with an alien friend that beats up people with the strangest of sounds.\n\n\nGeneral feeling after finishing?\nWarm. Good. The improved graphics are a welcomed change to it. Are we in a movie?\n\n\nStory?\nOne of the best bits of it. It's not complex, but it's dreamy, and unravels with a nice pace and some surprises. I really felt out there for a while, and it's only a pity that it's so short, and it doesn't even have a single word written or spoken.\n\n\nGameplay?\nSome parts are difficult to grasp (more due to the controls than the game's design), like jumping at the right moment, for example, but in general it's simple and well adapted to what it wants to convey. There's basically only basic movement (up down left right jump) and a gun. The gun is one of the better aspects of the game, actually, because it fits in so well with the story. You advance by discovery, there are checkpoints so no fear of dying, but the game doesn't "try to much" to lead you in a given direction as much as others, and there's also a lot of trial and error.\n\n\nGraphics?\nMinimalist but impressive. Rotoscoping, here, like in Prince of Persia, makes for a very smooth atmosphere.\n\n\nSound & Music?\nAgain minimalist and at times a bit distracting, but the effects (especially the gun and the elevators) are really nice.\n\n\nReplayability?\nOnce every couple of years should be fine, but yeah, definitely worth it.","January 23","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will admit I cheated a couple times by looking at walkthroughs online so if you do that, keep in mind, it makes the game much shorter.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is that it's way overpriced on Steam at $9.99. Not having played it through initially in the 90's, I thought the game was going to be much longer. I don't mind it's brevity but not at the price of $9.99. I would sell it on Steam for $2 or $3, but for such a brief game, I have to admit that while I recommend the game, I don't recommend the price so just a heads up if you're thinking to purchase. Otherwise, it's a great game for thinking through solutions.","November 6, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prepare to solve puzzles, run and jump out of danger, and shoot aliens with laser guns, all with a constant feeling of gloom, danger, and wonder. Gone are the days of entering codes to continue, and the remake features convenient checkpoints. My only complaints are the two puzzles toward the end of the game, which can be very hard to figure out if you are good at the action part of the game. Rule of thumb here is that if the game refuses to save your progress, you have missed something important that is required to proceed later on. In all other aspects, this game is out of this world, and should be played by everyone.","June 22, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

This paid of and I still keep that final image of the end scene in my memories as a dear memory and a sing of determination. Today however I felt immensely disappointed by the Anniversary Edition. The controls in modern days are plain ridiculous, where single action button will have a variety of functions depending on the situation, movement and map placement while at the same time being nowhere near being intuitive. It's a shame this have not been redesigned as this will be the main and often the only reason you will fail at majority of situations.","June 28, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a legend to those who played it back when it originally came out.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to play this on my Sega Megadrive (Sega Genesis in the US). This was back in the days when games were still hard. You had to figure out everything by yourself. There was no google or youtube to help you with walkthroughs. If you want a real challenge, try a blind playthrough of this game.\n\nAbout the game then:\n\nThe graphics are really low, but the animations are very smooth. It's a puzzle action platformer, and you have to figure out how to do things without any in-game hints mostly.\n\nThe time it takes to play through the whole thing is fairly short if you know what you're doing. But if it's your first playthrough you should expect it to take longer. The puzzles are pretty hard to figure out without the help of walkthroughs and you will get stuck every now and then. But for the sake of value, try to figure stuff out by yourself. This is not a game for impatient players.\n\nIn summary, if you want a really hard platform action puzzler that is a showcase in how game developers back in the days made the most of what they had available you should get this.","June 28, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I made it a 1080p and the game screen still went down and I couldn't change the resoultion until I changed my monitor resolution. So I said it got to be 1600p, NOPE, still the screen went down and I had to change the monitor resolution setting,. The same story went with 1200p resolution, this game is too edgy for my 4K resolution. So I said it was windowed I must first make it Full screen and then change the resolution to my liking.

He boots up his computer, drinks a beverage containing hallucinogens, and then trips out for about 2 hours, thinking he's in outer space with an alien friend that beats up people with the strangest of sounds.\n\n\nGeneral feeling after finishing?\nWarm. Good. The improved graphics are a welcomed change to it. Are we in a movie?\n\n\nStory?\nOne of the best bits of it. It's not complex, but it's dreamy, and unravels with a nice pace and some surprises. I really felt out there for a while, and it's only a pity that it's so short, and it doesn't even have a single word written or spoken.\n\n\nGameplay?\nSome parts are difficult to grasp (more due to the controls than the game's design), like jumping at the right moment, for example, but in general it's simple and well adapted to what it wants to convey. There's basically only basic movement (up down left right jump) and a gun. The gun is one of the better aspects of the game, actually, because it fits in so well with the story. You advance by discovery, there are checkpoints so no fear of dying, but the game doesn't "try to much" to lead you in a given direction as much as others, and there's also a lot of trial and error.\n\n\nGraphics?\nMinimalist but impressive. Rotoscoping, here, like in Prince of Persia, makes for a very smooth atmosphere.\n\n\nSound & Music?\nAgain minimalist and at times a bit distracting, but the effects (especially the gun and the elevators) are really nice.\n\n\nReplayability?\nOnce every couple of years should be fine, but yeah, definitely worth it.","January 23","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
