With three people you hate. While every other driver on the road is either drunk or deliberately trying to run you off the road. And you only have one sandwich left. And no head lights. Thats basically what the first few missions feel like. After that, it only gets harder because your driver has been blighted, your navigator was killed, and the other guy ate the sandwich because he had been driven insane. Eventually, after replacing a few people, you get to the point where, after a few pit stops, you manage to get rid of them and youre happily riding along with great people, and you think nothing bad is going to happen because youve got the perfect group of passengers. Then an eightteen-wheeler smashes your car killing all of you.

To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.\n\nWhat a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of "correct", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.\n\nHOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.\n\nAs you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a  moment  rather than just a nice bonus.\n\nIt can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a "tactical retreat" as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never  meant  to have it easy, that it's  always  been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure.\n\nEven I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.","January 25","true","257.8"," 1,265 of 1,404 people (90%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","90","265","1","43","42"

Be prepared to experience the consensus "cons"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game.  If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it.\n\nThe most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG.  All of these things exist in varying degrees.\n\nCombat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long.  The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit).  They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat.  If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous.\n\nThe chat bubbles also leave something to be desired.  They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat.  I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted.  This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming.  Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly.\n\nRNG.  I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc).  I've chosen to recant that.  RNG is crippling, but only in the early game.  Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance.  Early on, resources are tight.  You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission.  You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels.  Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE. You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc).  Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions.  In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one.  As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful.\n\nGetting crit increases stress by 15-20.  Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10.  Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game.  When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right.\n\nMy personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order.  There exists a "SPD" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order.  Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system.  It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim).  The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack).  This becomes further complicated when trying to "combo" attacks.  IE. Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it.  Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action.\n\nBeyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features.  Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me.  I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight.  What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative.  Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive.  I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50.  Not to get too invested in "real life" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of "real life", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span).  The same could be said of what happens when you "gamble" on opening chests/sarcophagus.  It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward.\n\nCombat positioning and class synergy are very cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time.  This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting.  Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or "practice" mode that has some examples of "combos" would be helpful.  IE. a guide that says, "Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T".\n\nThe town is also neat.  The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful.  Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming.  Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss.  Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult.\n\nI've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost.  I whole-heartedly disagree.  Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it.  Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does.  Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat.  Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing.\n\nClass balance could be improved.  There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts.  I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless.  Jester, other than people abusing their "stress heal" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well.\n\nUltimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay.  Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic.  When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated.  Early game can be THAT frustrating.  Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall.  Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though.  If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun.  My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game.  I suspect we will.\n\nIf you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon.  The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers.","February 5, 2015","true","31.9"," 570 of 631 people (90%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","90","570","631","18","44"

There's not much to tell, I'm sorry to say. I came here, same reason as you – for glory, for gold. And not one man can fault me with cupidity, no. I tempted good friends, capable friends, spewing that very promise, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n“Like pigs to the slaughter.\n\n“The first month was uneventful at the estate. Harried heroes came and went, but my friends and I were heartier fare. We spent what treasures we pilfered on libation, often causing a ruckus in the tavern. New adventurers would swagger in, ♥♥♥♥♥ure, and we'd put them right in place. We'd usually frighten the greener ones off... the rest would perish, often crying out – for God, for their mother, for the sweet release of death. Fools.\n\n“My friends and I, we don't adventure anymore. We tend the estate, greet would-be heroes such as yourself, to give fair warning. All your skills, all your learning, all your experiences past mean nothing here. You will die, likely alone and raving in the dark. Death is all that you can count on. Death is all you will know.\n\n“What, my necklace? No, these are no ordinary charms, child. These are my friends, you see. I carry them with me still, even after death. They quiet my mind, when the dark comes, you see. It was the least I could do; their bodies gave me sustenance – their bodies give me sustenance, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n“And so will you.”\n\nDarkest Dungeon is an RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler – and yes, I've written this phrase so much it autocorrects genres without prompting. I've named my dog “RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler” and he hates me. But I digress. Story is that your wealthy relative has died, not before sending you a letter, urging you to come to the ancestral ♥♥♥♥ hole to spruce things up and purge the ancient, unknowable evil that lurks, broods, and taints up the place like an unruly teenager. The game starts off with a neat little tutorial, explaining some of the nuances of gameplay: tactical placement of characters, attacks, effects, etc. These are all standards we've come to know and love in the genre, nothing out of the ordinary. But there are a few twists that set Darkest Dungeon apart.\n\nWhen you set out on a journey you'll select your adventurers, and there are a lot to choose from. Some are tanks, some are roguish, some are healers, and some suck (stupid damn plague doctor I HATE YOU SO MUCH). You can select your character order as well, and right clicking on a portrait provides insight into their ideal placement. Different heroes provide different bonuses, like scouting ahead to spot traps and treasure. After you pick your team you'll need provisions, a risk and reward proposition...  are you detecting a pattern? You'll need food for characters, particularly on the longer treks (there's even a camping/survival mechanic to replenish health and stress for such undertakings), or they're liable to starve. You'll need torches  to light the way and keep characters from intermittently having nervous breakdowns. And you'll need various health items to keep bleed and blight effects in check. Does this sound like a lot to juggle? Because I am not doing the death-defying, chainsaw spinning, greased up, foot juggling spectacle justice, I assure you. There aren't enough words. After your quest these provisions don't carry on to the next journey, unfortunately. So do you risk spending too much, or spending too little? Both carry consequence.\n\nBut there's more.\n\nEvery hero and heroine has a stress bar beneath their health. With each enemy encounter, trap, and the act of WALKING, the adventurers will accrue stress. This is countered by killing blows, critical hits, and some support abilities. Inevitably someone will reach their breaking point after one too many knock knock jokes and one of two things will happen: they'll rally courageously, lowering their stress and everyone elses, or become afflicted. This affliction, whether it be cowardice, masochism, irrationality (and more!), means you won't always be in control of that hero, often to their detriment and the team's.\n\nAfter you clear (or flee) a dungeon you return to the estate, a hub where your weary adventurers can get some much needed R&R. Mirroring the core gameplay, your decisions in the hub world are deeply tactical. Some characters are religious, and will only be willing to visit the abbey to relieve stress. Others will happily drink and gamble their sorrows away. And as less savory quirks develop (buffs and debuffs gained through adventuring and R&R, separate from affliction), you can send them to the sanitarium, where presumably all the fun is. All of this is costly in time and money, and you'll have to manage carefully. Fresh heroes and heroines are wheeled into town after every adventure, but they are newbly in nature. With each subsequent successful quest, estate properties unlock, providing you the ability to upgrade abilities, armor and weapons, survivor traits, and more (you can upgrade your town's buildings to improve their respective output). Expect to spend a lot of booty.\n\nAfter enough victories more procedural dungeon locales unlock, bosses become available to fight, and the game gets tougher. I'm not joking when I suggest that YOU, the player, will experience every quirk, affliction, and solace your characters do. I was paranoid. I was stalwart. I was masochistic. I was even hagiophobic (the last time a game introduced me to such cool vocabulary was Eternal Darkness). That is an accomplishment. And it was all worth it, every second of crawling, creeping madness, to play this game.\n\nIt's only February 2015 and this will easily be a contender for GOTY, of that I have no doubt. The art direction is spectacular; beautiful and visceral at the same time, like an old, dusty, medieval anatomy book. The turn-based attacks are so cool, so varied. The enemies are bizarre, terrifying, and menacing. The heroes and heroines are flawed, heroic, almost real. The dungeon crawling is rewarding, the victories are often bittersweet, and the office cooler conversation potential of this game is off the charts with so many variables. But the narration, sweet tap dancing Allfather, Allmother, and every Allrelative in between, the narration is amazing. It's omnipresent, in the hub and dungeons, raising hopes and dashing them in dulcet tones. It's like Vincent Price and Paul Frees' (Disney's Haunted Mansion) voices got married and Cthulhu officiated.\n\nI have a few teeny, tiny criticisms. The game can be unrelentingly punishing at times, unfair even. And while there is no fail state per se, things can get so bad that you'll want to just restart. I'd like the option to play a game in which I can save. XCOM has a save mode AND  an Ironman mode, and I'd prefer that option here as well. There are also little technical glitches here and there, grammatical and spelling errors occasionally. That's about it. That's the sum of my complaints. I'd like to be able to save and there are a few little errors. And this title is in Early Access, which means we can anticipate lots of fine tuning and HOPEFULLY some cool additions as well. But what's already here, what's already been done, is spectacular.\n\nIt would be a grave crime against the Elder Gods to pass this up, and madness will surely follow.","February 3, 2015","true","131.6"," 675 of 768 people (88%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","88","675","768","208","18"

Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the "hard" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.\n\nThe stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the Cthulhu games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.\n\nOh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.\n\nThe game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...\n\nKR Rating: [5] GREAT\n\nBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, Darkest Dungeon is a hard game.\n\nWell, no, that's not really accurate. Etrian Odyssey is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. Darkest Dungeon is not hard, it's unfair.\n\nSee, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called "curios" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the "retreat" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like Dark Souls in a way.\n\nAnd the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.\n\nThe developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the Darkest Dungeon. There are no heroes.\n\nNo, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)\n\nThat's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just "recommend" or "not recommend." Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.\n\nBut "great" and "universally enjoyable" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.\n\nIf I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.\n\nThat said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.\n\nIf you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.\n\n(Read the review on Knight's Reviews by clicking here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com])","October 1, 2015","false","10.4"," 1,682 of 2,032 people (83%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","83","682","2","55","62"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaya47/recommended/262060/","slaya47","abcismasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaya47/","279 products in account","I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed. Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for "delaying" a fight) can just turn them off. Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided. There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful. While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.\n\nNow that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.\n\nThis game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level "WTF" moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThis game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like "The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy" or "the game is anti-fun now", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a "balance patch", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be "fun-killing"). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.\n\nI'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.\n\nEdit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.\n\nRelease Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release.

Your monument to success here is built atop a mountain of failures. And that mountain will be staggering. Your characters will die, either going down swinging valiantly or from something extremely stupid because the entire world was out to get them at that particular moment. Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops. Sometimes you're just using recruits as stepping stones to get more upgrades to maintain your main fighting force, who are still traumatized from their last incursion or who are getting their negative traits tortured out of them in a medieval sanitarium. The game is designed around this, it expects you to do this, and it will passive-aggressively chide you for doing it. You burn through more recruits than a standard game of XCOM: UFO Defense, and that's an accomplishment.\n\nSo despite all the suffering, is the game good? Extremely. It is remarkably complex, difficult and addicting. You will almost never have an ideal scenario, so you have to learn to adapt to every scenario, learn who or what is worth investing in, and work towards that as your goal. Another body in the ground is another cobblestone on your road to success, and expect the ground to be littered with more corpses of adventurers than you will remember. To you it was the most important day in your life when you saw your companions die from a heart attack, bleed to death, and get mangled by a buzzsaw, but for me, it was Tuesday, and soon enough, it will be Tuesday for you as well.\n\nGrim/dark","July 5, 2015","true","211.3"," 244 of 276 people (88%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","88","244","276","42","4"

I picked this game up right after its release and unlike most people I like it now more than I did before, allow me to explain why this game is easily worth the $20.\n\nFirst of all you won't like this game if you fit into the following two categories:\nIf you don't like turn based games or RPGs this game isn't for you, pretty strait forward.\nIf you don' like a challenge, and I mean a real challenge, if you put most of your games you play on easy and then prance through them congratulating yourself on a stellar job this game will bury your pride along with your party of heroes pretty fast. Its hard.\n\nWhy do I like this game (the pros):\nThe narrator is great. fits the mood so well and makes everything come to life with the expansive vocabulary and deep timbre.\nThe artwork. Its superb, every review out there whether positive or negative will say it. It has the best art of any game I have seen a long time and like the narrator it helps the world come to life. The animation, though minimalist, is beautiful and powerful and really helps you feel the game. The sound is also great and helps build mood as it changes depending on how dark it is in the dungeon. At pitch blackness you hear the squeals, groans, shouts, or other sounds of the dungeon enemies off in the distance and during battle the music is louder and more ecstatic, making everything so much more tense. The aesthetics of this game alone make it work and suck you in, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg.\nThe gameplay (I said it, and I'll talk about why other people be hating later). I have always loved tactical turn based and this game is the cream of the crop. There are so many options when it comes to how to defeat your opponents. The enemy monsters are varied and that determines the tactical choices you make. It is brutally unforgiving and thus it takes actual planning to get a good hero lineup and execute with top efficiency; however no hero, ability, trinket or consumable is overpowered (some people say monsters are overpowered... but I'll get to that later). and there are so many ways and lineups to be used to clear dungeons. The tactical battles and overall strategy (the economy, stress heal, and leveling up) go hand in hand.\n\n\nSo why are other people not suggesting the game?\n\nYou can scroll through all the negative reviews but you only really need to read one to read all it basically: "the patch ruined everything." But yet I don't buy into that train of thought and I will explain why:\nPre-corpse and hound patch the game way simply too easy, it was all over the forums too. "This game is too easy its boring" or "after early game its a walk in the park" were the complaints. Unlike currently there was an "overpowered" strat where they would take a crit loaded team with two powerful front line hitters and two back line supports into a dungeon, snuff the torch, and then go ham destroying the front line enemies thus exposing the back line enemies while the supports buffed them up to hit even harder. Battles could be over in two turns. Heroes that didn't work into that formula were never used, like the grave robber, plauge doctor, crusader and bounty hunter. Yes every hero was viable but nothing could clear dungeons like a crit loaded dark run (they also gave you the most gold because as the dungeons get darker the more gold you can find).\n\nThe Corpse and the hound added two unique mechanics that threw off the crit loaded dark runs. The first was corpses. Now when you kill and enemy his corpse remains, meaning that the weaker back line enemies can stay safely in the back line and keep throwing their stuff at you. This screwed over the crit-dark runs because now you had to hack through an enemy and then hack through his corpse to clear a path the back lines, making the battle go longer and thus their crit-dealing heroes took more damage.\n\nThe second mechanic added was PROT or protection to enemies, heroes had always been able to get PROT by the means of a trinket but it was never that big a deal (why would you get a PROT trinket when you could just get a trinket that would boost your crit chance for your crit-dark runs?) PROT basically mitigates damage taken, and now that enemies had it (some had very high amounts) it took the crit-dark run damage dealers a few turn to hack through what used to be an instant kill. Both these additions made battles last longer but also opened the space for new mechanics and strategies. now dark runs were much more risky because of the amount of damage you could rack up (in the dark monsters hit harder and more accurately). But an added mechanic was the DoTs (damage over time affects) like poison and bleed completely ignored PROT and if you killed an enemy with DoTs it didn't drop a corpse. The heroes that had DoT's were the heroes that were considered useless before the patch, they didn't become super overpowered they simply became an actual option that could work.\n\nBasically "the patch" made the game harder and that cause a lot of long time players that had forgotten difficulty and were (to use game analogy) "fattened by decadence and luxury" to rage because they were unable to adapt. People say things like "This game used to be a gem and now I would recommend it to ANYONE!" the unfortunate thing is that if the game had had these mechanics since the beginning everyone would have loved it due to the difficulty. And even if you are scared by all the "the patch ruined everything" reviews, know that the developers knew this would happen. In the corpse and hound patch notes they said at the end that "we will be tweaking these mechanics because we won't know the exact results until after implementation" and they have as of 8/18  nerfed enemy protection and made corpses weaker.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI love this game, and the devs, Its only gotten better for me. I encourage anyone looking for a challenging game that will pull them into the lore and world to look past the negative reviews that all say the same thing. I wrote this review because I feel obligated to let everyone know why some people are mad. At the end of the day, despite the "patch" or PROT I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone remotely interested.\n\n10/10 would go stalwart again.","August 18, 2015","true","147.6"," 502 of 619 people (81%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","81","502","619","22","113"

Obviously, I was familiar with and intruiged by DD for its excellent art style already, but generally I am the type to wait for something to be complete before I give it a shot. However the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe you'd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them.\n\nSo thank you, dear, angry, entitled, (imo) wrong-headed (but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion, which you most certainly do, oh yes, you do...) players, for without your concentrated, delerious ire I may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last (and now this) year! For me, everything about this game is a win. The art, animation, music, sound design, narration, and general presentation are all top-notch. The prose itself is a particular highlight, as is the tongue-in-cheek brutality and general tone. To me, they really nail it.\n\nIt's hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself, because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be. DD is a procedurally-generated, turn-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty (with reference to Dark Souls) and light RPG elements and squad-management (with reference to modern X-Com).\n\nI concede that this can be considered grindy. Dungeon crawlers are generally grindy, even great ones like Dungeon of the Endless or Legend of Grimrock. The distillation of the various aspects of the form, the massive selection of character classes, buffs, debuffs, monsters, the writing, the aesthetic, these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts. However if you don't enjoy that core to some degree or other, I don't know why you'd be considering this anyway.\n\nPersonally, I never had a problem with corpses, because I never played the game without them. Over 50+ hours, I managed to beat a number of the bosses, level characters up to the top tiers, etc, ect, and only stopped because I felt like I had gotten far enough where I was ready to play the game in a finished state, and didn't want to master too much. I also died a lot. Then I died some more. And it was fun the whole time!\n\nAs the year went on and waves of negative Steam comments continued to roll in, I felt like I was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players. As they railed against it getting harder and harder, for example, I found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier. I certainly wasn't dying as much. Maybe I was just somehow very good at it? I don't know. I still die all the time in X-Com. I don't think of myself as a master gamer or tactician.\n\nThe other critique I saw a lot, which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it, is that the devs somehow didn't care about the criticisms, that they don't listen, or that they were corrupt, or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the Early Access community, that this game was somehow some kind of scam. That's just ridiculous. There were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year, which added all kinds of content in various ways. They were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked. They were communicative, and they were clearly listening and being involved (and also making the game, for goodness sake, cmon).\n\nGetting back briefly to the Great Corpse Outrage 2k15, for example, corpses were made a voluntary opt-out in the options menu pretty much from Backlash Ground Zero. Not that a developer has any reason to do something like that, but to then deny that it happened, or to say that they don't listen, that they're somehow scamming you, that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical, petulent, garbage argument. I can't understand what this aspect of the community actually wants, for the life of me. If the game isn't for you, you certainly don't have to play it. But a certain amount of the negativity (which borders on outright hostility) strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasn't cooked to his liking. Still, you have to admire (if not boggle at) their conviction, and their sheer verbosity of it all.\n\nFor me, this game actually sold me on the idea that Early Access could be an enjoyable, worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and I couldn't be happier with my decision to do so, and I look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer. Hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that there's a worthy, enjoyable, wonderfully-crafted experience at the center of everyone's opining.","January 19","true","95.0"," 1,315 of 1,685 people (78%) found this review helpful 215 people found this review funny","78","315","1","215","271"

I did hit a bit of a burnout with the game (not suprising given the 36 play time in something like 70 real life hours).

I named (friends and family work well here), upgraded, debuffed and looked after them. If the situation was dire, I'd do my best to get the sane ones back to my sanctuary to get them ready for the next run. This strategy kept me interested and scared of losing people\n+ Value for money: Steam bieng Steam, usually I wait for a sale to buy a game, especially one in early access. However I took the plunge with this one, and at 40 hours (to me personally) I am very satisfied with my purchase.\n+ Updates: Game has only been out 6 days, so can only speak for that time.

Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I’ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it’s a warning.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I’ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I’ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive.\n\nThere are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy’s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes.\n\nBefore even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.\n\nWith the game saving automatically as you go along, there’s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.\n\nI truly love this game and can’t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.","April 22","true","103.4"," 315 of 392 people (80%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","80","315","392","17","19"

To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.\n\nThe changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle.\n\nBack before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.\n\nTL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.\n\nAs for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.\n\nIf you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing. Still, I recommend this game to everyone I know, and it gets a big thumbs up here.","January 20","true","62.6"," 411 of 534 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","411","534","14","5"

The game is unapologetically difficult, with things like an automatic up to the second autosave to prevent "favorable reloads" when you get in a jam, and it was made that way intentionally. People seem to like the challenge. Even the sound is good. The price is reasonable as well.\n\nSo this isn't a terrible game, and it is still early access so things might get even better as it nears "completion" (only 3 of 5 dungeons are playable at this time).\n\nBut recently there have been several game design choices that have pushed the game from "hard but enjoyable" to "too many things that make the game tiresome", which I have been sorry to see.\n\nThey recently introduced a "corpse" mechanic, that drops when you kill a creature without using a damage-over-time attack. This was a step back for gameplay and a change not alot of people like, as it makes combat more of a chore to have to "kill things twice" in order to get at the remaining creatures. This change has made several character types less effective (those that have no DOT attacks and can only attack the closest enemies) and really made combat less fun. It also makes several character types "necessary" even if you don't want to play them. This is compounded by the fact the computer opponents for the most part can attack any of your characters from whichever position without penalty.\n\nIn addition to this, there were recent reductions to player damage, which again changed a lot of things that were "hard but fun" into a a boring slog. Damage on critical hits was reduced, making fights take longer. Creatures were given "protections" running up to 80%, making fights run a LOT longer, especially at the higher levels. Even to the point that the game "penalizes" you, for thinking you are dragging the fights out on purpose.  For some creatures, the combinations of increased protection, lower player damage, and corpses getting in the way of the flow of combat, has taken the fun out of things to a large extent. Add to that the fact that a lot of creatures will spam AOE attacks that hit your entire party, turn after turn, and again, the fun factor really takes a dive.\n\nThere are also the usual number of growing pains with an alpha title, but those will likely get worked out.\n\nAnd there is certainly time for this game to "recover" before launch. And I hope it does.\n\nBut right now it is over the line "hard but fun" into "a slog that I no longer feel like playing much".\n\nI would hold off buying at this time.","July 25, 2015","false","261.1"," 706 of 947 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","706","947","12","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellbent/recommended/262060/","ellbent","ellbent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellbent/","403 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor a lot of people, Darkest Dungeon is going to feel like the game they've been waiting for. The team behind it has done a great job.\n\nIt's impossible to discuss Darkest Dungeon without praising the beautifully stark art direction; it channels the deep shadows of Mike Mignola (of "Hellboy") perfectly, and the colors shift and suppurate everywhere from the doomed hamlet at the foot of the Darkest Dungeon to the deepest and most Godforsaken pit you'll chuck adventurers into like a wood chipper. The music deftly changes between ominous, somber, and stirring as the situation demands, and the narrator keeps the tone set wonderfully, commenting (though not annoyingly so) on every turn of fate in a Tony Jay timbre.\n\nEven putting aside the excellent and cohesive creative vision on display, the core mechanics of Darkest Dungeon are brutally satisfying. You'll begin the game tentatively sending small, untested and largely unfamiliar adventurers (I really suggest you not bother naming the poor souls yet) on short jaunts through nightmarish corridors -- keep the torch brightly lit in these beginning forays! -- in the hopes that some of them will back come out the other end with cash and relics to upgrade your town, relax and medicate your mercenaries, and keep the gears (the pulping, threshing gears) of your little dungeon-centric industry going.\n\nThe dungeons themselves are hesitant strolls punctuated by combat where every single point of health and stress counts. Darkest Dungeon keeps its numbers small: it'll be exciting when the Leper smacks a bandit for 11 damage, whether or not the Crusader heals for 4 points will be a matter or life and death, and the first time the Bounty Hunter gets a critical hit on a Marked target with Collect Bounty, 40 damage will seem miraculous. The first three-digit enemy will be more than a little worrisome. The RNG is still as fickle as ever though, so be prepared for even the best-laid plans to get ruined by bad luck.\n\nThose tools at your disposal -- the mercenaries -- are a really great puzzle in themselves, too. Where should each fighter stand? What skills can even be used where they're standing? Is it too risky to have a mercenary who's useless if he's knocked out of position by a spell or an ambush? Is having a mercenary who can act in every position going to leave him spread thin? If you put two skills on an adventurer that can only be used in the very back row, what happens if someone in the party dies and there IS no back row? Should you send a very stressed Occultist with a fresh group of mercenaries and risk him driving them ALL mad? Is it safe to send a half-useless and untested Jester with three experienced pigstickers if it means his death will ruin their morale?\n\nThis decision-making only gets worse (better) as the game goes on, and opens you up to a really great obligation to constantly shift, rearrange, retrain and reassess your bands of brethren. Missions will get longer, necessitating that your heroes stop to camp and comfort each other with incense, mockery, medicine, or prayer. As you start to get a few of your hires to a higher level of skill and bravery, sometimes so high that they'll refuse some missions as being beneath their abilities, the management of the town transforms from a largely between-dungeons concern to a much greater part of the metagame.\n\nYou'll swap afflicted but useful madmen in and out of the sanitarium and make decisions on whether it's more pertinent to cure your Bounty Hunter's accuracy-ruining case of The Yips or purge him of Deviant Tastes apparently so unspeakable he's not allowed at the brothel.\n\nYou'll wish a million painful deaths on the Caretaker because he took the last seat at the bar and your Hellion who's psychologically coming apart at the seams -- the Hellion that you NEED for the next outing -- can't relax with anything but a tall tankard.\n\nYou'll stare at the weekly report that tells you than your Crusader, who you sent to meditate his cares away, decided to leave the hamlet on a vision quest and take his holy wrath with him when otherwise your whole 'A-team' skeleton demolition crew is ready to go.\n\nThe town influences your quests into the subterranean meat grinders and vice versa. Parties that before seemed perfect will be split up because the Grave Digger needs her Rabies cured and the Plague Doctor's medicines seem more appealing when faced with the Blight-dripping porcine residents of the Warrens. It keeps the player out of complacency in a really satisfying way; fans of X-COM or other high-stakes strategy will love the feeling of having to scramble in the face of disaster or cut their losses and tell the veteran Vestal and Leper to abandon the quest as well as the bodies of their compatriots.\n\nDarkest Dungeons is a satisfying, strategic game about risk, reward, and reanimation. The dungeon crawls revitalize a task that's otherwise become almost a joke; there's no hazardous smashing through pinata baddies filled with loot here, and each time you hit 'Embark' you'll never really be sure what will be left of your party, if anything at all. The town management is a compelling game of its own, echoing "worker placement" board games and charming you as you hone blades, upgrade skills, and wrangle holy alcoholics into their barstools.\n\nThere's still some rough edges from Early Access here and there. Placeholder dialogue pops up occasionally and the central story has been held off until it's done, but even unfinished and in a mostly sandbox state both halves of Darkest Dungeon interact with other in a way that'll have you coming back for more. More, and more, and more, until in the folly of your hubris, the keening susurrations within the deepest abominable chambers beneath your lineage's empty-eyed manse ring out across the blighted land in an unendurable cacophony of gibbering and most terrible doom.","February 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 167 of 203 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","167","203","12","9"

My general rule: do not purchase pre-release games of any kind, but watching a few play throughs on Youtube peaked my interest and had me break my rule for a second time in my life. The game looked (and still looks) gorgeous, and seemed challenging and fun to play.\n\nAfter two restarts, one being a quick play through on another computer, I got the hang of the game.\n\nI so want to like this game, and while I do have hope for it in the long run, I don't recommend this game in its current state.\n\nWhat? I can't recommend the game and I still like certain things about it? Absolutely! Here's a few things I like about this product:\n\n* The art. It's beautiful, effective, and it works. The artwork was, and still is my biggest draw. Some people put what appears to be tremendous love and attention to detail in this part of the game. At about 20 hours invested into the game, I'm clear I was sold on the art work more than anything else.\n\n* This is a strategy game, not a tactical game. I get to be the invisible hand that guides the estate, running a stream of adventurers into dungeon after dungeon, building my coffers, choosing the ones I want to live, dismissing the broken, and sending the fodder to their doom. So many games bill themselves as strategy but end up being minutia based click-fests. Of the actual game mechanics, this subtle aspect is my favorite part of all gamey things found here, and I hope it doesn't get lost in the development of the game.\n\n* I am very pleased with the implementation of the stress system. The stress system gives me a subtle factor that I need to handle beyond the usual hit points. I'm more afraid of stress damage than of HP damage during combat. It's novel, and I hope that the system gets more love and attention as the game develops.\n\n* The spirit of the difficulty level is spot on.\n\nAnd yet the main reason I can't recommend the game in its current state: I don't feel there's much _game_ here.\n\nI feel that this game is the most beautifully painted set of dice that I've ever laid my eyes on. The dice talk to me, they invite me to their (slightly scary) parties. And even though I try to convince myself they're more than N-sided polyhedrons, they remind me that I'm just a useless skin bag whether I'm rolling Critical Hits or Critical Misses.\n\nBefore writing this I read reactions to the game posted here and elsewhere. I found it odd that I sided with people who were saying the game was too difficult and at the same time sided with people who said it was too easy.\n\nIn a completely non-scientific study, I took a few notes about my game play, and summarized my experience: arbitrary. The arbitrariness swings too hard, both for the good and the bad. Examples:\n\n* Earlier build than the current, but I got 4 (egads!) hunger events across 5 rooms of travel.\n* Then of course I have dungeons with zero hunger. Zero. We got meters for everything else, and hunger is a classical part of roguelike games. How about a hunger meter?\n* My first foray into a level 3 dungeon I took two level 2 people and two level 1 people. Made it almost to the end, went an extra room, and got obliterated by a really scary monster, seems fair, although I was surprised I made it so far without a hitch. Then...\n* ...my second foray into a Level 3 medium dungeon with my A-team, appropriately equipped. One non-starter room and two total and unavoidable battles in I have a death's door highwayman, a 60% stressed Hellion, and everyone not on death's door was beaten (HP wise) quite badly. This made me take a break for about a day...\n* ...and then I came back and accepted I might lose my A-team and went trekking into the dungeon a bit longer, ready at any moment to quit the mission. Almost nothing happened and I completed the quest by exploring 90% of the rooms with only minor battles. Really?\n* Then my next two dungeons with full light had like no monsters and I got lots of treasure.\n* Then I spent a frustrating dungeon with consistent 75%-100% light getting surprise after surprise and being eaten by those gnashing dogs, whatever they're called. So much bleeding everywhere, so much being surprised. I even got Rabies, not personally thankfully, but my Vestal was frothing. Had to put her down like Old Yeller.\n* Then I make it to the hag, and everything is going pretty well, but almost didn't beat the hag because I let my leader stay in the cauldron and die, and then my Bounty Hunter got thrown into the pot after the leader died, which shifted my party order arbitrarily forward, and with the load out of my guys only my Vestal could attack the hag. Almost defeated by party order, so silly.\n\nWhen I do well at things, or even just making my toddler smile (which is a feat in and of itself) I can often look back and see what worked. Despite the moments when I get frustrated, whether I lost another run in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or lose a hand of Poker, I can often pinpoint what went wrong. But here, whether it's good or bad, it seems like the overriding factor of success or failure is out of my control. I wouldn't go so far to call the gameplay Darkest Cookie Clicker, but it's very alienating as a player. There's no joy in my successes, and losses, while frustrating, make me shrug my shoulders only to hire more bodies from the stage coach to throw back into the meat grinder.\n\nBut this game could have substance, and a lot of it, if the same love and care that went into the art goes into polishing the game and the mechanics.\n\nWith all that said, since this isn't my game, I have a qualitative request to ask the staff and developers of this product:\n\nPlease, you have so much going good for you already in early access, but my expectation was to find a game that was more solid and art/UI that was less solid. Instead I found the reverse. (Despite some UI quirks, you have a very solid UI overall, something that is no easy feat.)\n\nTake a week off, not just a weekend, regroup, and please don't just shove spot fixes in to try to fix things. Please step back, take a holistic view of your game, and do the work to make the game mechanics and the game play itself as solid as the things that do work.","February 17, 2015","false","22.0"," 785 of 1,071 people (73%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","73","785","1","59","32"

I've lost heroes because of my own mistakes, underestimating opponents (♥♥♥♥ing Ancient Webbers), and (rarely) RNGesus, but it's never been because the game was too stacked against me.\n\nTo earn gold, you HAVE to budget. In early stages, when you're upgrading your Hamlet, you have to learn when Heroes are more trouble than they're worth and to let them go (i.e. their stress reduction cost total > the gold you're taking in, too many diseases, bad quicks that are locked in, etc). Everyone in the beginning is expendable. The overall goal is to accumulate wealth and upgrade that Hamlet.\n\nSimply said, you're not going to get to level 6 on your Heroes from the very beginning.\n\nAfter a while, gold and upgrading become less of an issue. Gold farming is incredibly easy to the Champion level dungeon runs (presuming you survive), with 15K gold as a reward for completing it, and it cost me about 4K to get more than enough supplies to survive. Adding in all the loot that I got (around 14k on my last run), the difference is real. Putting in about 6K in stress reduction, and 4K in quick-removal/disease removal, I still came out on top.\n\nEven with the ease of gold farming in later stages of the game, your Heroes can AND WILL die. I lost nearly an entire party of level 6 Heroes to Webbers because I had gotten into a "click, kill" mentality, and thought that the blight damage would be under control. Wrong.\n\nYou have to think about each move you make, because every encounter has the possibilty of going south.\n\nUpdate (Jan 5 2016): I'm very pleased that the featured reviews are all recommended like this game deserves, instead of the people who raged when updates happened and couldn't think critically about it.","December 25, 2015","true","133.8"," 456 of 612 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","456","612","13","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/recommended/262060/","SwaiN","Fuji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/","156 products in account","I've had Darkest Dungeon for a while now and I'm pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it.  DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out.  Many people say that there is no "fail state", but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose.  There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly.  Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken.  Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).\n\nIn short, the game has always been hard.  The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits).  Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations.  The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism.   I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.\n\nIf you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing.  I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently.  Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore.  If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying.  On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.\n\nAll in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.\n\nEdit for clarity:\n\nAfter seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.\n\nThe trinkets:\nI feel like they simply aren't balanced.  Most of the "Ancestral" (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help.  For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters.  That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit.  On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.\n\nThe increased prices:\nMost people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game "harder", it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the ♥♥♥.  Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher.  Has this specific issue bugged me?  No, not really.\n\nCurios:\nHonestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now.  When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't.  You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.\n\nHealing:\nThe devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets.  So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements.  Has this ever affected me personally?  No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons.  Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing?  Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.\n\nFacerolling:\nDo you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills?  Did they ever completely faceroll everything?  Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant?  Yeah, same here.  The game has never been "too easy" or "too hard", but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party.  One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE.  The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.\n\nClass choices:\nLet's face it, some classes are just underpowered.  I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit.  Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster.  The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable.  Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle.  I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept.  With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter.  The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well.  Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh.  In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet.  In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to "faceroll" things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched.  If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...\n\nFor the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it.  But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying "those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing", there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD.  I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.\n\nIf you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere.

The content and game-play are there, and the final product may work well in the end, but as it is now, its a game of luck, and not a game of skill.\n\nIt starts out like a sick game of chess.  Your moves must be thought out, and sacrifices must be made.  Unfortunately, once you get deeper into the game, the mobs are clearly designed to play on the fact that death is not a big deal for them and that they do not have to deal with "stress".  There are a number of mobs that simply bomb your team's "stress" from a distance and cause diseases without thinking of defending themselves.  So instead of the enemy mobs playing smart, they just throw themselves into you knowing that its the next fight that will kill you.\n\nAnother failing aspect of the game is the crit system.  The enemies have WAY too high of a crit chance.  EVERY time that I lost a hero that I spent time working on, spent money on, and built up to take on the heavy fights, I lost him/her to a string of OP crits that I could do ZERO to prevent.  -- Fight starts: first enemy attacks, crit, 1/2 hp lost.  Second enemy attacks, crit, down to 0 hp and now have a DoT.  My turn: DoT kills my highest level hero before I can do a thing.  --  Not a fun mechanic in the least.\n\nThe game has also gotten worse as it has been updated.  Instead of building upon the old game, the devs are forcing the players' hands to play the game the way the devs want.  Literally changing some mobs to have such high defense that you are meant to be forced into using DoTs... That's not my play style, so I am punished for it.... no thank you.  This  also takes away from creative party builds.  Now you have a checklist that you have to meet and to hell with your play style.\n\nOn top of the fact that there seems to be no direction at the moment.  If you stay in a fight too long, then your party takes more stress damage.  But with that game mechanic in mind, they add the NEED for DoTs, and enemy corpses that will block your melee units thus drawing the combat out and once again designing combat that clearly bolsters the monsters.  If a monster falls, there is a corps that keeps the ranged enemies in the back where they want to be, and EVERY monster has an attack that can reach from the back row, if one of your heroes falls, no corpse, your ranged guy is forced to move forward... The devs want difficult, and that's fine, but not at the expense of logic.  A corpse actually causes problems in a fight because your veteran fighters are too thick to step to the side?  * Scratches head *  Thankfuly, with the latest patch, they added the option to have corpses on or off.\n\nThen there is the preparation for the fights.  Some dumbass opens the gates of hell, so he calls upon heroes to fix his mistake, then charges you 250 gold for a shovel?!  A shovel that you cannot bring back if you don't use it?!  Is there a hole in my backpack that  only lets things fall out that I will have to buy again for the next fight?  Am I the only one who is lost here?  Your adventurers have no problem bringing back gold and stones, but any supplies that will cost you money next time will be left in the dungeon.  Why?  Because the devs say so.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that your heros are ALL likely to end up with a debuff at the end of a dungeon, even if you do well.  I gotten through a dungeon or two that I took minimal damage, minimal stress, and left with a sack full of loot,  full bellies, and full health only to have ALL of my characters come out with different afflictions and zero positive attributes.  There are plenty of punishing games on the market that don't punish you for a job well done.  This game becomes a grind due to the fact that you are punished for doing a good job just as much as you are punished for doing a bad job.  It's easy to just stop caring all together because you  are going to end up worse off no matter what.  Hell, you can even be punished for trying to remove stress in town because your characters will disappear for days on end binge drinking, or will "witness troubling activities" and can no longer pray for stress relief.\n\nSo if you want a game that is going to push your strategic skills and make you care for your heroes because if you play it smart, you just might prevail, DO NOT BUY THIS.\n\nIf you want a game that will throw all of your hard work and preparation away due to one unlucky fight, go for it!\n\n*Started a new game 10-3-15 to try out the new updates.  Started a new game, and when I got to the first fight with my two starting characters, I preceded to miss five out of eight attacks, and the three that I landed were  two stuns and a bleed, all of which were resisted.  The enemy missed zero attacks, scored two crits, and I resisted none of the bleed or push-backs.  I was dead before getting to town.  STILL an unbalanced game of LUCK*","July 21, 2015","false","64.7"," 534 of 735 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","534","735","15","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/262060/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler game, developed by Red Hook Studios. The game was initially released in Early access in January 2015, before leaving Early Access in January 2016.\n\nGameplay in Darkest Dungeon leaves you in control of a roster of heroes; you control almost every aspect of your hero’s journey throughout the game. Initially you start out with two heroes from the tutorial, and you can expand your roster by visiting the stage coach in the main game hub, here you can select from at least two heroes and have them join your group. The central hub of the game also includes various other useful locations too, such as an armour smith, weapon smith, a tavern, hospital, and many more. Each of these locations becomes key to the progression in Darkest Dungeon.  The dungeon crawling side of the game is done from a side scrolling perspective, as you explore randomly generated dungeons in search for loot and treasure. The combat in this game is turn based, and very tactical. Each of your party of 5 heroes will have their own preferred location in your group and will only be able to use certain attacks based on their location too. Each of your characters has 4 active abilities they can use in a dungeon; you can swap and change them as you please in the main hub provided you have learned the skill beforehand.  Your party will also contract diseases, afflictions, blights and wounds throughout their journey and most will probably even die or become useless. You can cure these by visiting the hospital in the hub, but some may render your character pointless to have around. Like the game says at the very start, you really have to make the best out of a bad situation most of the time.\n\nGraphically, it isn’t very intense; however the art style which is presented is just wonderful. The art style is really important to this game, as it shows the essence and feel of the game perfectly. The hand drawn look to the game is one of my favourite styles in gaming at the moment, and Darkest Dungeon wets my appetite beautifully there.   What is really important here though, would be the game’s user interface. As there is a lot of information needed to be able to progress successfully through the game, you are obviously going to need a clean and clear interface to show that information. The game’s tutorial at the start of the game explains a lot of it quite nicely. However a lot of the information is left for you to find out for yourself.  All of your characters information, stats and equipment are all a click away, as well as your map and inventory screen. I was really happy with the interface, a few changes I would of made is to add a lot of information to show right on the screen straight away, rather than having to hover over the item, or bar – it just felt like an unneeded hoop to jump through to get the information I wanted. The ordering of the turns can be quite difficult to keep track of as well; I still have no idea how it is worked out, but I would of liked to have seen maybe a time line of the battle somewhere on the screen to make it a little easier for you to plan your attacks; maybe this was considered already but was specifically not added so the game is all that much harder, that to me is the only logical reason for not having something like that included.\n\nThe audio in Darkest Dungeon is also spot on as well. First of all, the narrator is just plain awesome. His rusty voice sent shivers down my spine at times; it is very much on par with other great narrations like Bastion and Transistor. Sound effects are all really nicely designed too; the attack noises and monster sound effects are very nice and add an extra level of immersion to your game play.\n\nThis may be the hardest video game I have ever played. The game is so unforgiving and you will get screwed over, and you will probably die from your own stupid mistakes over and over again; but that is the whole point of this game. The aim to finish the game is very hard to hit and when you do hit it, you will be able to give yourself a very well earned pat on the back, because you will have just completed a monster difficulty game. I have never actually completed lost all of my party members, there seems to be an endless supply of them in the game’s hub, so you will never “lose the game” so to speak, you can just keep retrying (all be it with lower level characters).  This is one of those games where I had to spend a sufficient amount of time outside of the game, in the wiki and on forums just to give me that little extra edge over the unforgiving game play; I am not ashamed to admit and you shouldn’t be too if you have to check little bits of information out.\n\nDue to playing the game a lot offline this week due to PC problems, a lot of my time has not been tracked, but I have put in roughly 30 hours of gameplay. I have still not finished the game, I have managed to hit max level with about 6 of my characters but I have been spending quite a while farming and grinding money for me to upgrade them more before taking on the final stages of the game. Due to the game’s randomness, the replay ability is extremely high even when you manage to finish it the once. This is a game you can easily get at least 100 hours out of without growing bored of it.\n\nTechnically I had no issues what so ever. It is definitely a game you have to use a keyboard and mouse on, just because of the amount of information you require access to. There aren’t any graphical options available sadly but it should run on just about anything as it isn’t graphically intensive. Although it isn’t exactly a technical talking point, but a nice added feature here was that you can actually turn off some of the game mechanics right out of an options menu, yes this may make the gam experience differ and may even decrease the difficulty, but I personally don’t see this as a real issue in a single player game.\n\nMy conclusion on Darkest Dungeon is that it is one of the best games to come out via the Early Access system. Even when it was first released, it was a better game than most, but now it has been fully released this year it is an absolute must play title. All other devs looking to release a game into early access really need to pay attention to these guys as it was done so perfectly and hassle free. I can easily say that it is my up most favourite roguelike game ever. The game’s regular price on Steam for £18, 99 is a good price point, there is tons of content and extremely high production values put into this game. Do not hesitate for a second more and pick this game up.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

The Game\n\nThis game... where to begin, *Sigh* I bought this game in Early Access a week after it came out, I was looking for a Horror game- surprisingly this popped up under the tag (It's not a horror game btw unless you consider 2D monsters as "scary") and when I checked the trailer I said, "Oh what the heck, forget the horror game this looks interesting" I bought it, played it... and was very satisfied that I didn't search for that horror game because this game is a Flawless Gem...\n\nIt's a Dark Fantasy RPG Rogue Like - ...Whew what a mouth full - It's inspired by H.P. Lovecraft (Yes the author of the so called "Cthulhu Novels") & Dark Souls. The Game's Immersion is extremely well done with the narrator\n- Wayne June his name is...\n\nVideo with his narration.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rClHWMt9AWI\n\nHis voice creates this immersive... tense atmosphere. The Narration is done in such a way that he narrates your combat actions, how you're exploring the dungeon and when you find unique enmies. The feeling I get when I play this game is like when playing a D&D tabletop with my friends in a dark room and we're exploring an ancient dungeon, except this game makes it appear visually, seriously if you like D&D you'll love this game. I sometimes get so immersed into my character "Reynauld" in the game I repeat the stuff he says when walking down the corridors of a dungeon! Haha! This game really is amazing to me.\n\nThe creatures are exceptionally well done they look creepy and will fright your heros and yourself quite a bit. The heros are very well done.\n\nLevel Design is outstanding (It really feels like exploring a dungeon).\n\nThe Sound- Excellent! It may seem that I'm saying excellent everything, but if you don't believe me, experience it yourself. (Gameplay Vids on YouTube, isn't an "Experience") I suggest before you buy it... try it... and by that I mean go... you know, download it... for free "somesites" that I don't know and then if you like the game go BUY it and support the developers cause they deserve it as much as you enjoying their game for free.\n\nPeople say the game gets repetitive- which I don't know how it is possible, because this game has a story which people with 200+ Hrs havn't even completed yet, aswell as UNIQUE cinematics for each boss/lvl and sercret rooms. (There are over 14+ bosses and 50+ Quests 50+ unique items to collect.) If you play the game right and Explore like a person that knows how to play an actual RPG like this... - You'll find so many secrets that keep you from the main quest and prolongs gameplay even more...\n\nSecondly... The Concerns Surrounding The Difficulty\n\nThe game is OBLITERATINGLY HARD - literally the game is so hard that you have a chance to get both your tutorial characters killed (If you really have no idea of what you're doing) -or at least one of them. A lot of negative reviews is about how hard the game is, yet one of it's insparations are Dark Souls - which is renown for how insanely hard it is and yet no complaints about it's difficulty, and that FURIATES me to a very unnerving extent, because people now read the negative reviews of what people wrote & then they have like barely 20 Hrs of gameplay - they think the game is either accidentally made like this because of the RNG or the Devs are Insane, but actually if you run the game... after the intro it says that the game IS unforgiving - for that it is its nature... and on the store page.\n\nThe game is meant to be this hard and unforgiving - you require skill and patience when fighting you can't just select a skill and click on the enemy and expect it to die! You need to look at the bottom right on the "Enemy Info" tab for the "Chance to hit, Chance to Crit, the Debuffs/Buffs you get from using the skill and the Damage Probabiblity (Google the word "Probabability"\n\nPlease, if you don't like dying and starting over almost constantly... don't buy the game, because I can garantee you 100% that if you don't look at the "Enemy Info" Tab, or try to learn combining classes in a party... or if you're LAZY to take your time and think about what to buy before entering a dungeon... you will suffer mercilesly and painfully...\n\nThe point is, just because your characters die because you dont know how to play the game (By that I mean learn it because you learn through trial and error) and immidiately quit after 10-12 mins of playing... and now go write a negative review about RNG and stuff you don't know... I bet you most of the people who have RNG written in their negative reviews don't even know what it means and what it does when encoded in a game... (Random Number Generator) unless they quickly google it.\nIf you can look past losing/dying constantly, and know eventually when you learn the game you'll improve indefinitely... then this is the game for you hardcore gamers cause this game is meant to test your limits.\n\n:EDIT:\nIf you really want to, because of all the NegReviews the devs recently made a settings TAB where you can choose to remove Heart Attacks, Stress, Corpses and more difficulties. But that's the game for wusses, It's not meant to be played like that.\n\nThirdly... Game Mechanics\n\nCharacters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them.\nTo have fun and not die you'll need to gather your 4 leaf clovers for some luck, because the game...sadly (for some) is RNG based, you'll also need to know your basic and some complex abbreviations for RPG's that's why the game has a glossary book when your at your Estate menu on the bottom right of the screen.\n\nYou can CAMP!!! This is the first Dungeon Crawler That I found where you can camp!\nYou get a few types of dungeons:\n\n- Short\n- Meduim (Where you can start camping)\n- Long      ^\n\nWhen you camp it's almost like when you play D&D with your friends, you first decide which survival skills to use and it spends time points that hover above your campfire for example, every class has Combat Skills <Self Explanatory (Used in Combat) and Survival/Camping Skills (Used in the camping menu when you choose to set up camp in a dungeon/room)\nThe crusader has this one skill where he gives everybody stress relief with a speech he gives and where others can take watch while the rest of the party sleeps... all those skills take "Time Points" (The hovering number above your camp menu) and eventually when you decided you've used enough of those points the rest of the time is how long the party sleeps- the longer the more they heal and stuff.\n\nA TIP: After you bought the game, when you enter it and it shows RedHook Studios' logo don't press Esc. otherwise you'll skip the amazing cinematic Intro that gives you the starting lore you need!\n\nPROS+ & CONS-\nPROS+\n\n-Game is Hard\n-Lore is Great\n-Narration is Excellent\n-Lots of Loot\n-Variety of Monsters\n-Interesting story\n-Addictive\n-Great Immersion\n\nCONS-\n\n-Game is Hard (It can be good & bad from 3rd person perspective - Personally  I feel it's a pro cause it gives me bragging rights if I beat lvls)\n-Can be Frustrating\n-May Get Reppetitive (Depending if you Roleplay or not I.M.O.)\n-Realistic (Monsters that look like this I imagine won't be easy to fight in real life and people complain)\n-For HardCore Gamers only (By that I mean if you don't change the Misc settings for Heart attacks, Removal of stress ect.\n\nThank you for your time in reading my review. If you feel I spent to much words on the difficulty please feel free to criticise in the comments and if I should add some stuff!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/junRSA/recommended/262060/","junRSA","June","http://steamcommunity.com/id/junRSA/","140 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recently purchased Darkest Dungeon and I haven't been able to stop playing it.\n\nBefore I write my review I wish to state that there are far too many negative reviews that are completely unjustified. Yes, the game is unforgiving however it is nothing like what the other reviewers have stated.\n\nA lot of the people complaining are the same crowd as the 'casuals' you find in other games suggesting changes to allow them to 'win more often'. For example, "“Some traps for example are not visible and will just hit you without any counter option (but luck as in dodge)”. The traps become visible if you have 'scouted' the map. I have 112 hours at the moment and I do not lose any heroes  at all (your heroes have permanent death) and I have a full roster of heroes of every class. I can only imagine that the people who are finding the game incredibly difficult are struggling to understand the mechanics of the game. You will see below as to why it is identical to the 'casuals' you often find in other games.\n\nPeople are a complaining about balance changes. For example, "“The developers … seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun)”. People were just AoE'ing enemy characters to death, removing any skill from the game as players could kill the enemy characters before they could even react. This was changed so you couldn't just 'no skill' AoE mobs down and people are complaining about this. People were double and triple stacking classes because of this and just mindlessly using the same AoE abilities (You can see this in YouTube videos before the changes). Know the abilities, choose classes that compliment each other and play smartly; this is how the game should be, right?\n\nThe other complaints is that everything is too expensive. For example, "Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl".\n\nI started after the patch and although I dont have a huge amount of gold, my whole roster is upgraded to the max levels. Previously it was absolutely ridiculous and you never had to worry about how to spend your gold. It was just an unnecessary resource as you made an insane amount of gold and it cost nothing to upgrade skills/abilities, armour/weapons or use 'stress recovery' options for your heroes. Gold must be a reward for completing a dungeon and you should have to spend it wisely, not sit with it in thousands and never have to make a decision on how to spend it.\n\nPeople in the Steam reviews have used the cliched "it is not polished enough" which is the complete opposite of the truth. I do not think you will find many games as polished as this where the passion of the developers shine in their work.\n----------\nReview:\nDarkest Dungeon to me has been a refreshing experience. It features the narration of Wayne June in the most unique way I've ever encountered in a game. The narrator will essentially comment on the combat pushing the sound design from Darkest Dungeon to a new level. When you land a critical hit, Mr June will make you feel it.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game has a very dark art style to it. Everything is very well drawn. The creatures are hideous (in a good way) which adds to the dark theme of the game.\n\nSound:\nThere has been no cost spared in sound design. As someone with a degree in Music Production, Sound Design and Music Business, I really have a lot of appreciation for what they have done here. As mentioned there is the narration of your combat, but the amount of sounds they have created for the skills, which sound really good, is unbelievable. They all sound like the ability should. They have even gone as far to make unique sounds for when the abilities fail. Monster sounds are just as scary as the monsters are gruesome, making it easy to immerse oneself.\n\nGameplay:\nI see the Steam reviews are saying the game is unbalanced and too difficult. I find the game to be almost perfectly balanced, if not too easy. I have 2 final bosses to finish and I have not wiped or died on any of the final bosses so far. I find the AI is a bit too forgiving where it could have got a kill it instead attacked a hero with more health.\n\nThe game uses a unique system that when you get to 0 hp, you reach the status of 'Deaths Door'. You then do resist checks against attacks and if it fails, you receive a 'Deathblow' and that hero dies permanently. This is unforgiving however you have the option to retreat from combat and the dungeon if it is not going your way, which you should be as doing.\n\nOverall:\nOne of the most unique games I've ever played and I only hope the developers look past the negative Steam reviews because this game is absolutely a diamond in the rough; a complete winner in my eyes.\n\nIt is being released in January 2016 I believe however I feel that the game is already complete and I have not once felt like it was an 'Early Access Game'","November 25, 2015","true","160.2"," 609 of 853 people (71%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","71","609","853","22","119"

From the start it looked very fun, interesting and most importantly...difficult. It wasn't a game like so many where it's tailored to just get you from start to end. Where you mess up any number of times and just get more chances. With Darkest Dungeon there is room for error, but it's a very small room; and most the time you have to take a loss of some sort.\n\nAnyways into the real details.\nPROS:\n- Game looks, feels and sounds amazing\n- Combat system is fun, alas very random.\n- Upgrade system is very well done, with 4 different types of upgrade mats\n- Stress system is great, you get broken down mentally and physically, which is what seemed so interesting\n- Random dungeon layouts proves for a fun new adventure every time you embark\n- The game is VERY fun!\n\nCONS:\n- As it's been said so many times before in other reviews, good and bad; the RNG is not only too random, it's BEYOND frustrating. I fell this is by far the biggest issue with the game at current development. I'm not sure if it's a tooltip issue, or programming issue, or what the underlying cause is; but the RNG is far too random. I've literally (meaning literally not OMG "literally") had a 85% hit chance skill miss 9 times in a row. Now with 15% miss chance, sure it's not impossible, but this happens often in sperts of "bad RNG". It wasn't just a single time. When you have "low light" from your torch you're supposed to have a higher crit % according to the tooltip, but I don't think I've ever crit while doing a "no light" run. All in all, if you get angry at games on any level whatsoever, this game will definitely ♥♥♥♥ you off from time to time...often enough.\n\n- The Sanitarium is a joke, not only is it ridiculously expensive, with having to reduce stress after almost every dungeon, you never have time to put your characters in there. ESPECIALLY since you get a new affliction (debuff) almost every single run as well. So what is really the point of it? The Sanitarium needs to reduce stress as well, not as much as the Abbey or Tavern (otherwise they would become worthless in place of the Sanitarium), but by a 50% rate or something.\n\n- The in-dungeon character dialogue. They like to talk a lot, and when they do it stops whatever you are doing. It becomes increasingly annoying when they say the same things over and over as well. So you're not just being stopped to hear something interesting, you're being stopped to read the same thing over and over. It becomes unbareable when they get full stress and break, because in the battle they say something non stop and you spend 50% of the time waiting for them to shutup.\n\n- There is no structured combat rotation, it seems characters can go whenever they want. It's never "your turn" and then "enemy turn". Also, sometimes in particular with "surprise" attacks the enemy can go multiple times in a row, before you can. So at that point you're so far behind in the dungeon with almost maxed stress and no HP it's a miracle of you get out with all 4 people alive, or finish it at all.\n\nIt's early access, so we'll see where they take the game, but right now it's still worth playing if you can deal with moments of being annoyed and hating your characters sometimes. Even with all the at length CONS, I still highly recommend the game.","February 8, 2015","true","117.8"," 117 of 144 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","117","144","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/recommended/262060/","Qualbert","Qualbert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/","671 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMost depressing game? Quite possibly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.\nAn incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.\nPlaying as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of "stress" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.\n\nEach character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.\nEach character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.\n\nActions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathies/recommended/262060/","mathies","@MathiesSC #yuritopia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathies/","65 products in account","EDIT: There has been some misunderstanding stemming from my opening lines. The key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes Darkest Dungeon unique and rewarding to play.\n\nDarkest Dungeon isn't just another RPG, and I don't blame anyone for approaching it like one. There are plenty of on-screen cues and tips that guide the player, but for players who have played since the beginnings of Early Access, it's easy to overlook them and not start from square one. Players who are completely new to Darkest Dungeon are likely to heed these in-game suggestions and warnings at face value, and may have a better experience as a result.\n\nI do not think the game is perfect, but it's pretty great and worth your time and money to experience.\n\n\nThere are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played, and I want to shed some light on why this game is actually AMAZING, and has CHANGED over time to become BETTER. There aren't going to be ANY story spoilers here, just basic mechanics--more or less just the hamlet's features and how they interact with the core gameplay.\n\nIt is a difficult game, and it is an RPG. When the going gets tough in a traditional RPG, there's usually a couple ways to deal with that: grinding monsters for money, gear, and experience, completing sidequests, and so on.\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon, you have a variety of resources at your disposal.\n\nYou have Heirlooms (used to upgrade your Hamlet facilities), you have Gold (required to use your Hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition), you have trinkets(a way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities), and you have the Heroes themselves--a renewable resource. Each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes: Resolve Level, Sanity, Quirks, Disease, Equipment, and Spells.\n\nHere's the part where people go wrong: they try to min-max, they try to save their heroes, they'll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out. This game restricts your resources far too hard for that, and makes your gains from doing so miniscule--you do make a profit, but its tiny and takes a long time. The profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost non-existent, and players see this as being the 'grindfest' as they slowly approach the endgame, often trying to circumvent this game's difficult mechanics (popular Steam guides are guilty of this!) by 'grinding it out,' using strategies such as suicide-gold runs (which are a time sink in and of themselves, adding to the grind illusion)...\n\nThose narrow margins of profit? The seemingly unending grind? Its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play, and those players aren't adjusting their gameplay.\n\nProgression through this game's intense difficulty isn't made by grinding out the perfect heroes, its by taking what you have and going for it. You're going to fail. You're going to lose heroes. You're going to hit brickwalls. But you're going to learn the absolute limits of every hero, the absolute limits of your style of play, and you'll push those limits. Your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly, taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down.\n\nBrute-forcing a grind through the game is technically possible. But you shouldn't do it.\nThis game wants you to face its depths head-on, and as soon as you do, it drags you further down and constricts you even more.\n\nWhen you finally get it though--when you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the game--there is very little more rewarding. It doesn't happen because you grind. It doesn't happen because you followed a strategy--it happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it.","February 8","true","79.6"," 210 of 283 people (74%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","74","210","283","19","218"

I thought at first that this was a cry for help regarding a puzzle in Portal 2 so I obligingly came over the the Darkest Estate to help.\n\nAlong the way I met a shady fellow with a musket and a SCAdian in a coach.  After being waylaid by the local hoodie wearers we arrived at what is known locally as "the hamlet".  It comprised a seedy old church, a run down sanitorium, and a tavern, as well as a woebegotten old "caretaker" who I am 90% sure is actually undead based on his distinctive "cologne".  Take care indeed, he likes to mooch around taking advantage of the facilities on your penny.  Heaven knows but he spends too much time in the brothel and the flagellation chambers.\n\nSo what can I say ?  Uncle had shot himself with a dueling pistol, the old bandit, and left me with a property that is impossible to insure or sell.  On the other hand there seem to be an endless supply of friendly imported labour eager to go and clean it out for me for the most spurious and ridiculous of reasons, and best of all, they bring back money, family antiques, and even paperwork to help me do up the hamlet.\n\nAdmittedly it is a bit hard on the folks I send up there.  They generally come home gibbering mad, if they come home at all, but lately as I have been upgarding the hamlet's facilities and sorting out proper training programs and toys for the poor louts they are doing a lot better.  The Sanitorium is immensely helpful at treating all of the stomach complaints they seem to get, (poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s come home spurting from both ends half the time), not to mention how often they come home with syphilis and/or rabies.  Yes !  I checked the Brothel (once I could get those Lezzie Vestals to pull out of for 5 minutes), they are definitely getting the syphilis from their expeditions and don't ask me where.  I am sure it all gets a bit "Deliverance" up there at times, what with all the squealing we hear.    We now have extensive facilities and have murdered the full litany of monster royalty in the ruins, weald and warrens.  I am looking forwards to seeing what is in the Cove and the Manor itself.  There are 23 new gravestones in the hamlet's "boot hill" and a roster of 20 more likely candidates, but lately they aren't dying nearly as much, which is probably a good thing.  In fact I think I can see the light at the end of the Darkest Dungeon.\n\nI hope to turn the place into a holiday resort and theme park.  Please do come and see for yourself.  You'll love it.

I'd recommend the hell out of this game, but recently, there was a huge update, and while I thought it was just a class addition, it was total chaos.  I had read a review suggesting that the game had became unplayable, and I can safely agree with this, I felt the need to write an actual review for this game because of it in the hope that it'll at least get someone to tell the devs that they ♥♥♥♥ed up.  It's a damn fine game, it really is, but the new update added protection to basic level enemies, yes I understand that they can't take full damage from EVERY blow you dish out, but basic enemies, with wooden shields, hooks, and metal cans on their heads shouldn't be able to stop 3/4's of the damage that is coming at them, it makes sense in cases like the Brigand Cannons or large enemies but not for regular opponents, it was made to a point that maggots are actually a team kill, having armor, debuffs, AND stuns, as well as above average speed.  Yes, you're making the game more difficult, but you're also making the ability to clear any of the dungeons a horrible thought, you'll only complete a dungeon on rare cases now, considering enemy crit seems so increased that where you'll score a total of three crits in one dungeon they'll score a grand total of 12.  Added protection, and adding the fact that the buffs that are actually good can now be replaced with things you don't even want, as well as having to pay gold up to fix a characters "disease" of being worried, all of this is new, unwanted, and really, really not needed.  This is turning into a factor where you'll lose to a hallway encounter before getting through a room, I've only done short dungeons with the new update and I tell you I cannot imagine one winning in the longer runs, given while you may never have your health dented, the balance of health loss and stress is overdone, you'll walk out of a fight, untouched, with minimal injuries, but everyone of them seem to leave an etching on your men's souls that makes them panic extremely easily, and overall succumb to heart attacks at an intense rate, there's no getting lucky with heart attacks, you panic, become weaker, and if you don't get away before they stress you further, you get a 100% chance to lose your man simply because they thought it was a good idea to make your fighters the biggest weaklings out there.  Overall, you deal less total damage as fighters, they made a lot of the good abilities completely not usable, they made stress your worst nightmare, they made the perks your fighters have nearly uncontrollable since you can only save so many from so many problems at once no matter the money, enemies with weak hides and pathetic armor are oddly stronger than they should be allowed to be, you'll find fighting larger monsters is easier than fighting the peons, and finally, CRITS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE IN YOUR FAVOR REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTER OR MOVE YOU USE, No, it doesn't seem like they bumped down your crit chance, but when it's compared to that of the enemies, it's generally 25% of their total crit chance as an estimation, I wouldn't buy this game unless you either pound the idea into the developers heads that they're making the game terrible, or they fix their mistakes on their own, but if the game goes on sale for half off and you have the money to spend I don't see why one wouldn't try it out to say in the least.","July 20, 2015","false","63.7"," 440 of 627 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","440","627","11","25"

You have a bunch of heroes going through random dungeons which tear them down both physically and mentally. The art is grim and dark, very much like Mike Mignola's work on Hellboy. The different classes are fun (Grave Robber, Jester, Leper, Crusader, etc.) are a nice change from your general wizard, rogue, knight (though they'll fill the same sort of roles). And the traits are pretty interesting. I don't remember all the names but I had one hero who loved dead bodies, another that talked to unheard voices in various lanugaged (including coding), and another who decided they didn't want to fight anymore and would pass every time it was their turn.\n\nThe game plays very well, especially being early access and I definitely think is worth youre money BUT not before some major balancing. And I'm really hoping the people at Red Hook make some changes because this game has so much potential for stealing hours of my life.\n\nSHORT VERSION:\n- game is poorly balanced\n- too much grinding\n- some unintuitive design choices\n\nIN DEPTH\n- The upgrade system is much like Rogue Legacy. You bring back money from your dungeon raids. However everything is far too expensive making a lot of your characters useless. More on that later\n- You have to bring items with you into the dungeon. Food and torches are a must. However for the minimum amount, you're looking at about 1500 gold per run. And if you run into some bad luck, you're gonna be screwed for awhile on your next trip.\n- stats system is never explained and is not very intuitive.\n- While there are a lot of classes, there really isn't that big a difference between them. They all have ranged and melee attacks. Some have buffs, some have debuffs, but they all feel rather similiar, which is a shame.\n- You can get new "heroes" after every dungeon. However by the end of their first dungeon, more than likely they will be riddled with either mental or physical ailments. Now this is part of the fun but to it costs about 1500 gold to heal someone of a single ailment or to bring their stress down. Early in the game you aren't going to have any money for that.\n- A couple of upgrades don't actually do anything. At least the stats say they don't. I also had a skill up reduce the damage my hero did, but bring the damage window (possibility of lowest and highest amount of damage) just 1 closer. So not really worth it because of the huge gap\n- There are ways to buff your heroes sanity, but your heroes will be losing sanity at such a constant rate, it's not worth it at all. We're talking you buff for 4 on a character (using that heroes turn) only to have an enemy land a hit and cause a hero to lose 28 sanity, and 14 to those around them. And that's one attack\n- You don't know the turn order of attacking. So less strategy\n- The heroes talk all the time, adding some flavor text, which is fun. HOWEVER, the game stops when they do. So you're walking, you have to stop and listen. You're fighting, you have to stop and listen. And they are REALLY chatty. It ends up getting pretty frustrating because it breaks up the flow way too much, especially with all the grinding you'll be doing.\n- When trying to pick heroes from the wagon, their speech bubbles will block the hero above them, making it impossible to pick the hero you wanted for a short while\n- Various dungeons you can enter open and close for no forseeable reason. Want to play the randomly generated version of the first dungeon? Maybe you can, maybe you can't.\n- The game is too much about grinding. It sells itself as being really hard. And it is but for all the wrong reasons. The Dark Souls games are hard but because they're very well designed to slow down the player and play cautiously, using your head. Darkest Dungeon right now is hard because all the numbers are off. Stuff is too expensive, damage is too varied, and stats might as well be in brale. (I had a hero who I think had an 80% accuracy but would hit maybe 30% of the time, with no debuffs). The game quickly feels like you're grinding through the dungeons (often without much success) to give yourself a better shot later off with very little payoff.\n\nAgain, I think the game at its core is great. But there needs to be some major balancing and a few design fixes to get it back on the right track of being an awesome game of seeing a group of heroes unravel and try to recover from the horrors they've seen in the dark below.\n\nI look forward to seeing this game grow.","February 3, 2015","false","5.0"," 695 of 1,023 people (68%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","68","695","1","19","21"

However, it is not for everyone.\n\nIf you are looking at the title then I'll make a few assumptions. You like: dungeon crawlers, leveling up classes, loots...; which you will certainly find here.\n\nA few reasons I've spent nearly 300 hours on this game and not others should be what draws you in or dissuades you from purchasing.\n\n-Difficulty: listed 1st for a reason that some gamers don't enjoy a game that constantly and regularly challenges you and would appreciate a more liesure gaming experience. Understandable, but that is not this title. My experience in tough games and many hours in this one and I still have points, sometimes often, that I need to retreat.\n\n-Style: heavy-inky style gives it a dark world that perfectly fits the narrative and story. It should be said the Story is not something that explains itself very clearly. That being said, the finer details in Journals that you will find as well as the only voice in the game are done flawlessly. I could listen to this guy read a phone book and be enthralled.\n\n-Replayability: some may find the scope of the game rather small and they wouldn't be necessarly wrong. It isn't the completion of the game that was/is my goal. I actually was reluctant to finish it because I was worried I would lose interest. They do offer a NG+ (new game plus) mode after completion which adds a couple challenging hurdles for revisiting the Estate. But, the completion isn't the goal.

The different classes and abilities mean you can play two runs in a row with totally different battle play styles. The narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton.\n\nThe concept works really well. Rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits "money run" or "artifact run" into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression.\n\nThe balance is (IMO) really good. You are low on things and people for a long time, by design. Your dungeon crawlers die a lot, by design. But it's all in service of the theme, and as you rebuild and get better everything else gets better too.\n\nAlso, importantly, they have added a lot of options to change the gameplay to make it easier by toning down or eliminating various types of difficulty. I find the default difficulty fantastic but I'm also a big believer in letting people choose to turn off things they dislike.\n\nI paid $20 for this the first week it was on Steam, and played it for over 100 hours while it was still in Early Access.

With only the "Positive" and "Negative" options to work with, it makes it really difficult to accurately rate games that fall inbetween the two. Darkest Dungeon, to me, is one of those games. Also the review character limit makes it difficult to cover all aspects of a game at times. If a "Neutral" option were available, I'd flag this game with it. Darkest Dungeon has a lot going for it, but it also had a lot of things that are holding it back.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nDarkest Dungeon is essentially a sidescrolling, turn-based RPG that takes place on/underneath your ancestor's estate. The estate serves as the game's hub, where you can hire new party members, buy or upgrade gear, buy supplies, relieve stress, or even pay your respects to the fallen heroes by visiting the graveyard. You can only have up to 4 characters in your adventuring party at any one time, but you can have up to 20 characters on standby back at the estate. There are 13 different classes currently available, with 2 still waiting to be implemented. Each class has their own unique skills and abilities.\n\nWhen in the dungeon you have to manage a few 'resources', the most important one is stress. This is by far one of the most aggravating mechanics when mixed with the game's other features. To reduce stress, you can either camp in the middle of a dungeon or leave your characters at the Tavern in the estate. Leaving them at the tavern costs a pretty penny, and makes your parties extremely unbalanced. Some skills can lower stress mid-battle, while some camping skills lowers stress as well. When stress gets too high, some characters may refuse to quest with you, and should you attain high stress mid-dungeon, that characters risks a Heart Attack...which can kill the character. When HP reaches zero, characters enter a state called "At Death's Door". When this is reached, they don't die yet, but any attack afterwards has a chance to kill them. Death is permanent, but you can replace dead characters with more new hires. This, however, means you'll spend some time getting the new characters back up to snuff, which means more time grinding and more gold spent. Speaking of gold, let's say you complete a quest and earn...4,500 gold. Ok, that's a respectable haul, but most of it will go towards stress relief, food, and supplies, leaving you with a trifling amount leftover. Almost all of your gold is spent maintaining your characters so that they do not die.\n\nAnother thing you need to manage, which isn't anywhere near as bad as stress, is light. Bringing torches will help keep light levels high, which offer bonuses to your party such as the aility to scout ahead and see what each corridor has in store for you. Low light levels mean stronger enemies, but greater rewards. Use your best judgment to determine if the risk is worth the rewards or not.\n\nThe large majority of the game will be spent in combat. Any skills you have unlocked will be useable here, with combat playing out in turns. As you take damage, your stress levels will go up. Instead of leveling up, your character's Resolve will increase. Battles and random events in the dungeons will test your Resolve frequently, earning you perks or afflictions. Perhaps the most annoying part of combat are corpses. When an enemy dies, they leave behind a corpse; these serve no purpose other than holding an enemy formation together. This can make targetting enemies in the rear difficult until you get rid of the corpses. This is completely unnecessary, and only make battles even more drawn out than they already are.\n\nAlot of players complain about is how unfair the RNG seems to be. There will be battles where you will miss 4 turns of attacks, while your enemies will crit every turn. It seems like the game itself is against you, but I honestly think it's just RNG being RNG.\n\nThe dungeon crawling itself is quite bland. On the bottom right of your screen you will see the dungeon map. To travel to a room, click it and then hold the cursor and mouse button down ahead of your party in the direction you want them to go. You will find all manner of things as you explore, including enemies, traps, treasure chests, curios, relics, or any number of other random encounters. Sometimes you will find unused torches which can be picked up and added to your stock, other times you may find relics that can offers bonuses to your party once cleansed.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe game has an intense gothic, Lovecraftian look/feel to it, and is by far the best thing abotu Darkest Dungeon. Character designs are unqiue and thought out. Combat animations are simple, but effective. When actions are taken the affected characters are brought front and center on the screen, so you can focus on what's going on. Characters stand idle and have a small amount of animation to show then breathing while idle. This is a nice little touch that more games need to bring a sense of realism. As characters and enemies are damaged, small blood splatters are shown in corners of your screen.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is another good thing. It's very dark and gothic; fitting for the setting of the game. The estate has a somber tune, and the dungeons have a dark, ambient tune that makes you feel like you are definitely deep inside a dark dungeon with little hope of escape. Battle music is fast and blood-pumping; coupled with the battle sound effects and stress mechanics, this can turn most battles into quite intense encounters. I also *really* liked the narrator in the dungeons.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe game runs beautifully with little to no issues whatsoever, at least for me it did.The one complaint I have is that sometimes loading a dungeon can take AGES. Sometimes it loads right away! Not sure what causes this, but it happened to me a couple of times.\n\nAside from that, it ran at a steady framerate and I didn't have any odd crashes or bugs. The game is played mostly with the mouse. I can't see how this game could be played comfortably with a controller, so I stuck with the mouse. It worked very well.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDespite the downsides, I found myself enjoying the game quite a bit, and that is why I gave it a thumbs up rating. It's a really engaging dungeon crawler, although it can sometimes be really unfair and requires quite a large amount of grinding to be able to afford the upgrades you need. Still, it's quite challenging and I can safely recommend this game to people who like grinding and have that feeling of fulfillment when they reach goals. If you can look past the flaws the game has, you will find a somewhat enjoyable game within the Darkest Dungeon, although with a little more work and a few updates, it could be a great game.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/mPfXVxKn7eQ\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nSomewhat Recommended\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review.

It is currently in Early Access and is being developed by Red Hook Studios.\n\nIn this game you are the heir to a manor that has been abandoned by your family due to a gateway being opened, allowing monsters and evil to be released and corrupt the land. You are tasked with ridding the lands of these mosnters and this evil, as well as to restore the lost glory and riches of your family. At your disposal are countless up and coming adventurers, enticed by the promise of fame and riches. Their mettle and their wills are tested in each dungeon. They will be stressed, they will be driven mad, they will ultimately die in this quest.\n\nPros:\n+This game is beautifully narrated, and adds to the dark, gothic overtones of the game.\n+The artwork has a dark, hand drawn feel to it, which also adds to the gothic overtones of the game.\n+The storyline, though not the most original in the scheme of things, is very nice and the concept of it works well.\n+The stress mechanic your heroes face as they are used, abused, injured, and driven mad from the dark is very original.\n+When your heroes die, they die permanently. There's even a little graveyard for them.\n+Great music which is very atmospheric and adds to that dark feel of the game.\n+Your heroes have a great selection of classes which have their own unique abilities.\n+There are a decent variety of monsters and bandit enemies to fight\n+The game is difficult, but not overwhelming to the point you want to put your fist through your computer monitor.\n\nCons\n-The game can get grindy and repetitive after a couple of dungeon areas.\n-There can be a lot of micromanaging and planning  for the dungeons, which normally would be a good thing, but this game takes it to another level.\n-Randomness of the fight encounters can and will be unfair at times.\n-There is a learning curve and the difficulty of the game can be a disadvantage towards casual players.\n-The game itself has been in early access for a while and at this point is unfinished\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOverall I've really enjoyed playing this game. The dark overtones of the game greatly add to my immersion, and has been unlike any other roguelike game that I've played. The difficulty level of this game requires me to think, plan ahead, and treat each battle in a different way. I normally do not care for Rogue Like style games, as most just don't have enough to keep me immersed. I am disappointed that this game is still in Early Access development, but I'm hoping that it's due to the developers wanting to balance some things within the game. I paid the full price for this game, and have not been disappointed. Would I recommend this game?  Wholeheartedly. It is a very fun, unique, and challenging game. It is worth the full price. I would not, however, recommend this to people who don't enjoy challenging roguelike games. I rate this a 8/10.\n","April 25, 2015","true","6.7"," 73 of 90 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","73","90","0","4"

If you are looking to buy this game then you are probably like me, a fan of difficult games (Dark Souls comes to mind). Let me go ahead and give you the warning that I feel I didn't get from looking at reviews...this game is not difficult in a way that is remotely satsifying.\n\nWhen I play a difficult game I want to feel something after a tough battle. I want to feel like I really earned my sword, my armor, my loot, my gold. I want to feel like all the progress I've made is deserved, because I learned from my mistakes and overcame my ignorance of the world's mechanics. At some point I want to feel successful, and look down upon this horrific world that I've made my way in and say, "Heck yeah this place is scary, but I have at last become one of those scary things in it."\n\nDarkest Dungeon is not that game. (Spoilers)\n\n1a) Stress Damage (Too High): Stress damage sounds cool right? Very Lovecraftian. But the problem here is that you are already walking such a razor thin margin of success that all you need is for your main damage dealer to go insane to wipe the party. Each character has about 100pts of stress they can take before giving in to madness...which really isn't much when enemies do anywhere from 15-20pts of stress damage per attack.\n\n1b) Immersion Breaking: There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of logic to what causes stress or how much you take. Seeing a reanimated corpse shambling towards me would stress me out more than getting splashed with a cup full of blood...especially if I am a Crusader, Leper, or Highwayman who is...probably used to being splashed with blood.\n\n2a) Trinkets: I want to say that the items you use to "boost" your characters stats are worthless. That isn't true; it's just that they are nearly worthless. Yes you can find the rares, and you can get the ancients but the drawbacks are so significant that I almost never wanted to equip them. A bracer that gives +25 damage? Yes please! But it also gives +20% stress damage...when I'm already taking 20 stress a hit?\n\n2b) After playing Darkest Dungeon for 30hrs I have yet to find a single piece of loot that made me happy. Not a single one and for the life of me I can't understand why the developers went with such a harsh Catch-22 for all these items. If I don't care about finding gear to boost up my characters then why am I even delving into these dungeons?\n\n3a) The story. 30hrs in and I am tired of hearing the narrator as he constantly sputter 12-letter words ripped directly from the pages of your favorite Lovecraftian horror story. Excusing that, my problem with the story is that the narrator explains everything in the intro scene. Quite literally. As you delve through the dungeon and find notebook pages you slowly come to the realization that they do not reveal anything new.\n\n3b) Immersion Breaking: I start to ask myself...what in the world am I doing down here? Maggots can apparently appear from thin air so it's not like I'm going to live in this hellhole after I clear all the monsters and bandits out. My ancestor is hecka dead so...I'm not here to save anyone. ...Why am I sending all these people to die again? I mean...It's not for money. Only people making money in this game are my vassals (tavern owner, abbey, guild, blacksmith) who, setting aside the fact that they are charging me straight out the nose for things, apparently require I give them dozens of family portraits and land deeds in order to fulfill the orders that I just paid (and continue to pay) them for.\n\n4a) The Bosses: Back to Dark Souls 2 for a second. One of the most frustrating fights for me was the gargoyles in the belltower. More than almost any other fight it felt unfair, as you get swamped from every direction, skewered, and suffer multiple deaths. But eventually you get it. You learn the pattern, match it to your fighting style, and succeed.\nThere is none of that here. What seemed interesting and innovative to me in Darkest Dungeon was the number of classes and the combination of parties you could make. But gradually you realize that some of the classes are truly worthless (Antiquarian comes to mind) and even worse, that the game requires that you bring certain classes to certain dungeons. It curtails the way that you play and I am not at all a fan of paying money for a game only to have it pretty much micromanage my fun.\n\n4b) Immersion Breaking: The Wizened Hag. After fighting six different room battles I finally come upon the hag only to discover...she sits in the back row behind an unbreakable cooking pot and cannot be moved. Literally...cannot be moved. So why in the world would you give me so many characters and abilites that change the enemies battle positions?  Why give me a power and then say, "No, not here where it might be used best." After the Wizened Hag fight (which I narrowly won thanks to a Crusader with Spear of Light) I looked up tactics for every single boss on the wiki, something I would normally be ashamed to do on my first playthrough of any game. Why? Because I'm not about to lose 4 to 5 hours of gameplay and grinding because Darkest Dungeon in unfair. Not difficult, but actually just unfair.\n\n5a) Darkest Dungeon is simply unfair. Not in a sense of "It's okay, I can still get through this limping through the dungeon" kind of unfair, but in a "Hey, your characters are going to die today, and that's all there is to it." Kind of unfair. I have had a geared up team stunlocked to death by spiders in a hallway. I sat for four turns (all the spiders go, all my team recovers from stun = 1 turn) while the spiders stunned, marked, and killed my team. I have had enemies focus down my team one by one, from the healer in postion 4 to the tank in postion 1. Not with damage, but with stress, so that my characters pass instead of taking their turns and get picked apart. I have walked into a hallway and gotten surprised at 90 light, then walked into a room and gotten surprised at 80 light, and then gotten surprised leaving that room into another hallway at 76 light. I have watched as characters on my team repeatedly miss hitting the enemy 3 times in a row despite having no debuffs at all, and then watched as enemies debuffed to detract from accuracy, speed, and damage, proceed to get a critical hit, every hit, that takes my characters to deaths door and then the grave.\n\n6a) These situations are common, which brings me to my last point. The game is unfair, so there isn't a real reason to get attached to your characters. So... If you aren't here to take your home back, and you aren't here to save your ancestor, and you aren't here to become fabulously wealthy, and you aren't here to lead a team of chosen warriors through hell and back...what is the point of playing Darkest Dungeon?\n\nI ask this knowing that there isn't one.\n\n\n*****EDIT 5/21/2016\nAt this point in time only 0.9% of people who have purchased Darkest Dungeon have beaten the game on normal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messernesser/recommended/262060/","messernesser","Centimeterworm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messernesser/","111 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me preface this by saying how much I dislike turn-based combat.  In all my years of gaming, games like Final Fantasy and, well, any JRPG really, rubbed me up several wrong ways when I came back to the realization that my party and the enemy were taking it in turns to stand in a forest clearing and kick each other in the shins until the guy who didn't bring enough healing potions fell over.  The only game with turn-based mechanics that I ever liked, even loved, was XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which felt like playing a massive, high-stakes board game where tactical positioning and cover was of the utmost importance, and the turns progressed in a way that made sense.\n\nWell, after several years of being in a Pathfinder group, and about a decade of being in love with gothic horror in general, Darkest Dungeon did for me what XCOM did.  It did the impossible.  It got me to like turn-based combat all over again.\n\nThat said, calling D.D. a "turn-based" game is doing the fantastically well-implemented RNG elements a disservice.  RNG is infamously difficult to get right, especially in rougelike titles where they basically hold up the entirety of the experience, but D.D. has found that precarious balance between unrelenting and fair, where challenges feel surrmountable and all of the numbers mean very important things that become gradually evident over time.  There's this problematic occurance in a lot of RNG games I've played where the slightest mishap in balancing the numbers is the single, tenuous line between monstrously unfair and insultingly easy.  D.D., to its credit and my endless amazement, has found the balance upon the edge of the knife.\n\nAnd, holy crap you guys, this game is still in Early Access.  Oh my good lord, but I cannot WAIT to see how these guys polish their formula, because it's already a mirror finish.\n\nIn general, there's a whole bunch to love about D.D., but I'll rattle off a few things that I find immensely pleasurable:\n\n--The "crowquill" art style and gothic, Lovecraftian influences are drop-dead gorgeous.  Props to their art designer (and also to Mike Mingola, who kind of started the whole thing) for making some of the creepiest, grimiest, flat-out prettiest aesthetic choices I've seen since Dark Souls (the first one, that is).\n\n--The varied player classes and character builds makes for some damn fun experimentation and augmentation as you build up resources and plan your parties' ventures.  I love how almost every class is viable in almost any position with the right build and gear.  I've already had great fun trying out new kinds of parties, mostly failing, and learning a lot from those failures.  There's some deep, rich mechanics under this game's surface, and I, for one, am eager to puzzle them out.\n\n--The tactical positioning mechanics.  Holy crap, this might have basically sold the entire thing to me.  As I mentioned previously, turn-based games aren't my thing.  Turn-based tactics, on the other hand, now there's an entirely different bugbear.  The way you suss out how different squaddies fit together, the best party orders, the best adventuring combo teams, and then watching in abject terror as your team gets suprised and jumbled and your entire oder is screwed up and you have to scramble, sweating and swearing, to reassemble your precious roster row before that dreaded, incoming TPW.  Glorious.  Simply glorious.\n\n--The weight of the player's decisions.  Everything matters in this game.  Every little decision the player makes can have massive consequences in the short AND the long.  I seriously have not played anything so maschostically challenging, nor as powerfully rewarding, since Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.\n\nThat's about it.  There's so much greatness in this game, and so much I could talk about.  It is in early access though, so I think a brief list of more things I'd like to see is in order:\n\n1. Random events in dungeons: coming across a lost family searching for a way out, or perhaps an ancient tome of eldritch power that the party can't decide what to do with, or maybe recuing a hapless villager from the clutches of the swine hoards.  Those are pretty simple examples off the top of my head, but this game is absolutely RIPE for the odd proc gen, or maybe even scripted events that can only occur once per playthrough, that comes along to mix up the formula.  Some great opportunities for challenging mechanics-driven decision-making here, guys.  Love to see it implemented.\n\n2. More character classes: yeah, there's already a lot, and I know some more have been planned, but holy crap guys, I cannot believe how many concepts for classes didn't make it in to a game like this.  The Huntress, the Archaeologist (Indiana Jones, anybody?), the Librarian, the Investigator (I'm thinking Shadow Over Innsmouth), the Sheriff (or maybe Marshall?), the Muskateer, the Assassin, and that's just right off the top of my head.  Seriously, to see more awesome adventuring dudes and dudettes to send to their untimely demises would make me just the happiest.\n\n3. More insight into the world and the story of the Ancestor: seriously, the bridging narrative (what there is of it) in this game is turning out to be some sick, twisted, wonderfully macabre worldbuilding.  I want so much more.  I seriously can't get enough.  If there's a way to implement it (as perhaps in a way similar to number 1 up above), more story missions would be the absolute tops.  It's already great, you guys.  I just want more.\n\nSo, yeah.  Early Access.  Already an absolute gem.  Only going to get better.  GIVE THESE GUYS YOUR MONEY.  THEY EARNED IT.  Want to see more of it.  Probably will.  Eagerly await new content and alterations.\n\nPeace.","February 24, 2015","true","103.0"," 72 of 90 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","72","90","2","0"

The combat is awesome and diverse, the dark atmosphere is perfect, the random nature of the game makes the dungeon runs very fun every single time - overall, this is a great game, let down by two major factors:\n\n1) The Catch-22 equipment upgrades, caused by the fact that your characters level far faster than you generate the necessary money for their upgrades.\n\nso, let's say you've leveled four of your characters from level four to level five. There's a game mechanic where high level characters will refuse to go to low level dungeons (which are beneath their dignity).\n\nSo, the four champions can only do level 5 dungeons.\nBut you can't beat a level 5 dungeon without the equipment upgrades.\nBut equipment upgrades costs money.\nBut to get the money you need to beat the level 5 dungeon.\nBut the champions cannot beat it!\n\nSo to solve it, you get a B-team doing the dungeons as well, but then you need to spend money on the B-team! The only solution is to recruit new characters (recruiting level 0 characters is free) and duing suicide runs with them, which is extremely grindy and boring.\n\nBut this is nothing compared to...\n\n2) The Endgame\n\nBasically, once your team of four best characters of the highest level, the finest characters, goes into the first level of the final dungeon and beats it...\nThey can never go there again!\nSo you level four more best characters for level two of the dungeon.\nAnd they also can't go there again!\nSo you do it again for level three, and level four.\n\nAssuming no one dies (which is impossible), this is 16 CHARACTERS you need to level up to level 6!\n\nThis is the worst game restriction I've ever seen, I don't even know what to compare it with - it's like in Skyrim you would have to start a new character from scratch for every single boss fight.\nAnd for people saying "this is hardcore" - no, this is not hardcore, stupid restrictions to artifically prolong the game's life by making you do a ton of unnesessary work and grindfest are not hardcore!\n\nWith these two factors, I cannot recommend the game in its current state.","February 2","false","26.3"," 610 of 937 people (65%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","65","610","937","41","98"

While travelling through dungeons you not only fight the monsters that lurk there but also stress which can be even more deadly at times.\n\n+Really nice hand-drawn art style which suits the game well and looks great\n+Ten different hero classes each with their own abilities and combat roles\n+Party order effects what abilities your heroes can use and adds another level of depth to the combat system\n+You can upgrade your heroes' equipment back at your estate\n+Lots of loot to find in the dungeons\n+Many different enemy types including a number of boss-level enemies\n+Bosses provide a good challenge without feeling overpowered or unbalanced\n+A few different locations including 'The Darkest Dungeon'\n+The different parts of your estate can be upgraded to provide more benefits to you\n+Permadeath really is permanent due to the game frequently saving so every choice has consequences that cannot be undone\n+Dungeons are procedurally generated so you'll never see the same layout twice\n+Outstandingly good narrator\n\n+/-The combat system is completely reliant on RNG including in what order your heroes and your enemies get their turn. For the most part the combat system is fun (so long as you like RNG) but having no idea when your heroes or enemies will have a turn is incredibly irritating and often leads to the enemy team having numerous attacks before you get your first. Due to the RNG system it is also possible for you entire team to be wiped out before they even have a turn.\n\n+/-The stress system, like the combat system is a bit hit and miss as well. Stress increases very quickly when you are playing which is understandable against powerful enemies but when your heroes get stressed after a low-level enemy attacks it can be frustrating. Stress also brings out the best, but usually worst, out of your heroes, when their stress level reaches 100/100 they will either develop a positive trait (increasing their combat effectiveness and boosting your team's morale) or a negative trait. It's the negative traits I have a problem with, when a hero develops a negative trait you lose almost all control over them (for the most part they will either refuse to take their turn or you will have no control over which ability they use on which enemy which can be rather frustrating), as well as this most characters with a negative trait (such as paranoia) will refuse medical help from your other characters even when they are on death's door which can quite easily lead to them dying.\n\n-While on a mission you can only heal your characters in combat or by setting up a campfire (only available on certain missions and has a limited number of uses)\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nDespite a couple of flaws this is great dungeon crawling game so long as you know what you're getting in to. If you're unsure what RNG is or haven't played a game involving it before then I suggest you watch a number of gameplay videos before playing the game.\n\n*** I used a stemkey provided by the developer for review purpose ***\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Just SOME things this 100-hour player (including 20 Level 5 heroes with level 5 everything - each class at one point or another, at least twice over) has to say:\n\n- The dev's, like many before, do not understand that RNG cannot be let loose on it’s own - it needs to be there for some games, but it should never be left to it's own devises.  You need to make sure that nothing can Crit over and over and over and over, nor can you have misses happen over and over and over (90% chance to hit misses more than 50% in other games, IOW).  Dear RedHook, learn the same thing that GGG did with their evasion mechanic:  allowing pure rng made the mechanic broken.  They learned that they needed to enact a system where too many missed or too many hits could not happen - you can read about it on the Path of Exile wiki.  PLEASE NOTE:  I AM NOT HAVING AN ISSUE WITH RNG ITSELF, OR HOW MUCH IS LEFT TO RNG - I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY DEV WHO JUST ALLOWS THE RNG TO PURELY DO ALL THE WORK.  CONSTRAIN IT!!!  EX - Any programmer will tell you that if you write code to randomly spit back 0 or 1, and you just use RAND() (or whatever the function/method/class in your favorite language calls it) - you can run it hundreds or thousands of times and check the results, only to see, 1 come out sometimes 20 times in a row.  So your programmed a 50/50 chance, yet what happens?  You get one of the two values repeatedly.  You could have the same thing happen if you randomly generate 0-9 or whatever you want.  My point is, few find unbridled rng to be fun, and I imagine they might like some sales from hardcore lovers who like their hardcore fair, not full of lazy AI and mechanics.\n\n- AI needs work!  If the rng wasn't there to give it a kick, and they didn’t hide turn order (with a laughable excuse for why they, RedHook, won’t), it would be a total joke.  The only thing "smart" I have seen it do is target a specific player (randomly, it seems) and have most or all the mobs fight him.  Not a bad tactic, I guess, but it feels cheap, and then the AI changes target just when they were close to killing the first.  I have also seen the AI "pull" a teammate to the front (there are pull and push abilities), only to push them back the very next round (the AI has no memory of actions, except, I guess, to pick one target and stick to it, until RNG says to move elsewhere.  Lot's more crap like this to experience...  I have zero faith this will be fixed because most gamers are too stupid to notice bad AI, and even if they did, it's that last consideration (possibly below bug fixing, if that is even possible).\n\n- The economy is in need of adjustment.  Not really much to say there, I believe the dev thinks so too, just not sure when it will happen (unless you find a "broken" party setup that clears content easily) as far too often you feel stalled in progress due to there being lots of ways to spend money but no many ways to earn a nice amount, until late game... which reminds me...\n\n- Early game is unforgiving, mid game is brain dead easy, and then end game is ridiculous in how it swings between the two, but when it gets unforgiving (in the bad way), you will litterally want to uninstall the game and swear the devs off.\n\n- Trinkets continue to drop that are broken - that is - they provide bonuses for a class that cannot help them (increased chance to blight and bleed for a class that does not have any poison or bleed skills, e.g.).  They say they are aware and will fix it, but update after update, this is still broken.\n\n- WAY TOO REPETITIVE (this coming from some that loves randomized-content games).  No matter how many times you run a dungeon, level it up, kill one of the three levels of the boss for that dungeon (same boss, exactly, each time - YAWN!), it’s the same tile sets, and the randomization is rather lackluster in terms of how the rooms and connecting hallways are laid out.  Having the last two dungeons added will alleviate this a tiny amount, but it's just going to end up repetitive again.  Why can't dungeons get altering tile sets and layouts as they level up, or at least for the boss runs?  Why, if this game is supposed to be random in its layout, have I seen the same layout NUMEROUS times?  This is a game that is begging to be paid for hundreds of hours, but I guess the devs don't have the same vision (which is odd, games that give you so much value end up selling post-release content at a way higher rate, and the sequel does better too).\n\n- Stess system is broken. Getting crits give, on average, way more stress than giving them takes away. The walking around stess is also a poor decision. Level 4 heroes with Level 5 skills, armor and weapons should not get random stress from walking around in a Level 3 quest in a level 3 dungeon. Stress received and taken away needs some consistencey. +10 to you +5 to party/close-by friends if received, -10 for your and -5 for party/close-by charecters if you give one. Or have the scaling, since it also seems based on how hard you crit, also be as consistent. While I understand that a character that has hit 100 stress might say thing that bother the others, most of what leaves the mouth of these toons isn't stressful for anyone already in a very stressfull situation (fighting to the death).\n\n- Hunger system is purely RNG'd and tiles are secretly labeld "hunger" - instead of travling distance and fighting rounds making this something consistant, you can sometimes never get ungry, or get it twicein the same hallway, even right after a fire rest. How does a party who just had a fire and had a feast become hungry two hallway tiles away?\n\n- This game can be a performance hog on some system - which is crazy since this game is no way taxing of GPU or CPU based on the graphics.  (the art is good, I just don’t see how this 2d game can made some systems crawl)  My monster gaming rig has zero issues, beyond weird bugs and random hangs, but my tablet with a beefy enough cpu/cpu to plat CiV, has major issues with this game.\n\n\nAll in all, there is a great game to come of this prerelease version, I just hope the right changes are made -  at least they are allowing mods so hopefully we can change the things they don't.","March 4, 2015","false","100.4"," 237 of 359 people (66%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","66","237","359","17","27"

But if I had to sum up this game in just one word, that word would be "Stagnation." I had been following this game rather closely for some time and loved everything I saw, the game seemed PERFECT in my eyes, at least until recent updates to the game brought some "rebalancing." The latest updates saw rather drastic increases in the cost of... well... pretty much everything, heros cost more to train, town upgrades require more resources, and stress healing will bleed you dry. This, on its own, wouldnt have been too bad, had they not also considerably decreased the gold you'll get for going on expeditions. Many times ive completed a quest, only to spend most the gold i just recieved to lower my troop's stress levels from said quest, before saving what precious little is left to fund the next mission. Repeat this proccess about 5-6 times and congratulations, you now have enough to upgrade one of your heros' equipment or skills, and maybe a town building or two..... once. But if you're dedicated enough you can do this for long enough to have a fully equipped level 2 team, now you're ready to progress!\n\n\nOh, you got surprised by a horde of spiders who shuffled the order of your party and killed your healer and highwayman before you could do anything about it? Well, have fun starting over, see you in another 35 missions and we'll do this again.\n\n\n\nSo the point is this: Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl that you'll actually forget why you're even playing, if you're unsure on whether to pick this one up, I'd hold off for now, wait for a few more updates and then check again.","October 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 260 of 397 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","260","397","11","15"

My review is after the december patch from 2015.  This game is not worth playing now.\n\nIt really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now. Not because it is hard or unfair sometimes (now many more times after the last update). I actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time. So you can see im not one of "i lost 50 characters, this game is bad". The problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies, not to mention that there is little reward.\n\n\nI cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new  heroes, get lucky with some quirks, lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff. When in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk, i stopped caring for them. Why would i care for a vestal with higher hp, dodge and speed if she can  lose it all in a single turn? Why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them? What is the point of making a character unique? There is none, period. The devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks (note, they didnt get any single new attack. Their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now.) while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics.\n\n"Oh, there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher". Well, that's exactly when they start murdering the freedom. I dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like. What is the point of getting new trinkets, try nem combinations of trinkets? None. That's that. I dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could. FYI, i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run. That is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game. And the character is very fragile. No high hp, no way to buff his survival. Nothing. GHuess what, engage in a combat, 2 round later, his dodge was greatly decreased. And that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party, you can imagine how "open" the other 3 were. Im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well.\n\nIt sound terrible, right? But, hey, cant you buff your characters? Yes, you can. But here is the thing, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BUFF SKILL YOU CANT MATCH THE ENEMY'S DEBUFF. Simply as that. I think the aoe debuff i suffered is -10 for stack. and that for low level characters (you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons).\nThe highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9. Exactly, 9, from a high level character. And a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values. Nevertheless, even if the debuffs werent so severe, i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff. Simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you. And in this rng based rpg(dont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent. Even with top characters and trinkets, you could face some really bad situations) that can be very, very dangerous.\n\nBut, hey, that is not over yet. Ohh, you may start thinking "What, this is worse than it already is?"... And the answer is: yes. Here's the thing, now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat. That includes buffing and healing your party. Exactly, it includes it. And it can be even worse than that. I was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy, used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived. Oh, i was penalized because the guy survived. No, he didnt attack me or something. I got a stress attack (stress are almost a second health bar in this game. If you let it go too high... You might face serious, serious problems. In some extreme cases, your character dies). I gave up at that point. I was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right. What is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else you're wasting turns? I dont feel like it anymore, dont want to try new strategies, specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to "waste time" taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die.\n\nI have to write more about the trinkets as well, for newcomers, since they are one of the main rewards of the quests. A great number of them, include the most rare ones, "ancestral trinkets", are useless or unworthy. Really, the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other "not so rare" trinkets. The same rule aplies to the "Very rare" trinkets, which is one tier below. This happens because all of them have some drawbacks (- speed, -dodge) that make them less worth to use. And with the new patch, more of them became even more useless, which ends with the game being less rewarding. And, with all the bs the devs put now, there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket.\n\nThe another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless. You use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments (you can only get new armor and weapon this way). And you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group. Now, the devs got a brilliant idea: let's make the itens you buy limited. Yay. It's not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100% prepared for everything and you want the rewards... Well, you can use gold to buy trinkets as well, but the majority of them are useless. So... No reason anymore to have tons of gold. And even less reason to play this game.\n\n\nWell, that is why i gave up with this patch. Not willing to try finding better trinkets, that are so few. The majority of them you may not use EVER. And that list may have just got bigger since now you'll have to focus on debuff res. Dont feel like trying to make builds for some places. Hero that gets more attacks, hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time  i waste creating one completly unrewarded. And the freedom i had to try new party compositions, new strategies, finding sinergy with skills is vanished, since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me. cant go with a party that is "slow but safe". Have to go with higher risk. But, like i said many times, no reward for me.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, i really did. even in times i felt it was unfair, i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them. Now, since the best the devs have done to "rise the challenge" is simply make it even more luck based than ever, i gave up. They crossed the line of hard but rewarding  to luck and unrewarding. And i cant feel any longer the will to play it, praying that my group gets luck, that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight. That isnt skill reliable. Whoever think it is is completly mistaken. Gonna miss the art, music, dialogue and lore from this game. But, unless the devs do something about this, i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube. Far more enjoyable for me and less stressful","December 1, 2015","false","69.3"," 661 of 1,050 people (63%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","63","661","1","31","75"

Well you found a home here. With every step and corner you turn, death waits for your party and looms over them like a cloud of sickness.\n\n-Graphics: This game is 2D, but it's 2D done right, the art style is amazing and you feel the weight behind every swing of the sword and throwing of a bomb to take out your foes. The enemies come to life and spew their disease upon you, stab you deep and make your blood paint the ground, and stun you with their screeches of terror. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this. 9/10\n\n-Sound: Narration and effects help paint a wonderful picture as you dive into each hole and hope to come out on the other side victorious. The slashes, splashes, clinging and banging of swords against armor and skin are very nice and doesn't feel like some cheap call in for effects. The music for your journey is sometimes overdramatic but it's not supposed to be a joyful trip. Overall, very nice and whenever you hear that tune chime in at the end of a hard fought battle, it's extremely worth it. 8.8/10\n\n-Gameplay: The very meat and potatoes of every game and I'm glad to say this shines and keeps me coming back for more. With every journey you take, you will bring back a number of materials and gold to help soothe your warriors, strengthen your stronghold, and tune your party up to face what dangers lie with the next trip. The game centers around this hub and you go forth selecting what members to take, what supplies to carry, and what quest to take on and hopefully succeed. Party members range from brutish fighters to sly and trick filled jesters to help lay waste to the evils that lie underground. The last dungeon is not available to play yet but still there is already 70+ hours of gameplay for you to tackle while you wait in the meantime and prepare your party to take it on. Players experience stress with every negative event they encounter, they will get abusive, they will become masochists and will refuse healing. Managing their effects and taking care of what you need to concerning their minds is key if you want to win.  I've rage quit a few times and lost some very dear veterans but their monuments and achievements still remain with me as I bring some fresh new faces with me to avenge them in the depths. Randomly assembled rooms and dungeons are present and allow for an excellent amount of replayability even if the objectives and boss enemies are the same. Overall this game also shines in the gameplay department and delivers. 10/10\n\n-Controls: Very smooth and responsive, the controls haven't presented any frustrations or been the source of any of my failures and that makes me very happy. While there is potential for some tweaks and additions, the controls get the job done and just leave room to add on to and not patch to fix right away and leave it unplayable. Overall, great controls. 9/10\n\n-Replayablity: As mentioned previously with the random assembling and roguelike elements, this game allows for multiple revisits even after completing the main game whenever we can. Overall, a decent amount of replayability. 8.8/10\n\nFinal words: This game is Early Access first and foremost, but just know that this is an extremely polished and fine example of EA done right. You're not taking a chance at being severely disappointed by purchasing this with all the other information you have here. Will you get your 19.99 worth out of this game? Absolutely, this game can only go up from here and is a pleasure to play even if it isn't complete yet.

They said that you should prepare for an unforgiving and painful gaming experience, where all of your heroes are in the constant danger of dying within the next few minutes.\n\nI will tell you the same, but that's not all to it!\n\nAfter 6 hours of playtime, watching a bunch of videos and beating the first boss I think I have understood the main concept of the game, though I haven't seen everything of course.\nIt is true, it isn't that casual game for a short round now and then. You have to get into it and you have to understand, that every decision you take might be the last for one of your characters. You must be aware of the items to bring into the dungeon, the special abilities of your enemies and also your own. And then you have to calculate your risks and opportunities. Risk going for the next room? Or rather safe your precious characters and lose quite some gold for getting them good to go for the next run?\n\nAs it is a rolegame with some features, which take a classical approach, a good part of the game also relies on RNGs. But in my opinion it really is a good part, and not way too much.\nSo far I got just one character who died, but I know that it was my personal fault. RNGs just pointed my mistakes out. I knew it wouldn't be the best decision to take a healer into the dungeon, who already is almost completely stressed out. It was just my only healer who didn't need to recover from an exhausting dungeon run. So I wasn't surprised when she abandoned my tank in the midst of battle cause she just didn't want to heal him anymore... It still was a great experience.\n\nWhat I want to tell you by this is, that in my opinion it really is a skill-based game. Even though RNGs of course can mess you up, it happens mostly after some bad decisions from your side.\nIf you want some succesful dungeon runs and maybe even a decent team of heroes, who survived for quite some time, you must get into this game. From my experience so far, that is totally worth it!\n\nIt isn't called "Darkest Dungeon" for nothing, right?","October 9, 2015","true","25.8"," 109 of 159 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","109","159","3","2"

Here you will upgrade buildings that will allow you to upgrade heroes that will make higher level dungeouns easier, relieve stress and remove negitive quirks. gathering the resources to upgrade your town isent easy and will take some time.\n\nthe stress system - in most games your heroes look upon the horrers they face and while their diolauge may reflect shock and terror this never effects game play. Here it does, your heroes are not unstopple demi-gods of war who eat 12 story tall deamons for breakfest (at least not at first). here they will panic, devlop quirks that effect them negitavly, positivly or both they can also become virtuous where instead of decending into maddness they find the strength to carry on. with the recent update if the stress bar fills twice then the hero dies from a heart attack, this would be a con imo but due to the way in which stress can be mitigated (and almost ignored later on) i like it as it does make your stress bar somthing to watch.\n\nCons\nthe town - when the town is fully upgraded then thats it, no more resource mangment in fact you'll be tossing resources out of your bag to make way for other things such as gold (which by that point wont be a problem either)\n\nyour first game (for lack of a better word) - so what does that mean? it means that i suggest you treat your first game as a complete test run, even with the in-game tutoriols and the community on steam (who are very helpful and welcoming for the most part) the game runs off of rng and due to that the game can screw you particualry when you dont know whats what.\nnow i do not think that the rng in this game is all that bad but with the steam community having a few threads on this i feel its worth mentioning.\nThis is not a pick up and play game to an extent it has a learning curve but its not going to be gentle with you while your learning it there is no easy mode and your heroes are going to die untill you get your head around the combat system how heroes work together, which heroes work together and which heroes work for you and what i mean by that is i hate the occultist i cant make him work for me but there are those on the steam fourms who swear by him. when you have that figured out though the game becomes much easier and bearable which is why i suggest that for your first game just use it to learn the game and find out what works and then take it serioulsy for your second attempt.\n\nbosses - now i dont mean that the bosses are bad the bosses are very well designed each reqiureing diffreant strats and group comps to beat, so whats the issue? there is absolutly no in-game way of knowing what the strat is untill most likely you've already lost a squad or a hero to it (before you run away). now with hero recuirtment being free and heroes expendable that issue is mitigated but its still worth mentioning\n\nStress - stress in the late game almost isent a factor high level heroes have a high ammount of stress resist, i'm in two minds about this on one hand it shows that your heroes have progressed that they have gotten used to the horrers they fight and i like that on the other it makes the mechanic almost a non factor late game which isent a good thing.\n\nThe question\nthis game is in early access as you can see and with games like the stomping lands simply dissapearing without being completed or the game being in early access for years with little to no progress the question is will this game be finished? In my opinion at the time of this review being made 100% yes. The devs have just released a big content patch and in fact released two to three bug fix and balencing patchs on the day of the content release (and several more since) i remeber when i first bought the game months ago that a thread actully popped up on the steam fourm asking them to slow down the ammount of patchs being released (no serioulsy). The devs area passonaite group and i believe they intend to see this thing to the end in fact iirc they plan to release the full game later this year.\n\nDiscalaimer\nEverything said here is subject to change there are still two dungouns to be released the cove and the darkest dungoun (the latter of which the devs promise will be really hard and may fix stress being a non issue) its possible that this review will be of no use a couple of months down the line. But that is the nature of early access.","June 7, 2015","true","241.1"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","45","55","0","1"

It's balls hard but once you learn hpw to manage resources and make the best of a bad situation you will excel at this game. Expect to lose characters a lot a first and even much later. Each dungeon area has different status effects and troubles you will need to be prepared for which keeps the game fresh as it encourages you to build up multiple characters rather than have one mega party of the same 4-5 characters.

Except for the lack of story ending and access to some of the dungeons, it could totally pass for the feature-complete product. It's nice to know, though, that developers are still going to add even more content - if they accomplish that goal, the finalized game well may reach such remarkable quality level, that it will set a new reference standard among indie game projects.\n\nGood things\nGame mechanics\n\nDevelopers managed to find the fragile balance, making game mechanics deep, but inuitive and easy to grasp at the same time. You won't be completely lost from the very start, but there is a bit of intriguing sophistication to make sense of later. The "Stress" system is an especially good addition to the gameplay.\n\nInterface\n\nThe bane of number-crunching, turn-based games, the interface is well-managed here. Well-proporsioned and unobtrusive elements blend into gameplay process fast and easily.\n\nDifficulty and replayability\n\nIn spite of the waringins about "making the best of bad situation", the game is not too hard for a more casual player. Hardcore dungeon explorers may find it a bit lacking for their taste. But the balance is good, and the game finds amusing ways of bringing even the experienced player down to earth sometimes. In my second playthrough, just as soon as I started to think that I'm dealing with things too well, the tide of events made a sudden turn and I found myself escaping the dungeon with only half of the team, badly beaten. And, to my astonishment, it feeled just as a natural matter of hard luck, not a difficulty-balancing smite from the game engine!\n\nStyle\n\nDespite everything mentioned above, the game could still come out relatively mediocre, if not for the visual, sound and narrative style.\nThe disembodied voice of narrator gently but firmly guides you through the early stages and offers timely comments later, which greatly enriches the atomshpere. Unvoiced phrases of your heroes really make the story shine, though. You'll have a lot of fun watching them express their opinions and emotions while in action. Not to mention the heroes bickering, which is hilarious, but disasterous for their combat effectiveness\nVisual style is in carefully crafted superposition between self-irony caricature, Lovecraft-ish illustration and all-too-serious dark fantasy. Play the game for a little while, and be engulfed in its atmosphere.\nSound only adds to the effect. The soundtrack links to the game events well, but it doesn't leap to the foreground.\nThings to wish for\nMinor loading screen glitch fix\n\nSometimes the level loading screen seems to be stuck - and if you try to nudge things along with a mouse click or a keystroke, the game may crash. I've only encountered the glitch a couple of times.\n\nMore content\n\nThe more, the better. More character phrases, more dungeons, more monsters, more bosses with peculiar stratagies!\n\nAll in all, the game is not only good already, but has a lot of potential to become better! A nice example of a well-made Early Access project, for a change.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.","February 24, 2015","true","41.0"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","0"

The owner has finally called us today to hunt down a kill the wizard hag some canibilistic witch. He sent me, a occultist (who was a little wet behind the ears), a plage doctor (slightly more experianced but barely lvl 2), and a bounty hunter whom i worked with before and I the Hellion. We marched through the dungeon and the monsters proved no match for us but when we finally found the hag......that's were things turned for the worst. She grabbed the bounty hunter and thew in the pot, he begged for us to break it open but the hag kept pummeling us until we were all on death's door. The bounty hunter couldn't take it, we all couldn't after we've all seen and felt what its like in the infernal cauldren of hers, and he slew himself gibbering madly as his life blood soaked the dirt covered floor. The occulist sobbed and wailed until he was too silenced by the hag. The doctor stood and stared still her entrails were ripped from her and eaten while the witch chackled with guts running down her mouth.

I enjoy challenging games...but this game is not challenging in a fun, engaging way, as with games like Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls or whatever else.\n\nThis game constantly punishes the player in petty ways. Rampant early disease, the expense and limitations on treating disease and stress between levels, the restrictions of your inventory forcing you to leave behind treasure (especially if a character dies and you have to recover their trinkets), and the fact that you can't even use your higher level characters for lower level missions past a certain very early point (I can't send a level 3 character on level 1-2 missions?) are just a few of the things that suck all the fun out of this.\n\nProblems also tend to compound such that if you really screw up (especially early) I could see it being insanely difficult to recover. Couple that with the fact that even beyond the beginnings of the game, your high level characters with solid trinkets, armor and weapon upgrades, and upgraded skills can still get one-shot doing same-level dungeons...no thanks.\n\nI absolutely adore the style, art, theme, atmosphere, and narration of this game. I want so badly to like it, but Red Hook has really severely missed the distinction between "fun" difficult and "frustrating" difficult.","December 29, 2015","false","13.5"," 223 of 350 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","223","350","13","0"

What early access? This game is amazing as it is... oh, man, I can't even begin to imagine what will it look like when finished!\n\nI bought the game during the summer sale 2 days ago and I easily clocked in close to 17 hours already, and that is already telling, don't you think? But let's not get ahead of myself. As usual, I will take a look at the good and the bad. This review is as of build 9007, with the man at arms and the arbalest included, along with the new bosses.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Ironman - this game is for true rogue-like genre fans, the ones that do not whine and complain in the face of adversity and overwhelming odds, but for ones who seek options and avenues of advancement to combat this adversity.\n2. Rogue-like at its best - you never know what the game will offer you. You need to cope with the resources at your disposal. For example, you may be forced into weeks and weeks of hardships simply because the game won't pity you enough to give you another Vestal or Occultist character, but instead shower you with tanks and pitiful healers.\n3. Procedurally generated dungeons - while you could try to assume and predict, based on the area you chose to explore, layouts they are still largely random, so you need to plan ahead big time. Fight or flee has never been a bigger wrench of a choice before.Or that What if... queston on the back of your mind...\n4. Memorable stories - the game creates stories on its own, for example, how you got wiped twice, forced into meager runs but managed to get back on your feet and actually complete all the objectives, or, say, how you were forced into a 4 highwayman run cause you had nothing else to use, or, how your cleric went crazy and abusive and started britching(:P) about anything others do, which tunred into an avalanche of abusive stressed out individuals who care not about each other? Those things are in the game. This is one of the few games that makes you go to the forums or post a status about what happened just to vent off or share with your friends.\n5. Various missions - every time you complete a mission you get a different set of consequential encounters for you to choose, all of them with various objectives and varying rewards.\n6. Bosses - there are a number of bosses in the game, each one with different mechanics, meaning you need to bleed, boil and hurt till you learn what the boss does best and how to best combat him/her... it.\n7. Your very own mini-village for you to develop as you see fit. Will you neglect armor and weapons for the sake of more skills and buffs during camping? Will you choose to be skilled and better equipped and protected, but suffer everything the RNGesus throws at you cause you didnt upgrade the amount of new heroes who want to join you and the means of reducing stress through the abbey or the tavern? All up to you, and my, it is a big deal to select a good path of advancement. This alone creates memorable stories to post and share.\n8. Varying areas each with its own enemies, expectations, and bosses.\n9. The Light system, which alone makes for very interesting gameplay. More stress, but more loot, a normal run, or a safer run with less loot but little stress and lots of happy characters? Up to you!\n10. Wonderful level progression system with a set number of skills per character and quirks you gain for completing dungeons or various other conditions.\n11. Being dark and moody, making you crigne when something happens - it only enhances the experience.\n12. Value for the money - I like judging my game hours like 1 for 2, or 1 for 3 for bigger games. So, for every 1 euro I pay I expect 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can tell you, I could do 10 times the price I paid for this game.\n13. I have come back to the game since the review and I was absolutely baffled by the amount of content the devs actually dumped in. Well done, people. Let's go Darkest Dungeoning again!\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Early access - yeah, many features are still missing, even if the game is great as it is.\n2. Ironman - the game is extremely punishing, sometimes to the point of frustration. Some enemies can crit you out and kill a character while you're gaping at the screen with a "holy crap" ready to roll out of your mouth.\n3. You get to work with what you're given - you may find yourself sorely lacking in resources, passable heroes, meager parties, and worse.\n4. Cheesing out - the game can be cheesed out to make more money and save yourself from a dire situation, or to win a mission somehow.\n5. There is a stupid caretaker that may occupy the only freaking place where your most valuable character has to go to relieve stress.\n6. Dungeon layouts may completely foil your plans.\n7. Wipes and bad stuations - yeah, it can happen, especially while you still dont know what you're doing and what each thing does.\n8. Character balance - characters are not perfectly balanced as of yet. Then again, this game being a rogue-like,  dont mind having an underdog in my party just because I dont have anything else to use.\n\nConclusion:\nBUY THIS GAME - simple as that. You will spend lots of gameplay hours on it in its early access - I would say 30+ to complete all the caretaker's goals, and lots more when the game gets fully released. That being said, while I am a tad generous with the play time for a single run, I have 2 separate play-throughs (as I wanted to see the game from 2 different standpoints) and I can easily say that those play-throughs are as different as the sun and the moon. This is downright amazing, and I sure as hell hope they will continue adding content this way. There are still 2 more areas to unlock in the future, and they are surely going to be amazing.","June 14, 2015","true","111.5"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","45","57","0","6"

I created a new save file, started playing... and despaired. But I decided to keep playing, and to not stop playing until I had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer.\n\nSo it is now, after over 30 hours of gameplay time, that I want to write this review and say that I do NOT, in any way or form, recommend this game as it currently is. It is no longer the game I played back then. It has changed into something that is barely recognizable; it -is- technically the same game, but it most definitely does not feel the same. And it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment.\n\nI've read many bits and pieces of (sometimes conflicting) information as to why this happened, namely:\n\n-A highly-vocal group of "fans" steering this game into its sad current state\n-Developers which have a very particular vision for this game, and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could afford\n\nSo before I get into any details, I want to make this clear: I am not familiar to any such forum drama, I do not know who holds the blame, and I have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today. The one thing I know for certain is: it did change. Badly.\n\nThis game is now unquestionably an anti-fun game. By "anti-fun" I don't mean overly hard, I don't mean overly grindy, I don't mean overly complex. I mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it. Practically all enjoyment is gone, all progression feels meaningless for the most part, all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever.\n\nChief among the worst offenders are two mechanics: corpses and heart attacks. And yes, I know you can turn corpses off, but then we are not playing the game "the way it's meant to be played", we are not experiencing all it has to offer. And so, to elaborate:\n\nHeart attacks - having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before, in a GOOD way. It was a challenge to be overcome, it was an entertaining encumbrance. That lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough, and you'd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves, refusing heals, shuffling about, acting on their own... and a lone hero who passed the Virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition. It was a predicament, it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all, but it was FUN.\n\nThis is not the case anymore. Stress accumulation is now roughly 2-3x higher than it once was, everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously. And it doesn't stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal, while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable. No, now it NEVER stops, and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating, training, and equipping the heroes that WILL inevitably die from it at some point. You used to be able to bring a mildly-stressed hero on an expedition; doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well, and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will fail\n\nI will not even touch with a 10-foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right, and will simply leave it at: This is not fun. This is not acceptable, even. It is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress, something you can't effectively heal from, is an ever-present threat of almost instant death, which, thanks to this game's unforgiving RNG and mechanics, is VERY usually the same as instant death. Heart attacks could maybe, -maybe- be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress. And this is still a VERY big maybe. But as it is, it is undeniably an anti-fun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control.\n\n-------------------\n\nCorpses - This is by far the worst offender of the two, and that's without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone, butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach. This mechanic kills the utility of certain classes, artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which, for the most part, are otherwise generally useless, and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason. Enemies are -never- inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them, and even then, most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction. It is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game, causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target that's out of reach, thus taking more damage and stress for, again, -no reason whatsoever-.\n\nBut I want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic. Corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isn't a critical hit, which is like 90% of all killing blows, give or take. If the enemy is killed by a critical hit, bleed damage, or blight damage, there won't be a corpse. BUT:\n\n-If the enemy is bleeding/blighted, and is killed with a regular attack, there will still be a corpse!... that is bleeding/blighted. For some eldritch reason, if the enemy doesn't have those last 2 HP taken by bleed or blight damage, it suddenly turns into a corpse that CAN take a load more bleed and blight damage. Absolutely fantastic.\n\n-If the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage, there won't be a corpse. If the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage, there will be a full HP corpse. Being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important, which is their damage.\n\nBoth of the above points happen for a very simple reason: artificial difficulty. Forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn, and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you won't be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse. Taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the RNG's by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit, and not just a powerful hit. Because attacking bleeding/blighted enemies, or hitting near-death enemies with powerful skills, so that they wouldn't leave corpses behind? Those would be things the player could control, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?\n\nIn order to make corpses borderline bearable, at -least- the following changes would be needed:\n\n-Any enemy that dies while bleeding/blighted would leave no corpse\n-Any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpse's HP. For example, if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 HP, the corpse would lose 3 HP right as it spawned\n\nAnd again, this is so corpses would be more bearable. It is no substitute for the fact that, much like heart attacks, they shouldn't exist at -all-.\n\nThis is a game I loved and I'm actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in. But I cannot, at all, recommend this game. Regardless, I will update this review once the game is completed\n\nUPDATE: Game is completed, nothing really changed.","January 2","false","32.8"," 370 of 608 people (61%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","61","370","608","20","110"

There are some rough edges around the slightly unresponsive UI (selecting the rooms which to explore, etc), balance of classes (Jesters are fun but everyone else does what they do so much better at it) and difficulty curve (there's an immensely ugly spike from level 3 to level 5 dungeons and it's not entirely unreasonable that you WILL die during your tutorial battle).\n\nBut that's Early Access. And even now, even limited to "only" 10 out of 16 hero classes, and 3 out of 5 dungeons, the game is absolutely glorious in art and feeling. From the very first time I've set my eyes on the original trailer to accessing Kickstarter-Backer-only Pre-Early Access, I've been in love with the game.\n\nFinally there is a meaningful "flee" mechanic. It makes sense to abandoning a mission - you won't get the rewards, your heroes will be unhappy about it, but at least you get them out alive and all the loot they've gathered so far. And this loot will determine if you can afford their drinking sprees and self-flagellation practices in town to get them to function like normal beings again. Normal adventurer beings.\n\nDon't get too attached to your heroes. They will die, whether in a hag's cooking pot (what an amazing boss fight!), poisoned by sentient fungi or hacked to pieces by giant undead skeletons. They will die, and they will grow mad (or, rarely, heroic) and those who survive will develop most unpleasant traits during the weeks of their adventurers' life.\n\nAnd still you'll be hiring new faces, new classes with new skill sets to send them to their doom underneath your family's ancient manor while using your loot to slowly build up and expand your hamlet and base of operations.\n\n\nIt's the best and most complete Early Access game I have every played - if this sounds like something you enjoy, go for it. I certainly do not regret a single cent spent on the Kickstarter.\n","February 4, 2015","true","102.2"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","46","62","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/262060/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDarkest Dungeon is the strategy game Lovecraft nerds have been waiting their whole lives for. Your idiot ancestor, in fine Dunwich Horror tradition, opens a portal to unspeakable things in the caves beneath your family estate. This triggers a sort of eldrich Chernobyl, which you seek to battle back with the help of some incredibly suspect mercenaries. You send expeditions down into the corrupted places to battle monsters and secure treasures, at the cost of your team's health and sanity. Back at your hamlet, you manage your people, training them, outfitting them, and treating the different neuroses they pick up from their journeys. This is the heart of the game, the struggle between pushing back the darkness and keeping your troops from succumbing to it. Stress mounts over time if not managed, and adventurers pick up more and more quirks as they gain experience. Some of these are helpful, like familiarity with certain dungeons or stronger wills to resist stress. Most of them are not, and can range from claustrophobia to full-blown insanity.\n\nThe management half of the game is very much an XCOM affair, training and outfitting your mercs as you upgrade your hamlet. Aside from skill training and forging new gear, there are structures like a bar, a church, and an asylum for helping your team deal with the stresses suffered and treating the different psychoses and maladies they pick up. Successful dungeon crawls will earn you enough money to improve the lives of your crew and still have leftovers for further upgrades. Bad runs can cost you dearly, though there never seems to be a point where the situation is unrecoverable. There are always more hapless souls to send into low-level dungeons, after all. Upgrades to the hamlet reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and open up new options in terms of gearing and skill builds.\n\nOnce you're ready to venture forth, you pick a mission from one of five dungeons (only three are available now, hence Early Access) and form a party of four. Missions can focus on completing battles, finding artifacts, or scouting rooms, but they all really come down to exploring as much of the dungeon as you can. You spend gold on provisions like food and torches and shovels, and then you're off. I'm glossing over a lot here, because party formation and provisioning is super important for ensuring you don't have to bail on a dungeon. Dungeons themselves are randomized networks of rooms and hallways. Rooms have the major treasures and battles, while hallways can have ambushes, traps, and smaller rewards to find. Once you complete the mission objective you can leave at any time, so if your party isn't coming apart at the seams yet you can keep trawling for loot. In fact, you can retreat at any time, but your adventurers will suffer stress penalties for failing in their duty. Longer dungeons even have a camping mechanic where your party members can tend to each others' needs. Crawls tend to be tense and measured, trying to keep your torchlight up and your progress matching your provisions.\n\nCombat is where the game really shines. It's a simple turn-based system; all your people and their people get one action per turn, the order determined by their speed stat. Both parties are in lines of 4, and the skills available to use are dependent largely on position. Melee attacks might only be used from the front two positions and target the front two enemies, or a ranged attack might only be used from the back row and target all enemies except the one in the front. Each class has 8 skills, 4 of which you can have equipped in a dungeon. Skills always have a ton of features, like status effects or interactions with other systems like your torchlight, meaning there's really no basic "hit with sword" attack. There's a ton of strategy to using skills in concert, and the interface helps with this, giving you very complete tooltips on the odds and results of one specific attack on one specific enemy before you use it. It's very much the RPG equivalent of XCOM combat, with you forming strategies to minimize risk and overcoming unforeseen consequences. The RNG is out in force in this title, with massive crits and misses swinging battles back and forth wildly. This is mitigated in part by the Death's Door system: If your HP hits 0, you don't die, but any additional damage has a chance to kill. And when that character dies, they're dead for good, so dancing around Death's Door is a pretty thrilling part of any difficult dungeon crawl.\n\nHP is healed when you finish a mission, but stress sticks with your characters. Everything from suffering crits to just being in the dungeon for too long stresses your characters, and when that stress reaches the breaking point, things go to hell. Your mercs can get special sanity effects like Paranoia and Masochism. These can lead them to stop listening to your orders, going their own crazy ways, and stressing out your other party members. Back in town you can treat them with sundry activities like drinking, whoring, and self-flagellation, but even these have their drawbacks. My Occultist suffered a paranoid breakdown, and after being assigned to flagellate his fears away, decided to go on a journey of self-discovery and vanished from the roster. Honestly, that was less of an inconvenience than the Plague Doctor who "achieved a state of profound emptiness" while meditating and refuses to stop, or my Crusader who suffers religious delusions in battle and won't do anything except pray. We'll see what they have to say when they make it out of the asylum, though.\n\nI probably don't need to mention this by now, but the presentation is incredible. The art is a beautifully-animated pastiche of thick lines and limited colors, looking very much like a love-letter to the works of Mike Mignola. The music is bold and oppressive, and the sound effects are rich and impactful. And I can't pass up the chance to talk about the narrator, because he's one of the best this side of Bastion and The Stanley Parable. Every word out of his mouth is the most overwrought, overdramatic thing you could imagine, bordering on parody but working so, so well with the pitch-black airs of the game. I mean, when you light a new torch he says "THE MATCH IS STRUCK; A BLAZING STAR IS BORN" for God's sake. Watch the intro if you don't believe me, or just do it anyway because it is brilliant. Aesthetically the game is absolutely dripping in polish, in stark contrast to its Early Access status.\n\nIf you want to send hapless adventurers into nightmarish hellholes to bring you back ancient treasures at the cost of their sanity, this is the title for you. As far as Early Access goes, there's no real reason to wait on this one. The game is missing two dungeons, one of which is supposed to go in this fall, and is still being balanced but right now plays just fine. In terms of pricing I expect this to be a Kerbal sort of situation, with no greater discounts until the full release (early?) next year. If you get it now you can ruin a whole bunch of peoples' lives for a few dozen hours, forget about it until release, and come back to an even better game.","August 20, 2015","true","67.7"," 78 of 116 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","78","116","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamdownlord/recommended/262060/","iamdownlord","downlord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamdownlord/","3620 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a very solid turn-based dungeon crawler with rogue-lite elements that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nTL;DR\nA fantastic Early Access game that is well worth the asking price, and has the potential to be one of the greatest dungeon-crawlers ever. The game has tons of content, enjoyment, playability, and polish going for it. With the upcoming content additions, I'll definitely be playing this for a long long time. It's relatively bug free already, but I think it does need some minor balancing done here and there.\n\nGameplay:\nSolid, incredibly hard, but not unfair, and very addicting. Combat is rarely a cakewalk, and you need to be calculating in your choice of classes, their positions, their moves, and targeting. The current classes are pretty varied, but ultimately boil down to melee DPS/tanks, ranged, and support/healer classes that you are used to. The classes are all very good in their own right, but their does definitely need to be some balancing done between them imo, as some classes are objectively better than others.\n\nCurrently melee classes like Leper, Bounty Hunter, and Crusader are far better than the others. They have high HP+DEF and do far more damage than any other class, so if it weren't for the fact most of their skills can only be used if they are in the first two positions, you'd just want to fill your ranks with them. Ranged DPS sucks for the most part, and the support classes really onli have very weak buffs/debuff, very low damage attacks, and/or very weak healing spells.\n\nI don't think the melee should be nerfed entirely, but tanks shouldn't have high dmg output, and vice versa: DPS shouldn't be invincible. Ranged should have low DEF/HP, high damage instead of low HP/DEF and low damage, and support classes should have higher stats on their buffs, and at the very least, do better healing. Healing skills tend to be less than 50% of what a single enemy attack does, so there is almost never a point to using them atm. There are no HP potions, and food doesn't heal for ♥♥♥♥, so something is definitely needed to allow some reasonable degree of healing without removing the games difficulty. Classes like Plague Doctor and Jester are currently not worth the slot they occupy atm, unless you have no other options for those back two slots.\n\nThat said, the framework and skills of the classes, even the ones I'm complaining about are honestly pretty wonderful, it's just a matter of changing some numbers around slightly, which I do hope happens. It is an Early Access game after all, so these kinds of things are to be expected, and expected to change over time as the final product takes shape. The gameplay tons of fun of even now, it's just frustrating sometimes when you're stuck with one or more party members that can't pull their weight at all.\n\nContent:\nAlready there are many hours of content. I'm ten hours in and have barely scratched the surface. (A few bosses down, chars still lowish level, etc.). This is partially do to the game's difficulty, slow pace,high-ish (but not necessarily steep) learning curve, rate of progression, and the fairly large variety of classes and missions already available. The game (currently) definitely requires plenty of grinding, but that's pretty par for the course in the genre.\n\nCharacters very level slowly (if you can keep them alive in the first place). Upgrades (two kinds - overworld upgrades ala Rogue Legacy, and character skill/gear upgrades through gold) aren't terribly expensive, but much of your gold will be spent de-stressing characters and buying consumables before each dungeon so their isn't much left to spend on character skills/gear, and overworld upgrades are earned pretty slowly through completing dungeons.\n\nYou can also find random loot items in dungeons, or as a reward for completing certain dungeons. However, of the dozens of items I've found so far I've equipped exactly zero of them. Every item has a benefit (like +dmg) with a cost (-HP, for example), which is good, but currently it seems like every item I've found has, at best, marginally more COST than benefit, and more often than not, is more of a gimp than anything. These items definitely need some balancing as well imo to provide at least somewhat of a net benefit. The idea is already implemented and cool, it just needs some tweaking.\n\nMechanics:\nThis game has lots of cool mechanics, however the two that make it unique are the stress mechanic and the light mechanic.\n\nThe stress mechanic is awesome and definitely makes sets the game apart, but it might be a little heavy. For most games, you will be lucky to get your characters through a single dungeon without at least one hitting 100% stress ("afflicted"). They then have to be relaxed in the overworld, which takes them out of rotation for a whole dungeon, and costs a significant amount of gold. Even if they don't hit 100% in the first one, you can almost never take them through a second dungeon back to back without relaxing them first, or they will quickly get to 100% in your next run, stressing out your other characters in the process, and often dooming the whole run.\n\nThis brings me to the light mechanic, which is really cool by itself. The higher the light, the better the chance to scout ahead between rooms, and the higher the chance to 'surprise' any enemies, causing them to skip their attack phase during the first round. Light is based on consumable torches. The light bar decreases as you progress, and you can use torches to replenish it. If you let light fade, you increase your stress levels, but also increase the loot. Sounds cool, and it can be. However, because you get sooooo much stress in dungeons as it is right now, it's almost never wise to not just keep the light topped off, just to delay hitting that inevitable 100% stress level, so you don't really get to use it much.\n\nYou get stress walking (full light or not) you get stress from mob attacks (like 15+ stress per hit), traps, items, damage, and your other characters. If one char gets crit, HP down to "1", or hits 100% stress, guess what? The rest get tons of stress too. It adds up quick really quick, and a few bad hits in an early encounter in a dungeon can send the whole thing snowballing down quickly to the point you have no option but to retreat, abandon the dungeon, and lose any items/gold you had earned, plus now you'll have to send all 4 characters to 'relax' and pay thousands of gold for it. If stress were nerfed just a little bit, even in one area (like not getting random stress when walking at 100% light), then the light mechanic could be utilized a lot more.\n\nThat said, if it sounds like I'm bashing these mechanics or the game, I'm definitely not. I like them, and I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre, there's just some minor numbers that need to be changed for balance here and there. Or hell, maybe I'm just really bad and just need to L2P. Either way, I wouldn't change a single thing about the functionality of the mechanics or game itself, just tweak the balance a bit\n\nAtmosphere:\nExcellent, the voice acting that exists so far is perfect, and the game has a beautiful graphic novel style Lovecraftian aesthetic. It's hard to overstate how nice this game looks and sounds.\n\nEarly Access Comments:\nGame definitely does not feel much like an EA game. The only bugs I've experienced have been very minor, except for two CTD's after several hour play sessions, but since the game autosaves constantly, it was really just a minor inconvenience, and may be fixed already. There is a ton of polish and content already. If it didn't get another update ever again, I think it'd still be worth this price. I don't think that's the case, as Red Hook seems very committed, but ya never know 100% with EA. If this is just the beginning, I can't wait to see what's coming next.","February 3, 2015","true","17.6"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","47","64","0","0"

Your move Crusader. Man, if only King Arthur, 1st of His Name, Biggest of Jockstraps, Defender of the Realm and Slayer of Harems had thought to bring a band-aid to get Ol' Compost the Leper off of death's door then he might have lived. Oh wait he totally has that skill. You just didn't equip it because biggest sword is best sword. Big RNG crits sink happy little adventurer's ships, so run a very low level heal skill on 3/4 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen. The Leper lives, and you don't have to go home and tell his, ah, remaining foot that the rest won't be coming home. You do get better at the game, you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes. I've run 20-30 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character. To those who say "TOO MUCH RNG, NOT EVEN A GAME": proper prior planning prevents ♥♥♥♥ (urine) poor performance.\n\n2) "TRINKETS ARE TRASH, NO REWARD!!!"\n- Trinkets have upsides and downsides, why not combine two trinkets? *brainexplosion*\n\ne.g. +30% heals, +20% stress. "THIS IS TERRIBLE I'LL DIE OF STRESS" says big bubba. Oh wait what's this? A trinket that says -20% stress? What if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team that'll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be. Legendary trinkets are legendary, proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful. There's no free hand outs, use strategy and planning to win dungeons.\n\n3) "THE GAME IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND!!!"\n- If you're taking forever to finish the game, then you're losing too many people. The game is easily finishable within 60 hours. True end game dungeoning can take a long time, because of certain factors which come into effect. However at the end game there are catch-up mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast. Procedurally generated rogue-like games such as this, you are essentially doing one dungeon after another. The only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time, and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses, which have their own surprises.\n\nI wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with:\n1) Difficult gameplay, where consequences are real.\n2) Brothels\n3) Tentacles","April 2","true","132.1"," 90 of 137 people (66%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","66","90","137","78","0"

It really takes heavy cues from H.P. Lovecraft on how man was not meant to see what lies just beyond the torchlight.\n\nIt uses a turn based system and RPG elements as well as some cues taken from roguelike games, such as permadeath.  The game rewards quick thinking in a bad situation and preparation and priorities can truly determine weather your party comes out from the caves alive, or are ripped to shreds by nameless horrors.\n\nThe Art style is phenomenal and you'd be hard pressed to find a indie game with such evocative soundtracks and voiceover.  The narrator makes you feel the success of a critical hit and heartache of a fatal blow.  You grow attached to your party members just to see them die from a poor decision.  Some people may cry that the computer can pull these amazing succession of criticals leaving your characters ripe for slaughter next turn, but I've found that if you prepped correctly, prioritized your healing, and use status effects (like bleed and blight) to your advantage, you'll make it by the skin of you teeth and escape the dungeon.\n\nIn this game, you gotta know when to call it quits and leave the dungeon with what loot you can carry.  It's ok to run and come back another day with a stronger party and better supplies then to lose a character you've upgraded significantly.  And I love that about this game.  In H.P. Lovecraft's stories, it is rarely a happy ending and this game holds to those themes tightly.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game, but only to those that have the patience and understanding of the mindset you have to have when facing the terrors of the abyss.

The exploration segments have a fairly small number of decision points. Characters have a limited number of moves to select from in combat, and character building is limited to a small number of skill and item choices. On the one hand, the game lacks somewhat for depth as a result of this aggressive minimalism. On the other hand, it's freed of a lot of pointless micromanagement that plagues more detailed games. The concept is that you have a smaller number of more meaningful decisions to make, although I can't say the execution is without its flaws--too many decisions are plagued by trap options, leaving the player with fewer real choices than they should have. It's still fun, but has room to improve.\n\nGenerally, though, the tactical elements are pretty decent. There is a large element of randomness, but the game does a good job of providing tools to mitigate risks. Careful and thoughtful play is consistently rewarded, but there is a strong risk/reward element to the gameplay, so if you play fast and loose you can still accomplish amazing things if you're lucky--or die horribly if you're not.\n\nThe highlight of the game is definitely the aesthetics. The art direction is awesome, the voice work is superb, and the story (while sparse) is surprisingly good. The tactile feel of combat is extremely enjoyable. The game's themes and motifs are woven throughout the art, story, and gameplay in a really satisfying and cohesive way. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is executed brilliantly. Most dungeon crawlers have the bare minimum of story necessary to explain why the player is off to kill monsters and collect loot, so getting an interesting narrative out of the ending sequence was a pleasant surprise. It's a very well done piece of horror.\n\nThat does bring us to the elephant in the room: the grind. Dungeon crawlers generally tend to be largely about grinding when you get down to it, and Darkest Dungeon is not really an exception. It's got 14 classes to play with and heavily encourages (eventually outright forces) you to use more than 4 characters, so there's enough diversity in the roster to keep gameplay somewhat fresh and interesting. And the difficulty curve is well done, with enemies picking up new tricks to challenge you throughout the game. Even so, there are points where the game ends up dragging. A full campaign is likely to take 30-40+ hours, which is a huge time commitment for a relatively simple game. The game could really have been shaved down by 5 or 10 hours without really losing anything.\n\nIn general, I would recommend Darkest Dungeon if...\n...you want to play a streamlined version of old school dungeon crawlers with a major roster management component.\n...you'd like to see a game pull off a gritty gothic horror theme and turn classic RPG archetypes on their head.\n...you enjoy tactical combat optimization that doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.\n\nOn the other hand, you may consider staying away if...\n...you get very attached to your characters in RPGs and hate when bad things happen to them.\n...you enjoy micromanagement and having control over a lot of fine details.\n...you're a fan of traditional heroic fantasy narratives and love seeing the good guys win.","January 22","true","154.6"," 90 of 138 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","90","138","10","0"

I decide to leave my Plague Doctor at home too; his kleptomania and plutomania make him compulsively raid every chest along the way, which is setting off traps and stressing the hell out of everyone.  In their stead we take a Hellion and an Occultist, and back to the ruins we go.  Storming through the gates, my lads and lassies are crushing everything in sight.  Whatever for evil may take, be it bone soldiers or cultists, all fall before my steel.  Pressing on, however, we realise that we didn’t bring nearly enough food or torches for this mission.  Do we soldier on, or to we turn tail and run home?  By the beard of Poseidon, we go on!  Inevitably, things start going hairy once the torches run out, and a bunch of spiders thrashes us with impunity. We’re all hanging on by threads, the pitiful 1-2 hp from my Vestal’s group heal the only thing between us and oblivion. My crusader’s resolve is tested, but his brush with death awakens his heroism, and he storms back.  My occultist, however, can’t take the heat and turns abusive, berating the other members and stressing them out even more.  We finally manage to squash the bugs, but the whole party is in bad shape.  Stress levels are high, hp is low, and all the food is gone.  We only have one more room to go through to complete the quest, but the odds are that we won’t survive another scrap.  Embracing recklessness, we push on to the next room, where bone soldiers and spiders await.  The enemy surprises us, the shock throwing my Hellion and crusader to the back of the formation where they can’t attack anything.  By the time I’ve got my part into a fighting formation, it is looking particularly grim and frostbitten for us, and that bloody rapscallion of an Occultists constant stream of abuse and slander towards his comrades isn’t helping. My crusader hits a stun on one of the spiders, giving me a brief chance to get back in the game.  I risk it all on my Hellion’s Break Thru ability; if it doesn’t hit, we’re toast.  It hits, and it bloody critical hits, sending our foes back to the nether from whence they came and allowing my heroes to leave the dungeon alive.  The snide Occultist earns a trip to the sanatorium for his crimes; a week in a padded cell might straighten his shenanigans out.  With the loot we earned we can update the town, learn some new skills and beef up a bit. Thankfully, my highwayman has ended his week-long pub crawl and is ready to rip it up again.  I just hope his newfound love of alcohol won’t get the better of him…\n\nHow many games let you craft your own stories as good as this game does?\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a classic triumph of a small, focused and creative team of indie developers beating the snot out of the AAA market.  From the fantastically grimy art direction to the harrowing baritone narrator, DD is dripping in lovecraftian atmosphere and hammy gothic horror, and has the world has such striking personality and depth that it is always a pleasure to venture into dungeons and watch your heroes die.  I’m not gonna go into details on game play here; just go on you tube and you’ll see what it is all about.  What I will say is:\n\n•	This game is addictive as hell!  Once I got a taste for this dungeon crawling rpg gore fest there was no turning back.\n\n•	It is not as hard or as punishing as people seem to make out.  There is a steep learning curve, for sure, and you must make careful preparations while wisely choosing which characters will go a questing; more than a few of your party will die before you get the hang of it.  However, in the humble opinion of yours truly, this is not as frustrating or as difficult as people make out\n\n•	That said, it is still bloody difficult, and a lot of the time it revolves around the luck of the RNG.  Relish the challenge and come to terms with the fact that sometimes, no degree of skill and planning will save you from death.\n\n•	This game is just bad ♥♥♥.  Plain and simple.\n\n•	This game is SO METAL it is unbelievable.  If you listened to Slayer or Dark Angel during the 1980s you’ll know what I’m talking about.\n\n•	You can’t heal outside of combat.  Deal with it.  Healing out of combat would destroy what makes the dungeons so exciting – its about surviving the horrors or succumbing to them.  Also, you can camp and eat to get a small bit of health back, so the game isn’t unjust towards you.\n\n•	This game takes the traditional RPG standards and throws them out of the window in favour of things infinitely cooler and more creative.  Sick of the old warrior/mage/rogue trinity that is the foundation of JUST ABOUT EVERY RPG EVER?  How about plague doctors, occultists, jesters and lepers?  And there are more classes on the way….\nThis is the coolest, most bad ♥♥♥ RPG I’ve played in ages.  Let it be said that if you play RPGs for the storylines and stuff, and there’s nothing wrong with that, then perhaps DD isn’t your best bet.  If you like challenging RPGS and have a bit of a masochistic streak in you, then this is your destiny.  Embrace the darkness.\n\n(P.s. I found that listening to any good thrash or death (SkeletonWitch, older Slayer, Absu etc) really goes well with this game)\n","March 17, 2015","true","51.5"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","34","43","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Davoski/recommended/262060/","Davoski","Davies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Davoski/","398 products in account","Darkest Dungeon is a 2d turn-based dungeon crawler, created by Red Hook Studios.\n\nUpon starting the game you are greeted with the news that a dear estranged relative of yours has been up to some pretty bad stuff and essentially leaves you to clean up his mess. The mess in question being the multitude of ghouls, horrors and other assorted ne’er-do-wells that now inhabit the family manor and the hamlet that surrounds it. This is the premise of Darkest Dungeon and it works as well as any other to start our adventure.\n\nThe bulk of the game revolves around leading a group of four characters through an assortment of randomly generated dungeons and doing battle with the creatures that inhabit them. Characters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them. For instance some characters will do better on the front line while others will thrive at the back of the group. Setting up your group is key to a successful endeavour. This is where the games hub comes into play.\n\nThe Hamlet is a small group of shops and buildings that acts as the games main hub. From here you are able to make use of a wide variety of amenities as you decide which heroes to send out on their next adventure and with what supplies to pack. New heroes are able to be recruited from the stage coach, armour and weapons upgraded at the blacksmith, diseases and quirks cured at the sanatorium as well as many other services being available for the right price. This includes spending money to reduce the effect of one of the games main mechanics - Stress.\n\nStress is an in-game measurement of a particular hero's mental state, a counter that goes from 0 to 200. If the hero's stress reaches 100 they will gain an affliction or have a chance to become virtuous. While a virtuous hero will only benefit your team with buffs and stress reduction. An afflicted hero has the complete opposite effect, increasing the stress of those around them and sometimes actively putting themselves in danger or ignoring your command completely. If your stress becomes too high, your hero is at risk of a heart attack which may kill them outright. This may be compounded by the games quirk system, where in certain situations a hero will develop a positive or negative quirk that will affect how they act, or how you must treat them. These can range from increased stress gain to a compulsive need to examine every item you come across and many more.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation, Darkest Dungeon gets full points. The gothic 2d art style oozes personality without being overly busy or confusing and a good use of depth of field stops the game from feeling flat. The interface is incredibly well designed and remains simple, despite the amount of information housed within. There are a few changes I would make to make viewing information a little easier but overall the interface does what it sets out to do very well.  The graphic style of Darkest Dungeon conveys the mood of the game perfectly and only strengthens its theme, ESPECIALY when paired with the terrific audio design and the phenomenal voice acting of the narrator.\n\nThe Audio design in this game is on another level when stacked up against its peers. as the light fades so too does the music’s simple nature, giving way to an erratic tune that becomes more maddening the more you venture forth, the weighty sounds of attacks as your group goes toe to toe with all manner of horrors, and of course the absolutely shiver inducing tones of the loquacious narrator as he pontificates about his "Venerable house" and the "arcades of antiquity".\n\nAll of these elements come together to make Darkest Dungeon and absolutely unforgettable experience. the feeling of felling an enemy with a perfect strategy leaves you in awe of yourself as a brilliant tactician while other times becoming absolutely downtrodden as you lose the hero you've been cultivating for so very long. Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of what you are given and sometimes when life gives you lemons, well I hope you like lemons.\n\nOverall my Experience with Darkest Dungeon has been incredibly satisfying, having put 40 hours into the game I can see that I am in fact not even close to finishing, nor do I feel the fatigue that I usually would after playing most any other game for such a long period of time. When I first saw it in early access I was itching to play it, but decided to hold off and wait until the developers were confident enough to say that it was a finished product, and I am so glad that I did.\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of X-Com, or don’t mind a bit of punishment to get true satisfaction out of your gaming experience then I don't have any problem telling you that\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a MUST PLAY.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review consider leaving a thumbs up, or if you have some constructive feedback to leave, feel free to comment.","February 15","true","51.4"," 80 of 122 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","80","122","8","0"

As you walk forward the clock ticks down.  If you loot something, there is a good chance you will lose 15 seconds.  If you don't have enough torches the clock ticks down even faster as you move.  If you get into a fight and take too long trying to survive, you lose additional time.\n\nIf you are critically hit, EVERY party member loses fifteen seconds.  If you critically hit someone, one or two of your party members may gain a few seconds back on the clock.\n\nOne player class has the beneficial ability to sit in the back row and give one team member three more seconds to an individual timer.  In comparison there are common enemy special abilities you will constantly encounter, that deal a small amount of damage , while taking another 15 to 20 seconds off of one party members timer.\n\nEnemies have group attacks that hit every party member and removes another 20 seconds from your play timer.  There is no friendly equivalent, not even something small that gives everyone 2 or 3 seconds back.\n\nIf one character hit's the halfway mark and is down to only two minutes remaining, roll a ten sided dice. If you roll a one through nine, that character instantly loses an additional 30 seconds, and each other group member loses 30 seconds as well.  That character will then randomly take away another 10 seconds from each player while walking, and in combat will continue to drain time away from the entire group about every two rounds.  If this triggers a second group member hitting the 2 minute mark, that person will then have a %90 chance of suffering something similar, and draining even more time from your play.  There is hope though, if you get that slim one-in-ten victory at the halfway point, you will gain a minute and a half back on your timer, and once every six to eight rounds of combat you will give out a party buff.  This experience will feel like winning a five dollar scratcher.  Sure, you won, but now you have to go back to the gas station.  Hooray.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, a lot.  Great sound effects, incredible voice-over work, and perfectly moody and atmospheric soundtrack.  The game play is fun and interesting, unique leveling system and very cool buffs and debuff's that can arrive quickly and randomly.  Sadly, if the stress system doesn't get a whole lot more attention, this game will be doomed to bear the ultimate video game sin of being boring.  The stress meter has a lot of potential to create exciting or scary swings towards victory or defeat, akin to the random elements you normally expect from critical hits.  Unfortunately, the only thing the stress meter actually adds to the game, is redundant timer.  Regardless of preparation, or player choice, the stress bar is essentially a one way trip towards character heart attack, and that stress meter can suffer random spikes towards maximum from every single action you take or enemy you face.  There are methods in-game for reducing stress for party or characters, but those are comparitively small when measured against the steady swell of incoming stress.  Initially this feature is quirky and interesting, but when you realize how it works, and that it steadily and reliably defeats you with no recourse, the game becomes boring.  It's similar to knowing that tax season is around the corner, and you are going to owe again.  This game is not as difficult as some make it out to be. There is simply a pre-lit fuse over every action you take and that you can't put out, only slow down, poorly.\n","July 26, 2015","false","60.2"," 201 of 329 people (61%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","61","201","329","15","3"

In short, should you buy it? YES.\n\nImportant things to know:\nThe game is technically early access and I'm sure you've heard (or been subject to) the horrors that could potentially come from a title with this tag. But one easy way to know if this game is a legitimate seller, or just a shameless grab for money; is to look at the news/updates for the game. The game has very steady updates, which are usually packed with either a lot of fixes and tweaks, or full blown new elements to play with. Overall the developers seem pretty committed and there is a large pool of gamer genres it caters too, making the community reasonably sized.\n\nBuy this game if you like:\n-Challenging yet rewarding game-play\n-"dungeon crawlers" (aka Diablo, etc.)\n-Unforgiving games like Dark Souls (See negatives)\n-Awesome medieval/gothic art style animations\n-Strategy games\n\nSetting:\nThere really aren't many spoilers to give, so long as you've seen the videos offered on the game's store page; you've got the gist of it. You are the heir of a noble bloodline, who's family owned a castle and a big chunk of land, which subsequently became overrun with demons, undead, etc. You are directed by the, amazingly well voice acted, voice of your ancestor to cleanse the grounds of all evil and take back your home.\n\nGameplay:\nThe character you play as (the heir), is never actually seen (except for a brief silhouette in the window of a stage coach). The game is seen mainly through the eyes of the adventurers that get hired to wander the halls, sewers and gardens of the grounds. Their are several different classes to choose from, as well as an enormous number of random traits assigned to every new character arriving on the stage coach (think of Rogue Legends).\n\nThe explorers are sent in to accomplish various tasks: map the area, kill baddies, purify alters and exterminate bosses; all the while collecting gold, jewels, trinkets and other important things. You control them as they travel from room to room, managing supplies and food consumption. A major mechanic of the game is stress, which regularly proves to be more lethal than most of the enemies by themselves. If an adventurer becomes too stressed they become "afflicted", resulting in various negative behaviors including hurting themselves, whimpering in fear, reckless abandonment or just further stress.\n\nOnce the adventurers stagger out of the dungeons with loot in hand, they return to a small town just outside of the grounds and deliver it to you. It is then your duty to manage your money to fund various important tasks such as: paying to let characters reduce their stress (praying, drinking, etc.), upgrading their gear/skills, investing into town services to upgrade their benefits and a myriad of other things that I'll let you find for yourself.\n\nNegatives:\n-The game is very punishing. When enemies "Crit"(critical hit) they not only deal extra damage but usually cause the stress of all your party members to go up. VIce versa, your heroes crits will heal some stress; but the enemy do not experience stress so its not much of a loss for them. Also heroes, if not careful, die a lot. It may get to the point where each expedition ends with you hiring an entirely new team.\n-RNG. Random number generators are used for a lot of the unseen calculations that determine whether an attack hits or misses and how much damage is dealt. Recently they've implemented fixes to make it so enemies can't crit 5 times in a row, completely wiping your party; but like I said, early access.\n-Trinkets are Unbalanced. Sometimes your adventurers might find a trinket that can enhance certain stats/abilities. Most of the time these trinkets benefits are far outweighed by their negatives, making all but a specific few trinkets essentially useless (except in more advanced play).\n\nPositives\n-Looks great, sounds great. The art style is very gothic and edgy, wrapping up the whole "Darkest Dungeon" feel. While the animations themselves are very simple, the game has an excellent audio board full of tasty sound effects. Mainly though your ancestors voice steals the show, narrating just about everything in an aristocratic, gravelly tone. "A SINGULAR Strike! The fiends must be driven back, and what better place to begin than the seat of our noble line."\n-Endless combinations. You can take four adventurers into a dungeon. The various classes, plus the positive/negative traits they all have, plus the trinkets they're carrying, plus the specific dungeon area, plus the various skills they possess; lead to a new experience every crawl. Experimenting on what works well with what is half the fun, giving it a really strong replay value as they add new content all the time.\n-Intense Crawls. Never before will you look at a dungeon crawler the same way again. The adversity that you must overcome, coupled with trying to keep your characters from ending themselves, is delectably painful. Your characters will seem to take on personas of their own as they single handedly take on a boss or go insane and starting acting manically.\n\nClosing statement\nBuy the game. They just added two new characters for free. You won't regret it.\nOr maybe you will, once you've entered...\nThe Darkest Dungeon\n\nUPDATE 8/11\nStill playing and the game is only getting better...","May 28, 2015","true","100.7"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","33","42","3","0"

It's nice to see the early access state to finished barely changed anything, except add in more fake difficulty.\nPros:\n-REALLY, REALLY good artwork and style, some animations could be a tad better, but they're mostly 99% good most of the time.\n-An interesting gimmick of stress and the psychological horrors that adventuring could have.\n-Unique quirks system making every hero feel slightly different.\n-Interesting classes, all with unique dialogue.\n-Pretty simple game to grasp.\n-More game options to get rid of... unwanted gameplay aspects.\n-Super easy to mod, the devs even encourage modding (In case anyone wants to know, just make a comment in the review asking how, and I will be glad to share on how to mod the game).\n-Death's door to prevent complete and utter insta-kills/give a fighting chance.\n-Wayne June does an AMAZING job as the ancestor. Honestly, I would say it's the best thing about this game.\nCons:\n-The gimmick of stress is just one huge annoyance, the chances of actually getting into 100+ is by doing a dark run or getting gimmicked by stress attacks.\n-Heart attacks, 1. Stress takes many years to actually start having health issues, you don't have a heart attack instantly. 2. If you get hit by it once, you now go to insta-death's door, a second time? Bye bye, hero.\n-Quirk system, most are just annoyances that, once again, are just gimmicks.\n-Disease system, most are, again, annoyances, however, it needs more balancing (i.e. hero gets Black Plague, throw hero away or cure it because they literally can't help now. Hero get rabies, leave it, it's more of a buff than anything. Hero gets Griping in the Guts, annoying, but it's easy to get around.)\n-Afflictions and virtue chances, virtue chances are so low, I think it might be possible for someone to have 100+ hours into the game and never get a virtue. Afflictions are major gimmicks, reducing nearly every stat for the hero and making them do random things. You can generally keep going with an affliction, but if the player has more than about 2 rooms, you will have to cut off the run short, only to do... nothing.\n-Above, why does it do nothing? It's mainly a farm and grind game, any gold you need can easily be obtained just by slamming heroes into dungeons, with or without supplies. The upgrades to the town make it to were you need less gold. Everything is an infinite amount of gold and heirlooms.\n-Because everything is an infinite supply, including heroes, it makes it more smart to upgrade your town first rather than try and play normally.\n-Heroes are on infinite supply, no matter what, this game will never truly be hard if there's no true way to "lose" since gold and heirlooms can be farmed. If you lost all heroes without upgrading the stagecoach, what happens? 4 fresh heroes right there.\n-Champion dungeons become a long, slow, tedious grind to the boss. It also requires some serious number crunching and near perfect min max team comp, leaving barely any room for expirements.\n-...The only way you can figure out this game is legitimately rolling low numbers on purpose is modding. How? Perfect example, as a joke, I made the Jester (funny stats for a funny character) do 0-9999 damage with a modifier of 100+% damage increase... he would constantly hit from 2000-4000. You start off with 67% of a death resist, I even increased it to about a 75%... they still have a good chance of dying from 1 hit.\n-The numbers ROUND DOWN. A double edged blade, to an extent, since it also applies to the enemies. Need an example? A vestal can heal for 7-8. Adding a trinket that gives a 33% heal buff, lowest heal she can get is 9 (9.31, to be precise). Highest would be 10 (10.64, precisely). Instead of rounding up when it hits a .5 and above, it rounds down. This effects the player mostly though because even if they still get rounded down, the enemies can outdamage any negative things that happen.\n-Class balance is fine for the most part, except the classes that outperform the others, outperform them HEAVILY. A vestal can NEVER outheal any damage, only prolong them from death. An occultist? He can not only have the best debuff in the game, but outheal the damage to a character. Hellions? Best meleer in the game. Why? She's the only class in the game that can hit ranks 2-3 while in rank 1-3 and 4 in rank 1. Lepers cry because once they get pushed to rank 3, they literally can't do anything worthwhile. When they're in ranks 1-2? They can only hit enemy ranks 1-2. Does he have the damage to make up for it? For a normal class? Sorta. Hellion though? She's barely a few points off of leper damage except she can add a bleed DoT.\n-DoTs... bleed is pretty much the only good DoT. Blight upon hit does 0 damage and at max rank does a DoT of a whopping... 7. Yay. A hellion could basically hit for that along with a bleed that does about 3 damage. I don't understand Red Hook's obsession with blight doing no damage.\n-However, you need some DoTs because of prot and champion dungeons. With all these recent patches, they added prot which was a means of prolonging the fight to make it "harder" meaning use some more DoTs just for them. Also, there is no possible way you can get up to the jacked prot the enemies have. The best you will get will probably be 15%, using both trinket slots.\n-These devs constantly buff enemies while nerfing heroes. Matter of fact, the entire every team is viable has been bogus since the release of the game and has only be stomped more into the ground with these stupid nerfs.\n-Final level is filled with nothing but stress gimmicks and enemies that tank (granted, they can do a lot of damage, esp. with crits + DoTs) that wants you to min max a team.\n-There's a slight more, but I won't touch on them except... the crazy, annoying doomsayer. ♥♥♥♥ him. I hope they remove him. His yelling sounds like some bad, cheesey, low budget porno that doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense.\nTL;DR version: The game is good if you're gonna play a small amount and then move on. If you plan to spend a lot of hours in it, pass or wait for about a... 75% sale, at least............. Also ♥♥♥♥ the doomsayer, ♥♥♥♥ing remove him already.\n\nSide note: Before I get ♥♥♥♥ stormed by I'm bad, casual, not helpfuls, etc. I have played enough "hard" games and even relatively obscure games, Dark Souls (not really obscure, but "hard, but fair" which a I call bull and beaten it), Legend of Grimrock 1&2, Pillars of Eternity, a few Ys games, and more. I can say, this game would be good for a mobile, up until champions, which can take up to an hour from the tankiness of enemies. I am very far from bad, casual, etc., it's just the way the game plays, it's just meat grind simulator till you can use heroes leveled etc. (specific heroes too) and then it becomes 95% of the time, the house wins game. Huge time sink to even START in the higher level dungeons. Honestly, veteran is the most fun that can be had, and that was ruined by the crit focus every battle.\n\nSide Side Note: I have feeling the people upvoting this generally agree with what I have to say, but if you have read this far, please tell others to not just mindlessly upvote bad and/or good reviews. It doesn't help anyone, and it can possibly even mix opinions and facts. For example, if one says x game is bad because it requires too much number crunching whereas another one says x game is bad because it seems like the devs wanted you to be a 2 year old to play, then... yeah, kinda hard to truly tell where opinions and facts start and end. So, please try to spread the word of don't upvote/downvote till you know where this review is coming from. Also, don't upvote memes and joke reviews, it, once again, hurts to see where facts and opinions mix. Just... vote funny and move on.","December 27, 2015","false","61.3"," 217 of 357 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","217","357","14","38"

As a resuly I have I have become very attached to this game and honestly want to see it so well. So, bad stuff first.\n\nYeah so my squad just got critted a whole bunch of times, went mad and refused heals and I missed 5 escape attempts.  They all died, leaving me with no gold and no future prospects other than using some scrubs from the wagon to get some gold, and up until week 40 I only had 6 deaths. Now it's 13, their blood is on my hands and I'm slowly accumulating a pile of dead lepers and doctors.  Honestly I really love this game, but it makes me sad that a careful style of play is not rewarded (enough) and you just end up treading water to recover failed missions. At it worst it feels like playing a freemium game, but thankfully never for long. I feel like what the dev was going for was to balance your need to go forward against the personal needs of your heroes, and that's great, but I feel like it requires some balance in areas. It skirts the line between unfair and unforgiving and don't get me wrong, that makes for some exhilerating gameplay, but some fail safes on the side of the unfair would be much appreciated for those of us who would like to move forward with the least amount of bloodshed possible.  As an aside, both the conflicting quirks and the removal of incorrect quirks from the abbey were areas where the game could be unforgiving and have it not be a big deal, and they made sense flavour wise( why would medieval medicine be so much more effective than modern medicine and having only one stress outlet is unhealthy respectively).  I think they were removed or tuned down recently and I would be against outright removal.  However an upside chance alongside the downside chance would be nice, especially in regard to removal of quirks.  I realise this is more feedback than review but sure feck it I'm here anyway.\n\nThat being said, this game is amazing.  The mechanics, tone, atmosphere, voice acting. music, narration, art direction, stability(1 crash on day one, none since) and balance ( mostly!) all emerged fully formed from the developers tepid mind-womb.Also , I talk like that now so that's nice.\n\n9/10 for full release, 11/10 for early access.  Also those of you who are waiting for it to be on sale or waiting for the full release, or both, I wouldn't expect a sale in the next year since the early access period is 6 months.  However, I think if you Nomad level kickstart it for 15 bucks, you get it on release.  Not sure if you can still do that, but you used to be able to. You will not get early access.","February 8, 2015","true","48.3"," 56 of 82 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","56","82","8","0"

Some of the negative reviews have said that this game has an unfair difficulty system, that you will randomly be matched up against enemies that are simply impossible to beat for the level that you are at, and this was the only thing intially holding me back from getting it. This isn't true, the enemies are tough but it is also fair, I am yet to lose a character and I feel that if I ever do it will be down to my own mistakes.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who love roguelike games, RPGs, Lovecraftian fiction and horror as this game uses all those elements beautifully. The game looks fantastic with an incredible art style, plays beautifully with a well structured and balanced combat system, and has an awesome narration voice that adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nGet this game, you won't regret it!\n\n\n\nUpdate @ 12 hours in:\n\nI've now lost 3 important characters and each loss has been emotionally devastating. Each was lost due to my poor tactical choices and greed for more loot and pushing to finish the dungeon when I knew it was taking a massive risk.","July 5, 2015","true","31.1"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","52","76","3","8"

Every dungeons, classes, buildings gave me a great feeling of "God there's so much different things to do and try", and the first ten hours (because I like to take my time) were the funniest hours I've spent on a game since a few years.\nEvery characters (or class) feel unique, they all have their quality and flaws, they have damage or debuff or DoT or even heal/protect skills, they have some kind of specialities (like multi-targeting or crit or DoT...) and even some great art. Every building have a good impact on the game and makes you feel "doing what you are doing for a reason".\nThere's also Torch management, Inventory and objects management (as some object can be really usefull on fights), stress management, etc... I mean there's a lot of great thought features that will make you be really, REALLY happy at the beginning.\n\nYeah everything was fine, fun, balanced, and so much more, until I reached the level 5 part of the game (The maximum level is 6 by the way).\n\nThen monsters began to be completely unfair, most of them are going from 10HP 0% Protection, 10 dodge and 6-10 damage, to 26-50HP, 35% Protection 36 Dodge, and a ridiculous increase of damage (some hits for 30 crit even with 25% damage reduction, no jokes). You might think it's fair if you didn't buy the game yet because you can upgrade your heroes, but the main problem comes from the fact that if you upgrade TO MAXIMUM your characters, overall they'll win 5 damage/10 accuracy (depends of the class though), 10-20HP and 10 dodge, and they still have a completely unbalanced factor of damage/heal (like going from 5-8 damage to 7-14). What that means for real is that THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. Melee characters can't hit anymore and will miss 40% of their attacks even with a huge accuracy boost, ranged character will deal the same amount of damage to opponent than they previously were on level 1 because of the insane protection boost on monsters and will even miss 1/3 of their attacks, heals will go from 4-6 to 6-10 even fully upgraded which CAN'T follow the damage upgrade of your ennemies. You feel like being completely torn apart every fight, and struggle to make your characters survive even for a single turn. The stress management becomes impossible to handle, as on 100 stress most of your characters will begin to pass their turn, wound themselves, disagree to get healed or use the wrong skill, and you have to surrender most of the dungeons after 4 rooms because even 1 firecamp break wasn't enough to make them feel better, if you didn't lose someone already.\n\nSome classes will survive and "do" some things, but 60% of the other class (there's 15 on the game) will struggle so much that it's just impossible to use them. You'll have to spend half the gold you made to treat some disease that are impossible to avoid, to treat their stress as even if you are the best coach in the world, it's impossible not to reach the 100 bars on at least 3 of your heroes (and skills that reduce stress are mostly useless btw) which gives the game a more frustrating than hard feeling.\n\nAfter 40 hours of gameplay, I never tried the level 6 dungeon of the game and the only level 5 dungeons I made were short ones. There's a terrible grinding of gold to do because of how much you'll need to spend after every dungeon (but when you think afterwards, it's the most fun part of the game because you'll farm gold on level 1 balanced dungeons with funny/original strats or composition !).\n\nI first thought that I was just bad, or making bad decisions, but after trying so much builds, classes, and reading a lot of people reviews, it's just sad to say, but the game is NOT FUN AT ALL on the endgame.\nLosing character is a point of the game (as the developpers said), but if you lose them because it's really hard, or you took a critical strike, or your heal get stunned on the wrong turn, it's pretty funny actually, it happens, it's a part of the Roleplay, etc..., you'll have to be more careful or change your trinkets to decrease the odds of death happening next time. But here, it's just completely luck based, and you feel like you got absolutely no chances of winning and all the odds are AGAINST you. The only hope you have is if your character land the CRITICAL HIT OF HIS LIFE that you needed, which means that 1/18 of the time it'll be an okay fight only because of luck, none of your management has a real impact.\n\nIf I can add one last thing, is that your characters have positions, which basicly allows them to use some different skills. Great feature I have to say, but what I find unfortunate is that this positionning has impact on YOUR HEROES ONLY, it's changes nothing for the opponent, they do whatever they want to whoever they want. It would be even more fun if your positions changed the amont of dodge, or damage you take, of even damage you deal or accuracy I don't know, which could make "tank" be a real thing, or healer be less vulnerable. It would actually give a certain amount of strategy and credit to the combination of heroes you try to make.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I got no regrets for buying this game, and it is still terribly fun on the early part, but there's a huge difference (as everybody said) between "The games involves dying because it is hard" and pure frustration, pure madness, pure luck. To make a comparison, when you play Roulette, you choose the amount and the numbers you bet on. Here, it's like watching the bet table, only allowed to bet all your money on a single number, as you are not even changing your odds of winning, dying, or whatever, every time you enter a level 5+ dungeon or equipping different trinkets.\n\nI still have to give a huge shout out to the developpers, who did overall an absolutely beautiful and enjoyable game, one that we were waiting for a long time, one that is beating most of the other games out there and even big studios ones. But I hope that the future updates will give a brighter future to the game (and that unfair points will change to hard points), as more and more players are reviewing this game badly because of the sames problems over and over again.\n\nEDIT : For all those who says "You need to watch a playthrough on internet etc..." well if the point of the game is to take the same characters as an internet guy and do the exact same thing (because other things don't work as intended), it breaks COMPLETELY all the DnD, discover by yourself, experiment, point of the game, which is to me the best point of all. I took the Vestal for healing because it is more constant even if it heals less than the occulist, but everybody told to me "Naah don't take the vestal, just take the occulist", then what is the point of the game if it's just to play like hearthstone and brainlesly taking other's people decks ?

On the flipside, you can play like absolute garbage and have nobody in your party die ever because whether or not a character lives or dies when they're at 0hp is purely down to chance.\n\nI get that the design is supposed to force the player to make the best of a bad situation, and I can get behind that, but at this stage (As of today, "This stage" is the game as the devs invisioned it on release. There's no hope for change.) there are too many design decisions that force the outcome out of the player's hands. This is probably because the part of the game that is actually up to the player is so easy - if you've got at least a few braincells rubbing together, it doesn't take long to figure out how to play it optimally. So, rather than address that, the developers have decided to make it randomly kick you in the nuts every few minutes. This doesn't make it deep or challenging, just frustrating.\n\nThe golden moments where the game achieves what it sets out to do with it's chaos management mechanics are few and far between, and most RNG punishment tends to go around instantly eliminating one of your heroes. Rather than requiring you to adapt your strategy because of the loss of a character, you're able to just go back to a level 1 dungeon and start over because all it takes to replace a dead hero is to grind a few levels. It doesn't add any extra challenge, it just forces you to grind more.\n\nIt fits into the new-wave "Hardcore" trend following Dark Souls, where being "Hardcore" comes more from marketing and player perspective than actually being a difficult game and, as a result, that's the philosophy that drives the worst elements of it's design. What's more, players who picked up the game based on this marketing are willing to defend these elements to the death, because if the public perception were to change to see the mechanics *the way they are* without the "omg so hardcore" veneer, that would invalidate the hardcore gamer cred they feel they've earned by suffering through the game's grind. If you're feeling "Called out" at this point, that's great, because I think you're a tool.\n\nArt, storytelling and atmosphere are A+, and I'm going to come back to it just for that when the last of the content is added, but the game itself is a grind facilitated by RNG that shouldn't pose any actual challenge to anyone with a reasonable knowledge of CRPG mechanics.","January 5","false","28.6"," 104 of 167 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","104","167","11","1"

Early mechanics are fun, the art is amazing and the difficulty is certainly there.\n\nHowever, as soon as one hits the mid-game, difficulty turns into annoyance with ridiculously unbalanced stress on Veteran and higher quests. I didn't feel challenged as much as bullied by the game, ruthlessly telling me that anything besides pure damage is useless, unless I enjoy seeing heroes die of heart attack. For a game that relies on random numbers for power, using cheap tactics like this or monster corpses only make the game more tedious and boring, not requiring of skill.\n\nGiven Red Hook seems pretty bent on messing up the game with their patches and that any critic on the official forums is met with anger and insult, I see no reason to think these problems will be addressed soon.

Which seems to be a trend with this studio - they come up with game mechanics to fix problems, real or imagined, but never actually think whether those would be fun or fit the lore (not to mention being logical), which in the end brings more of a repetitious tedium than anything else without fixing much, if anything. Even worse - some of those new game mechanics introduce new problems which get "fixed" in the same fashion... All of that resulted in an illogical, frustrating and very much grindy experience. The truly spot-on art style, music and narrator could no longer offset the tedium and as such the game simply became un-fun. To the point where this happened:\n\nhttp://www.thejimquisition.com/darkest-dungeon-and-the-perils-of-early-access/\n\nas a result of which Jim Sterling, as a Steam curator, eventually decided to take down his own Early Access recommendation for this game...\n\n(On a related note this is a relevant read as well)\n\nThe devs’ desire to make the game hard(er) for the sake of it (and there is only one difficulty setting with no plans for adding more) thus meant that for example higher-tier maggots in dungeons had more armor than even your best armored crusaders in one of the previous patches. Maggots! Why? Because this is how this studio decided to increase the game difficulty - where each maggot was basically like a terminator sent back from the future to end your line. They introduced more randomness for the sake of randomness, grinding for the sake of "prolonging" the content, and introduced an overall, fake, difficulty increase (clad in the impenetrable armor of tedium) because according to the devs this is supposedly a roguelike game (which it really isn't - this is basically XCOM with Ironman permanently ON but with Cthulhu monsters instead of aliens and a lot more illogical randomness). It has randomly generated (and very generic) dungeon layouts, hero permadeath and a single automatic save – and that’s it. It has no fail state. You literally cannot lose. According to this it also never will. It will have even more grinding though. A lot more - once the last, fifth endgame dungeon is implemented it will require you to finish multiple missions, as it were, in it, only unlike the other four dungeons it would not allow you to retreat in case things get hairy. Which means that if your heroes fail their mission they will perish trying - which is perfectly fine. Problem is - in case your heroes are victorious they will get a perk preventing them from doing more missions in the endgame dungeon effectively forcing you to grind more heroes from level 0 (no, you cannot hire higher level heroes) in the other four dungeons as to attempt to finish the game. Basically you have to grind one full party of heroes per endgame mission and that is assuming you finish them all at first attempt. Yeah...\n\nDespite the game being in Early Access and the devs constantly proclaiming that they appreciate and value player feedback such game altering changes are NEVER put out for public testing prior to release, even if Steam allows beta patches to be installed by those who want to do so and test such changes before they make it into the live build. Such changes are also never discussed or even listed (anywhere) prior to coming to the live build. It is literally expected that people would simply take them for what they are, like them and praise the devs for their hard work. “Communication” with these devs is strictly a one-way street and takes the form of their patch notes. Criticism was simply ignored in the past. Now it is actively censored with people often getting banned and their whole post history outright deleted.\n\nAll of this has had its effect. According to this[steamspy.com] the game sold more than 400 000 copies on Steam so far. But according to this[steamcharts.com] between sales and major patches on average 700-800 people play it. Which put into perspective means that only 0.2% of the owners of this game actively play it for what it is. The other 99.8% do not, and as of writing this the numbers are still falling...\n\nIn its current state, as an Early Access title, I really cannot recommend this game. As a matter of fact I'd advise you to stay away from it. The developers do not seem to have a clear-cut vision of what their game is to be, seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun) and since they neither ask for nor heed any player feedback there doesn't seem to be much hope of them getting this right by the time it is officially released, which as of writing this is 3 months or so away.\n\nAs a conclusion I'd like to add that this is not my first Early Access game. Nor is it the most expensive.  Some of my other Early Access games have been basically completely abandoned by their devs and never got finished as such.  But despite all that Darkest Dungeon is the Early Access game that managed to convince me, once and for all, to never, ever, buy into Early Access games again.","October 30, 2015","false","17.2"," 194 of 324 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","194","324","15","10"

I played through the game and it was a blast.\nSecond time I played through after Men at arms and arbralest were introduced, 2 patches before the cove i guess.\n\nSo right before the release i started my thrid playthrough to be right at the darkest dungeon as soon as it is released.\nI am shocked. This is not the same game anymore. I used to be pretty RNG heavy throughout the entire early access phase but RNG was always less important than your decision making. Thats occours to be over now and Redhook failed in a very important aspect.\n\nIf you try to be hard but rewarding do it like the Dark Souls/Demon Souls/Bloodborne series and be FAIR and dont just try to artificaly incease the difficulty with stupid RNG and bad gimmicks wich represent the awful way of "quick and dirty" solutions instead of well thoughtout gameplay as it was in the beginning of the early access period.\n\nI am disappointed. Darkest Dungeon used to be my holy grail of the way early access games should be... to bad.\n\nIf any Redhook Dev reads this here is the hint of your lifetime:\nReddit is loud, but doesnt represent your community/customers/fans by any means. Its only a small portion. Make the game as YOU (!) want it, not as some random person on the internet thinks it should be. And if you want to satisfy all the redditors include a difficulty system like Bastion.\n\nLong text in short: If i wouldnt have  experienced the good times in early early access i would use the refund option now.\n","December 27, 2015","false","127.1"," 126 of 206 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","126","206","10","1"

I absolutely adore the camping mechanic in this game. It just oozes personality. Easily my favourite part of the game. In fact, there is a huge amount of tension in trying to keep your party members alive and sane. The stress mechanic is brilliant and adds a lot to the feeling of the game.\n\nThe Strategic Gameplay\n\nThe problems with darkest dungeon isn't that its a roguelike with crushing RNG; its the same with the other games of the same genre. The problem is that its is a very grindable rougelike.\n\nTo make sure your heros have the best equipment and ability available, you will have to upgrade your town with heirlooms. To upgrade your town, you have to find heirlooms in dungeons. To get heirlooms without jeopordizing your best characters, you'll run low level dungeons, repeatedly.\n\nThere is no check to this. In fact the game encourages you to do this with the tiered dungeon system. Your hero too high level? Well then it can't participate in lower level dungeons, you get this new harder dungeon! Don't have other heroes of the same level, well then you are either going to go into that dungeon disadvantaged (and lose hours of work when they die) or going to have to grind other heroes up before you can use the high level one.\n\nBecause of this, the tension of the early game completely evaporates when you get to middle and late game. There is absolutely no incentive to push for higher level dungeons until you are completely geared due to perma death and the amount of time needed to reach that point. There is no timed mechanic like in XCOM or FTL that causes you to continue pushing forward.\n\nThe Tactical Gameplay\n\nA huge part of the tactical gameplay depends on party composition. Everyone fights in a line and your available attacks depends on where you are at in the line. I find myself thinking about optimal party lineups well until the end of the game, so well done there.\n\nDungeon Crawling\n\nVery uninspired. You move around in rooms and encounter monsters. You can find curios around which spices things up at the begining until you figure how they work. Traps basically just does damage to you.\n\nRecommendation\n\nOnly get if you want to support to support the developers in making this game. I see a lot of potential for this game, but at the moment, the game is just not all there.","March 8, 2015","false","90.8"," 91 of 146 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","91","146","5","3"

While the latter two remain intact, it's the former that has suffered greatly. The game's recent patching has made it boring and frustrating to play. Enemies have always been unfairly strong, and have always had more and better actions than you, it was how you strategized around this and managed your resources that helped you overcome this. However, each patch has ruined this rewarding of smart thinking more and more. The developers are far too dead set on punishing players for finding loopholes or gimmicks, and the game has become no fun. Unless you run with an online guide with the optimal party and make sure everything is perfect. You will lose, and even if you do all that, the odds are you will still lose. I cannot put into words how frustrating it is to have a boss heal back 20 health in a turn, hit your party for 40 damage, then heal for another 15, then one of your members goes, and he instantly repeats his 3 turn process. It's a joke to call this game "Strategy" anymore. It's luck, it's a pure slot machine that I honestly don't want any part of anymore. The new class was interesting and I played around with him, enjoying the man beast concept. But then I was sucked back out of the game when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG decided that he would be crit, given a disease and 4, count em, 4 different disorders from 3 consecutive attacks. The game is dumb, it doesn't even make any sense. Why does the trader provide less goods for shorter trips? Wouldn't a trader sell as much as he could to make more money? Why can't you stall a fight to heal? It already doesn't make sense you can't heal out of combat, or camp more than the allotted times. The player punishing is just dumb and incessant, and I know it won't stop so I'll be dropping this game. What was once and fun and interesting game to play when I had nothing else to do has become a boring chore that annoys me and sets me back hours regardless of how well I know the game and it's systems. Don't Buy It. Do yourself a favor, try Xcom, it has similiar BS Rng but it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you nearly as hard. Also, the developers of that game don't punish players for finding strategies that work.","December 15, 2015","false","40.8"," 232 of 392 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","232","392","13","0"

A tragedy in many parts.\nDarkest Dungeon was very nearly one of the big wins from Kickstarter alongside Divinity Original Sin, and Wasteland 2 (though opinions do remain a bit divided on that one from time to time). How best to describe it? It's basically the grown up version of Warhammer Quest, except it's the grown up version *done right*. This is probably as close as you'll likely get to a pen and paper roleplaying experience on your computer without actually rolling the dice yourself.\n\nThe game follows two distinct beats, the first takes place in your hamlet, known simply as the estate - insert the name of your save file between 'the' and 'estate', this leads to all kinds of possible creative humour if you stop to consider the implications, for people over here in Britain, the obvious choices such as "The Darkest Leeds Council estate" are going to be too easy to pass up - the estate serves as your hub to manage your roster of adventurers, and it will be a roster, a sizable bunch of misfits drawn from a wide class pool, easily as diverse as you could possibly wish for, and all of them have a slightly grim twist upon their usual fantasy tropes upon which they are based.\n\nA grim tale with a bloody end, for everyone involved...\nFor example, in normal roleplay games, one would ordinarily expect the adventuring party to be made up of the holy trinity, that is to say - tanking, damage and healing. Those tenets are more or less followed here within reason, two of the classes offer up healing options in the guise of the Vestal, a priestess who is decked out in more metal than robocop, and the occultist, who can mend with dark powers whilst raining down curses upon his foes. Tanks include a crusader, possibly the only unambiguously "good" moral choice in the bunch, and even he can be easily brought down from grace if you send him to the brothel (yes, there's a brothel, and yes, you can get people -banned- from it for "deviant tastes"), and a leper, a hulking brute of a tank who wears a mask reminiscent of the guy from V for Vendetta.\n\nAll of the classes have their own unique twist on the usual trope, and their own backstory, a reason for visiting this utterly forsaken place, and as a result you'll likely get attatched to your favourite classes and heroes, all of whom you can name and provide trinkets to adjust their stats a touch here and there. Gear can be upgraded, naturally (though as of the current build, there doesn't seem to be a visual reflection of upgrades, which is a bit saddening, though the art style more than makes up for it), and additional skills can be bought and then shuffled around from the guild hall. Each character gets seven skills, but you can only take four into battle, and some skills are usable only from specific places and only UPON specific targets in the opponents position order, so choose carefully and ensure you have a good spread.\n\nVenturing down into the depths...\nOnce you've settled upon your choice of party, skills and core kit, you then move to the provisioning stage, where you select the mission you wish to take on, you then buy up any consumables you wish to take with you for the mission ahead and then deploy, and the game proper begins. You move about between rooms on a map, following "corridors" made up of little mapsquares that can contain encounters, loot and other interesting things, the rooms too can contain multiple items and enemy groups, and over time, fighting can build up stress in the group, and as wounds pile up and the group gets taxed, so too does their minds.\n\nThat's when the stress mechanic begins to take it's toll, eventually as the minds of the adventurers begin to fracture, you'll find they get more... talkative, and less co-operative. Sometimes they'll act on their own, sometimes they'll pass their turn, sometimes they'll refuse healing. It adds a random factor into proceedings that can make the difference between life and death, and combined with the death's door mechanic, can create some genuinely tense and hair raising fights.\n\nIn this game, death is permanent, and boy will you go through adventurers, even getting one to level -3- is considered a feat in itself, most will die before they even see level 2 or even level 1, and the graveyard will likely be full to bursting within a few months. This is not a game to play if you are expecting to develop long lasting relationships with a lot of heroes, you may get to preserve a select few over time, but most will be as moths to the flame. Thankfully the cart comes weekly, loaded with fresh meat for the grinder, and recruitment is free, so that's nice!\n\nThe glory of good design and sound...\nThe art style is -glorious-, and the sound and overall design back this up, creating a genuine Tabletop RPG feel that perhaps could only be provided for by a computer, though if there ever was a proper pen and paper version of this game created, I could imagine as a first edition, it'd sell amazingly well. It has all the ingredients for a fantastic atmosphere, and a great evening in, much like a great night with Dungeons and Dragons. The cherry on the cake is the narrator, who lends a thick, grim air to proceedings, and even when things go well, seems to live to take what little hope you have, and smother it in a layer of soot and grime.\n\nDid I say this game is grim and contained adult themes? Oh it does. Much flagellation and deviancy await, along with unspeakable horrors that will cause many an adventurer's mind to turn in on itself.\n\nThere is a but...\n\nIt very, very nearly got the "Essential" badge, but then I got to the end...\nThe endgame however, pulls the most mighty of penile moves. A hardcoded debuff called "Never again" applies a ban to heroes that enter the Darkest Dungeon, preventing them from returning. This forcibly extends the playtime of the game by forcing you to grind out a minimum of four complete teams, depending on how your parties have evolved, this may take you significantly longer than you expect.\n\nThere's very little reason for this other than to pad out the game and to prevent you from blasting the Dungeon with your "A-team", but nonetheless, here we are. A lot of needless grind put into the game simply to stop you from finishing the game when the time is right.\n\nThis turns the game from being fun, to being frustrating. All the work you do up to the Darkest Dungeon gets thrown in your face and you wind up staring down the barrels of long trudge after long trudge. A ceaseless grind that simply exists to make you stick your face in the dirt.\n\nI'm sorry, but that's no longer "fun". As it stands, it's not fixable either by users. I looked.\n\nFor this very reason, this game loses it's positive Early Access rating from me, and gains a negative rating, with a final verdict that's much less positive in it's standing.\n\nTo be clear - "Never Again" is the core problem - It's hardcoded - It cannot be modded out, it bans characters from the Darkest Dungeon, meaning you CANNOT re-use them in the Darkest Dungeon again, period. If they complete a Darkest Dungeon map, they become unusable, if they fail, they die. Either way, they're scrapped. That's the issue at hand here. Make sure you are entirely informed of this issue before commenting.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist, and pick up on sale, worth considering if you're a fan of -hard- RPG games.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

The atmosphere of Darkest Dungeon is simply amazing.\n+The characters the player can recruit are all different and have fun quips and personalities.\n+Addictive dungeon crawling that will make you go for "just one more quest."\n+The UI is elegant and superbly done.\n+The devs have added options to remove/toggle corpses, nerf enemy crits and more small tweaks.\n+Certain heroes now bring items with them when embarking, for example the crusader will bring holy water.\n\nThe bad:\n-The difficulty isn't a curve, but a wall, a wall that has been known to be hit even in the tutorial. The game wants to be hard and that's a fine selling point. However, this is not elegant design like Dark Souls, but rather by arbitrarily stacking the odds against you.\n\n-You have to juggle gold, experience points and resources for buildings in order to progress, which is fine in theory, but gold will quickly become the least of your worries as you grind away at resources and while doing that you have to avoid overleveling heroes as this makes it impossible for them to participate in missions they will then deem to easy, yes you read that right, your heroes will actually go against your orders.\n\n-With a huge variety in heroes imbalance is sure to arise, but the issue is how obvious it is. For example, the plague doctor has been one of the weakest hero types throughout this entire Early Access, and they still are because they simply can't match the healing of the Vestal or the damage of the Arbalist.\n\n-Most trinkets are useless. Almost all of them come with one or two bonuses, but also one or two negatives. A select few artifacts only have bonuses, but they usually aren't too great and they are hard to find.\n\n-The quirk system is currently stacked against the player, just like everything else. Negative quirks can fester and become extremely expensive to get rid off. Positive quirks don't have this option, so sometimes after leveling you'll lose valuable quirks because your hero leveled up. Furthermore, diseases are now their own seperate thing, but they don't disappear over time and have to be removed as well, once again, it's just tedium for tedium's sake, because now you have to spend even longer on grinding them away too.\n\n-Red Hook has so far with every update and without fail nerfed heroes and strategies into oblivion, which is fine, afterall the game should be balanced. However, they have crossed the line where it has now become mandatory to use a walkthrough on how to min-max. Gone are the days where 4 jesters could enter a dungeon and while they wouldn't be a great team they could pull through.\n\n-After nearly 50 hours it has become clear to me that one of the biggest issues is the pacing. Upgrading your town takes way too many resources and you never gain the ability to hire heroes higher than level 0. You never truly lose, you're just doing the same thing over and over, always making the same heroes and dismissing them after they become too expensive to make viable.\n\nBottom line:\nDarkest Dungeon has so much potential and back when I first bought it I was absolutely hooked by the atmosphere and surface gameply, but once you get deeper you realize just how poor the execution truly is. One misstep feels like it can ruin your entire game; forcing you to start over.\n\nThe game still has immense potential, but the goal of making a hard game has grown and taken over the core design and it's killing the experience. I vehemently hope that I can change this to a recommendation once the next promised update hits.","January 2","false","50.4"," 172 of 288 people (60%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","60","172","288","11","6"

RNG based combat is fine, RNG-based combat where a single enemy ability can cripple you in one turn for the rest of the dungeon, is not fine. Combat is no longer about choosing the right thing to hit first, it's praying the enemy party doesn't use a stress attack and crit first, which of course, is completely RNG-based. Devs believe that unfair advantages for the monsters is the same as making the game challenging, when all they are doing is putting off people who actually enjoyed the game. Unlike what many people who don't understand how game difficulty works, you cannot "git gud" at a game where everything is completely reliant on luck. I've been following Darkest Dungeon since it first went into Early Access, and with every update my faith in the devs in making a fun, yet challenging game is eroded.

Now u can almost only get negative stats on your heroes. Was fun before, cant recommend it any longer, havent played it after the Devs ruined the game.\n\nDetails:\n\nFirst it was a real fun game, where you had to grind your way through with stressed out, ill and kleptomanic heroes. Even the the items you got always had a negative impact as well. So it really took time to somehow protect your most beloved hereos through the dungeons and get family heirlooms now and then to finally upgrade your buildings.\n\nSlowly but steadily you would get one or two heroes to the next level without them having 10 different negative effects at once, making them unplayable. Then you finally upgraded the armory and you would spend hours to get enough money to get your top group of heroes new weapons.\n\nCombine this with completely different hero classes that all have their unique purposes and u had a hell of a fun game. At least for me as a RPG fan by heart.\n\nNow, what changed: First, they limited the positive quirks each and every hero can have to 5, which means, that from my best heroes 70% of their positive stats just vanished. It really takes time to build a strong hero in the game and the quirks are the only way to improve them once they got a top weapon and armor. So now it just doesn't make fun anymore playing your best heroes, because you will hit the top ceiling and that's it.\n\nMoreover they didn't limit the negative quirks. While u can't make your heroes better, they will become worse and worse if you don't pay hefty gold for it.\n\nAnd finally they installed a corpse system which makes absolutely zero sense at all. A 8 HP monster  leaves a 15hp corpse behind (WTF?!) which just blocks your way from attacking the other monsters (which still can attack you) and just prolongs fights for no reason.\n\nGiven the fact that you can't boost your hereos anymore and regarding the dragging fights with the corpses I can't recommend the game anymore.\n\n\nEdit: The negative quirks are limited to 5 now. Still, no more fun till the remove the limit of the positive ones again.","August 13, 2015","false","74.8"," 554 of 960 people (58%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","58","554","960","25","21"

The game is stunning not only visually but also in terms of atmosphere and audio design.  Production values are fantastic across the board.\n\nThe game play is solid, tactical, and unrelentingly difficult.  While a heavy dose of the game revolves around RNG, it never feels like the RNG is straight-up screwing you in quite the same way that XCOM does.  Even the most horrific of situations can often be salvaged with a lot of thought and a little luck.\n\nThis is not a game for the weak of heart.  The challenge level is high and the possibility of winding up in a state where you are basically doomed to failure is very real.  Forethought and planning are required in order to keep the dungeon-ball rolling safely.\n\nIf you have a taste for rogue-likes, an interest in the unique, and the idea of a 2D crossbreed of Dark Souls and XCOM sounds magical to you, then you may have just found your game.\n\nMay your torches be ever bright.

I recommend you wait till it's final release before purchasing!\n\nFull Review: First of all I would like to say that I helped back this game. I absolutely loved the concept and was on board the moment I saw the combat and art style. The soundtrack is done wonderfully by Stuart Chatwood of (Prince of Persia series) fame. The art design is foreboding and dark as it should be and the small touches of dialogue from the Nameless Estate Owner's deep voice evokes fear and tension in every battle and even in respite. This game has everything going for it....until you start playing more than two hours of the game.\n\nThe start of the game is difficult and the first dungeon teaches you a very powerful lesson. "In this dark abyss, only thorough forethought and careful execution will you allow yourself to survive". It's a shame then that the game has yet to fully take it's own advice. This game wants to be Dark Souls or FTL or the Binding of Issac so bad and I do too but here's the thing about those games. They may be incredibly difficult, but they are also phenomenally well designed and balanced which is why even in death you want to try again to do better, to play smarter. I can't tell you the amount of times I've spent playing FTL over and over again. Just one more turn, one more room then I'll go to bed. This isn't one of those games; not yet at least.\n\nLets start with the positives, the combat. The combat is fluid and deep and each battle keeps you on edge and each victory feels great. It's such a satisfactory feeling to kill two enemies at once and have the narrator praise your strike when you were at the brink and you turned the tide of battle. It is equally heartbreaking then when an enemy kills an ally you've grown accustomed to, and like your characters your resolve breaks at the sight. That's whats great about this game what's not great is when you attack five times miss five times and the enemy kills you in one hit despite massive upgrades. For all this game does right the balancing issues comeback and take it all away. The first apprentice levels gets you accustomed to the combat but the moment you level up and move on to the next greater challenge the game slams you back HARD and destroys the flow it had been building. Yes the game is supposed to be hard I get it (comes with being a rougelike game, you know no mercy) but the sometimes sporattic RNG isn't fine tuned enough to warent an honest death. The game advices you "sometimes its better to run from a fight", I agree. However when you abandon a quest your allies never receive experience for their effort so not only do you lose money for the supplies that you can't take back you are stuck with stress and nothing to show for it. Wanna an easier level to get back on your feet after a difficult dungeon? Too bad your too strong to go back and too weak to go forward.  They want you to grind for experience and get gold and get stronger to get more skills to be prepared for the next battle. But they punish you for playing it smart and retreating or if you want to do small tasks to make back the money. The game forces your stronger companions to fight more difficult battles alienating them from the rest of your party members. So if you want to get your strongest party to fight the upcoming boss too bad that guy didn't level with the rest of them breaking up the synergy.\n\nSpeaking of party members each class is unique, you have the Crusader, the Vessel, the Bounty hunter, the Occultist, etc.. The problem is that there are classes that are clearly better than others. Why would I bring a Grave robber when I have a Highwayman? She can randomly get an item when resting, whoopee! The Highwayman has a high dodge chance and can hit three enemies for higher damage, guess which one I'm taking? Each party member gets a good quirk and bad quirk. Some make the character more unique others are diseases that need to be cured. You can get rid of the bad ones for a price but only one. Problem is between all the upgrades, the stress relievers, and the upgrades of skills there is not enough money to do what you need to survive. You can't just take a week off play it smart and weigh your options. Your forced to keep going back in. You never can do what you want efficiently and you ask yourself why you couldn't do things differently.  Why couldn't you have an upgrade where you could take away two bad quirks for a slightly increased price instead wasting an adventurer? Why can't I carry more gold like maybe 2000 per slot instead of 1500 or make this less expensive? Why can't I customize the color of an adventurers look? I know I could lose an adventurer but by the fifth bounty hunter I stopped caring about their names or quirks.\n\nMost of the problems probably will be fixed by the time the game is finally released. Which is good but it needed to be said now. This game is still being fixed and balanced. That's why I wrote this review because I want this game to be great it clearly has the potential. I want it to be heralded as the indie Dark Souls or Resident Evil (1-4)  but it doesn't just get it handed to it because it has my money. It has to work at it like everyone else. I believe in Red Hook. It's a great team who clearly want to make a great game and I believe though that by the time it is finished I will be singing it's praises on release day. But for now I will be backing away into the dark night waiting for its foreseeable release.","February 3, 2015","false","11.2"," 404 of 698 people (58%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","58","404","698","37","14"

Lovercraft, Roguelikes, and difficult RPGs, I might be just a little bit biased when it comes to this title, but if you are a fan of any of those, (Or maybe even if you aren't) Darkest Dungeon might be worth a look.\n\nPros:\n+Good sound/art design\n+Difficult (With the option to toggle the more unforgiving features)\n+Good balance between permadeath and progress; losing characters is extremely painful, but expected\n\nCons:\n-Extremely unforgiving (Options exist to toggle some of these. Looking at you, Heart Attacks)\n-Gameplay is somewhat repetetive (But, that's a problem with the genre)\n-Gameplay flow forces you to have multiple parties, can't focus on just your favorite\n\nWith the overview out of the way, let's a get more indepth.\n\nGraphics/sound: 8/10\nSurprisingly enough, this game's art style and sound direction does a lot for it. The sense of gloom as your torch fizzles, and finally snuffs out, with an accoimpanied change in music drives home the tension and risk. The periodical quips from the narrator give the game a feel akin to a novel or short story, further deepening the illusion of playing a Cosmic Horror Story. It all blends together for a unique experience, fully immersed in gothic, Lovecraftian anxiety and despair.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nIf you're wondering why the gameplay is recieving a low score, it's not because it's not a fun game. On the contrary, battles are always tense, the difficulty is spot on, every run just beyond your characters level of ability, meaning greed or complacency can always cost you dearly. Battle system is smootyh and refined, and the mechanics reinforce the tension that is the core of the gameplay experience. My main complaint is the quirk/stress system. On one hand, it is a core mechanic that sets this game apart. After each dungeon run, your characters have a chance to develop  a positive trait, negative trait, or disease, which alters their stats, resistances, or what facilities they can use in town to lower their stress.\nOn the other hand, characters must sit out a battle to have their stress lowered, remove a quirk, or cure a disease, (There are a few exc eptions, but this is the genberal rule) resulting in a gameplay cycle of train team A, lower team A's stress, cure team A's diseases, train team A again. It makes sense mechanically, given the constant, expected flow of new members in your roster, but results in it taking 3 times as long to ready a tream for a boss fight. (And you had best be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ready because you WILL wipe if you aren't extremely well prepared.)\n\nTone/playability/immersion: 10/10\nAll things considered, the game has a lot going for it. It's difficult, but fair, it controls well, it has a strong tone and theme throughout, with the gameplay and mechanics reinforcing said themes. It's not just an RPG where you explore a mansion that is the sight of an Eldritch portal, it has the exact same feel as reading, say, The Dunwhich Horror. And wether you're looking for a game that will draw you in like many games can't, or simply a game that will test your tactical mettle against ever-increasingly difficult foes, Darkest Dungeon hits all the right notes, offering something truly interesting and memorable amidst a growing pool of games that draw on Lovecraft lore but miss the "feel" of his works entirely.","September 10, 2015","true","36.7"," 74 of 118 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","74","118","4","2"

I just want to express my conclusions on the game after beating it.\nIt's wonderful, really, especially if you love Lovecraft like I do. The overall aesthetic, the sound design, the narrative, everything looks great and polished. Combat feels very satisfying and has you literally scream in joy and terror in front of the screen. It's awesome. There's a ton of content too, it took me more than 70 hours to beat the game (it's also very possible to do it in a much shorter time, of course).\nBut this can be quite a stressful experience aswell, not just for your heroes but for you, the player. While I found most of the campaign to be very enjoyable, the endgame really killed most of my enthusiasm and almost got me to the point of giving up playing to just watch the ending on YouTube. This is because the game gets very grindy during the final quests: the Darkest Dungeon is a pretty rough place, and it will probably kill many of your heroes. And unless you send legendary heroes, your party will be dead long before it can explore the dungeon enough to give a clear notion of how the various mobs and bosses fight. And remember that there can be no retreat from that place without at least one dead hero.\nThe grinding aspect kicks in when you realize that you don't have the legendary heroes you need for a particular quest and that you have to train new ones up to level six in order to get a single chance to succeed. Even if you win a Darkest Dungeon quest, the survivors will permanently refuse to embark on the following ones, thus becoming useless.\nYet the game does actually provide you with some hints so that you can immediately guess which heroes you should bring in a particular quest in the Dungeon. (let's imagine that you are tasked with killing a boss, and that maybe the name of said boss can help you plan your party composition before you start the mission...)\nBut since I was too dumb to notice such hints, I finally decided to use a guide to beat the last missions of the game. I guess I'm just not that good with this kind of games, I can't come up with particularly good strategies in terms of party composition, so that my chances of victory often depend on RNG and luck. Plus, this is not Dark Souls or Super Meat Boy, you WILL be punished even though you don't deserve it. Many have criticized the importance of RNG in Darkest Dungeon, but it's a necessary element in a game that wants you to feel stressed whenever your heroes do.\nThat said, I did beat the game with default difficulty options: you can toggle off some mechanics in order to make your experience less frustrating if you feel you can't stand the overall difficulty of the game. You'll probably be labelled a "casual" from hardcore players and you won't be given a particular achievement when you beat the game, but who cares. Your heroes will go crazy during the adventure, make sure you don't. The fact that you are given an option to customize the overall difficulty of the experience is the main reason why I would recommend Darkest Dungeon to anyone, even those who are not familiar with the genre. It's probably still going to hit you hard even in "casual mode" but, as the game tells you, there can be no victory without madness.\n\nEDIT (12 March 2016): the Antiquarian Update solved most of the issues I had with the endgame. So most of what I said above about grinding should no longer be of concern.

But I'll do my best review it based on my own thoughts, rather than the opinions I have read elsewhere online. But I will delve into those later.\n\nI'm not the smartest guy. I'll be up front about that. I rarely go into games and know exactly what things that can be exploited, what must be done to make this or that easy, find loopholes or redundencies. I don't have the patience to go through each and every stat effect and percentage and chart it all out. Its just not something I have interest in or time to do. With this in mind, you can probably tell that I don't actually look into the RNG all that much.\n\nCritical hits are critical hits. Misses are misses. I never noticed if one side had an advantage over the other. I never noticed the effects that torches had on the battlefield cuz I always had one lit. I never noticed if one side got more buffs or had resistances or any of that. I just played the game how I thought it should be played.\n\nHere is where my biggest issue with the entirety of the game comes into play: the inability to play how you want.\n\nNow, I get it. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be difficult. its meant to put you into a corner, but its boot to your jaw and see how you can escape it. Here's a few things I don't like, however, about said difficulty - with personal examples from the game:\n\n-battle mechanics, on a defensive side. What do I mean by this? Well, once I was playing through a dungeon. I had a tough time with a wave, and wanted to go on the defensive for a bit, get some health back real quick before I proceeded to the next battle. So I kept an enemy in stunlock/debuff while I used my healer to get my fighters back into a better spot. With this one enemy left completely weak and vulnerable, it seemed like a viable strategy in order to get my footing back and continue strong. But NOPE. Literally two turns after trying this strategy, two enemies randomly come out of the woodwork. Because this game has to be SO HARD that it just throws more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you.\n\nWhat this said to me was this: no, player, you do not play how you want to play. You cannot use the strategies YOU want to use. You play by OUR rules. You go fast, and kill fast, and if your players die in the process, well TOO BAD.\n\nSome players may see this as just another part of the challenge, but I see this as a fundamental flaw: you are not allowed to play this game how you see fit. You are not allowed to go on the defensive, take advantage of a situation and play to your strenghts. You can ONLY play how the devs WANT you to play. And that, to me, isn't fun. It is frustrating. Its tedious. And it lead to me shutting off the game and not playing it ever again.\n\n-escaping battle. This is a shorter one, but still a grievance with the game I personally have. So, when you escape battle, you are given a consequence of stress. I saw this as a fair trade. If things are going badly, you have the choice to take the stress in order to fight another day.\n\nThis brilliant idea was ruined by the timeworn BS cliche of: not being able to escape. So not only do I have to accept the consequence of a massive stress boost when I actually manage to get out of battle, I have to risk my party members in an entire turn that could possibly get any of them killed if the escape attempt fails. That. Is not. Ok. Take one punishment, don't put them all in one basket. And don't give me the "git gud" crap everyone else does - we all enter bad situations in this game that we need to escape once in a while. RNG makes it so. Don't corner the player by making them worry if they'll escape or not, and if you want to keep that, fine, but get rid of the added stress issue then. Pick one poison and stick to it.\n\n-the stress meter. Now, I have to say, this was actually one of the reasons I was fascinated with this game at first. It seemed like such a neat mechanic that could actually end up with GOOD results, and not bad.\n\nOut of the countless times my characters reached full stress, only twice has something heroic happened. This should be a 50/50 chance, and not a 10/90, imo. You're already threatening death with the stress waves (which apparently wasn't in the original EA version), why make it even more challenging by not giving the player a fair shot at feeling amazing? Because you're too busy making it feel frustratingly difficult? That's why? Eh.\n\nNow with all that said, you'd think I HATE this game. I'm just another one of those jerks on the internet saying its the worst thing ever. But here's the thing: I don't. With all that said, I still love so much about the game:\n\n-The art style. So refreshingly simple, yet bold and interesting.\n\n-The music. Tense, adds to the atmosphere, and well composed.\n\n-The designs. Goes hand in hand with art style, in a way, but every class looks very unique and stands out in their own way.\n\n-the voice acting. Top ♥♥♥♥ing notch, hard not to love. Complex dialogue makes this game feel intelligent (even if the narrator isn't saying anything most of the time other than "this ♥♥♥♥ sucks sometimes yo").\n\n-fascinating game mechanics, like stress and perks/negatives. While some people abbhore some of these things, I am impressed with how many different things your characters can get, both positive and negative.\n\nThere are things to LOVE about this game. There are things to HATE about this game. I am left torn down the middle. I want to like this game. I want to get swept up inside of it, lose myself for hours on end from dungeon to dungeon but...every time a risky dungeon is presented, I don't want to take it because I fear I have to start from scratch from a different warrior. The fact that people think that the death of your character is a fair punishment just isn't true. All those hours and money into these particular characters you want to crusade through dungeons with are put out within minutes due to bad RNG, bad situations, or just bad planning or poor decision making.\n\nAnd even if it WAS all my fault, even if it WAS misdirection or poor planning or player error or...whatever, even with all that in mind and the fact that my character(s) died, wasting hours of my life because of simple mistakes, is that ok? Does it make it a fun challenge? Or a slog?\n\nThe answer is that there is no answer. This game is dependent on what you like as a gamer, and as a person, really. You're not a bad person for liking this game. And you're not bad for disliking it. I see the points of people on both sides. And I think everyone should just calm the ♥♥♥♥ down and learn to deal with other people's opinions on the internet (although that probably won't ever happen, even though it should).\n\nAs for me...this game is interesting. Its stressful. Its tactful. Its challenging. But, in spite of things, it just isn't fun to me. A lot of times it felt like a chore. To the point where I no longer wanted to play.

However, not long ago they implimented a new patch that seems to effect a great deal of game balance (in the monster's favour). The game, which was already incredibly challenging and unforgiving, became nearly impossibly challenging. My team is surprised more often (even in bright torchlight), critted (what seems like constantly), already debilitative mental conditions have been separated into mental and physical ailments (and then allow those to compound and get harder to remove), and even the damage of the monsters seems to have increased. Some characters (like the occultist) have had their debuffs nerfed and have become an almost useless class compared to others now.\n\nWhat used to be a game that made you strategize your supplies and fight a war of attrition now kills off your (well prepared and equipped) characters before you're even through a second room sometimes. Bosses aren't the only major threat now, a group of mini-bosses seems to be able to wipe you out at any time. It's now nearly impossible to keep a skilled team, and thus you're frequently forced to train up low level characters to replace the ones you've lost. Then, only to lose them again without being able to explore the deeper levels. The difficulty curve ramps up way too much, way too fast.\n\nAlso, it's hard to raise character levels because you only seem to get advancement experience if you complete a dungeon (which is often VERY difficult now), so even if you complete 90% of the dungeon and are forced to abandon it because most of your characters have been wiped out, the remaining characters recieve ... nothing, no experience at all. You only get more trinkets and money (and lots of it, but it doesn't really help you out much).\n\nThey've also added this strange corpse mechanic, which seems kind of interesting, but doesn't really function logically. Sometimes you have to "kill" the corpses of the enemy that you've already killed just to get at the back row of enemies, yet your own characters never leave corpses, and most enemies can hit all ranks of your characters anyway.\n\nAll that said, I have hope that this patch will be modified to make the game playable again. It was honestly one of my favourite games that I've ever played before, but I'm going to bench it for now in the hopes that it will become a more balanced game in the updates (and release) still to come.\n\nFingers crossed!!!","July 29, 2015","false","45.0"," 131 of 220 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","131","220","7","2"

This might in part be my fault since I got involved during this stage- most people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when Facebook changes it's layout. You can only imagine how rustled I'd get when I'd get on and find the gameplay mechanics of DD would change. But I can accept those twists and turns as part of the development process.\n\nWith that said... And believe me, I've dumped 100+ hours into this game so I say this with a heavy heart, I'm pretty dissapointed with where they took this during that time of development.\n\nDarkest Dungeon doesn't have any obvious one glaring flaw, but small things add up and it's the small things the devs take that do the most damage. Now obviously this is supposed to be a harsh and adverse game- the whole point is to be difficult and unforgiving, after all. Right?\n\nWell, yes, you would be right. The game itself proclaims that is about "Making the most of a bad situation", how there will be deaths, there will be failure, and so on. It warns you right out of the starting gate. Hell, that's part of the reason I got into this game. I liked the idea of a dungeon crawler with long lasting wear and tear on adventuring. Your heroes getting quirks (for better and for worse), diseases, weird obsessions, that's all pretty damn cool and it helps make the game what it is.\n\nBut the problems come from the small things that add up. I don't think DD's problems come from any of it's core ideas, but the ways they're implemented. You want the game to be difficult, unforgiving even, but you still want it to be fun, challenging, and most importantly, -rewarding-\n\nPROS:\n- The art is fantastic. Absolutely terrific and it never gets tiring to look at.\n- The soundtrack is great. I'm not even sure how to label it, but imagine a mix of horror, grunge and epic orchestra.\n- The game's narrator, played by Wayne June (who has done countless audiobook readings of H.P Lovecraft's works) is perfect in every way for the role and just oozes a brooding edge.\n- The core gameplay is simple, intuitive and the team manages to build a lot of complexity and synergy out of the turn based combat.\n\nCONS:\n1) The game has gotten progressively more bent on grinding. There are 5 areas in the game. Each area has two bosses. You must fight each of those bosses three times. Each of these bosses is at a different level ranking. Higher level heroes cannot play lower level dungeons. If you do not plan out managing three or 4 teams of different ranking hereos far in advance of this, you are going to tack on days of extra gameplay just trying to cultivate competent teams to fight bosses you've already battled several times. This doesn't even take possible Total Party Kills into account. It also doesn't take into account the time you need to kill waiting for heroes to recover from stress, disease, crippling quirks or just straight up wandering off.\n\nThis isn't difficult, challenging, or rewarding. It is tedious. It can be infuriating. But not as infuriating as...\n\n2) Not getting any sort of reward or compensation for slugging through said grind. I'm not asking for a pat on the head and a slice of birthday cake pushed into my mouth for not quitting 30 seconds into the game. However, most games, especially the grindy ones, usually give you something in return for putting all that time in.\n\nYour level 6 'Legendary' heroes have fought their way up the blood soaked ladder, having disposed of countless monstrosities and grappled with their personal demons time and time again. They're scarred, they're battered, they're hard boiled sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es that live to claw the eyes out of mutant fish monsters. You've given them the best armor, the best trinkets, and pair them up in groups where they synergize the best.\n\nThey drop like flies in the Darkest Dungeon area. There's no weight, no reward for dragging your guys through the mud until they're legendary. They're just as likely to spazz out and panic as they were at level 0, they can barely cut through High Protection level enemies, and the same cultists jerks you've been slapping around since Week 1 can now give them heart attacks in 4 turns if you don't take them out immediately because now they get arbitrarily huge stat numbers for the final dungeon.\n\nSpeaking of arbitrary numbers....\n\n3) The hardest parts of the game are mechanics outside of the combat and exploration that the devs use to punish the player.\n\nA game like this ought to punish you for making stupid mistakes. A game like this should throw lasting repurcussions at you for failure. Games like XCOM do this really well because said repurcussions feel like natural cause and effect for the situation.  DD does not do this, and it feels more malicious than anything. It doesn't tell you the rules it wants you to play by, and when you step out of line it'll take your hand off for it. ESPECIALLY if it catches you trying to heal your party up when only a single enemy is left. It used to be content just to make your party get stressed, but now it throws a new mob of enemies at you.\n\n\nAnd that's really the big problem. With a game as challenging as this, the struggle alone should be enough, but the game will actively punish you for struggling.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese are the problems with Darkest Dungeon. Corpses and heart attacks are annoying when the game first surprised you with them during Early Access, but with adjustment they fit right in and mesh with the tone, the difficulty and open up new lanes of strategy. Those aren't the problems, those are challenges.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is not a bad game- on the contrary I think there's an excellent game in here, but it's buried under the weight of a lot of busywork and excessive punishment it doles out at you for not doing what it wants (but doesn't tell you to).  It takes and it takes, but it never gives back.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game of diminishing returns. I'm not saying you should avoid it, but heed my warning: You'll love Darkest Dungeon, but no matter how much time and work you give to it, it won't love you back.\n\nKinda like an ex, really.","July 26, 2015","false","108.4"," 111 of 186 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","111","186","4","1"

Aside from all this I am compelled to come back for more, to feel the utmost joy of scoring a critical hit, the relief of surviving the horrors being thrown at me and the unforgettable feeling of triumph. This is a thoroughly fun game and I would suggest any person who wants their metal tested to play it.

Then, life happened, and I set the game down for a while.\n\nThis past weekend I was up for some Graveyard shifts and decided to pick up the game again. Excited, I opted to start a game from scratch and relive the whole experiance. ...But, I couldn't even get an inital team off the ground.

Yes, you would lose someone to stress or death occasionally, but that was to be expected.\n\nThis time, however, was something else. I tried the first 4-person dungeon 5 different times: I could NOT make it through. I would be slammed again and again by crits, only to have my characters miss for rounds at a time.

I am disappointed to say the least.\n\nSo after beating the game I stand by my points since early access. The game just isn't rewarding to play with how much grind and garbage you gotta slog through to reach the end and then it hardly feels like you are overcoming a great evil so much as it feels like you just have to exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to pass. I don't feel like I was truly challenged, just constantly had someone trying to cheat me. I genuinely feel like all the positive ratings for the game are a result of the 'git gud' crowd who themselves probably suck. A challenge to overcome is what I live for. Darkest dungeon was less a challenge and more a gamble.\n\nHonestly I was hoping the ending dungeons and ending itself would be rewarding, but instead I feel pretty empty. I guess that's the way you feel when you are so mad at a game you are just trying to find something good in it and you just don't.\n\nDarkest dungeon is playing a poker game and going all in. You play your hand, clench your teeth and/or buttcheeks, and then you win and get a ♥♥♥♥ load of money. After getting home you realize that you spent a crap load of money on cheetos and soda and also you need to spend some money on releiving stress from the ordeal (for some reason) and end up with just enough money in the positives to buy a soda and enough money left over to do it all again. Not very satisfying.\n\nAs of July 15th I've pretty much given up on the game. There's no point in trying to help anymore. I don't really care that all my saves were deleted. I don't really care that they nerfed the crap outta camping buffs. I don't care heavily that crusader protection is useless. I'm not crying after they ruined any reason to play in the dark. I don't fully care that enemies hit extra hard and do extra stress. I don't really find it awful that being marked is considered a means of protection. I'm not upset that my highwayman was killed in the tutorial. I'm not offended that when the game crashes some buffs/debuffs are gone from characters. It doesn't bother me that you can just Alt + f4 when one of your guys gets deathblowed to avoid it. I'm not sad that the game gets kinda monotonous after a bit and I can let the fact they ignore teaching boss mechanics slide.\n\nBut the fact you can lose a party member from 100% to 0% just by encountering spiders in the first mission and it's been this way since I started playing? No. Screw this game.\n\n\n\nIn the end, what really matters is your own opinion. The thing is that in my opinion I was not satisfied with the end results of the game.","July 15, 2015","false","241.2"," 82 of 136 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","82","136","15","0"

All of this contributes to a promise of something deep, dark, and deliciously engrossing.\n\nThe savvy player will go in expecting a challenge. After all, the game stands at a crossroads of several historically demanding genres: RPG, survival, roguelike. These genres are loved for many reasons, but paramount in my book is that they offer a deep, precisely crafted challenge. This is where Darkest Dungeon fails, utterly.\n\nThe game offers nothing more than an illusion of depth. Class variety, skill selection, inventory management, character-building, team-building... I could go on. DD has it all. But never before has such a plethora of choices been so meaningless.\n\nSink as many hours as you like. There are no real lessons to be learned, no real experience to gain. You will enter the dungeon as a trembling, stupid peon, and come away very much the same. Ultimately, there is only one way to play this game: grind, and grind some more.\n\nSadly, one of the major selling points of DD, its character "stress" system, is the very centerpiece of this problem. Stress is unavoidable and inherently boring. Curing it is slow, expensive, and braindead: roll new characters and slog through low-level dungeons to earn money. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThis pattern replays itself through just about every facet of DD. There are no revelations or breakthroughs; just slow, monotonic progress and the looming shadow of boredom. Increasingly, the game's once-charming aesthetic becomes a reminder of what awaits: joylessness.\n\nDD's early access status provides a glimmer of hope. There is still time for the developers to overhaul the game's mechanics and rescue an otherwise promising title. Give us something more to look forward to than a chronic nosedive.","March 1, 2015","false","7.9"," 116 of 197 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","116","197","6","3"

Well, this is a prime example. Darkest Dungeon is a side-scrolling turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG where you take a small team of 4 into increasingly difficult dungeons trying to save your Family's Estate. You'll face both physical challenges involving zombies, hellbeasts and bandits yet you'll also have to conquer mental challenges such as fear, insanity and death from stress. This game puts a huge emphasis on the terrifying nature of exploring the dungeons, where games like Diablo show your adventurer as a fearless battletank, the characters you get in Darkest Dungeon are individuals who will eventually become broken by traits like masochism or other mental illnesses. Don't worry though, there are ways to allow your characters to rest, whether it be the brothel, drowning sorrows in the tavern or repenting in the church... after all, everything can be forgotten for a price. It should also be mentioned that players can level up, gain skills and become incredibly powerful but like other Rogue-likes, death is permanent and focusing too much on one hero can lead to the death of all the others.\n\nGameplay aside, you've also got an epic gothic/comic artstyle that really brings this game to life and further immerses you in the world. I can't help but think back to the dark and dank of the original Diablos while playing this game.\nAlso, the narrator in this game is disturbingly amazing. Seriously, pay that guy more to do more lines because he undoubtedly deserves it and more. It's like if the Bastion narrator lost his mind and merged with a demon or something. Freaking epic.\n\nIn summary, this game is great. One of the better indie games of the year and I'm glad to see it has finally released. One final word of advice, don't be afraid of restarting a few times. You'll probably need to.\n\nEarly Access Review\nDark, dank, a badass narrator, epic soundtrack and the keys to my heart. Losing heroes has never proven so gloriously fun. Where in X-COM the game would showcase the achievements and build a connection with you and your soldiers, Darkest Dungeon seeks to make you cautious of forming that connection. After all, insanity is just around the corner for those who delve into the dungeons without a light. If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself to. Absolutely phenomenal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6x55jSOPw0","June 20, 2015","true","9.4"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","26","36","9","0"

I played it when it was a casual dungeon crawler with innovative mechanics and cool art. I took a break to let early access take care of content addition and expansion, reading patch notes about new classes and anticipating making a new run at it with tons of new toys to play with.\n\nThe mechanics and art remain, but the casual dungeon-crawler has turned into a turgid min-max fest that is much too harsh on all but the most dedicated stat junkies. Corpses completely change party-building mechanics and lengthen fights to an annoying degree. Heart attacks are BS. The game feels much harder than it should be.\n\nI feel like the game doesn't even want you to play it and is dedicated to punishing you if you do. It's difficult for me to recommend this game and I'm sad about that. It used to be a fun romp, now it's a slow, plodding stumble through a too-harsh environment.\n\nMaybe the devs will clue in and create difficulty levels to appease the whining min-maxers while allowing the rest of gamers to still have a fun experience.

Once you figure out some basic mechanics and which upgrades take priority, ( I almost restarted after a few unwise purchases), it becomes a lot easier and rather fun managing your party of merceneries.\n\nBasic Tips.. Get your roster up rather quickly.. then develop a couple builds that work for you. While one team is being cured of stress or diseases, let the other one go in to battle. You will have people die. Take rookies and mix them with more experienced fighters so you dont get wiped out as bad. Experiment with your builds.. theres not too many bad characters they all can bring things to the table and some work better with other characters. My favorite build has to be two Hellions up front- two Vestals in back- or a Occultist and a Vestal in back. Out of my roster of 22, I have 8 or 9 Vestals ready to rock. When you upgrade your Vestal make sure she has the Judgment attack. It comes in handy when she is not healing your party. But dont worry about her mace bash. You dont want your Vestals up front and thats the only time she can use the Mace. Another interesting one is two highwaymen up front and letting them take turns with their point blank shot for serious damage. Also the grapeshot blast is a good one to have in their abilities especially early on. The Crusaders seem rare to find on the fresh meat wagon but they are also good to have. The Leper once powered up can replace a Crusader in my opinion. Just whatever works for you.\n\nAdvancing in game.. Try to get characters to level 3 and then leave them alone until you get enough of level 3s to take on the medium missions. Save level 3 bosses for level 4 fighters as they are still considered level 3 mission eligible. Makes a lot easier trust me.\n\nI just think this is a wonderful and deep game that has tons of potential for future installments or DLC depending on how they want to advance this franchise. They could keep adding new areas and bosses, have daily missions, random loot placements to hunt for and all kinds of endless possibilities..  I am excited for the game but almost more excited for what it can be in the future.\n\nWould "Give Them No Quarter!"  again  10/10","June 16, 2015","true","134.3"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","33","49","3","1"

I played this at my sister's for a solid two weeks and thought it was an awesome game. But since the update they did in mid-July, the game is just horrible. Alas that I cannot return it and now am stuck with it. Since I *thought* I was buying a different game than what I got, I really should be able to return it. . .\n\nThe NEW version of the game is so ridiculous that not only do you have to kill the monsters, but then you have to kill their CORPSES. Seriously? In what universe does a person have to kill a corpse? So while you're clearing the damn corpses, the monsters continue to hit you for oh, 30-50 stress points (no joking, you can actually get that much stress from a single hit).\n\nI loved in the original game that my toons died, and not infrequently. Now they die all the time, of course, but what's annoying is that there is no adjustment to be made to prevent it even slightly. It doesn't matter what your torch is anymore. Low torch does not up crits at all (I went through an entire dungeon with about 2 crits at low torch), you get surprised at high torch >50% of the time, etc. The strategy of the game was replaced with luck.\n\nSO glad I wasted $20 on this because the developers decided to destroy a perfectly good game.

But given what this game has become, I cannot do so in good conscience.\n\nWhen I first bought this game back when it was in early access, it was something really interesting. An incredible aesthetic matched by a gameplay that married the best aspects of RPGs and Dungeon Crawlers, with its own twists and turns that made for a wholly engrossing experience. It wasn't perfect, but it was challenging, enjoyable, and most importantly of all, rewarding.\n\nAll the way through the development process, I'd periodically start up a new run to see what sort of changes had been made, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. The difficult of the game got ramped up, but so too did the classes themselves. The fights were both terrifying and exhilarating, and taking down a boss felt like a triumphant moment. The new classes were interesting, and the quirks system made them feel like more than just a grouping of mechanics.\n\nI didn't mind the introduction of heart attacks and corpses, as they forced me to keep a closer eye on my stress levels and put more thought into my party lineups.\n\nAs Darkest Dungeon reached its final stage, the very same elements that made it so fun and enjoyable for me have become twisted into something that has turned the game into the exact opposite. Reaching Resolve level 5 and 6 used to be an accomplishment, a marker that these characters/heroes had faced overwhelming odds and achieved a greater state of being. You would face off against some truly powerful and terrifying enemies, but your characters were on par with that power and could exchange blow for blow. There was a balance, and even when the tide of battle turned against you there was still a chance that you could pull off a victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nNow, the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you. Don't even think about going into a higher level dungeon with even one of your characters not fully upgraded, as they will die. At first, I thought the sudden skyrocketing of my casualty rates were the result of me making a tactical error, but when I looked at play throughs online I found that people who were more or less equally skilled as I was were suffering from similar casualty rates, for similar reasons. I don't mind losing someone because of an error that I made, but losing it because the RNG decided 'they gonna die now' is strikes me as something that is blatantly unfair. Especially when in order to bring them up to the point where they can survive the upper level dungeons requires hours of joyless grinding for resolve and gold, and the fruits of those labors don't seem to have an impact on their overall survivability.\n\nIn general, Darkest Dungeon does an extremely poor job of explaining the way different features work, or what to expect when going into a new location or facing off against a new type of boss. Which i don't necessarily mind per-say, but when the cost of failure are so high that they will undermine hours of work, then that becomes a problem.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the final dungeon. There are so many design decisions (like rendering your characters illegible for future expeditions, to name one) that are some high grade cow manure, and exemplarly of just how un-fun the game has become.\n\nI guess I'm more disappointed than anything else. There are so many aspects of this game that I love, and that I'm sure other players who are thinking about buying this game will love too. The aesthetic of this game is absolutely phenomenal, the writing is superb, the gameplay is innovative, and there are some genuinely great features. But somewhere along the line, the game has become less about facing off against the eldritch horrors and pulling victory from the jaws of defeat, and more about not losing horribly. It has gone from ‘tough, but fair’ to ‘grueling and frustrating’.\n\nEdit:\nFor those of you who are interested, I effectively did three runs of the game. The first I started back in March which went on for roughly 30 hours, in which time I'd completed all the available content. I did a second, much shorter one in mid July that lasted about 20 hours in which I only got about half way through bosses. I started a third one, intended to be my final run of the game, in late October, which took me 45 hours to reach about three-quarters of the way to the end game.\n\nThis should help show just how much of a grind this game has become","January 23","false","95.9"," 269 of 475 people (57%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","57","269","475","20","26"

But then come the lvl 5 champion ones... and with them comes utter disaster as monsters start to show up with abominable amounts of PROT(while we still have only TWO heroes who can counter this), SPD and additional effects to their attacks.

The amount of various relics required, especially Deeds, is atrocious. The amount of gold necessary for upgrades and the quality of upgrades themselves is DISGUSTING.\n- The game actually ENCOURAGES you to sacrifice your first best group of heroes, as they will accumulate EXP faster than gear and at some point will not be able to handle the dungeons appropriate for them.","January 23","false","101.7"," 195 of 342 people (57%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","57","195","342","15","8"

I have just begun to plumb the depths of the veteran maps, but I can't find the motivation to do much more now than play a run or two in between work. The game greatly lacks variety--in monsters, dungeons, and bosses. Both monsters and bosses are generally just reskinned, so after the initial "shock" of facing a deadly new one, most of them become trivial and even gimmicky.

I've started 5 games; the first two I read all the text, followed all the advice, read the details of all of my characters' moves, etc. Now I feel like I'm just ramming my head against a wall.\n\nThere is a difference between a difficult game - one which requires skill, strategy, coordination, forethought, or some combination of the above - and a random game where the odds are stacked against you. Darkest Dungeon has high potential to be in that first category - the combat system is unique, the skills are varied, the variety and heavy influx of characters means you get a unique combination of talents at multiple points in the game - but ultimately it falls into the second, at least for now.\n\nYou are put in a randomly generated map, with randomly generated treasures, traps, and encounters along the way.

The encounters feature a random (and worse, frequent) slew of critical hits, misses, and dodges (Each of those concepts are fine it they occur EITHER very rarely or very frequently, or if there's a way to control them well enough that they aren't so rbitrary... but in Darkest Dungeon they seem to occur just often enough to be a not-completely-unexpected but not-remotely-reliable nuisance).\n\nIt's impossible to amass any resource in the game; typically you can invest time to SOME end in a modern roguelike, but in Darkest Dungeon all of your characters seem to be designed to consume all of your money, go mad, and die in short order, certainly well before they have the chance to be useful. The death of characters isn't issue; the number of resources they cost you while they die is. An adventurer will not earn you enough money to sustain itself, let alone to sustain its successor.\n\nYou can upgrade buildings in town which in turn sell benefits to your characters to help deal with this issue, but then the process becomes hiring lvl 0 adventurers, throwing them at quests until you pass (the chances of which are very slim if you don't at least invest some gold in them), expecting to fail but hoping to just scrape a few upgrade items out of the quest so you can upgrade your building so that you have a slightly higher chnce next time.\n\nNothing in this game feels rewarding, and in fact, the degree of arbitrary madnesses (which will can do anything from eat your character's turn to raise the stress of other characters so that they're more likely to go crazy) seems to be intentionally designed to give this impression.\n\nI see so much potential for this game, so I'll probably keep playing it in hopes of updates in the future... because as has been mentioned, the artwork, soundtrack, narrator, overal polish, theme, and mechanics of the game seem a solid foundation for something amazing.. but in its current incarnation, I can't recommend it.","October 9, 2015","false","18.2"," 39 of 61 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","39","61","2","0"

It has the ingredients to become something great, but it still needs something more. Although, keeping the fact that this game is still in early access in mind, I am sure that it can still become something great.\n\nThe game's very fun and leaving a challenging quest with all of your characters still in one piece is a great feeling, but after a while, the rinse and repeat gameplay style just becomes a bit stale. You go into one dungeon, your characters come out all stressed out, thus requiring you to allow them to rest. You then take a bunch of low leveled characters, take them out on a short quest, come back and repeat.\n\nI will without a doubt definitely play this game avidly, but I would not really recommend it to players that dislike grindy and repetitive games.\n\nEven if some of these negative reviews do take the game off your wishlist, I would definitely recommend you follow this game and it's updates.

I will continue playing because I believe it will be better at some point. This was not an impulse buy for me. I read through the forums and looked at videos before buying. I waited for a sale to make it easier for me to see value in the purchase. It has nice graphics and interesting mechanics. It has an RPG elements to add some depth to the basic rogue structure. There's a base building mechanic simialr to X-com, which is something I usually like. There's resource management which should lead to interesting decisions. All these things appealed to me and made me decide to buy it.\n\nI expected to be greeted by difficult challenges that required me to closely monitor my resources and make difficult choices about my characters and their fates.\n\nUltimately, I'm just faced with a mindless grind over and over.\n\nMy current state of gaming after 14 hours is:\nManage my main party\nRecruit 4 characters from stagecoach\nPress embark button\nPick a short adventure\nPut the 4 characters in their slots\nPress provision button\nBuy 6 torches\nStart adventure\nAdventure until one characters stress gets close to or over 100\nAbandon quest\nClick through a bunch of buttons to get back to the base (Not sure what they say as I click through them as fast as possible)\nRight click each character and press fire button\nManage my main party\nGo to stagecoach .....And the worst part is there are no shortcuts. You can't fire everyone at the end of an adventure. You can't recruit four characters from the adventure screen. It's like they're trying to convince me that these choices have meaning. They don't and they just add clicks until I get to the ones that do have meaning.\n\nThat meaning shows up every third week or so.\n\nEvery few weeks, you'll take your main party on an adventure and you'll try and push them to the end so they gain gain resolve to level up. You'll even equip them with shovels and food like a real party would want. If all goes well, they'll finish an adventure and you'll get some cool things.\n\nOf course the party will also be a stressed out wreck and require several weeks of rest to recover enough to go on another adventure. This of course is ok, since you'll need several weeks to gather enough resources to pay for their stress recovery and any upgrades you may want to put on them.\n\nThis of course means you'll spend several more adventures going through the earlier cycle with a bunch of characters who's names you don't even bother to read. You'll even gloat a bit when the starvation screen comes up as that means you've had a better than average run and should get some decent money out of the adventure. The fact that you're technically starving four people to death in order to make your return on investment worthwhile should never be brought up.\n\nIs any of this difficult? Does it make the game challenging?\n\nNot really.\n\nThe monsters so far have posed little or no threat. Even if a character gets to zero health, it's unlikely you'll lose them. You can probably give them a health on the next combat round and they'll usually hang in there long enough for you to finish any really tough battles.\n\nThe base poses no difficulty once I figured out the grinding part. And since it's clear that in the long term I'll get enough resources to build up to maximum, there's no interesting choices to be made there.\n\nWhat is difficult is stress, and only because the game doesn't give you the resources to deal with it if you keep pushing on. It won't matter most of the time because the throw away characters can get as stressed as they want as long as they don't all die before you abandon the adventure.\n\nFor your main party, stress is the real enemy. I would go as far as to say your only enemy. From the start of your adventure, you'll be wondering if they'll get to the end before they stress out. There is little chance the monsters will kill your characters, but once one of your characters goes over 100 stress the threat of heart attacks becomes a real and pressing problem. At that point, you're playing with fire while showering in gasoline. The characters will start talking and the stress levels will skyrocket. Then another character will go over 100 and they won't shut up and three turns later someone will fall over dead from a heart attack. Once one goes, it's belly up for all of them and you get to start over. Since you'll quickly learn this lesson, you're unlikely to ever face this problem more than once. At that point, stress then just becomes an annoyance instead of a difficulty. It will quickly come to represent extra weeks of tedious trips through the cycle of collecting resources.\n\nWhat about the times where it really does go bad for your main party? It has happened once to me because I didn't want to go through a medium adventure a second time for two rooms. I pushed on even though I knew heart attacks were close.\n\nI started raging against the fates and designers right?\n\nNo. Remember, you only play with these characters once every 3 weeks. You're not really attached to them. The entire party went belly up and the most I could manage was a tired sigh as I thought about the button presses of tedium while I started a new party to replace .... hmm .... what were their names???\n\nAnd in case you think I'm exaggerating this point, I give you the following example of my total ambivalence for these characters. One time, I fired one of my main party members by mistake. I had forgotten their name and their stress was high. It was only when I started the next adventure with my main party that I realized what I had done.\n\nIn all the rogue games that I thought were good, I could remember the names of my characters. I cared what happened to them. I would go so far as to say that's the heart of a good rogue game. Make the player care about what's happening, and then put them in an impossible situation. Most of the times things will go badly and the player will hate the game and the developer.\n\nSometimes though, a miracle will happen. You'll get that perfect set of circumstances to overcome the impossible. And that character will be your hero. The game and developers will be brilliant. That story will be told to everyone who will listen. Of course the character will then be killed by a lowly slime moments later, but the memory of them overcoming the impossible will live on and make you believe you can win. You will honor that character by starting again. You will swear to defeat that game because of all the fallen heroes who did the impossible to get one more level further than you had ever seen before.\n\nI wish that was happening in Darkest Dungeon. Unfortunately, the designers have forgotten to make me care.","October 10, 2015","false","25.5"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","51","83","4","1"

Its strengths lie in the beautiful atmosphere, (mostly) rewarding leveling system, and unforgiving RNG that makes all fights feel important as at any time you could lose a character you’ve invested several hours into. Fans of challenging, turn based rouge likes should be right at home and not hesitate to play.\n\nPrice Point:\nThis was my biggest deterrent to buying the early access. I believe $20 is a little pricey for an unfinished game and wasn’t sure how much gameplay I’d be getting. However I was able to get at least 40 very fun hours out of that $20. Many games charge a lot more for a lot less and as I write this review I feel my money was well spent.\n\nRNG:\nRNG makes darkest dungeon the challenge it is. Unfortunately many players are claiming they had terrible luck, making the game nearly unplayable. It is possible to miss nearly every attack as some say, it’s just incredibly unlikely. For me, RNG was just punishing enough to make encounters challenging, and only a hand full of times did I feel cheated. It really made my heart pump going on a boss mission with level 5 characters, knowing I could permanently lose characters I’d invested 4-5 hours into if I had a handful of bad rolls. Similarly, its incredible seeing a bounty hunter crit a boss for nearly 80 damage because he hit a 20% crit chance. Character death is permanent and unforgiving. It’s not impossible to beat the game without dying, but it is unlikely. It’s terribly frustrating to see a player get crit’d twice, putting them on death’s door where they can die to another enemies attack or to bleed or blight. But in my experience these cases happened very infrequently and could be avoided by fleeing from battle. Once I figured out the game, maybe around the 10-15 hour mark, I stopped losing characters. For me, the RNG was what made each mission immersive as players are at fortune’s mercy, for others it is a terribly frustrating mechanic.\n\nCharacter and Skill Balance:\nHaving leveled each character to rank 6, I’ve found some characters and skills aren’t as strong as others, this could just be my play style though. Damage is king. The player could spend a turn using the plague doctors 15% damage boost, but on a character that does 10-16 base damage, 15% is only 1 to 2 more damage points which aren’t guaranteed because the buff’d player could still miss. It seems far more sensible to have the plague doctor attack as any damage he does is likely to be more than 2, maybe even getting the kill and saving the player damage next turn as the dead enemy wont attack. Its similar with the jester. The jester’s attacks are weaker but seem to have a higher crit chance and cause bleed damage. But again, I’d rather have a stronger character guaranteed to do more base damage each turn like the bounty hunter. I would not have played the jester or the plague doctor in late game if not to raise them to rank 6. Because they are both weaker characters, but particularly because in late game enemies crit for so much and its very possible for the jester to be on death’s door after one crit from a hard hitting enemy. All other characters I found usable, fun, and different. However, I still only use their damaging or healing skills. Again, I could buff the highway man’s accuracy to maybe hit next turn, or I could just try to do damage both turns. The one exception I found was the occultist. His debuff’s are extremely valuable for boss fights. However, most boost skills are largely too weak to be used and should be buffed.\n\nGame Progression:\nEarly game is challenging. Players new to the game mechanics and the RNG could get frustrated easily. Again, this is dependent on the player. I loved the early game, but players should realize this is likely the most difficult part. It’s a perfectly viable strategy early on to send in suicide teams with no provisions assuming they will not complete the mission and end with high stress. However, all the gold they gather will be kept by the player and they can be dismissed from the roster to make room for a new suicide squad. By mid game the player will have upgraded the town enough and found a handful of useful trinkets that the player will feel vastly overpowered compared to the early game. You’ll be overpowered compared to early game, but still be challenged. I had the most fun at this mid game stage. I felt I had built up my players and strategies and was being rewarded for playing the game well. Late game, which I understand was recently buff’d, felt a little cheap to me. It seems enemies are given too much dodge, health, and damage. The late game felt like early game, just with bigger numbers. Enemies have such high dodge, that a crusader’s level 5 smite seemed to hit for almost the same percent chance and do the same proportional amount of damage as it did in early game. I felt this way about all characters. Its fun when games let you feel more powerful as you play on. Darkest Dungeon does so beautifully from early to mid game. You feel rewarded for leveling your players, upgrading the town, and implementing good strategies and teams. Players are robbed of this in late game as the enemies get such high stats that it feels cheap and that the player has regressed back to early game. As if the player never leveled up or got much better at the game.\n\nSuggestions to improve the game:\n\n1) Tweak the late game to keep the player feeling overpowered, yet challenged. Either nerf the late round enemies, or have another round of powerful upgrades for players that are unlocked at rank 5 or 6. By rank 4, all skills, weapons, and armor can be maxed. Implement one more round of upgrades that come with rank 5 to offset the difficultly of late game enemies.\n\n2) Fix inconsistent stats. What does speed do? One would assume it dictates turn order. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve had characters with speed 8 go before characters with speed 10, strangely it seemed to only happen when my party surprised the enemy. Both characters were using speed boosting trinkets. This is confusing. If speed doesn’t dictate turn order then there should really be a tool tip when the player mouses over the speed stat explaining what it does. If it does dictate turn order then it should work as expected and the higher number goes before the lower.\n\n3) Not sure if it is intentional, but when moving from one room to the next in a dungeon and approaching the door for the next room. If the player mashes “w”, they can get into the last room without losing some torch light. For example, If the player starts moving from one room to the next, with no interactables in the hallway, but doesn’t mash “w”, they will enter the next room with less than 75 light. However, if the player does mash “w” as they approach the last room, they will enter that room with 76 light. This saves more torches than you’d think in lengthy dungeons.\n\n4) Make passive attacks stronger. Damage is too important. Why would someone use a turn to boost a characters attack by 2, rather than attacking to cause more than 2 damage? Maybe 15% damage to the entire party would be worth it. To only one player, it is not.\n\n5) Useless trinkets. Some trinkets have useless combinations. Like 15% blight chance to jester, when the jester doesn’t have any attacks that can cause blight. Also, by late game there were only 3 or 4 trinkets I used. The lepers mask which gave huge boosts to health, and speed for the leper class. The tough ring which gave 20% health and 8% protection, a book that game 15% damage and 2 speed, and a right that gave 15% damage and 8% protection if light was above 75. All other trinkets were garbage. Maybe have a way to sell trinkets to get a little more money.\n\nMore suggestions in the comments below...","February 18, 2015","true","57.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","2"

Overall, the game has a lot of fun elements to it, but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices, mostly those that were added post-alpha. Pre-alpha the game was a lot of fun, often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it. Post-alpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up. The game is built to be challenging, but what Darkest Dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions: the more you play, the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of RNG you have to rely on.\n\nDarkest Dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck, which only gets worse the longer you play. The game is built to put the PCs into a dying state quickly and often, which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic. Introduced sometime after alpha, and a longstanding point of contention, heart attacks cause a PC to instantly enter a dying state, regardless of health, or die permanently if they are already dying. Because of this, often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party, regardless of how well you are doing.\n\nSanity loss for PCs leads to afflictions, which basically makes the given PC suicidal for the rest of the dungeon. More often than not an afflicted PC will skip their turn, refuse healing, shift the party order around, or somehow injure or debuff themselves. It would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things, or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen, but instead they often happen in succession, which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction, and the cycle repeats. This quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75% of your turns are either skipped or used to re-arrange heroes because they can't do anything else (not even defend). This is, in short, not fun whatsoever.\n\nAside from the in-dungeon frustrations, the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon, with PCs claiming that they "wouldn't learn anything from the experience", or some other ridiculous reasoning. This is actually probably my biggest gripe, even moreso than heart attacks. This level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon. Unfortunately, it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced, so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again, re-living the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome.\n\nOverall, I do like Darkest Dungeon, when the dice are in my favor. When they aren't (which is ~75% of the time, it seems), the game is just an unending stream of frustration. The thrill, charm, and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in pre-alpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the post-launch changes, and given that I play games to relieve stress and have fun, this is the opposite of the desired result. As such I cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it, however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches.","May 15","false","25.1"," 194 of 343 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","194","343","11","0"

The stress levels of your heroes will not be able to recover within a reasonable amount of time, the healing techniques are sparse and can be randomly refused by your heroes. The roguelike gameplay means that you may spend a half hour sprawling through a dungeon getting lower on supplies until you happen upon the objective by luck.\n\nThis game may be fun for some, but the tragedy is that most of the problems with this game are because of incompetent design.

XCOM or D&D style of combat and squad building, although with a 2D side scrolling view.  That includes random number based combat that can be frustrating to some, but personally I love.  There are ways to tilt the odds in your favor with good party/character building and strategy, especially once you level up your characters a bit.   As you explore and clear dungeons you get loot with which to upgrade your characters.  You can also buy upgrades to buildings back home which allow more character upgrades.  An added element is stress your adventurers receive from facing the horrors they are fighting.  Too much stress can lead to bad, and occasionally good, traits being given to them that have to be dealt with by sending them for various forms of “treatment.”\n\nPositive:\n+Voice Acting:  Narrator is excellent in adding to the atmosphere of the game.  First “Hand of Fate” and now this game.  Looks like indie games are finally getting serious about getting good voice acting in their games.  Voice acting never a must for me, but when done well, it can definitely help.\n+Graphics:  While somewhat simple mechanically, stylistically the graphics are extremely well done.  Has a rare and interesting look.\n+Gameplay:  Simple yet addictive turn based combat and character building.

Ideally I'd give it a neutral recommendation, but since I can't it's going to be not recommended. Why?\n\n- The game evolved very little since ea started. They added more stuff (heroes, enemies), sure, but they didn't really add more depth or refine the game mechanics in any meaningful way.\n\n- The grind. And this is coming from someone who can take a lot of grind in games. This is the worst kind of grind, the grind without any meaningful progress in sight. Most of the game you'll be doing the same medium length missions over and over again to grind gold, deeds and XP, in fact you HAVE TO beat every mission a number of times before a boss fight unlocks. Then each boss has to be killed 3 times (after you fill the GRIND BAR 3 times, obviously). Much like your heroes, the bosses don't get any new skills, they just get stat buffs. Then you beat the final dungeon. That's it. If you cut all the fat the game could be beaten in 20-30 missions, without repeating the same scouting quest 20 times and spending 526 deeds to improve the bar in your village. In fact it would've been better that way.\n\n- Incredibly shallow game mechanics. Stress? It was promised to be a core mechanics of the game and it's just another healthbar with random effects at break points. Afflictions? Way too easy to remove. Hero skills? Just bigger numbers from start to finish. Equipment? Again bigger numbers, zero variety. Trinkets? Take the ones that improve the stat you want, sell the rest. Exploration? Doesn't exist. Combat tactics? Shoot the eldritch horror until it dies.\n\n- Difficulty. The game seems very difficult at first, but it's an illusion, once you learn to game the system and proper party composition it gets trivial. You'll still lose a hero or be forced to abandon a mission every now and then (the game is RNG heavy), but because the game has no fail-state (!) you're only limited by how much grind you can take.\n\n- Now that's it out of ea, I can say that some things seem like placeholders. The hunger mechanic is a joke. Dungeons are mapped from the start (!). Torchlight system is just tedium. Many skills and trinket are complete garbage and essentially serve as a newbie trap. Corpses don't add to the difficulty or tactics, they just prolong fights and look stupid. I could go on, but these are nitpicks that wouldn't matter if the core gameplay had more depth to it.\n\nWhat's good about it? The atmosphere, graphics and narration are excellent. Gameplay... not so much. It's not completely terrible, but they underdelivered, concentrating on meaningless fluff like corpses, heart attacks and fight prolonging penalties instead of adding some choice and depth to gameplay. It's a 5/10 game, if you get it for $10 or less, you might have fun for your money, but that's all it is. A shame, really.\n","January 24","false","66.8"," 268 of 479 people (56%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","56","268","479","13","49"

I'd like to know how many people this includes, because it, again, feels much like a visit to the casino: a handful of people win. Everyone else loses.\n\nI've reached a point where I'm not sure the game takes much skill, but rather getting on your knees, praying, and then realizing it does nothing.\n\nI still like the game. I like the corpses, even--it was frustrating working a monster to the front only for ranged characters to have nothing to do. It can be good. At the moment, however, it's kinda not. And that's my review as it stands. Lots of design decisions that could be good, but just aren't really.\n\nAlso: while I understand most of the new classes, when first introduced, were OP, the houndmaster strikes me as the absolute worst. I could be missing something, but a group, 1 bleed attack is just worthless. Yes, he can lower protection--another questionable  recently impelentated mechanic--but on the whole he feels like a waste of a slot, and only helps to drag battles on longer. And, given that time and chance are your two biggest obstacles every step of the way, you're better off bringing along someone stronger, who can take enemies out faster.\n\nSo much for keeping it short. But, if you're interested in the game, ask yourself: how salty do I get? If you get very salty at games, move along. It's not worth the frustration. And that's my real complaint. The developers need to find a balance between their vision and something that's actually fun to play. Unless you like losing money at the casino, find something cheaper, and more rewarding. Something that you feel like you've earned through skill, perhaps, and not just dumb luck.\n\nBut also know that while I'm not recommending the game, I kinda am. This game could be amazing. Maybe it even was, at one point. Hopefully it will at least be somewhat fun again.","August 16, 2015","false","86.3"," 84 of 144 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","84","144","6","4"

Killing the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis is a turn based up to 4 person party dungeon crawler rogue-like. I know how much you love labeling genres. This game is not easy. It will punish you for making bad decisions, going in with little resources as well as not making a balanced party.\n\nAs the ruler or I guess maybe Mayor of this town-- no, ambivalent spectator you are given charge of recruiting willing quest takers to lead into the dungeons. You have the ability to upgrade buildings in the town which more or less are the permanent upgrades and what makes this game a rogue-'like' as the characters in your roster suffer from perma-death.\n\nThere is quite a few class types. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Not only in their ability set but in their personality. Before I delve deeper into this subject, stress management is a very real thing in this game. Simply walking around in the dungeons will stress the characters out. As stress builds to a maximum, that specific character goes through a resolve check which will have 1 of 2 effects. One is that their mind will break, giving them afflictions of being masochistic or paranoid among other things which depending on the severity may have you lose complete control of them. Additionally, almost every time when someones mind breaks the rest of the party becomes all to aware and will likely have a cascading affect on everyone else. However there is a bright side, sometimes when a character goes through a resolve check they get a positive character trait so that they become more courageous or vigorous and boy that feels really good. After every attack that character encourages the others and they receive a small decrease in overall stress level.\n\nOnce back in town, you are given a few options to treat the stress of questing. Either some proper drinking, gambling or a visit to the brothel or more zealous options for the more religiously inclined including flagellation. And going back to each character having a specific personality some will only have one way to relieve stress and being that there are only so many slots to place characters for specific activities this can become an issue. So plan wisely. Additionally, the stress relief does not always go so well. I have had multiple occasions where a character would cost me additional money because they got too drunk and bought every one a round or had some crisis of conscience during meditation and went missing for weeks. Additionally, there are also blacksmiths for equipment upgrades as well as a Sanitarium for the treatment of diseases and maybe some not so nice ways of getting rid of personality quirks that may not be.. beneficial.\n\nThe game also has a an extremely addictive quality in the gameplay loop in that it goes like this; return back to town, put folks into stress relief situations, take B team and start another quest, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe game is mostly controlled almost entirely with just a  mouse. You can use A and D to move left and right down hallways should you choose to but as the game is mostly menu navigation, I preferred just using the mouse. Its also a dead ringer for a tablet port.\n\nNow I'm just going to gush\nThe art design is possibly one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. It's obviously a completely different game and style really but its on the level of how I felt the about Ori and the Blind Forest. Each character sprite is really cool looking and ever so slightly varied. There is also a narrator that encourages you and sort of lends this 'gameshow' quality to everything. He seems to carry himself in a relatively sort of sadistic way. It reminded me of Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He says some truly awesome things and the voice is great. While I was rummaging through a loot sack “Secrets loom in the most tenebrous reaches of this place.”\n\nTHE GIST\nEasily one of my favorites games I've touched thus far in 2016.\n\nADDENDUM\nAfter being slightly perplexed at the way voting was going I decided to take a gander at the other reviews for this game to discover just what made this game so polarizing. It seems a lot of people have developed a rather large disdain for 'grind-y' things. Yet I do not see this treatment to liberating outposts in far cry or reaching the paragon levels in Diablo 3. Likely due to the fact that those characters can't be wiped by a bad decision or ill preparation. (unless you consider hardcore mode in D3)\n\nEither way, a game being grind-y is not indicative of poor quality. It is a design decision. Just because it is a long road of learning mechanics and being properly prepared as well as learning when to cut your losses to reach the final end game does not invalidate the rest. If you only played 10 hours, never killed a boss or even completed a medium length quest and had 3 or more full party wipes I would STILL recommend the experience. I don't like the way people are changing needing to be coddled, that they must be allowed to see the credits roll and this is the developers job to do so. Darkest Dungeon is a difficult game if that's not your cup of tea go play Child of Light.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a phenomenal experience. Even if you do wipe you still have upgraded buildings in town and the knowledge of what makes a balanced team as in bleed effect abilities probably aren't a great idea in the Ruins because Skeletons don't have blood. Or a tactic I tried myself, dwindle a fight down to one weak enemy and stop attacking while using your abilities heath and stress included to try to get back into fighting shape. I myself have lost 2 level 2 fighters that were nearing 3 as well as 2 others half way through 1 because I got greedy on a short quest after completing it. I continued to explore the next 2 rooms. Full party wipe. I went back to the drawing board. Made sure my new recruits had complimentary abilities, upgraded those abilities afforded to me by the guild and pressed on.\n\n“Confidence, SURGES as the enemy crumbles.

It started out as a rogue-like with heavy Lovecraftian influences. Great artwork, soundtrack, and very cool and novel concepts such as "stress", "light levels", and encouraging team work. Sometimes you had to sacrifice a beloved character in order for the rest of the team to finish and level up. No problem there, it actually gave the game personality and added depth to the story. All of these great things are still in the game, but...\n\nThe game went really off-balance in the July 15 Build Update. Enemies get major boosts in crit damage and frequency, so most of your turns you will be healing. I get the idea behind having a corpse in the way after defeating an enemy, but when 2-3 hits to get rid of it, it gets annoying. Also, I like the fact that you can now die from stress. But, in a dungeon, stress builds up WAY faster than you can get rid of it. And you can only do so in:\na) Battle- Some characters can heal stress. During battle is when stress builds up the most, and the amount of stress healed is mostly insignificant.\nb) Camps- A lot of stress can be relieved here, but you can camp only so many times, and it can feel like a waste of resources if your HP are still high with a long road ahead of you.\nSo good luck with not dying of a heart attack during long dungeons. Please, add a stress relieving item if you are going to have stress be such a major issue.\n\nI know this is still Early Access, but hopefully developers pay more attention to negative reviews and actually do something about these issues. Avoid raging at your monitor and come back when these things are fixed.","August 15, 2015","false","30.1"," 64 of 109 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","64","109","5","0"

The systems are basically finished, with the team mostly just fine tuning now. The art is fantastic and imaginative, both with characters and environments, There is plenty to do. The game is only really missing the final two areas and and a handful of character classes, which should be arriving shortly.\n\nDD is a hard game. but it has an interesting fallback: heroes are free. You can recruit them endlessly, so it is nearly impossible to actually fail. Which is good because nasty things lurk in the depths. If you have read H.P. Lovecrafts works (and you should), then this will seem very familiar in a good way! Much like Lovecraft's protagonists, your heroes will mostly end their stories by going insane and dying.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting facets of the game: stress. In DD, your heroes are vulnerable and scared. They don't enjoy being assaulted by pig-men with bone clubs. Walking skeletons frighten them. Starvation is sad. Basically, they act a lot like real people, and its great!\n\nThe quirk system is similar. Your heroes acquire charactersitics as they plumb the depths, most of them weird. Your crusader may have been a holy hero once, but 10 weeks at the estate and he has become a nymphomaniac with syphillis and an obsession with corpses! Necrophilia, anyone? :P\n\nGetting good at the game will likely take awhile. There are a lot of classes, and each one has numerous skills they can use in battle and while camping. Learning how to managae your money, provision your party for journies, and what buildings to upgrade first can also be confusing. It is all very do-able, it mostly just takes time because it is different. You will get used to it if you give it a chance.\n\nBasically, DD takes a sort of George R.R. Martin view of adventuring. There are a lot of details that you do not encounter in, say, a Final Fantasy game. Heroes actually need food, for example. Torches don't last forever. Characters don't take crushing blows from a cleaver without reaction (sometimes they start screamng in unknown languages and then murder your hapless doctor...). It's a muddy, bloody good time. And larks for all ;)\n\nLast Words: Experimental game-design done right, with some fantastic art direction and ideas, that results in a RPG masterpiece. Keep up the fantastic work Red Hook Games!!\n\nEdit #1 (July 29, 2015)\nSo, I wanted to revisit this review after spending some time with the new updates. The game is progressing nicely, with some new bosses and various quality of life fixes. Definitely a lot of hard work being put into the game, and it looks like it is shaping up to be one of the best RPGs around. The developers have been very responsive and have accomodated the forum requests and suggestions of fans like myself to a suprising degree. Still a highly recommended game!\n\nEdit #2 (September 29, 2015)\nThe Cove update was just released, and the game seems to just be getting better and better! If you have been keeping tabs on the game, you know that there was a wave of backlash over the last while concerning certain gameplay changes. I hopw that the discerning gamers out there will try to look past these and try the game anyway. Most of the criticism is unjustified and mainly related to the nerfing of certain strategies (cheese strategies that were near game-breaking, by the way). Perfectly justified choice on the part of the developer, in my opinion. I will retrun to the game sometime after full release day and give my final impressions.\n\nEdit #3 (After Final Release)\nWell, the game is finally out. It's still good. It's not perfect and arguably did not live up to all of its promise, but is definitely worth the money. It is very hard, and can cause some frustration, so it is unsurprising that DD ended up being pretty divisive. If you enjoy rogue-likes, dungeon crawlers, or just plain hard games, then you've come to the right place!\nBut seriously, there's this weird smear campaign going on, led by people who apparently 1) take this game way too seriously and 2) are prone to some very weird conspiracy theories about "shills" and stuff. Ignore that. It's just a normal game.","March 29, 2015","true","39.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","0"

The fact that you can quit a dungeon at any time, and return to the exact place, means that I can get my 15-minute fix without fear of losing progress.  It is a brilliant feature.\n\nBeyond that, the art, audio, and gameplay are some of the best I've encountered in my 25 years of gaming.\n\nIf I were to offer some constructive criticism, I'd suggest including the following:\n- the ability to lock/remove positive quirks, as they're currently randomly replaced; this can limit one's opportunity to hone specific characters for specific areas.\n- the ability to sell trinkets, and for more varied ones to be offered in the shop; currently there aren't that many different ones on offer.\n- an option to swap weapons to gamble or min-max abilities.  For example, swapping a Crusader's sword for a warhammer might boost his attack but limit his accuracy.  Giving a Leper a pike could do the opposite.\n\nI can't wait for the new areas and the new classes.

Here me out. I am no meek gamer in the strategy world. I have completed Shogun 2 on Legendary and Xcom on Impossible Iron-man. I can take the beatings if the game world and mechanics make sense, and I get a feeling that I am contributing to my goal.\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon there is one difficulty. I suppose the designers have tried to incorporate what is known as cognitive flow in game theory [1], by allowing your to choose the level of dungeon you enter with your party. You can roughly match your party to a suitable dungeon in level-wise as well as tactics wise (if you go ruins, don’t take bleed damage, for one example).\n\nThen it becomes apparent that the designers have know idea what they are doing and then BREAK the cognitive flow by not allowing you to 'game the game'. You can't take a level 3 character into a level 1 dungeon. You can't use your battle skills outside of battle, but then you can't take an extra 2-3 rounds to heal wounds and stress because the game will punish you with more stress for bothering to try. Entering a level 5 dungeon is less like a move from 3 to 5, and more like a move from 3 to 10 if you know what I mean.\n\nBeyond the obvious imbalance in the game, the game will then double and triple punish you with it's inane random dice that I wonder why both with in the first place? Ironically the stress attacks in the game cause real stress to the player, because they are so frequent and critically boosted that it causes no-end to frustrations. Where is the fun lads?\n\nThe carry space is far too small for the amount of item types in the game, forcing more contrived choices with the only goal of annoying me further. There is not enough gold earned in the game. There are too many heirloom items in the game (used to unlock and build up your town).\n\nI am left to assume that the refusal to balance the game properly and provide either adequate difficulty modes or a proper working cognitive game flow, is a sign of artificially inflating the playtime of the title. Taken into account the annoying slow pop-ups that lock the control on the party, the tedious animation loops, and the drawn out combat; all of which compound to my suspicions.\n\nI hope with their financial success, they make another game and address these issues forthwith, but for me I didn't like this game despite really trying and pouring 50 hours into it. This is the counter point to looking for 'long games' to use as an example of 'good games'. This is the same problem with games like Counter Strike GO; were I clocked up 200 hours before a realisation of 'WTF am I doing'; I didn't actually enjoy nearly all of my time in those worlds. To me, they will be be forgotten and never explored again.\n\nWhat both these titles have in common is the overuse of catchy gimmicks in game-play and exploit this fully with shallow quest/rewards. The length of the game is not equal to the quality of my enjoyment. In both these games I was annoyed, frustrated, bored and wishing I would just find a better game to play.\n\n[1] http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php\n","April 16","false","58.6"," 84 of 146 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","84","146","6","3"

During the rest you get jumped by a group of monsters you killed off by the dozents before. But this group is the "cheating" one, almost all of their hits are criticals and they dodge most of your attacks. Before you can even take your first action, one of your group gets critted by the first mob, the second mob does an AoE and kills him off. It´s your turn but your stun doesnt stick (despite the +40% stun chance trinket) and your second attack gets dodged. Enemy turn, critical, next AoE and another one of the group is dead. You try to retreat on your next turn, of course you dont get away, next guy is down to zero hitpoints, then dies in the next round. Your last guy gets lucky and away in the next round.\n\nFirst time I thought: "Oh well, bad luck. I´ll just try again." So I start again to prepare that group, this time with a different mix of heroes...and now after the fourth of fifth time I can tell when that one fight comes and retreat just before I get wiped again. I wonder if that tactic is intended by the devs, but I guess not. It´s a build in mechanic to f*** you over as soon as you have a bit more cash, some high level characters or what god knows.\n\nAnyway, it feels like work and not like a game. It kept me busy, sure, but there are much better games out there that wont frustrate you and instead relax you and give you a good experience and not that kind of deep down angry feeling you get when you are getting cheated over and over.\n\n","October 12, 2015","false","99.0"," 91 of 159 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","91","159","6","5"

The shortest way to put it is the game is far too unforgiving, to the point that it will punish you even after a good performance. I will begin with the negatives and wrap up with the positives at the end, seeing as how I prefer to get the bad out before the good.\n\nGames like X-COM allow you to comfortably mitigate the randomness with proper strategy, skill, and caution. This game has many of the same elements: you need to know when to cut your losses on a mission or quest, you need to have good squad composition and know how to effectively use each class, you need to plan your missions and battles, and you need to use upgrades, abilities, and items to their fullest extent. The seeds are planted here for an excellent game.\n\nWhat lacks, however, is fairness and logic. When my entire squad misses their attacks or puts out a pittance, while the enemy continues to pummel me with a wealthy stream of critical hits several rounds and battles in a row - sometimes for an entire dungeon crawl - the game just becomes hard for the sake of it. It's also really ridiculous how an enemy critical hit will cause huge stress in the 10 and 20's for the entire team, while critical hits by my party reduces stress by maybe 5 if I'm lucky, and I'll be even luckier if it affects 2 or more party members. It all occurs too often.\n\nThen, in this game, the abilities your party uses are affected by positioning, and it's very common for sudden effects at the beginning of a battle to jumble where everyone is, and it's not entirely clear how this is factored. Not even initiatives are clear to me, with turn order going all over the place (although I may not be looking at the right places). Considering that it seems to always be random, and in favor of the AI, it ends up punishing players who do plan ahead with party positioning and composition. Even when your characters find maps or do (again, completely random) scouting and you know where the enemies are, they can still ambush you and throw your party into disarray despite their preparedness. Certain enemies have skills that do this and you can plan depending on where you are deploying, since enemy types differ by location, but the randomness is unfair.\n\nSure, there are the few dungeons or battles that went in my favor. I managed to surprise the enemy (how this works I do not know), pummel them all, and then walk away unscathed or with almost no damage. In fact, I've managed to have a few dungeons go like this, even if they're not as common as my party leaving the depths of my family's ruins with under 20% health and going insane from stress. You'd think that such a positive mission would be rewarded? Wrong. When your characters level up, they get completely random Quirks that are overwhelmingly negative and require a great deal of time and money to reverse.\n\nSo, even if the mission goes incredibly well, your adventurers suffering minimal to no stress or damage at the end, and you walked away with an immense amount of loot, the game does not reward your prudence and strategy. Instead, in most instances, it will still punish you. There is no logic. I had one of my adventurers with minimal damage and almost no stress at the end of a mission receive both the "On Guard" and "Off Guard" Quirks upon leveling up. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n\nIt is also possible for adventurers to gain both positive and negative Quirks by interacting with different objects while exploring, such as book cases, urns, and corpses. You will almost always get a heaping helping of negative ones, some of which can render your adventurer completely useless for in-game weeks as you dump thousands of gold into Sanitorium visits, which are used to remove negative Quirks. This renders the huge number of objects on missions utterly pointless as the risk of toying with them is far too high. This means that a great deal of what the developers have put in is, in fact, completely useless. The slim possibility that you will receive a positive trait that almost always offers little benefit stands in stark, bold-faced, italicized, and underlined contrast to the oft-crippling effects of negative Quirks.\n\nThen there is the confusing and counter-intuitive Provisions system. At the beginning of every mission, you must purchase food, torches, and any other items you think that you may need for the mission, such as bandages, healing herbs, skeleton keys (for locked chests), and shovels (for debris, which otherwise cost Health and Stress to remove). These items, however, are useless after the mission. There are permanent items in the form of charms and trinkets you can keep in a party inventory at home base (almost none of which you will use because the drawbacks of these trinkets render their buffs useless), but apparently your characters just throw away torches, potions, shovels, and other items that could last for months after leaving the dungeons. I could totally understand food being useless between the weeks, but it's really frustrating to buy items only to find they're useless in one particular crawl, and then to eschew them the next only to see that you need the items you did not buy in abundance.\n\nThere are still some real positives about the game. The issues I have mentioned are things that can be fixed with tweaking and do not require the developers to throw out huge chunks of what they've already made in order to rebuild. As it currently stands, the developers have an admirable piece of work. The art is very crisp and appealing, making the game just nice to look at. The upgrading system is not ovely punishing and even having to grind low-level dungeons for the items you need for upgrades is not terrible as it gives you the chance to level up newly-recruited adventurers and learn how they best function together (aforementioned issues notwithstanding).\n\nEven money seems to be balanced enough at the moment. The music is well produced and the game runs perfectly, at least on my rig, and it does not seem to be particularly demanding - which thus makes it an appealing game for people who have economy rigs. Animations are smooth and the narrator is interesting (although that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ can be really patronizing when you're losing, not to mention repetitive), offering commentary and even some bits of lore throughout your travels. There are a plethora of classes and skills which keep things interesting and give you a lot to play with as the in-game weeks press on and you continue to delve into the corrupted ruins your ancestor so feverishly pursued.\n\nWhat I love most about the Narrator's is his commentary about the player themselves: how far are you willing to go to redeem your fictitious family's honor, and do you really care about it versus the divers shinies you uncover in your wake? Admitting my own hubris, I have had an entire party wipe because I delved into the ruins for more goodies even after completing the quest goals.\n\nMy advice to the developers would be to make the game more fair and balanced. If you're going to make it punishing, make it punishing for a reason. There are far too many aspects of the game which are decided by pure chance, and this is both frustrating and insulting. It is frustrating to find yourself often punished even if you have a successful mission or make the strategically correct decisions, and it's insulting that the developers added in clear artificial difficulty at every chance, instead of fine tuning their game.\n\nIt deserves to be stressed yet again that I see a great deal of potential in this game and its developers. I like having some randomness to my games, or else they become easy and predictable once you figure out how it works. What Darkest Dungeon does, however, it is takes the randomness way too far. Should the developers make satisfactory changes, I will update my review in kind, and change my recommendation as such.","June 21, 2015","false","19.7"," 134 of 239 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","134","239","10","26"

That said, there's a lot of elements that are really just frustrating to deal with. The stress system, while sometimes fun (It feels pretty awesome when you hit 100 stress and your character gets a heroic bonus instead of crumbling under the stress like the majority of characters do) is more annoying than anything. When maximum stress hits the character has a heart attack, dropping their health to zero and debuffing them for the remainder of the dungeon, which can be a group killing experience. To avoid this you're expected to "treat" the character's stress by leaving them in the local bar or church while you go on your next adventure. This leads to a lot of characters leveling up at different rates. This wouldn't be too bad, but there's invisible barriers between characters of certain levels. For instance, level 3 characters can't embark with level 2 characters. This causes problems where the only characters available on your roster are two level 3s, and two level 2s, because everyone else is healing from stress or illness. Except you can't embark with that group, because theyre separate level groups. So what do you do? Well, you can either take a highly stressed character out of the bar or church because you need some lower leveled guys to adventure with to get some people up to level 3. I realize its supposed to be a matter of how to manage the team, but it's more frustrating than anything. A high stressed character IS going to have a heart attack during the dungeon and ruin the run, and dismissing them to hire a new recruit is just really annoying.\n\nThen there's the spontaneous difficulty spikes. For instance one dungeon, suggested for level 1 characters, asks you to kill a specific character, a "boss". The "boss" character all of a sudden is able to knock two characters down to 1 health in one attack, and gets multiple attack turns in one round. Meanwhile all before this I had been playing level 1 dungeons, others with boss characters that were nowhere near this difficulty. It's just ridiculous, because there's no reason or expectation of such power in a level 1 dungeon.\n\nThere's also the low drop rates of gold, which you need to spend more and more of on supplies just to survive the dungeon, but then also need to use to upgrade characters and heal their stress and ailments. There's barely enough money to go around, which makes advancing characters a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially when they'll just die to an encounter with an enemy like I mentioned in the last paragraph.\n\nOverall, I find the game frustrating, but there are redeeming aspects, like having a solid team making dungeons a challenging, but rewarding experience (but like I mentioned with the level-tier separations that can get messed up really quickly) I'd recommend it to people that like repeating tedious elements, because you will be losing characters, and re-running the same dungeons to level up new characters again. I've read that the game is more of a team-management game than a dungeon crawler, which kind of rings true. The important part of the game seems to be more in how you handle healing characters and the meager funds you get. If you're into that aspect, and dont care that much about whether your characters survive in the long run then you might like the game. I feel the game is misrepresented as a dungeon crawler RPG, and thats only a part of the game, which is more often frustrating than enjoyable. If all you want is to dungeon crawl, a different game might be more up your ally. If you want to manage your team of weaklings, and can accept that most of them are going to die then you might like the game.\n\nGenerally, I don't recommend the game, because I don't think it appeals to a wide audience and most people are going to go into it expecting an experience much different than what it actually is, but if you fall within a specific niche of gamers that prefer team-management games and grim-dark fantasy you might be one of the people that really like Darkest dungeon.","April 15","false","13.7"," 52 of 88 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","52","88","2","0"

This is the game for you if you're a supernaturally lucky person. Otherwise, can't recommend.\n\nThe good: The writing is excellent. The graphics do a very good job of getting the overall mood across and are creepy without getting overboard. The character classes are quite interesting. The music and sound effects are also pretty cool, and I love the overall idea of this game. However...\n\nThe bad: Success or failure is mostly random. This makes the game difficult, as advertised, but it is an extremely frustrating sort of difficulty. The game may give you a mission with eight combat rooms and corridors full of further combats and traps, or it may generate a mission with tons of loot and maybe a single fight. In combat, one crit from your enemy - or even an enemy using a particular attack, chosen at random - will often lead to a situation going rapidly out of control. If your party ever gets surprised (random chance), you may as well pack in then and there. You'll frequently have to skip a full turn to get everyone into a position where they can actually do something, and by that time your party will have a crippling amount of damage inflicted on it. It is generally not possible to salvage a bad situation. Some afflictions are utterly crippling, some stressed-out characters will skip their turns, whether a character who is "at Death's Door" will live is up to chance and so forth. Abandoning a mission (if you can roll a success on your flee-from-combat attempt!) will leave you with a group of stressed-out characters and not enough money to outfit a worthwhile expedition, so you'll have to go back to grinding the Ruins for a while so you can get another shot at the success roulette. Most combat skills also have random effects (apart from miss chance and dodge chance); the Occultist's heal skill, for instance, can do anything from "heal 10" to "inflict 3". This is not good gameplay. This is a slot machine.","June 2, 2015","false","129.5"," 120 of 214 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","120","214","14","3"

The dungeons are hard but also rewarding and interesting, your characters grow or die, develop their individual traits and get on your nerves with their quirks (in a good way).\n\nThe fun ends once your characters level up to the higher quest tiers. There are level 1, 3, 5 and with the Darkest Dungeon presumably level 6 quests. Once your characters reach the respective level, they refuse to go on lower level quests, which generally would be fine. The problem is that the difficulty scaling from one tier to the other is insane and level ups themselves don't do anything for the characters. You will therefore be massively "underleveled", if you haven't been extremely successfull in upgrading your guild and your smithy and getting loads of money to then actually upgrade your heroes. You can then either send your best guys on runs they're not prepared for and either see them die or spend most of the money you get on their recovery OR you grind ridiculously small rewards with new arrivals.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the RNG but I honestly didn't have any issues with that. Yes, sometimes it can feel unfair and your party gets ♥♥♥♥ed because of a series of terrible rolls, but other times you'll see them destroy a boss with him barely being able to get a hit in, so... yeah, that's RNG for you.\n\nWhat really ruins this game for me is its insane difficulty scaling and artificially stretched length. I have started a couple of runs and have never gotten past the level 3 quests. To be fair, I can be pretty bad at video games but it seems like a lot of people are having similar experiences, so I don't think it's just entirely that.\n\nThe game still has a lot of good elements and I can't say I completely advice people not to buy it. It's just that actually finishing it is an enormous pain in the ♥♥♥ and I'd reckon most people won't actually see the end if they're not extremely determined and have a very high tolerance for frustration.\n\nMakes for great streams though.","February 8","false","44.6"," 55 of 94 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","55","94","4","0"

I bought it following a recommendation from a friend. I've barely touched any of the other games I bought during the steam sale. I ended up playing about 24 hours in the first week. I think it's the challenge. The fact that knowing that at any moment, everything could just go to ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- "Bugs, huh? I gotta fight bugs?

Like when all my characters died of heart attacks all at the same time. Who knew the Apprentice Necromancer was also a Krispy Kreme vendor? (also registered trademark) It may require some patience to endure the painful "learning experiences" of the game (although from what little I've seen of the most recent update, it looks like they're working to make the game less mysterious), but I never really considered the momentary confusion or unpleasant sudden realizations to ever outweigh the fun of playing. Honestly I rather enjoyed discovering the mechanics for myself.\n\nAll in all, the game is very challenging, highly addictive, pleasing to the eye and the sanity mechanics add an extra dynamic both in terms of game mechanic and in developing an emotional attachment to your cannon fodder (I mean...when you're one Obdurous Advancement away from a party wipe and your sexy booty ♥♥♥♥♥ hellion becomes Heroic and lets loose a raucous war cry as she cleaves a shamblers head off with one well placed justice crit it's kinda hard NOT to buy her a drink afterwards and offer to bear her children, yano?)\n\nHighly Recommended/10\nPlay your way to madness.","July 17, 2015","true","33.5"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","29","46","5","1"

Allow me to explain: Your characters level when you take them into the dungeon, but around level 4 your higher level characters will refuse to go to the lower level dungeons to help escort and level your lower-level characters. It's more or less suicide/disaster when you bring your lower level characters to higher level dungeons. This took me several hours to discover, otherwise I would have continued escorting all my low-level characters up to a decent level. It requires careful planning to make sure the exp gets spread out so no one char gets too high and becomes unusable until the rest of your team catches up(or fails to catch up because an A-lister can't go in your dungeons anymore). The problem occurs when some of your A-team chars die or are out of commision for awhile and your B-team can't compete in the current dungeons. Painstakingly raising rookies to even B-team status will literally take hours, assuming all goes well.\n\nIt gets to a point where instead of "oh crap, a char died, I'll just start over my 2-8 hour game" you go "oh crap, a char died, I can either trash my 8-12 hour game, or try to get back into it by investing 3 hours into a rookie and try to salvage all the time I put in". It becomes quite tedious.\n\nALLLLLL this could be alleviated if you could buy higher level characters(for a higher price, or not even characters that rival your high level chars, maybe just level 2 so you don't need to spend 2-3 hours grinding a few levels for your rookies).\n\nAll in all, I think this game needs work.

On the positive side, the gameplay is good and engaging. It's fun to build parties with various synergies and see how they tackle the challenges this game throws at you. The artstyle is fantastic as well, and all the classes feel varied enough to remain interesting. So what are the real problems with this game? Bottom line, it comes down to one thing:\n\nYou probably won't finish it.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is many things, fun yes, challenging and even unfair at times, but what it is more than anything else? It is repetitive.\n\nProgression happens very, very slowly in the game, as your heroes gradually rank up if they do not manage to succumb to the horrors and RNG of the dungeons. Things also get progressively more expensive. One of the main challenges in this game is maintaining expenses. Everything is expensive, and the amount of money you get from dungeons, even in dark runs, isn't sufficient to cover your costs. You have to make sacrifices, and its very difficult to get and remain ahead. Accidents happen, and runs will go poorly. You must pay for stress treatment and disease treatment, and upgrades are expensive and must be purchased. I honestly feel like in some respects, the game is a budgeting simulator. I don't think that is particularly fun.\n\nThe other major issue is that to lengthen the game, you must fight nearly every boss 3 times, each on a different difficulty. They don't actually change in any aspects other than their stats, so this feels like a grind and a way to pad the game out to be much longer than it actually needed to be. They would be better off removing variations of the bosses, and shortening the game up. I'm nearly 30 hours in at the time of this review, and still have to kill many bosses, nearly all of which are simply beefed up versions of bosses I've beaten before. Repetition is not fun for a player. Nobody likes doing the same thing multiple times if nothing is going to change. I don't mind the difficulty, but the grind and repetition is excessive, and will be too much for most people to actually hunker down and finish the game.\n\nSo all in all, I'm conflicted. This game's core systems are fun, but it's mired down by an overwhelming grind and expense management. Simply due to the fact that most people won't have the stomach to fight through the whole thing, I can't honestly reccommend it on good conscience. It is a fun game, and I would recommend buying it IF and ONLY IF you are aware before hand that you will likely lose heart, and this will be a game you never finish. Not because of difficulty, but because you just got tired of doing the same thing over and over when it simply wasn't necessary to do so.","May 29","false","58.8"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","5"

In a gaming universe now littered with embarrassingly amateurish "shovelware,"  insipid "AAA" titles that usually amount to little more than more of the same with minor tweaks (but with eye-bleeding super-realistic graphics that require mega-GPUs to get 25 fps - another sad trend as of late), and just plain scams where devs promise one thing, deliver another, and disappear into the ether with your cash, a game like Darkest Dungeon (DD) gives me hope that my once favorite hobby has some life in it yet.\n\nWhat is amazing is that DD treads a well-worn road.  At its heart, DD is just another "roguelike" dungeon crawler.  But what elevates DD to its own lofty pedestal is a simple question: would professional dungeon crawlers develop PTSD?  At first, you laugh at the idea.  But then you stop and think about it.  Given how your typical fantasy dungeon crawl not only involves the type of brutal combat that any modern soldier would understand, but also a host of horrors - such as demons, giant spiders, and other abominations- on top of THAT, the answer would seem to be: oh heck yeah.  I guess they really would!\n\nThat is the heart of Darkest Dungeon.\n\nDarkest Dungeon puts the player not just in charge of clearing dungeons, but also of managing the mental health of their assailed heroes.  In DD, the player must send teams of four adventurers (whom come from a nicely varied assortment of classes) to clear dungeons from around half a dozen thematic designs (ruins, warrens, etc.).  This part of the game is great fun.  Resembling a side-scroller, your adventurers, whom are brought to life with some wonderfully hand drawn artistry reminiscient of a Brothers Grimm fairytale, clear out a series of rooms and passages (randomly generated and populated with monsters, traps and loot, of course) in a dungeon of various sizes, some  so big that your team will need to camp inside a few times.  Such moments are a lot of fun as it involves its own unique gameplay of recuperation and campsite chatter.  Battle is handled in a wonderful turn-based fashion (love it; so glad to see devs getting away from click-fest RTS games) with both sides using their weapons and skills to strike each other down, something wonderfully enhanced by a narrator who comments on the action with a voice right out of, yes!,  a Grimm's fairytale.  But here is the important kicker: as your adventurers explore and battle their way through a dungeon, the game tracks stress points individually.  So, for example, if your man-at-arms suffers a critical hit at the hand of a foe, his stress level will go up, as might the stress of the other party members.  On the other hand, if he deals a devastating riposte, his stress might go down, and so on.  If stress accumulates to a certain degree, the adventurer might have a mental break.  It is here that the game begins to resemble Crusader Kings 2 in that each adventurer can accumulate a mix of up to a dozen vices and virtues that will affect their performance.  So, that man-at-arms who was almost killed might become a coward when he has his mental break, something that might debuff his stats or make him miss a turn.  Or, maybe he overcomes his fear and gets a virtue instead: he becomes heroic and urges his party to fight harder, reducing stress for all and buffing combat stats.  See how it works?  It is quite fun and adds a wonderful novelty to the game!  But be warned: if your adventurer becomes too stressed, he can actually die of a heartattack!\n\nSpeaking of heartattacks, that is what might happen to the gamer when he loses one of his star adventurers to permadeath.  Yeah, this game has that.  Personally, I love permadeath because nothing ruins a tale of adventuring heroism when the player can just "save and restore."  Face it: S&R is just immortality by another name.  How can there be true heroism if the hero is never truly at risk?  But that is just my two cents.  Be that as it may, this game has permadeath, so be prepared to lose some of your best players to the evil machninations of the "random number generator" that governs many aspects of this game.  If you hate such mechanics, than this game is not for you.\n\nWhat happens when your adventurers leave a dungeon, assuming they survive?  Here, the game takes on an XCOM-like factor where base management comes into play.  In between dungeon crawls, the player can send his adventurers out with bags of gold to help them blow off steam in six different ways, from getting drunk, to praying at the abbey.  Of course, this takes these adventurers out of the game for at least a week - I say "at least a week" becayse random events occasionally trigger where, say, your knight gets drunk and wanders the town for two weeks in a state of inebriation!  LOL!  That actually happened to one of my adventurers.  Not only did he go AWOL for an extra week, be he lost the magic trinket I gave him!  Hence, the player needs to have a deep bench of adventurers to keep the gaming moving along, something that is not initially difficult as the local stage coach brings in a steady supply of new victi...er, adventurers.\n\nIn addition to managing the stress of your bench, you can also train new skills, upgrade armor and weapons, upgrade facilities, treat the mental and physical ailments your adventurers acquire in the darkest dungeons, and select the next adventure and get kitted out for it.\n\nAnd that is pretty much the basics of the game in a nutshell.  Again, with the exception of the stress factor, nothing revolutionary.  But RedHook, with feedback from the community (this is EA done right!), applied so much thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and ol' fashioned love to their project that what has emerged out the other end may well be Game of the Year material for the PC.  Frankly, it has been a very long time since I have so thoroughly enjoyed a game.   With the devs already promising a new class of adventurer as well as "town events" in the near future gratis - the town does need some enlivening as it feels a little static and dull at times, so I am glad to hear this - I think the Darkest Dungeon has a VERY bright future ahead of it.  It certainly has already rocketed to the top of my favorite games list!","January 22","true","22.6"," 71 of 124 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","71","124","9","0"

Sure RNG helps keep things freash for a short time, but this is a massive overdose of it.\n\nIt's just not fun anymore, the reward you get from finsihing a quest hardly ever makes up for the ever rising cost of healing your party's stress and verious illnesses. You don't ever get the feeling of progression. A constant state two steps forward and three steps back looms over you through the entierty of the play session.\n\nThe game simply lacks consistancy, it's very hard to learn when you can't tell if the effect was the game giving you yet another middle finger, or it was becuase you did somthing wrong, making this profoundly diffucult for new players to start with the laerning curve.  was an 8/10 to start but with the most recent updates, its bumped down to a 4/10 would not buy.","August 18, 2015","false","7.3"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","32","52","6","0"

It ultimately feels like a highly polished smartphone game: all treadmill and no destination.\n\nFundamentally, the game wants you to toy with villainy, tasking you with renovating your haunted estate on the backs of an endless supply of expendable heroes. At first glance, this works pretty well. You send a colorful cast of characters through four zones of procedurally-generated room progressions, encountering spooky doodads, slaughtering monsters, and collecting loot as you protect your heroes' bodies and minds. But after a short while, it drifts into purposelessness. Clear an expedition and you're rewarded with another one that's no different. Defeat a boss only to learn that he has a palette swap (two, actually) standing a dozen missions behind him. Level up a hero and (after jumping though entirely too many hoops) raise all of his numbers a tiny amount while leaving him functionally the same. Lose a hero and replace him with another barely different one. Even the system of perks fails to individualize units, since you'll usually end up selecting for "better at the only thing this class does" traits that don't exactly scream personality.\n\nThe expeditions themselves fare no better. Most of your time will be spent in the innovative combat system, which restricts units' abilities and targeting capabilities by marching order. But as before, this makes a great first impression before sinking into drudgery. Heroes generally have little mobility and even less desire for it, encouraging a static formation that spams its most effective abilities. Enemy formations consist almost entirely of meaty tanks up front and stress-inducing mage types in back. It doesn't take long to realize that every fight has you stunning a few folks, killing the back, mopping up the front line, rinse and repeat. When not fighting, you have scattered opportunities to set camp for the night and recuperate or to investigate madness-inducing curios littering the estate, but as with everything else the volume of ideas fails to hide the lack of depth. When each decrepit hall looks and demands the same approach as the last, the tension gives way to tedium.\n\nIt bears repeating Darkest Dungeon presents a wealth of excellent ideas worth exploring. It's just a pity that it didn't bother to.","June 5","false","76.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The only way to heal is in-combat as each food heals only one HP. Having to grind 5 mins in a combat by chain-stunning an enemy is not the way to go. Also, there are not enough stun and heal skills to reliably pull this off early-game.\n\nItems are way too expensive. The item pouch is too small, given the plethora of mechanics in this game (torch level, stress, bleed, blight, HP, artifact cleansing, path clearing, etc). Even after ending a dungeon, players should be able to keep the items for the next quest.\n\nThe combat mechanics are too RNG-based, rather than skill-based. Opponents seem to dodge a significantly larger amount than the player.\n\nKeep in mind that the villains' attacks also out-hit the players in HP and stress, which makes it tough as you will need to heal for two categories at a large cost.\n","August 12, 2015","false","7.3"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","33","54","4","0"

The depth and difficulty are superficial and short-lived. $20 PC game now, or $5 (or less) on mobile platform.\n\nThe concept is brilliant and unique, the art and design are inspired. However, everything about the game seems to indicate that its primary purpose is to test out how well it can be ported into mobile formats.\n\nEdit:\nOn its Kickstarter page, the game was advertised as "Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring."\n\nAs a backer i am still disappointed by several parts of this description.\n\nThe game is not challenging. (the game feels and plays more like a slot machine or a game of poker, you have very little input, and what little challenge is there is only exists on the surface. the challenge is easily overcome in a few hours. certain additions have been made to provide more challenge, but they only increased the tedium of the game. making the game require more grinding, and drawing out every battle is not a substitute for depth or difficulty)\n\nThe game is not a rougelike in any way. (your heroes suffer from permadeath, if you let it go that far, but you as a player suffer NO consequences as a result of letting individual heroes or even whole teams get wiped out. Heroes are a free resource that you can keep obtaining and accumulating)\n\nThe game is not an RPG. (the game is more like a hero management simulator, you can make improvements to your hero's skills and items, as well as determining the party composition and their position within the group. There is no story nor any role-playing element to the game.)\n\nThe game has no adventuring. (everything about the game can be seen within a few hours. in each location there are only 5, give or take a few depending on the location, different variations of fights to be had before seeing a boss or fully exploring the dungeon. The misssions themselves have very little variety,and any sort of risk/reward for pressing further into a location is almost non existant.)\n\nThe game we are being sold certainly doesnt feel like it belongs on PC, nor is it the game that was originally pitched or is currently being advertised.","August 6, 2015","false","7.9"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","34","56","3","8"

First of all let me say that I loved this game, it's seriously a lot of fun. It has a lot of customization, many different hero classes to play as and many different moves for each of your party members. The atmosphere and artstyle are also fantastic with a dark comic book feel that really immerses you while you play. The dialouge is also fantastic! The person doing the voice acting does a really nice job. Now, for the negatives, after a while playing this game I was having a blast and I was really enjoying it. I had gotten up to level 3 people and I was having a blast. But I started realizing that I had very little impact on how my people die. RNG dictates COMPLETELY how any run goes, not your skill. For example I got into a fight after I was done camping (no, not an ambush in the next room over) and all of my people were either at or damn near max HP and very low stress. Upon entering the room I went about the fight as I had for 5 hours prior, nothing seemed different during turn one. However then my plauge doctor got hit with a 37 HP critical attack and had bleed inflicted, and then died when his turn came. I can deal with that, one unlucky death, oh well. However then on the next turn the same enemy attack 2 of my men with one move and guess what! Another crit! Except this time it was a double critical attack that dealt nearly 20 damage to both my party members, putting them at high stress and low HP. Then immediately after my party was blanket fired and guess what, ANOTHER CRIT 5-6 damage dealt to every one of my party members and even more stress. At this point 2 of my guys were on deaths door and were broken with stress. I promptly left the dungeon and got a quest failed. I'm not writing this review to cry about one incident, throughout my playtime I found that in combat my choices didn't dictate who survived and how well I did, but rather it was ALL based on RNG. Why continue to play a game where ultimately you don't have any control on what plays out, as one string of ridiculous crits can wipe out your entire party? I don't know what the devs can do to patch this, because RNG is based around every event in the dugeon so there's not much they could do to remove it.\n\nPROS\n-Awesome art style\n-Excellent dialouge\n-Diverse selection of characters and skills\n-Cool town mechanics\n-Addictive\n\nCONS\n-The game crashes every now and then\n-Some UI quirks\n-RNG based everything makes the game feel more like a slot machine than a rougelike","February 8, 2015","false","22.4"," 123 of 222 people (55%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","55","123","222","12","14"

Yes, the game is a challenge, the game is tactic based and yes the game has a big replay value until a certain point. While you might feel you mastered the dynamics, the trinkets/spells/camping setup, the RNG and unbalanced minions will eventually beat you after you start doing the champion challenges. You might feel that everything is doing fine after you realize that the minions stats do not really scale with your heroes stats meaning that the higher level you get, the lower damage you deal due to the fact that every minion now has ridiculou dodge/prot/crit ratings which makes the no longer a challenge but a dice roll. The size 2 minions can one shot you with non crit atacks (treebranch smackdown from the troll hits for 30+ non crit, 55+ crit), the bleed/blight now deals an insane amount of damage per turn while the game absolutely ignores your resists. I have for example 90%+ on both bleed and blight but I would still only resists those kind of atacks about 2/10 times. As for today I lost 4  lvl 6 characters in only an hour gameplay (dont have to mention how long it takes to pimp out your heroes) because I just wouldnt beat the dice rolls (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instagibs, bleed/blight dealing 12 per tick..) which makes it utterly frustrating experience. There is just still so much work to be done on this game and if you dont want to rage destroy your rig I suggest you play something where only your decisions and skills have the impact on the game. This game so far is fairly both luck based and improperly mechanized while being pretty unrewarding at the same time.\n\nI am pretty sure that once proper changes are made this game will kick asses but as for now that is not the case.

I had just started feeling good about my chances with this game. I had learned the main mechanics, put together a party I was confident in, and was on the way to beating my most difficult quest to date.\n\nThen, something unexpected happened. The boss, exploiting a mechanic I had not seen yet, decimited the health of all my heros in one round.\n\nOne. Round.\n\nIn an instant my entire situation had flipped. From full health to everyone suddenly knocking at deaths door. From feeling optomisticly confident, to feeling like I had no chance in hell. One, round.\n\nThe next few rounds I tried diligently to staunch the bleeding that had occured to no avail, my whole party wiped, as I could never recover. And not only did I lose the time and money invested in grooming those heros, I lost the few pieces of legendary gear I had that had enabled most of my smooth progress. It was a beyond devestating defeat.\n\nThis is normally the point of a game where I reload, start from scratch, or begin a new save to correct refine my tactics and correct my failure. The magic of this game is the fact that the way it is designed, reloading and restarting is completely un-necessary. You gain exctly nothing from starting over a new campaign, which I think is a brilliant design point to make. And since there is no way to reload, you have to learn how to accept defeat and move on.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nThere's only one problem. That wouldn't be my first wipe.\n\nThe next day, I got back on the proverbial horse and started again. I groomed fresh troops to go back to the same mission and eventually avenge my original fallen party. It took a few days, but I did it. The confidence was back, the swagger regained.\n\nAnd unfortunately, sadly, pathetically, the same unavoidable cycle repetead itself 2 more times, each failure successively more demoralizing than the one before it. 3 total times, my party wiped from some previously unforseen mechanic activating that totally flipped the tables no matter how well provisoned and prepared I might have been. The very last wipe I slammed my desk and haven't opened the game since.\n\nHerein lies the question.\n\nUltimately, is the game at times gorgeous, wonder-inducing, challenging, and terror-invoking?\n\nYes. Without question, yes.\n\nAnd at other times, is the game gimmicky, niche, and disengenuous in the sense that, it may lead to believe that you are prepared for what lies ahead, but unless you sink hours into trial in error wipes or research fights in advance, you will ultimately have the tables turned upside-down on you no matter what, because the developers specifically want you to fail in such a devestating way? In other words, are you okay with walking into a trap that you have no way to counter without some research and some good rng? Some people may not like the feeling of being setup, as I certainly did not. In fact, I haven't re-opened the game since that last wipe. And while I might one day muster up the pride to go back, I could also very well choose not to and maybe live a life better off for it.\n\nOnly time can tell.\n\nFor now, though it is a great game, I'm advising no as a reccomendation simply because I've had it, after 27hrs. Maybe I'll go back one day and get to 100, and then in terms of value I will change the review to yes. Maybe other reviewers got their moneys worth already despite all I've said and will put yes.\n\nFor me, and my rng karma though, the answer for now is no.","January 27","false","28.9"," 64 of 113 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","64","113","8","3"

But the higher level you get and the better trinkets you earn, you will learn what combinations work well together and you will turn the RNG in your favor.\n\nFor only $20 at the time of this review, I would definitely say it is worth every cent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bajiru/recommended/262060/","Bajiru","Alfa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bajiru/","83 products in account","Darkest Dungeon is a "rogue-like", turn-based game where you explore four different areas of levels to reclaim back the lands your ancestor lost. The reason I am reluctant to say rogue-like is that each level feels 95% similar to the last. The area may be different in layout, yet that makes minimal difference and this title does not deserve to be in the rogue-like genre. In each level, you not only have to manage health with your max of 4 character party, but also stress, a statistic that causes detrimental affects as it gets higher. When a character dies, IT'S DEAD FOREVER. It's a cool mechanic, and offers a challenge that sometimes is reasonable.\n\nI really wish I could recommend this game. The first parts of it are really fun, admiring the artwork and effort put it with lore and classes, and being curious and ready for a challenge. After a certain point, as in once you start going into Difficulty 3 (Veteran) levels, it gets ridiculous. It's a huge jump up, even with upgrading weapons and armors of your class and using people who are better geared for certain areas. You get two major problems: HAVING TO GRIND A TON AND RNG RIDICULOUSNESS. The game becomes 90% luck, and A LOT less skill based. For going to those next stages of levels, you have to grind with low-level characters, since higher-level characters refuse to partake in lower-level quests. After all that preparation, it's unsatisfying. You just feel more stress, and hate the game. The RNG is EXCRUCIATING, it makes me want to rip my limbs off with my teeth at times.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, and creative. Yet that's all that's going for it. It's REPETETIVE, and not difficult in the fact where you can take the blame. It's not like, "Oh, my party died because of my fault." It's mostly, "My party died to RNG being a ♥♥♥♥♥ with critical hits and stress chance as well". It's infuriating, and my largest pet peev is THE PRICE.\n\nThis game does not deserve a 20$ range at all. 15$ at most. The gameplay is too repetitive to price people in such a high range for a lack of hours and difference.\n\nDon't buy it, if you want a challenging game, play the Souls series.","June 5","false","9.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The combat in my opinion seems unbalanced highly favoring the enemy modes you will face. The rewards are always two edged and exploration usually leads to ruin. Another annoying factor is more powerful heros can't help lower level ones after a point.

A lot of the percieved difficulty I see others describe seems to be a combination of not understanding the game (or taking the time to learn it) and not being willing to use a variety of strategies and approaches.\n\nThe art is great. The characters are fun and interesting.\n\nBut its the tactical depth that really gives the game super high ratings from me. Yes its hard and sometimes the RNG will seem unfair (the nature of RNG). But thats a whole intentional element of the strategic depth of the game. The disclaimer at the start of the games tells you that DD is about making the best of a bad situation.\n\nYou will be on dungeon runs that are going great and quickly start going horribly wrong. You are forced on the fly to make strategic adaptations to survive and continue or risk/reward analysis about fleeing the combat or abandoning the dungeon run entirely. I love that. I want to be challenged. I want to sometimes be put it what some describe as "unfair situations" despite my best planning and preparation. Thats an opportunity strategically delicious decision making. Few games do this.\n\nIf you are into X-Com played on Ironman mode you will probably like this game as there is no save scumming allowed. X-com is by for the game whose RNG and its effect on your tactical decision making most closely mirrors DD of games I have played. I am like 80 hours or so in and am still learning different ways to combo the heros, their abilities, and the lineup.\n\nFor the first 20 hours or so I didnt even realize this game was in beta. Sure I have run into at least one odd bug but its remarkably polished for a beta, I am excited to see Redhooks take on endgame content once they release that with the actual release of the game.\n\nHonestly while the game is on the challenging side, its not nearly as hard as some reviewers make it out to be. If you are willing to change/evaluate your tactics, run from fights/abandon quests when things go terribly RNG wrong, and use the info on forums and the wiki to make better tactical decisions in group composition for the dungeon you are tackling and curios you activate you are probably the type of gamer who will really enjoy this game.\n\nAlso, it captures the Call of Cthulhu feel very well, especially with all the insanity stuff and real risk of death of your heros.\n\nThis is a true gem. Best game I have tried in quite some time.","October 28, 2015","true","176.4"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","42","72","0","8"

Now, I've not gotten very far into the game, as it just constantly makes me frustrated and unhappy, But from what I've seen of it, it's a pretty neat setting and I just wish that I could enjoy it more.\n\n-The art style is pretty fantastic, I love the art style and look of the game.\n\n-There are quite a variety of heroe types to choose from and there seems to be a great deal of customizability to the game.\n\nNow what I don't like.\n-Stress is incredibly difficult to manage. Stress causes all kinds of negative stuff to your heroes, some times devestating stuff, it's expensive to get rid of and is accumulated all of the damn time. The more stress your heroes have, the more bat-♥♥♥♥ insane they get and the more stat penalties they incur. Stat penalties are also expensive to get rid of.\n\n-The torch system in this game is also very difficult to manage. You have to buy torches at the beginning of an expedition and you have to use them to recharge your light as you make your way through the dungeon. My issue with them is that the lower your light gets the more stress your heroes suffer from and the more difficult the monsters become, and torches do not last long at all, I often times will have to use up two of them just to get between rooms.\n\n-My biggest complaint and the primary reason I keep quitting out of frustration, is how you constantly have to micromanage your expenses. You get gold from completing expeditions and you must spend that gold on upgrading the abilities and gear for your heroes, providing leasure activities for your heroes so they don't go bat-♥♥♥♥ insane and on consumable items used during expeditions.\n\nNot that big of a deal, the problem for me is specifically in reguard to the consumable items, you have to do some major guess work(or clever statistical calculation) in order to make sure you have enough to keep your party from dying horribly or going insane. Now, I am not a statistician so I cannot do the clever statistical calculating to make sure I have enough to stay alive and even if I could, there's a very serious randomness to the entire game. Even if you math out the most efficient use of your gold to gear to abilities to leasure to items, you still will probably get screwed over during the expedition. Perhaps you didn't pack enough food to feed your heroes(yes you have to feed your heroes at least a couple times, if not more, during an expedition) and the RNG didn't provide you with food as treasure, or perhaps you didn't pack enough torches so you run out of torches and your heroes either go totally bonkers or die horribly in battle. Maybe you couldn't afford enough bandages and that damn pig creature just kept making your heroes bleed and they died of blood loss. Maybe you couldn't afford enough antivenom to heal the poison(or blight as it's called) that the mushroom mutants constantly cause. There is no item to heal the huge stress that the undead inflict to your heroes, the only time you can do that is when you spend gold and keep the hero out of the following expedition(and you must attempt an expedition every single day(or week as they call it), you can't skip weeks!).\n\nEvery time I play I feel like I'm beating my head endlessly against a wall. It is very stressful to have to guess so much about what to expect or plan for in a given dungeon because more often than not, the random number generator will completely screw you over. In fact, everything about this game seems to be random, everything from what heroes you get to pick from after the introduction to how much and of what types of loot you aquire in a dungeon. Everything from what happens to your heroes during combat to what groups of enemies you run into. Even the effects of stress on your heroes is random. Sometimes you just get an amusing phobia, other times your hero gets a debilitating debuff that will have a real, sometimes crippling effect in game.\n\nI understand that the developers wanted to create a challenging game, I understand that they wanted to create a game that elicits a sense of crushing hopelessness. They very much succeeded, perhaps they succeeded a too well. The randomness coupled with the micromanagment this game expects just overwhelms and frustrates me to the point where I simply don't enjoy myself and enjoyment is the whole reason one plays a video game.\n\nI'd play the hell out of this game if they just allowed us to customize the difficulty, but the only way to make the game less difficult is through a mod that alters the game files and that mod doesn't really do much to lessen the cruelty built into this game.","February 8","false","12.2"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","35","59","3","0"

Now after playing the game some more I can safely recommend it.\n\nAlthough it is roguelike it plays as a side scrolling dungeon crawler with parties of four. You are situated in a village allowing for weapon and skill upgrades as well as the recruiting of new adventurers (expect some to die along the way). There are quite varied classes, although maybe another tyoe of party healer is required, as there are only two classes that do this role effectively. As you complete each dungeon you get heirlooms, these can then be used to upgrade your village amenites. You can choose out of a few areas at once with bosses along the way to fight, meaning you won't get stuck in just one area with the smae baddies for ages. The combat can be challenging but not impossible (as far as I know, I am still near the start).\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the stress effect on your characters as you explore each dungeon. Some are positive but most are negative. For instance they might become abusive to other adventurers increasing their stress or paranoid and avoid being healed etc. To help with this you use the tavern or the abbey to calm them down. Meaning you will constantly be rotating your party for each mission. There are also disease effects to account for and sometimes personal preference like being god fearing etc.\n\nThe art style itself is fairly unique and very atmospheric and the voice acting of the plot driver is fantastic.\n\nIt is a fun game that pushes the boundaries of the genre and can be played in short doses with persistent progression to your village and characters, if they survive that is...","February 2","true","8.0"," 91 of 164 people (55%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","55","91","164","16","7"

That horrible realisation came to me when I had yet another one of my characters die because the game's mechanics are so utterly arbitrary, convoluted and befuddling that I can have my most skilled warriors miss attacks time after time and there is literally no way to anticipate or counter the sheer randomness of the game's rules. Accomplishments in this game are treated as insults, I have never seen another game be so utterly meanspirited when it comes to making progress; high level characters suddenly refuse to go on missions and become so "stressed" that they actually become a liability, wasting time and money trying to heal them. I lost two of my best characters killing a boss and when the mission was completed I got almost no reward, no new areas, no special equipment, buffs or any sign of progress. The game just went "♥♥♥♥ you for killing our boss. Now do it again. And again. And again." Combat in this game only gives the vague illusion of strategy; so much of the game is based on chance, which would be fine but the parts that are based on skill are almost impossible to work out and are governed by random factors which basically make it poinltess to even try. To top it off the enemies are just overpowered to the point of idiocy; the very few rules that actually govern combat just don't apply to your opponents, character positioning, buffs and targetting just get left by the wayside while they continue to rain hell on your characters with no indication that you're going part way to killling them. Meanwhile your characters get subjected to all sorts of pointless and petty rules and factors which just limit the entire game experience completely. The turn timer is a particular favourite; I once had two enemeis have four turns one after the other before my characters had even had their first go and there is literally nothing that can be done about it, apparently speed is a governing factor but its nigh on impossible to find your character's speed nor is it possible to actually understand what is considered good speed or find out how it compares to the speed of your enemies.\n\nThe thing is I like a challenging game and turn based combat is good fun but this game makes challenge and combat frustrating and utterly boring. Xcom is one of my favourite games but in that game you can understand the limitations and rules governing the game, similarly with darksouls the game is unbelievably hard but you can work strategy into your game and when you make progress you actually make progress, the game rewards you in ways Darkest Dungeon just refuses to. I will say that this is one of the most beautifully designed and atmospheric games I've ever played, for several hours the game can fully immerse you in its world delightfully and then you just find yourself fighting stupidly frustrating and drawn out battles and while initially the sense of triumph after completing a level will keep you going for a while there comes a point where it just stops being fun.\n\nI know that responses to this post are going to be the same standard of "lol git gud" or "you just need to keep going" but at this point I have to ask...why? Why should I keep going with a game where combat is so ridiculous and frustrating and there is just no real reward. Every mission is just the same basic nightmarish grind and when they're completed the game gives you nothing new except more grind. No new characters get unlocked (characters appear randomly and don't really bring anything new) and after the first handful of missions you'll have unlocked all the buildings and after that progress becomes meaningless. There's no benefit to completing missions apart from "do it more" and after a while even the analysis of the stress mechanic becomes boring, when the only interesting part of the game is "what random negative effect has my character received now" then I just can't see the point of the game. With combat this frustrating and such little reward even the great atmosphere starts to pall, not lest because the game kinda stops world building and just drops you into the same basic locations with the same basic enemies with no real sense of anything changing. I will say that this game is great to play with friends, not least because you can get someone else to do the grinding while you do something else for a bit\n\ntl;dr this game is like great foreplay that results in terrible sex...and instead of getting to ♥♥♥ at the end you're told you have to have even more terrible sex again and again with only the vaguest hint of a payoff at the end, except at the end you're told you need to keep doing it over and over again. After a while you just want to stop and walk away, although if you can get more people involved it can improve somewhat. I do want to say that this is by no means a bad game, its just not fun in the end.","July 24, 2015","false","23.5"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","29","48","4","0"

The gorgeous hand-drawn aesthetic and comically overwrought prose of the story really stand out as unique. Big, smart-sounding words will be misused (swarthy means dark-skinned, you guys), the low-low-low gamma will make you squint at your screen, and the 'heroes' will dodder around on-screen like children playing dress-up. The hamfistedness really works out favorably overall, though you may tire of the rasping narrator after the 50th time he tells you about the “dancing steps of war”.\nThe heroes themselves are diverse and unique, and the sheer number of classes (10 and counting), skills, and personality quirks mean that no two are ever quite alike. Your nymphomaniac  Plague Doctor will save you cash by being… efficient at the brothel, but his Fear of Beasts will make him pretty damned worthless in the Weald (where he probably acquired the Fear in the first place after contracting rabies from a dog). Luckily, you can forcibly remove his phobia (for a steep fee) at the Sanitarium, where you can also cure the rabies.\n\nIn addition, there is also a really great gameplay mechanic called ‘Stress’. As they’re subjected to more and more horrors in the dungeons, each heroes’ stress level increases until a critical point at which they crumble, becoming an abusive, cowardly, selfish, or (extremely rarely) more heroic version of themselves. In between dungeon runs, the heroes can spend a week or two blowing off steam at the Tavern or Church (though I’m still not sure how self-flagellation can possibly be as effective as a visit to the brothel).  Thus, even though you can only use 4 heroes at any given time, you’ll want a sizable roster to rotate them in and out of your lineup. This also forces you to use vastly different combinations; sometimes you’re  just stuck with three healers and a mage with the red plague on a given week and you have to make a dungeon run anyway.\n\nAll of this sounds great, doesn’t it? Why am I giving this a thumbs down? Unfortunately, the gameplay is entirely dominated by compounding randomness. The damage ranges are wide as a barn, critical hit and dodge percentages are huge; even aoe’s can be completely dodged or be complete critical hits. Blight, bleeding, and disease resistances similarly operate on an all-or-nothing percentage basis. The net result is that your careful strategic choices, character development plans, and painstaking expenditures have very little bearing on success or failure. Your awesome high-hp crusader could be killed from full health by the very first group of enemies you encounter on a dungeon run before you even get a turn. This is true of *any* group of enemies you encounter, whether the first or the 20th, whether you’ve been dominating all of them or not, whether you’ve made wise choices or simply clicked on whatever skill seemed cool at the time. I don’t mind punishing difficulty when it can be circumvented by skill and strategy (e.g., Dark Souls; XCOM), but neither of those traits need apply here.\n\nBecause of this, it feels less like a game and more like a spectator sport. You’re on a rollercoaster, watching various heroes die. There isn’t any significant progression in strength, and micromanaging the various traits becomes a chore because really, what does it all matter? The repetitive runs through the dark dungeons yield nothing permanent or tangible. Worse, there is never any doubt that you’ll prevail eventually; throw enough heroes at it and eventually the dungeon will divulge its secrets through sheer numerical luck. The feelings of difficulty and danger *aren’t even real*.  Perhaps this will change through development, but I doubt it. The game designers seem to have embraced randomness as difficulty instead of more complex gameplay mechanics. But, that’s life – sometimes your lead programmer is fearless but flatulent, your head designer has photomania and misanthropy, while your story writer is lazy-eyed, a clutch hitter, and a known cheat. If only they could have assembled the perfect team… but life just doesn’t work that way. Maybe video games should, though.","July 28, 2015","false","23.5"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","37","63","5","0"

It is brutal, there is a ton of micro management and then you go into a dungeon and get destroyed. lol. The quirks are hilarious. The dialogue your characters spill out when they've lost their marbles is wonderful. This has revitalized my feelings on the current state of turn based combat. This game truly does stress you out. The art, music, and narration are a breath of fresh air. If you are a LoveCraft fan, be it his writings or games based on his works, then you will appreciate the game mechanics even more. This game is worth way more than $20. Thank you Red Hook.

This is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.  Unfortunately the developers have increased the difficulty level to the point that the game is no fun anymore.  Many of the changes the made to up the difficulty are so arbitrary and unrealistic that they break the game immersion.  At this point I wish I could get a refund.\n\nPros:\n- Love the artwork, very atmospheric.\n- The guy who did the narration/voice work is fantastic.\n\nCons:\n- The last few updates have made the game very difficult.  Some missions are borderline impossible.\n- The developers are adding game elements (ie corpses) that are utterly unrealistic and break immersion, just to up the difficulty.\n- The game is becoming very unbalanced and unrealistic (giant worms have 80% resistance, while my crusader in maxed out plate armor has 0% resistance, really?) again just to up the difficulty level.\n- The game is very random.  Combat is often dominated by wild swings of extreme good luck or bad luck.  Gear and items make almost no difference.\n","August 2, 2015","false","33.4"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","38","65","4","0"

It was significantly less enjoyable.  I noted the new corpse and heart attack thing, and I see that it has been much discussed.  I did nto super mind them really.  But it is worse than that, the math just seems bad.  I played the game enough to note a variety of strategies to do well in the past, or at least to keep my head above water.  Now, when starting the game it is just very random.  You absolutely have to have several full groups that can all hit the same level dungeons since they go mad so very easily they will never be able to run more than one mission in a row.  But how many characters you have and their classes are luck of the draw.  Wrong hand?  You lost.  Oh, but it will take you hours before we let you know that you lost already.  The game feels balanced against a best-case-scenario player, it has been made hard enough for the guy who has memorized every system and is willing to grind, grind, grind until the dice roll in their favor and they get a run of easy missions long enough to build up their troops.\n\nI am not that guy.

As it stands today - If the nature of the horrid gameplay isn't clear, I'll try to explain: Roll a 6-sided dice.  If you get a 1, some character you have will horribly and inexplicably die in one turn before you can act due to monster crits or stress bombs. If you get a 2, some random and unavoidable effect in battle or in the environment will basically force you out of play into a town with fewer resources and more afflictions.  3-5 you may be able to progress a room, maybe a few!, before again being the victim of traps, environment blockage, or randomly scaled mobs that have one of the paper-rock-scissors skill that ruin your party no matter what.  A 6, followed by another 6 and you may beat a quest allowing you to recover maybe 25% of the damage and cost it took you to get there.  And all this while having slow, interrupted, low-interaction gameplay watching animations on how screwed your characters are.\n\nI get challenge.  I like challenge.  But if all I wanted out of an experience was to be punished with no skill dependency or possibility of success, I'd just study more tax law.  I get the dark nature of the game and trying to create the horror and detachment from your characters by unavoidably killing and maiming them along the way.  But this game has created 2 conflicting goals that make it a failure - on one side, trying to encourage role playing, progression, and advancement for a player, and on the other side destroying that progression by beating the player into submission by making resource acquisition and advancement so temporary and volatile both positively and negatively that you might as well just be fighting a low-variability random number generator.  The way the game stands today, just throw a fresh party into the grinder every week in the hopes you'll get a lucky loot drop early on before they die horribly and randomly.  There are ways to mask, and even make fun, the second aspect that this game has not grasped yet or evidently ruined from past versions.\n\nBuyer's remorse at this point.","August 7, 2015","false","8.5"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","39","67","4","0"

But, as far as execution goes, this otherwise great game is broken.\n\nFirst off, the difficulty is a huge problem - and this is coming from a guy whose favorite games are Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, and Xcom. The difference between those games and Darkest Dungeon is that, while those games are punishing, they are also fair. There is nothing fair about Darkest Dungeon. There is nothing fair about fighting a roomful of standard enemies and to inexplicably miss every attack while they hit you with four consecutive criticals. This happens all the time, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Bring your max-leveled team with fully upgraded skills, equipment, and trinkets, and you will still be decimated by random dice rolls. I wonder how random it truly is, though, since the odds of such catostrophically bad series of rolls are pretty astronomical, yet seem to happen pretty frequently.\n\nThe other problem related to the difficulty is the stress, quirks, and disease mechanics. Every mission your heroes undertake give them a certain amount of stress, negative personality traits, and diseases that severely effect their performance. It is, like everything in Darkest Dungeon, random. So, if it costs 4,000 gold to provision for a mission, the mission rewards you 7,000 gold, but you must spend 4,000 gold to cure the stress, diseases, and negative quirks your heroes picked up over the mission, you're left with a net loss of 1,000 gold and unable to provision for the next mission. Your only choices are to quit the game, or send a team into the next mission with no supplies (guaranteed death). Even if you play perfectly, eventually you will get some bad rolls of the dice and see total financial ruin.\n\nThis is mitigated somewhat by the ability to sell trinkets collected during the mission... which is where the bugs come in. For some reason, I am suddenly unable to access the trinket menu, so not only can I not access this crucial financial resource, but I cannot give my characters vital equipment. I haven't recieved word from Red Hook's tech support about this yet, but the game is already hard enough without bugs and glitches making it impossible to manage your characters' inventories.\n\nOh and I feel I should mention the new corpse mechanic. It's awful. It's a transparent and artificial attempt at further increasing the difficulty. Basically, when you kill an enemy, it's corpse stays on the battlefield and blocks your ability to hit enemies behind it. Because it makes total sense that my team of heroes who leap around smiting foes with magic swords can't just step over the body of a dead maggot to attack their enemies. Nope, it makes much more sense that you'd have to spend a round fully dismembering a corpse before you can attack the enemy standing two feet behind it.\n\nWhat a disappointment. Red Hook has the makings of a truly great game, but the random catastrophic events, the bugs, and the unfair difficulty make it practically unplayable.","November 8, 2015","false","186.1"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","34","58","3","1"

The game drops you in an estate with a ruined town, very little money, and only a few glory hungry fools at your command.  Every step will be paid for in blood and you have no choice but to move forward regardless.  You will need to see everything in context and pick what is worth preserving and what resource is the most important at the time.\n\nI won’t go deep into exactly how the game and all its mechanics work because,\n1: it’s early access and might change\n2: half the fun is figuring those things out and mastering them\nThis game pulls no punches, there is no easy mode here and you will lose adventurers but with each quest done you learn more and get better at the game.  You figure out what the cultists moves are, how to build a strong party, how to respond to finding an iron madden, etc.  Sometimes, even the most prepared party gets messed up by the random factor but that just make every win feel real, significant and earned.  The entire appeal of this game for me is plucking victories from the gaping maw of crushing defeat no matter the cost and making the best of a bad situation.  To push an adventure gone bad just a little bit farther, to get through just one more room and somehow eek out that victory after losing your healer in the 3rd fight feels so satisfying.\n\nThis game will challenge you.  This game will most likely frustrate you at some points.  But I think that this game is defiantly worth the time to play if you enjoy dark and unique worlds, easy to understand yet deep mechanics, and being challenged in a way few other games do.","August 19, 2015","true","177.8"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","34","58","0","1"

There's a mechanic that has been added to hero stress since I played last, which feels like a massive kick in the teeth at this point. Now not only do characters max out their stress bar and develop what is usually a mental illness or other negative character trait that requires time and money to cure, but the maxed out bar can now fill up a second time and give the character a heart attack if it fills the bar again. And now there are corpses left to keep enemy positions the same, whereas before they would move up when allies died. You have to go through their hit points again (if you want to waste your already precious time) to get rid of them. I'm sorry, but... whuh?\n\nSo... now the game is pretty much unplayable. It was already frustrating when it took a lot of time to mash groups of garbage heroes through dungeons and chuck them after, waiting until there was enough money to take my good groups into dungeons so they could finally get some xp (which is literally THE strategy for getting anywhere in this game)... now it's just gratuitous punishment and a complete waste of time.

There are hard games at which one has to "git gud," and then there are games that are so unbelievably dominated by random number generators that even the smallest degree of success is more appropriately credited to a coin flip than any particular skill or strategy. Darkest Dungeon is absolutely in the latter category.\n\n"Stress" is perhaps this game's most important element and key mechanic. In simple terms, stress wrecks your characters' performance and can make them do things like skip their turns, self-harm, or even attack one another. Stress is bad; stress is evil; stress is a game-over-you-may-delete-your-entire-campaign-now button. It is also 100% unavoidable, and will constantly be inflicted upon you even throughout the tutorial.\n\nYour characters begin their first missions pre-stressed, and light fades so quickly that you cannot travel from one single room to the next nearly without burning two fresh torches, lest you begin taking enormous stress penalties. Enemies constantly land critical hits that inflict insane stress on you, and many of them have standard attacks that do so simply as an added effect. In many missions there is no way to mitigate the accumulation of stress, leading to key characters' unavoidable meltdowns. Healing spells are incredibly weak, unreliable, and few and far between. I've missed more attacks than I can count against enemies with dodge ratings of ZERO. There are no healing items or stress reducing items consumable between battles, save for *occasional* camping in select missions—and even then the abilities you have available (at least initially) are randomly selected for you when your characters are created. Invisible traps randomly damage your heroes and—you guessed it!—increase their stress levels. When enemies land critical hits it tends to increase the victim's stress by 10-20 at a time; however, when YOU crit against an enemy you'll be lucky to see yours reduced by 5 as a "bonus." Honestly, I could go on and on and on and not even begin to crack the surface of just how broken this game is. It's not just salt: the game is a nigh-unplayable mess.\n\nDarkest Dungeon opens up with the promise that the game will beat you, permanently kill your characters, and otherwise make you cry. What it doesn't tell you is that this will ALWAYS happen to EVERY party you organize, regardless of what time and care you invest in them—or that even leveling up after successful missions has a large chance of adding debilitating "quirks" to your characters. (You then have to pay thousands of gold and spend an entire mission without them available to remove said afflictions. You'll go bankrupt overnight doing this once or twice early on.)\n\nI wanted so badly to love this game but I've been forced to restart my campaign upwards of ten times and have never beaten the second boss. I've upgrated armor, weapons, finely-tuned my abilities, but nothing matters in the end. Everything fails, always. Twice I've completely quit playing for a month or more just to see if when I return a patch has better balanced the game. If anything, it has gotten more abusive over time.\n\nI want the developers to know that this is the most sorely cheated I have ever felt as a gamer. I'm a Dark Souls veteran who loves a challenge, but THIS is not challgening. It's just flat-out cheap and blatantly unbalanced. This game is fundamentally broken and its designers owe us all personal, handwritten apologies along with full refunds.\n\nDO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME!

Buy if one sale.\n\nLong version:  Darkest dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler.  You recruit heros and try to level them up (with varying degrees of sucess) in the various dungeons.  Completing a quest/foray will give your guys some loot.  All pretty standard stuff.\n\nLike pretty much all RPG's, you will spend a lot of time grinding through dungeons, trying to level up characters.  In this game, it feels much more like a meat grinder.  Your characters WILL die, and the time and money you invested in each one will be lost.  Sometimes you wont have a choice but to send a team of expendables down on a suicide mission to gather that little bit of loot for your prime rib characters.\n\nMost of the game's fun is here, managing a roster, choosing upgrades, saving gold to build an effective budget team to tackle bosses.  It's essentially football manager, Rogue Cathulu style.\n\nThere is a definite muffin top to the game.  Once you get your guys get strong enough to do high level missions, collect the right trinkets, and upgraded all the buildings, you can really start crushing the game and building a fortune.  You start getting fat (stacks).  Personally I enjoy this.  What's the point of grinding it out if the rewards don’t help?  In all fairness though some of your currency does become useless, (all non-gold currency is pretty much worthless when you've upgraded all buildings)\n\nUnfortunately the pendulum of updates has swung to the side of (personally) too hard/not fun.  That comfortable muffin top has just shrunk a whole bunch, and a lot of people are butt hurt over the whole thing.  That being said, the DD developers have been very receptive (on the whole) to the community, and I for one have faith they will fix it eventually.  Right now I'm just waiting around for the tide to turn so I can get my Level 6's off the bench again and into the game.\n\nIf certain things get fixed or added, i would change to a buy at full price.  As it is though, pick up this game at 50% off.  It's worth the price at $10. $20 seems a bit much unless you are a REALLY big fan of Dungeon Crawling RPG's.\n\nSome big pros:\n-Stylistic game, cool looking characters, dungeons, etc.\n-some diversity between characters.\n-receptive Devs who appear to genuinely care what the community say/think.  (they haven't grown large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of their forheads yet at least)\n-interesting story line,\n-narrator’s voice is chocolate fun times.\n\nSome big Cons:\n-Recent updates put a damper on things. (corpses suck. protection is the devil, new trinks are useless)\n-Major content still missing. (currently 2 dungeons of the 5 total not here including the actual Darkest dungeon)\n-Some lack of characters/enemies.  Characters of the same class are exactly the same.  (i expect enemies at least to be added slowly over time to an acceptable number)\n\nThings I want added:\n-Customizable towns.  (gives me something to do with my hard earned seals, crests, etc.)\n-Heros that feel more like individuals rather than being defined so much by their class.  (I'm not lying, class IS hero, there is no difference between 2 same level, same class characters)\n-Some reversion of recent Corpse, Trink, Prot upgrades.\n-Obviously those 2 new zones.\n-More enemies, more champs, etc.\n-More narrator voice, because it's awesome.\n-Buff that PD! (just make her stun 4 instead of 2, same with plague grenade, and/or a 1 person crit buff.)\n-also different gendered characters?","August 18, 2015","true","141.7"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","35","60","0","2"

Though the development team is ambitious they do not always think through what they do. The prime example I have currently is an issue with 'heart attacks'. When your stress level reaches 200% your unit instantly dies (Without chance of save) from a heart attack. The problem is this, in the same turn, causes every other unit to face a significant raise in stress, so if you have a 200%, 180%, 160%, and 140% your entire squad will instantly die, more than likley, here is why:\n\nNote: the average boost when a unit dies (From my observation is roughly 20pts)\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #1 dies, Unit #2 raises from 180 to 200, unit #3 raises from 160 to 180, unit 4 raises from 140 to 160.\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #2 dies, unit #3 raises from 180 to 200, unit #4 raises from 160 to 180\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #3 dies, unit #4 raises from 180 to 200\n[Unit #4 dies]\n\nThe reason this is a critical flaw is it kills end game potentials. You hold a high potential to see 30-50% stress raises from single attacks at level 4-6 character's fights.

This game is a constant random dice roll. Nothing is satisfying when random chance carries more weight in the game than actual strategy and planning. The combat is simply a dps/crit race that punishes any and all defensive type tactics. The quirks each character gains at the end of a dungeon have no rhyme or reason, it is complete chance what postitive or negative buffs each character will gain at the end of a dungeon. The game is trivially easy if you simply put your "A" team on a pedestal and just have your "B" team, made up of completely free and expendable newly hired's, grind suicide missions.","July 28, 2015","false","29.7"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","29","49","4","3"

However I just don't really give a single ♥♥♥♥ right now.\n\nYes, yes Darkest Dungeon is a hard game. You can expect RNG to ruin a run, that your heroes are expendable, and that you know all of this to be true right when you buy the game. This does not change the fact that when all your hours of progess results in a monumental loss that makes your entire campaign trashed thats when I draw the line. Let me explain the absolute trainwreck that was my latest campaign.\n\nSee this was actually my second campaign after my short introductory one that I fully conceded failed on my behalf. So I set off on the next one and I'm doing fantastic, it's going great. However a simingly mundane roadblock comes right out of nowhere putting my entire strategy in jepordy. Party members LV3 or above can't enter any dungeons below their level, even against bosses. *WHAT*?! So since the game doesn't tell me this absolutely massive detail my entire strategy is in upheaval. Well, I say to myself thats really big, but I can push past this. I've got plenty of time to build my forces, getting high LV 2s (but not too high) for bosses and a LV 3 team for veteran runs.\n\nWhile doing this I ran into an astonishingly bad development choice surronding ambush mechanics on medium/ long dungeons. When camping you have the option to eat, heal, and stress heal which is a life saver. The kicker is that you have a chance of being ambushed after camping where the game arbitrary takes away all your torch light, even though camping firewood gives you 100 light while surprsing nearly every party member. For those uninitiated when you have low torch light enemies do faaaaaar more damage, you gain stress at a much higher rate, and when you are surprised enemies get a whole free turn to attack. So after camping and getting everyone to full HP on two seperate occasions I lost a total of 1-2 party memebers to low level mobs since they all decide to gang bang the healer or what have you. Oh and don't even think about using a torch because when ambushed you can't use torches, DUH, obviously!\n\nBut despite all that I had done it, 6-9 party members all at LV 3 a complete truimph. Persevering despite the horrific odds that's what Darkest Dungeon is all about!\n\nOh I just failed both of my 2 raids to LV 3 dungeons along with my priceless trinckets... Well, it would have been nice if I could've leveled them up before entering the meat grinder, but ehehe that's not how this game wants you to play. In my latest failure ending just about 30 minutes ago I suffered 3 crits in a row, rabies, 2 occultist heals resulting in 0 HP with characters on death's door, and 3 misses since the veteran enemies have higher dodge + HP, accumulating in a complete wipe.\n\nYou know I was ready to give this a complete and undivided recommendation. I loved it even while I hated it, and with so many games holding your hand to an obessesive degree Darkest Dungeon was truly refreshing. Plus its a game that handles its Lovecraftian atmosphere and world perfectly with gameplay reflecting that. However there is just so many times you can handle what feels like the game blatently cheating you over on factors you have no control over. So while this review might be unrecommended there is certainly a ton of value to be had, just be warry of the Darkest RNG.","January 5","false","36.8"," 44 of 78 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","44","78","6","2"

I enjoyed the game a lot, at first. As the game went on longer, I saw my motivation fading, due to a real lack of reason for success. This may sound vague so far, and many reviews cover the points completely and eloquently. I will therefor use an analogy.\nDarkest Dungeon: Live Action Role Play Version\nStep 01: Find a six-sided die (dice)\nStep 02: Find a friend\nStep 03: Find a playing surface, such as a table\nStep 04: Roll the die on the playing surface\nStep 05: Since you are a "beginner" at this point in the game, rolling an even number is safe and you "progress." If the number is odd, however, your "friend" kicks you in the groin as hard as he or she can.\nStep 06: If you happened to roll an even number, you get a second roll. If you roll a two, you get a magical "cup." This "cup" can be worn for groin protection. The "cup" is also ringed with spikes on the exterior. These spikes are aimed at the inside of your legs. Now you can protect the groin, but the area around it will be painfully shredded in the process.\nStep 07: Regardless of which number is rolled, if at any time you vomit, you lose. If you lose, you have one day to recover and must return to Step 01 the next day.\nStep 08: If you rolled an even number, and disregarding the outcome of Step 06, you now move onto the "Intermediate" or "Veteran" difficulty. On this difficulty level, roll the die again. If you roll a 1 or 2, you are safe and can move onto the next difficulty level. If you roll a 3, 4, 5, or 6, your friend kicks you in the groin as hard as he or she can. Same rules apply to recovery.\nStep 09: If you rolled a 1 or 2, you are now on the highest difficulty level. This being said, you get to roll the die once more. If you roll anything other than a 6, your friend kicks you as hard as he or she can in your groin.\nStep 10: If you managed to roll a 6, congratulations. Your reward? You don't get kicked in the groin. If your roll resulted in groin kicking, go back to step 01 after one day of rest.\nStep 11: If at any time you don't enjoy this game, and decide to quit, do not purchase Darkest Dungeon.","May 28","false","203.9"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","57","35","61","27","2"

A game of managing your risk and working hard with your team of Heroes against a terrible evil.\n\nThen we players made the big mistake in Red Hook's eyes. We learned how to do exactly what they "expected" of us, and began posting guides so we could help new players beat the game too.\n\nRed Hook proceeded to jump up the Random Number Generator of the game until, honestly, your efforts mean nothing. No amount of preparations has any observable effect anymore, and they've stooped to micromanaging player strategies in the name of their "vision". Namely, that everything is on a dice roll and preparations against the terrors below is a farce.\n\nI was fooled by their responsiveness. But responsiveness in the forums also means ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS.

Everyone else will hate the inability to actually win anything.\n\nDon't be fooled by the "easy" low level dungeons. Red Hook knows what its done, so they made sure the first 2 hours of gameplay seemed quite reasonable and easy so you couldn't refund it when you got to the harder dungeons.\n\nDon't let them lie to you. Don't buy this game. Looks, music, ideas aside, it's not fun. At all.\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is this game's greatest crime.

I finally got it last year, I don't know when exactly but I play at least since april. Thing is, I don't play often. Actually out of my total 75h of playing, I easely played 50h before summer.\nI don't want to start my review as is, but here it is : I liked the game "before". Back in april/may, I could only talk about DD to my friends, because it was a big deal for me. Telling truth I got the game because I'm a turn-based rpg fan. But all the squirks, dialogs, lore, classes specs, village upgrades, and even the rng (back then) was all I loved about the title. The identity was there anyway.\nBack then, DD was fairly controlable, with some bad luck at times. Sometimes some very bad luck i must say. But it was part of the game! And it felt fun! I could talk about how my lvl3 vestal died starving in middle of a corridor cuz I ain't no food anymore! About my alchoholic highwayman havng not much acc and failing 90% of his shot, my knight afraid of the dark, etc. I made myself kind of a picture of those characters in a dark humorous way, and it was great!\nSo many stories to share. And yet, I could, sometime, manage dungeon till the end, losing 1 or 2 dudes in the process. I felt the game was like kind of a fair trade and it was addictive somehow. My main goal was to lvl max my favorite characters. It was hard enough to me.\n\nBut today the game is about how to lose an entire team after 1 or 2 fights, thanks to the mad RNG, the stats nerf, the stress augmentation and the enemies luck. I get the game is about how terrible a quest can turn for your characters, but there is a "can" in this sentence. It tells you then that it can aslo NOT be so bad. So not only the game is gone into "every single quest will be a pain in the @ss from now on" (not joking, my % of success went down and down for the very same quests since last spring), but it also gets the player rid of any control of what is happening. Your character should be alright with his lvl 6 stats and equipped items? Nooooo let's get him the worst possible scenario, because RNG is more important than the choices you made for your character. So characters have stats and skills, but in the end they are not relevant for you can't decently plan anything to happen "almost" as expected. Your most violent warrior can become a ♥♥♥♥♥ and your vestal can destroy suns for wtf reason.\nIt's not the problem that bad things happen, I loved the game for that. The problem is that it always happen, to the point you have nothing left to enjoy anymore! Even victory tastes like crap most of the time. The fun in DD is dead within 6 months.\n\nSo to make it simple : the game, to me, went from a :\n50% lucky stuff 50% bad stuff\nTo a\n10% lucky stuff 90% bad stuff happening (without logical reason, I repeat).\nYou can't count on characters specs, skills, stats, items and strategies these days, it's all up to randomness, even in the easiest dungeon. Everything can happen to you, but be sure it's gonna be bad no matter how you know the game.\nIt's not harder, it's more non-sense. It's less controlable. You lose for more reasons than before, you surrender more quickly and more often. You earn less things and need to farm madly to save what's left from your previous disasters. The game never rewards the player in the way I didn't smile since June while playing it! It's only about frustration and guilt. I only play here and then to see what's up and it's sad to said it is not the fun game I used to spend my life on.\n\nTL;DR : game went from enjoyable, memorable, fun and strategic to some lifeless russian roulette for the sake of difficulty poorly executed and understood. Needs a lot of balancing until it might justify it's price. DD was one of my favorite game experience ever, but it's one of the most disappointing now.","January 19","false","91.8"," 275 of 516 people (53%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","53","275","516","15","53"

No, it is hard because of RNG, like most roguelike games. In combat, there is nothing to tell you who is going first. Sure, you could look at every party member's speed rating and every enemy's speed rating, but wouldn't it be easier to tell the player so he can plan, and not rely on RNG?\n\nThe game has extreme difficulty spikes, often wiping your entire party out even when they enter a boss battle with full health / no stress because of.. reasons. Enemies get two or three turns per round, and can often wipe your whole party in the FIRST TURN. Losing characters is a part of roguelikes, but this game has far too many cheap deaths to make their deaths feel as though you did something wrong.\n\nThe hunger mechanic is broken. I just fed each of my party members to recover some health, WHY are they hungry, and why is the only option to starve?  Why can I not chose who starves, and instead feed the party members who I want?\n\nThe game prevents you from having any veterans, as those who get to the higher levels are often loaded with disproportionate amounts of negative quirks, making it so it would be more cost effective to toss them out than to heal their injuries. There is no out-of-combat healing system aside from food, and for some reason bandages don't heal your wounds?\n\nRanting aside, the game has a lot of potential and is already really fun. I don't recommend it because by it's nature it is the pure embodiment of blind RNG. When you finish a level, it does not feel rewarding because you feel as though you've gotten lucky. When you fail a level, or lose all your party members, it is often because you feel cheated by the game.\n\nAlso there are some critical glitches that absolutely destroy your save. Since the game autosaves after each action, if you are stuck in a loop where you can't get back to town / it crashes during certain stages of combat, you are forced to watch as hours of your time are thrown away. Pretty terrible, but it's early access and I guess they'll fix it.","February 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 180 of 336 people (54%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","54","180","336","21","13"

The randomness isn't my problem, really- it's the game being able to completely ruin you without any input on your part. Too many times I've set out to a dungeon and the first battle someone is killed before I even have a chance to react. The gold system is frustrating, and some of the currency seems pointless because it needs the same amount of another currency always. Why can't you keep the items you don't use each week? That makes little to no sense to me. I love the hero classes, the art, the voices, the abilities, the items- but the game is just far too cruel in some ways. Watching a hero die before I even get to make any choices or actions is really frustrating, and ruins a whole game week- because 3 heroes is a massive handicap and you're doomed to retreat or die soon into the dungeon. Another thing that was frustrating is finally getting to camp, and then being attacked for it so you lose all the health, stress reduction, and other benefits of camping. A couple times I've ended up worse for camping. I really like what I see from the devs of this game, I've gone back and read a lot of the updates and such- so I'm sure they'll iron it out they seem very committed but honestly, at the moment, I don't recommend this game.","January 7","false","24.1"," 47 of 84 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","47","84","6","0"

I got it because I loved watching livestreams of it, and on my first day, neither of my starting characters made it to town, and my new party wiped on their third mission. After that, I didn't really play anymore, but I still paid attention to its development and still loved to watch the streams. But over time, I noticed that the game was getting worse and worse as it got longer. In the state where I first took interest, with just the Ruins, Warrens, and Weald, the amount of content and difficulty scale overall seemed ideal. The introduction of the Cove seemed to stretch things a little thin, but I was still willing to overlook that because as a work of art, this game is beyond outstanding. The art, the atmosphere, the voice work, the character and enemy design, it's all pretty close to perfect.\n\nAnd then... the Darkest Dungeon came out, with that more than quadrupling the amount of grind present in the game - starting with quadruple because of the dungeon's unique mechanic: having to be beaten four times with completely different parties, and actually being much worse because RNG at Darkest difficulty level is *horribly* stacked, virtually guaranteeing a huge number of failed runs and deaths for each actual success. And at that point, this game went from cruelly hard to virtually unplayable.\n\nOh, it wasn't all the Darkest Dungeon's fault. To some extent, it just seems that every new feature added to this game only serves to make it more punishing, the most notable example being the horrible disease system that doubles the number of debilitating penalties a hero can suffer from, but that was the final nail in the coffin. This used to be one of the games I was most proud to have in my library, even if I was too much of a chicken to play it much myself. But these days... you need to ask yourself, is it worth trying to play a game that requires dozens of hours playing through the same content over and over, getting continually screwed by the RNG in the process? This game isn't 'random' in the usual sense of the word - you don't get a streak of good rolls and win, because luck only carries so far before its benefits are removed or canceled out. We're not talking about beating a hard mission once, we're talking about farming them to truly gain ground. The only randomness here? Whether or not you'll make it through each grinding session without having your progress completely set back again.\n\nAs a work of art, this game deserves a spot in a museum, and to have classes of college students studying it and writing papers on it. As a game... it's not a game, it's just grim, soul-crushing, uphill toil. I suppose, considering its subject matter and intended effect on the player, that this is only fitting.","May 29","false","5.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

I really really do. The style and atmosphere and polish is far and above nearly every other early access title I've seen. But somewhere along the way, the developers let "complexity" fudge it all up. This title buckles under the weight of its unforgiving mechanics and sheer randomness. Difficulty I can overcome by learning and playing smart is enjoyable, difficulty I can never expect due to punishing random events is not.\n\nThe entire game is one gradual slide into inevitable failure with nothing to really connect me to the game world.

As a reality ensues version of a dungeon crawler, it succeeds amazingly. Alot of minor things may not be explained at first, and some things that work you may not even try because of thinking about what you can do, because you think of it as a game and dont try something you would do irl (see using bandages as handwraps for investigating a kniferack).\n\nThe heros are varied and never seem to be just carbon copies of eachother, and the position based strategy like combat is fun and interesting. But be careful that the stress doesnt get to even you, rushing your judgement and making mistakes as a consequence of stress, again, that stress based mechanic is well implemented, an amazingly interesting theme, and adds alot to the gameplay. Though some might find the RNG a bit too powerful.\n\nThe game leaves an impression when you just look at it that it will be overcomplicated but really its not, its the same effect as FTL, a cursory glance at the variety of features gives an illusion of overcomplication. Certain moves work in certain positions, and you remember them reasonably well, and some are more suited for the front or back of your lineup due to being a tanking melee or a healer/ranged for instance. The stress makes you go insane at first and eventually a heart attack, but camping, jesters, critical hits, disarming traps and sometimes kills heal it, with a bit of skill its not that bad. They can get negative traits to debuff them that cost a bit of money to remove, and you take them to buildings to upgrade armor and moves and relieve stress. Even the trinkets I found to be relatively intuitive, upsides and downsides use them to buff or compensate, try not to leave to big a weakness, at the very least stuff like the blight stones and archers rings are easily understood.\n\nThe game doesnt ever tell you what you feel, despite what some may think, it tells you what they feel, and they can get stressed, go mad and have heart attacks. Stress can feel like more of a danger than the health, as its alot harder to cure. Death functions a bit differently, if someone loses all their health they go onto "Death's Door", where they theoretically could live forever, but every hit could strike them down, basically its a 67% chance that they dont die forever every time, and bleeding and blight count as hits every time they activate. Do you keep risking the fight? Do you abandon the mission to save them lest they die forever. I'm about to explain why you should care about just another Vestal or Crusader, but heres how camping works first, you get 12 "Time" Everyone has 3 camping skills at once, each requires time, they can grant buffs, stress heal, and heals, you use firewood granted on longer missions to camp, you can be ambushed while you camp every once in awhile with lower light, messing up your lineup, etc. Now, onto individuality.\n\nThe game is also very good about letting you have time to care even with minimal individual traits. Theres 7 different possible camping and combat moves which you can unlock and upgrade for customization. You can switch them from a few palette swaps, change their names. Upgrade weapons armor, equip trinkets. Despite being just another Vestal the positive and negative quirks grant a bit of functional not just aesthetic individuality. Sheer force of time lets you humanize and invest in them. You give a ♥♥♥♥ if they die. Though its not only possible but profitable to get a ton of new guys for free, throw them in a mission with barely any supplies, let them go insane and die, grab a ton of money and things like Busts, Crests, Portraits and Deeds (what you use to upgrade the town) and fire them neglecting to cure their diseases and psychological damage, as thats not free. You monster.\n\nOne thing I neglected to mention is the light, you use torches to keep the lights higher, as lights high, you have a higher chance of scouting around and knowing whats around you on the map ahead of time, suprising enemies, and everyone friend or foe gets less crits. But you get less treasure and cause less crits. Lower light gets more treasure, your less likely to scout and more likely to be suprised, and theres more treasure. By the way, Crits you deal stress heal, Crits that hurt you cause stress.\n\nFor some the darker tone reaches Narm Charm levels, personally I disagree, but its a subjective thing. The game switches between saying the world is ♥♥♥♥, or the world is ♥♥♥♥ but not beyond redeeming. Alot of your party isnt exactly noble. Bounty Hunters, Grave Robbers, Occultists, Crusaders, Highwaymen. Some only seek payment, they arent all in it for the heroism. People die and stay dead, the art styles appealing and gloomy, the whole stress mechanic and reality ensues theme isnt exactly idealistic.\n\nThe animations isnt that present, when you attack it switches their images, centers them in the middle of the screen enlarged, and tilts the camera. Some might call that simpler style a problem, but personally it could easily be considered a stylistic choice and they make it work VERY well. the art style is definitely pleasent to look at, and its definitely easy to run because of it. So *I* consider it a positive, but dont expect to many extravagent animations, but frankly making something like that a dealbreaker especially when the game isnt even ugly is a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid desicion.\n\nUltimately it has interesting mechanics, intergrates gameplay and story masterfully, has an interesting theme, tons of replayability, and its just really fun to play and really easy to get invested in. For those of you concerned about whether or not to get it yet cause its in early access, waiting till full release I can understand, wanting the whole experience all at once yknow, but if you dont care, its definitely interesting, well put together and fun, even in early access. Its worth buying as it is NOW, is what im saying. I recommend it.\n\nAlso the musics well done. As the light gets darker the music gets more intense or chaotic, you can hear more unnerving ambience in the background. The tracks strings can really capture the stress of your situation. It composition covering the seriousness of every encounter. The music of your Estate is soft and sad, but not hopeless. The lighter keys making you feel at least like you have a chance.","June 8, 2015","true","80.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You barely make enough gold on a success to heal off the stress and unsustainable quirks from your last run, effectively breaking even.  A failure may cause you to lose several heroes you have invested many hours into.  I spent significant time learning the game's mechanics and increasing my chances, but it still just takes a few bad rolls of the RNG to burn it all down.  It's easy to party wipe in the final stages leading to a loss of 30+ hours, often out of your control due to the random factor.\n\nIt's inexcusable that Darkest Dungeon does not have an easier setting for players just starting to learn the mechanics.  Early mistakes will put you in the hole and often force you to abandon those heroes.\n\nEven though many parts of the game are phenomenal, like the art, music and combat system, I cannot recommend it due to the oppressive chance-based difficulty.  It's ultimately an excercise in frustration.","April 24","false","35.5"," 117 of 218 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","117","218","9","13"

It fails to live up to its potential as an interesting roguelike, or RPG. The shallow gameplay simply doesn't provide the entertainment and replayability, that other, good games of these genres offer:\n\n- Dungeon-crawling and the tactical combat quickly become repetitive.\n- There is no real story, interactions, or meaningful choices. The "world" feels very static.\n- Leveling up and managing your characters is not fun.\n\n- Superb art style and audio.\n\nThe single good thing about this game is the excellent art and presentation. It captures the depressing, horror atmosphere, although some of the very illogical, random gameplay elements detract from this and make the atmosphere frustrating and tedious instead.\n\nThe psychological stress system, which was one of the most hyped aspects of the game also falls short: Stress is pretty much just a second HP bar, watching a character go insane is totally unfun, and all the quirks and traits they acquire are completely randomized. There is no psychology, no cause and effect, it's all randomness and grinding for gold, in order to regularly remove stress and quirks.\n\nI have finished the game, it takes about 50 hours from a fresh start, without guides. Unfortunately, about half of those 50 hours aren't exactly entertaining, but clunky micromanagement, looking at slow animations and simply repeating the same tasks / fights a lot.\n\n4/10, a big disappointment.","February 4","false","218.3"," 55 of 100 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","55","100","2","0"

I even poured hours into it. I now regret them. 1) Random crashes are infuriating. How hard is it to build a stable game? 2) The random number generating. It's as bad as playing Risk. Far too many battles turn around because of a single "Crit" from the enemy. The Crit puts someone at Death's Door, then makes them afflicted, etc. all in one go. Additionally, too many of the mechanics are poorly explained. Scouting is obviously the most important mechanic in the game yet nothing ♥♥♥♥ing talks about it. And it can be absurdly unreliable. 3) I believe *this* game is more about gameplay than story, that being said I find the story just not worth it. Initially I cared but the story pieces before each boss dungeon just don't hook me. Also, for the emphasis placed on the gameplay it all so poorly explained and the learning curve is steep.","June 3","false","68.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

Let me start off by saying the devs are extremely responsive and constantly show up in the forums. Which is a huge plus, especially for an early access game. They listen to our feedback, and are quick to fix issues within the game. Just wanted throw a kudos to Red Hook. Y'all are awesome.\n\nOn to the game now. The game is extremely high risk/high reward. Your team is low, but you've got one room left and you'll finish the quest. Do you risk it and attempt to see if the room is clear/fight the battle, or do you haul it back to town with your team in-tact and the treasure you've collected so far? There are interactable objects that can also save your run, or set you back which adds a lot to do while crawling through the dungeons. The game is extremely difficult, but in the best possible way.\n\nStarting off you're going to die, a lot. Until you learn the mechanics, learn how to build a balanced team for each dungeon. Learn how the abilities work and function. You will die, but that's ok. In Darkest Dungeon every death is a new lesson. The variety of heroes we've been given is pretty vast so far including the Grave Robber, Vestal, Occultist, Crusader, Highwayman, Hellion, Jester, and Leper. All of them work differentlky and do their jobs well.\n\nA tag you won't see on this game that is a major part of it is, Puzzle. Every fight is a puzzle of sorts, especially boss fights. They all have weaknesses and different attacks/combinations that mess up the enemies momentum and attacks. Got a dude sniping you from the back? Use Eldritch Pull to yank him to the front and knock him out. Got a Plague Doctor? Use Flash Powder to stun the back line while you eat their beefy front line leaving them open.\n\nThere is so many to go through a dungeon and it's just an all-around fantastic game. The community is very helpful and we're all learning and helping each out. If you're into difficult, but rewarding games with a dark atmosphere, and Cthulhu/Eldritch creatures, then Darkest Dungeon is the game for you.","February 3, 2015","true","29.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Although it is still early access, Darkest Dungeon is well into development, has plenty of content, and is more then worth the asking price of $20.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it is just as described:  A roguelike turn-based dungeon crawler rpg.  There is a good amount of depth and strategy involved, both in and out of battles.  Choosing how to spend your money and resources on upgrades and provisions, deciding which of your heroes to bring and which of their abilities to equip,  and choosing how to act during battles and other random events, etc...\n\nThe art style is absolutely gorgeous, in a gritty, atmospheric kind of way.  The art and music come together perfectly to set a dark undertone.\n\nOh, by the way, this game is hard.  You will always be struggling in one way or another while exploring a dungeon, and very rarely does a situation play out as planned, forcing you to change tactics and make decisions one turn at a time.  Although difficult and random (as expected from a roguelike) Darkest Dungeon never feels unfair.\n\nOverall this game is super dank and earns 8/10 bomb nuggets.

Truthfully, unlike a lot of people I didn't start this game when it was considered its golden days, I started after corpses and heart attacks were allowed to be disabled, which I did from the get go and never looked back. That being said, I really enjoyed this game, and I still do to some extent. But every recent patch has just made the game more and more unbearable, with enemy crit chance being so damn high, prot being frickin ridiculous, and enemies in general having too much dodge. I could live with enemies in champion level dungeons having 40+ base dodge if my characters could get that much. When they do, it's with trinkets and it rarely seems to help. Enemies also have perfect skills, which pretty much make move skills only good for them. If your arbalest or healer, or plague doctor gets pulled to rank 1, well, unless you work fast they will die fast. What happens if I pull one of their ranged rank 4 units? He starts using close range moves, that, while weaker, still allow him to do something all while those who were moved back use moves pushing them forward/don't give a single crap about the rules and continue using their moves from back rows. I understand they don't want move to be op, but if my leper gets to rank 4 what does he do? Slowly walk his way up? Champion level dungeons right now are the biggest chore, with enemies having so much life/dodge/prot it takes forever to kill things. Oh, and disregard the tooltip telling you to use blight on high prot enemies, 9/10 times good classes can just do a melee swing and apply a bleed totalling to way more than the blight. The only time I would recommend blight is against the formless flesh in champion. Class balance; I haven't gotten to try the abomination out yet, but when I saw my cousin using him in apprentice dungeons he seemed really good. Whether or not that will last into champion who knows. But unfortunately, for class balance in general, it's not that good. In normal dungeon crawling scenarios, I'd argue it's ok. Any class can manage on normal runs. Hell, until champion, I'd even argue most classes can do most bosses. But unfortunately, even with that being said, there will always be classes better. My top pick would easily be Hellion, as this class has enough hp and dodge to function as a tank while easily outdamaging any other class in the game and even being able to hit further ranks of enemies, which is very important on bosses in champion level dungeons. Lepers, crusaders, a load of classes just won't cut it in champion. Also, most bosses cheat in champion dungeons too - the swine god still managed to do damage to my party when his damage was debuffed to -160%. So, in conclusion, I think this game had potential. It was fun, and to some extent now it's still fun. It's a lot more unique than the cookie cutter crafting games on steam early access, but unfortunately, these devs disregarded fun at one point and tried to make it as gimmicky and "hars" as possible. Take it from me, I've spent a lot of time in this game, maxed every estate building, and beaten almost every boss. Don't waste the time or money people - pass.\n\nTl;dr - Unfair, unfun, RNG, stupid patches that only make it worse.","December 2, 2015","false","100.5"," 103 of 192 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","103","192","6","1"

You are summoned to your ancestor's home that has fallen in disrepair and corruption to a force that is revealed as you progress through the storyline and fight bosses.\n\nWith stunning graphical design and amazing voice acting by Wayne June you'll be instantly drawn in... however.\n\nFrom the very beginning the player is warned that this game is extremely hard, you will be forced to make tough decisions and not to grow overly attached to characters, THEY WILL DIE. Normally this is not an issue but...\n\nThe game mechanics are flawed in many aspects. Your characters have an HP meter and a Stress meter. Once your stress meter reaches 100 out of 200, your characters can and will most of the time develop some sort of side effect from the horrors witnessed throughout combat. Too many times have I witnessed my healer become paranoid and refuse to act all together, and whenever a stressful event happens, ANYTHING at all stress related, all your other companions will get more stress aswell, quickly developing into a failscade, and many times these happen outside of your control. At 200 stress your character has a heartattack and immediately hits 0 HP. This also stresses out the party. I have on multiple occasions seen one character hit 200, heartattack, stressing out everyone else into a heartattack, while all four where under some sort of bleed or poison and watched 4 party members die in one go.\n\nRNG rules this game and will create nightmarish situations for you to witness. The ability for your team to failscade due to bad RNG is all too present, Heals are underwhelming and in no way will keep up with the ludicrous damage monsters put out. Debuffs and buffs dont last long enough, turn order is badly calculated and gives the "House" the advantage, stuns are lackluster and have diminishing returns (which is good) but because of turn order shenanigans, cannot be counted on or managed in any way. Due to these gameplay issues, creating any significant interesting team builds or strategies is highly impossible as nothing can be predicted and even the best team can have a bad day. The most prevalent build is a high spike damage team that is boring to play and takes advantage of the highwayman point blank shot ability.\n\nCharacters also need to constantly undergo "psych" treatment to be viable in the next mission which constantly means benching and using a different team. Once a character hits lvl 3 Resolve he cannot ever go back to doing apprentice level missions (Resolve 0-2) which means you can't grind an A-team and go back to do bosses you left so you could grind, you HAVE to fight a boss at the approriate lvl. Character can also level at different speeds, meaning one member of your A-team might have to be benched while others catch up. God forbid one of them dies and you have to level them again...\n\nUgh what else? I'm already getting tired of writing this review.\n\nCharacters have flaws too, those suck and can make a good character turn into a bad one pretty quick, those also need to be managed and purged constantly.\n\nEating in this game is a terrible mechanic that makes no sense, I've had a completely full character die from hunger.\n\nOverall, fun, crisp, and beautiful game, but an extreme grind fest with no real reward for your work and only a headache when RNG gives you bad luck and wipes your party, there will be a lot of setbacks, be prepared for them.\n\nP.S. Boss fights where designed by a demon from hell itself as they subject you to sadistic forms of actual torture both in real life and in game.

I really love how dark and hopeless the game feels, the available classes, skills and status effects. I also like the way you need to manage your team with 2 different health bars (hp and stress), taking care of resource management (torch, food and gold) and a big amount of status effects in battles.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the current build, most notably the amount of grind required. Since you can't keep using the same heroes over and over (firstly because you need to let them rest to recover stress, and secondly because you can outlevel the content and not be able to use them anymore!), you need to train other squards, which takes a huge amount of time. If a hero dies, you also lose it forever, meaning a bunch of hours training him were tossed out of the window.\n\nI feel like a few of these mechanincs were created to make you care more about your characters and decisions, but they accomplish the opposite of what was intended. After the first time your character dies and you recruit a substitute you treat them as disposable thrash. You know that if the worst happens and a character dies you only need a few more hours playing to replace him, so he isn't "unique" in a true sense. There's also some squad compositions which are clearly supperior to others, so after you find one that work, you are likely to just repeat it over and over again, because you can't really afford to make a mistake with a "bad" squad (since a failure may means several hours os setback).\n\nInstead of the current system, I would prefer if I could have manual saves and make character death truly permanent, meaning there's only one character of each class, and if he dies you will never find the same class again. This would enable me to:\n1) Experiment with different team compositions, because I could load an earlier save if I screw up with a bad team\n2) Truly care about my character's death, and give me the choice to either keep playing without that character or lose a few hours and load an earlier save\n3) It would make me create other squad compositions, since I won't be able to use the same classes again\n\nI would also like if dungeons were to scale accordingly with party level, because it makes no sense that in a world of terror and disease an experienced team would refuse to do easy content for some quick cash. I also think upgrades costs too much and need to be reduced to avoid endless grinding.","November 3, 2015","false","10.9"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","28","49","2","0"

Mostly because of unlockables and trying new abilities and character types. Once the initial discoveries have been made only a semi-insane completionist like myself would consider continuing to play. The battles are not really anything special or different from an old super nintendo turn based jrpg and the quests your characters go on don't actually vary much.\n\nI got to the point where I had four level 5 characters and took them on a veteran mission (level 6 is the max, veteran level missions are the hardest). I took a few risks because my armor and weapons weren't at max level. It was tough but no one was dying. Then I faced a fat ectoplasm with 70 health and 2 of the smaller ones. I killed the big one. A smaller one spawned another big one with 70 more health. I killed that one. More small ectoplasms were spawned since I couldn't one hit them or stun them. I also couldn't run away from the battle. After killing 3 fat ectoplasms and about 7 small ones my characters were given death blows and all died by about round 20. I suppose I should have known better and played it safe by taking other characters on another 3 - 6 quests to get the money and artifacts to max out my armor, levels, and skills.\n\nIt may seem like I am giving the game a negative review out of frustration, I had done well up to that point, but losing my highest level characters and having no money left made me realize that a game that will set you back 4 - 6 hours while asking you to continue the same repetitive tasks over and over just to level is just poorly designed. Unfortunately I compulsively play games and want to see them through even if they aren't offering anything new. I thank the game for breaking its hold on me but would not recommend playing it for more than 5 - 10 hours. Why do so many games nowadays want you to keep playing them long after they have stopped being enjoyable? Is it a requirement that every game have 30 – 60 hours of playtime to create the illusion that you’re getting your money’s worth?\n\nThink of a game where you have like 12 different pokemon. At first it's interesting to test them out and get new abilities and make them stronger. Now imagine you have to level all those pokemon to progress as well as level a few duplicates since survival without a healer is unlikely. Now imagine some of those pokemon just die and you have to start leveling them from level 0 again. Aside from level 0 to 1, it takes 2 - 4 quests to gain a level. If repeating 50 - 80 mostly monotonous quests for 16 - 20 pokemon (since some will die) to complete this game sound like fun to you, then I highly recommend it.","October 19, 2015","false","45.9"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","28","49","2","0"

There are things about this game I really like and I hope this review will help the developers add some things (this is still in early release) to really make this game special.  I'll list various pros and cons.\n\nPositive - Combat positioning: Your characters and the enemy characters stand in a line (1-4).  Certain skills can only be used from certain positions and skills can only target certain enemy positions.  Some skills attempt to move an enemy to a new position.  This adds a nice strategic element to traditional turn-based RPG combat.\n\nPositive - Overall Graphics: Generally rather nice.  Game has a good feel to it graphically.\n\nNegative - Hero Uniqueness:  You basically recruit random heroes of a certain class.  These heroes stay with you until they die (very possible) or you dismiss them (can be a good idea at times).  These heroes start with a random assortment of skills and gain random quirks (both positive and negative) that separate them from other heroes of the same class.  The problem is several-fold: (1) Heroes don't have random base stats (e.g., strength) that allows separation; (2) All heroes of the same class can learn the same skills if you spend gold to upgrade them, leading heroes to be less unique; (3) Quirks don't do a great job of separation.  Sometimes a quirk is so bad you won't want to use the hero until its removed but other than that the most important thing is class composition on a dungeon run.\n\nNegative - Equipment:  The equipment system is about as rudimentary as you can get.  You don't find weapons and armor but improve it through town upgrades (requiring relics) and then spending gold.  All equipment for a certain class is the exact same, the only difference is the upgrade level (upgrading adds no random stats).  The only room for variation in equipment is two trinket slots.  While you find trinkets in dungeons and there appear to be a good number of them, the problem is that trinkets always have one positive effect and one negative effect.  While the positive effect tends to outweigh the negative effect, often I find myself not using trinkets because I don't want the negative effect.  Trinkets essentially boil down to knowing the dungeons and choosing a trinket whose positive effect will be valuable against those monsters and whose negative effect won't matter much.","September 2, 2015","false","15.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","0"

I don't know how people like TotalBiscet or NorthernLion make it look so fun. Maybe it's because I'm not the one playing. Maybe it is because they make it look easy. I don't know.\nI just start a game and I'm already having a salty time. Getting constistently hit by crits and consistently missing attacks makes combat feel very unnatural, despite the fact you're combating supernatural beings but that is not the point. It doesn't feel like I'm being slowly whittled down bit by bit like a #2 pencil in a hand-cranked sharpener, but more like I'm a #2 pencil being snapped in half for funsies.\nI feel no sense of escalation. Like instead of throwing monster fodder at me at the beginning like most RPGs do, it's more like every fight is a mini-boss, which means that one team of skeletons at the beginning of a mission will end you if RNGesus doesn't particularly like you that day.\nI can't settle in on one save file because I can't trust the game on anything, like gambling since my luck is about as reliable as getting kicked in the groin. I know there are options in the setting menu that will decrease the risk, but I'm afraid that will decrease the authenticity of the experience of what the game is suppose to provide. Which is a delema to me. Do I want to enjoy PLAYING the game, or enjoy playing the GAME? I'll probably just leave it in my Steam library and leave it alone ad infinium.\nDarkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of a bad situation. But if the best I can make out of a bad situation is effectively nothing (poor roster selection, essentially no gold, bad luck with RNG) or worse, what is the point in trying?","February 3","false","2.2"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","18","30","5","0"

It even seemed like it might deliver on these. Playing through its Early Access was usually enjoyable, even when bugs interfered. Still, there was always this nagging feeling that the developers could not quite get the balance of player power versus the game's environment down. There were many times where the game simply decided that you could not win, no matter how well equipped and pre-planned you went in; enemies would land critical strings constantly and dodge far more than they should even after being debuffed, or the foes would relentlessly target one specific unit even when the targeting system is meant to be randomized (aside from certain rare encounters). This feeling grew as release version after release version added more to the enemy's side but did nothing to bring up the player's tools to match. No amount of skill or planning can save you against terrible luck, especially when the abilities available to you just can not measure up to the enemies'.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, the game fell prey to the most common pitfall of the tag: the Random Number God trumps anything you might do, as the developers confused biased dice systems and overpowered enemies with genuine challenge. The early game will let you pass if you use tactics, but the mid and late game are all about praying that the dice land in your favor.\n\nOn top of luck being the deciding factor in combat and exploration, the game constantly stacks even the menus against you. Healing higher leveled heroes of stress, illnesses, or mental ailments becomes increasingly expensive just because they are a higher level than the scrubs fresh off the stagecoach; it's an arbitrary punishment for progressing with them! You may get stuck in a cycle of needing to do low level missions to pay for stress relief or illness removal on your higher level characters just so that you can play the missions that actually advance the story. Alternatively, you could just straight up dismiss characters that you already invested money in so that you can hire a fresh batch of heroes off the stagecoach to try again from the start.\n\nImbalanced gameplay aside, the game does present a very nice... errr, grim atmosphere. The gloomy graphics, subdued sounds, and sudden spikes of noise when something dramatic happens are great at setting the mood. Character animations are rather limited (for example, you get the same animation whether a character dodges or gets hit by something), but they do get the idea of the move or action across. The narrator, your character's ancestor who kicked off the plot, is usually entertaining with his comments, but they do become stale after you've heard every comment many times.\n\nOn a final note, major bugs are still seemingly common with the game, as it only recently left Early Access at the time of this review. My patience for it was finally ruined after my saves became corrupted. Such issues may be resolved in time, but until then you're risking all progress if you play in its current state.\n\nTLDR: It's luck-based, and still buggy. Wait to see if it gets fixed and rebalanced before you buy.","February 13","false","139.2"," 33 of 59 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","33","59","4","0"

After equipping my characters to maximum efforts, the nightmare of what many have described this game as 'unbalanced' has finally rung true, sadly. All time and effort battling with my characters, the last of hard earned gold purchasing much needed upgrades to venture the 5th level dungeons.. All.. for.. null. I have changed my tune and am no longer recommending Darkest Dungeon. I will put DD away until I find there is a much needed update to balance the 5th and 6th level dungeons. I can't imagine why anyone would continue playing this game. What's most upsetting is that I truly wanted to believe the negative reviews wrong..sigh\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat feels to be a dark side-scrolling dungeon crawler - bringing to mind games of past that I enjoyed, gathering them into one tough ultra strategic D&D RPG of sorts.\n\nI've found Darkest Dungeon (through trial and error) to be very tough on the unprepared. The game is brutal to both seasoned and unseasoned player who dive in with set goal in mind to conquer with a 'record time' mindset. If you do find yourself wanting to give this game a go, then you must know that your characters will die, every time, as long as they aren't developed enough through the lower stages while finding and equipping proper trinkets, leveling, and simply understanding correct placement in the line.\n\nPlacement in the line is probably the most important factor to survive and thrive in Darkest Dungeon, as there are 4 spots front to back where you will place your characters, each placement tailored specifically for different characters to maximize their individual strengths. Patience is needed to enjoy this title. If you don't have patience I suggest not purchasing this game as you will have a very difficult and stressful experience. You must study the characters and discover each of their strengths over time, while simultaneously learning by trial and error - dying, and starting over again - until you understand each characters abilities, placements and weaknesses.\n\nThe game is fun, I'm sincerely having a blast, and knowing there is permadeath keeps the intensity very high.\n\nI cannot stress enough that Patience, once again, is key to enjoying this game. You cannot rush a game of chess, in Darkest Dungeon you must understand your pieces and respect the unspoken rules of the game first before gaining any glimpse of an advantage.

The visual polish is incredible, even though it lacks variety. The core ideas are very interesting and some choices were good, such as the ability to leave a dungeon at any time to prevent loss of recruits, at a cost. The narrator is amazing and the addition of a section in the options menu which lets the player toggle certain systems such as corpses was a very good decision.\n\nThat said, while this breaks my heart to say, this is easily one of the most disappointing games I've ever played.\n\nAs it stands, progression-wise, Darkest Dungeon's design is very akin to your standard mobile game. Perform task, then perform task again, then perform same task again. As you do this, your funds may rise and you may inch yourself closer to... Whatever objectives the game throws at you. At its core, the game asks you to pick a party, throw the party into a dungeon where they'll hopefully succeed. After this, the player will receive funds in return for a good performance, promptly wasting said funds recovering party members from basically unavoidable mental injury and funding the next expedition's quasi-mandatory set of supplies. This will / may leave the player with a very, very small margin of profit. Since money is so important to progress, half of the game will feel like a constant grind to stay just above debt. Losing out will often imply a huge scuffle just to recover from debt. Running out of funds will almost always mean the player will be losing recruits or a great deal of time just to get back on the treadmill, let alone back to progressing.\n\nThe core design doesn't help this. I love turn-based RPGs and I particularly love tough ones. My favourite RPG series ever is Shin Megami Tensei, for example. The difference is that, in those games, the player has more going on that they don't feel like all they're doing is fighting. That's more or less what I felt while playing this. I fight, then I fight some more, and then I fight a little bit more, and in the end I hope that I made slightly more money than I wasted.\n\nI'd also like to add that for a game whose narrative is based around eldritch horror, it certainly is pretty safe with its monster designs.\n\nCombat-wise, each and every enemy encounter feels designed specifically to kill or maim the player's progression as fast as possible. Some enemies are dedicated solely to inflicting large amounts of stress damage and they're often protected by beasts with over-inflated health bars and sometimes even spells to protect other members from direct harm. On paper this might sound alright, but in practice, since practically every move a player makes is subject to RNG, it's hard for the player to feel like they can control their fate.\n\nThe game is too reliant on dice rolls and that's fine, in theory. However, the enemies are not under the same pressure that the player is, so they can easily form all-out attack parties and stack debuffs on your recruits because losing their ranks doesn't matter. They are more-or-less subject to the same kind of dice roll the player is, so to some players that might feel fair. But since the AI has no sense of self-preservation, they can easily throw themselves at your party until it breaks.\n\nThis would also be okay, would it not be for the overwhelming odds. The developer has gone on record to state that they wish this game to feel like the player is constantly in a bad spot. I understand this mentality, but I think it didn't work out for them.\n\nThe game becomes grueling to the point of frustration and tedium -- where things happen completely outside of your control and you're somehow being asked to feel responsible for something you couldn't possibly prevent. It's like saying you worked hard to win the lottery.This is one example of a new genre I call "Badge of Honour" games. Games which live and die through unfairly punishing design and are extremely contingent on clicking with the audience -- being able to say you've "beaten" Darkest Dungeon will become a badge of honour and very few people want to admit they won because they got lucky, so it creates this aura about it wherein the audience is divided by "people who got good", and "people who don't get it". Plainly, I disagree both of these are the case, so I don't feel the game should be recognized in this manner. There's nothing quite as infuriating as knowing a game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and yet being told it was intended.\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't possibly recommend Darkest Dungeon. There are those who say people like me "didn't get it", but I'm sorry. I systematically play bullethell games, I've done challenge runs in games like Contra and Megaman and I often engage in challenge runs in more modern games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I do get 'punishing but fair', and this is CERTAINLY not it.\n\nSeen as I'm told all of this was intended, I'll make sure to not recommend this. I can forgive awful balancing work and poor overall design due to inexperience, but if this was the vision the creator had, then they'll have to accept those consequences -- ironically.\n\nDid I enjoy my time with Darkest Dungeon so far? To some extent, sure. And I'll be playing more of it. That said, I am fully aware that this is a game a lot of people will not enjoy for this price.\n\nOnce the price drops to 5€ or thereabouts, I'll edit my review. Until then, again, I'm sorry, but at this price, a glorified mobile turn-based badge of honour game isn't worth your time or investment. I've said this before and I'll say it again: Videogames are a past time. Designing a videogame explicitly to make the player feel like crap on a constant basis is counterproductive at best, and just plain stupid design at worst.\n\nIf you're not convinced, then I would highly recommend downloading the Lighter Dungeon mod and then going into the game's files and adjusting the parameters to better fit your criteria. Bumping down the cost of supply items can go a long way toward making the experience bearable at best.\n\n"These terrible creatures can be killed; they can be beaten!"\n\nSure thing, narrator. If I'm lucky enough.","February 11","false","27.4"," 62 of 115 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","62","115","5","4"

But there is so much in this game that makes no sense and annoys the heck out of me:\n\n1. To much luck, to much randomness:\nYou have no indicator at all what will await you in a dungeon and what items you might need. No idea at all if the box you look into will be good or bad. The quirks your heroes get on every corner are also something you cannot control, doesn't matter if it's a good or negative one, no idea what enemies will await you. No idea or control about who the enemy will attack in your group. Pure frustration\n\n2. Slow & Repetitive:\nThe battles, the animations, everything is so slow. A fight could be over in 3 minutes, but thanks to the slow animations you need 15!!! Also you will want to strangle the voice who tells me the 50th time in a dungeon that my luck might be turning. Less frequent please or more tracks.\n\n3. Makes no sense:\nSo much makes 0 sense in this game: You buy items to go into a dungeon but if you don't use them they are magically gone afterwards. And the money you paid for them with it. And because you have no idea what awaits you in a dungeon it's a pure lucky guess if you buy the right items or not. Your heroes feel more like civilians than warriors. 50% of the game consists of sending them into overpriced bars/hospitals/churches to tend to their breakdowns. And you should spend a ton of your time to look into which hero likes what best and remembering it.\n\nI'm sorry, but this game must be made by SEO, because it's formula is to frustrate and punish the player on every single corner. Not because it's hard, but because you can also let a monkey play it as there is so much luck and crap involved.

If you hate yourself or play nothing but difficult and frustrating games that function off high risk low reward, you'll still love this game, but if you're a casual gamer or generally don't enjoy RNG-driven difficulty spikes then avoid this for now.\n\nThis IS a fun game, but it could really use a difficulty toggle that doesn't penalize your gains so much that playing on easy actually makes you suck more in the long run, since you gain less loot and gold, for only a small decrease in difficulty.\n\nThe game would greatly benefit from letting you play on easy for the first few dungeons you run and clear, and then gradually ramping up the reward curve for playing on hard so as to incite you to get comfortable and increase difficulty at your own pace. But also, it would benefit from easy being easier. As it is right now it really is just a self-imposed penalty on gains for only a tiny decrease in difficulty, and RNG can still totally screw you over anyway.\n\nTL;DR: Easy mode not easy enough, imposes huge penalty for almost no gain, especially combined with RNG. Latest patches have been pandering to the vocal minority asking for a harder more tedious game, alienating casual players.

It is true that characters (even your godly characters) are pretty much expandable, and accidents (mostly unfortunate ones) that kill them are really frustrating and sometimes unforseen (thus unfair). Yet, with the wisdom of our great humanity, the guides about this game are very abundant online right now. I would seriouly recommand any players who dare to venture into the darkest dungeon do read about those works of other players' pain and lessons. They would make you evade a lot of traps (due to designs, I feel like some features of the game are simply DESIGNED to be that horrible to go through).\n\nHowever, this is still a quite difficult and intricate games that require very meticulous planning and exceuting at every step. One misstep, especially at high levels, can mean the demise of your "powerful" characters.\n\nThe designers want this game to be dark, gloomy, and excrucitaing, and they succeed greatly, Mistakes are not tolerated, and odds are hardly in your favor. Do I recommend this game then? It is really not the question, I would still "recommend" simply because It is a greatly designed game that deserves some respect and applause. However, please think twice before deciding to launch your adventure into the darkest dungeon, it is not a game for lesiure fun.

Let me give a quick synopsis of it.\n\nYou are trying to reclaim your family's estate from dark forces. You recruit adventurers from the town to perform various quests, all involving adventuring in dungeons. You will have the ability to upgrade your party's skills and equipment, in addition to equip them with trinkets that can help or hinder them. There is a very diverse spectrum of character classes and builds that you can recruit, along with both positive and negative traits.\n\nBuilding a party of 4 adventurers whose skills benefit and support each other is key to adventuring successfully. While you adventure you will find treasure, trinkets, and "heirlooms". The latter of which you can use to upgrade the resources in the town to better support your adventurers. During your adventures your characters will not only take health damage, they will also gain STRESS. Varying factors can cause stress, everything from taking a lot of damage, enemy attacks, insufficient equipment, traps, other character's actions, your character's quirks, and even not enough lit torches. Having too much stress will cause your character to acquire quirks as they slip deeper into insanity, most of the ones you acquire will be detrimental, and hurt your character's performance, rarely will the quirk actually help them. In addition to quirks the characters can become diseased, further hurting (very very rarely helping) them. To remove the Stress, quirks, and diseases, you need to make use of the facilities in the town where the character will recover for 1 week in game (the time it takes to  perform 1 quest). Due to needing to recover from stress, diseases, or quirks you need to have multiple effective parties while the others recover.\n\nWhere this game falls short:\n- In the dungeon there is no way to heal outside of combat other than a dubious "Camping" which is not always present and subject to the characters skill sets and quirks. You can eat food for 1 HP each, until the character gets full (3 or 4 HP total). This is next to useless as most enemies will eliminate that in one hit.\n- Negative Quirks and Diseases are acquired faster than they can be healed. Paying to reduce stress, and cure quirks and diseases can get VERY expensive, there is no way to keep up with it, you have to become resigned to having patchwork characters with annoying negatives.\n- Farming is disallowed. Finally have a party of decent heroes? Think you can run some low level dungeons to get some gold so that you can actually pay to cure and outfit them? No, too bad. There is a level cap, your heroes will utterly refuse to go on quests that are "beneath them". I can understand this, so that you don't farm until you are unbeatable. But one Levelled hero should be able to join a low level party.\n\nBasically if you don't mind completely random events trashing characters that you've put time into and become attached to, then this is the game for you!","November 15, 2015","false","14.1"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","18","31","5","0"

It's sad because the hand drawn inked aesthetic was charming at first glance and could have been a great touch if the animation wasn't that cheaply done.\nThe background starts off as a good idea but is ultimatly used as an excuse to put you in a dungeon and do stuff without really getting into too much details, making the whole game not subtle at all if not forgettable.\nThe UI is sometimes messy and the tutorial just give you basic knowledge about generic stuff without getting into more details than just "click here to open the tab or here to move to another room", when it should be explaining you a few stuff about what's going on with every heroes you can recruit, what the hell is all these numbers and why every single usefull skill a caracter have that could help you out of combat has to proc randomly if you want to progress without pain in the dungeons.\n\nIn fact, the game is all about numbers, making it more a management game with a dungeon theme rather than an actual rogue-like or dungeon crawler. And this is mainly because most of the push-your-luck and progression in the game will resolve around how balanced and prepared your party will be, how well you manage your gold in upgrades and when you'll decide to go back to town before it's too late while exploring or questing, but even that will usually get reduced to simple dice rolls and bad lucks when the game decides it's okay to whipe 15hours of grinding (and the game is all about grinding) in just 1 encounter.\nIt's not about how well you'll do in the actual dungeon when facing dangerous enemy and defeating them thanks for a good strategy or reflexes, for there's too little skills for each character (being a turn based game) and nothing like well-timed attacks or stuff that will requires you, the player, to interract with the game to get the best out of every fight. It's all about gambling, and hope for the best.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where the game fail to be interesting, for me at least. Everything looks like a mobile game, from the way it presents missions with quest jauge that fills every 'run' you take and rewards when clicking things to the way it tackles the caracter and hub progression. I'm actually quite surprised there's no cash shop or, you know, a set limit of tasks to perform before being able to keep playing the next day.\nBut it boast and advertise itself about how hard and challenging it is when it's just all extremly unfair RNG and bad difficulty.\n\nIt's not about being casual or blaming tje die and retry mecanic, for i do beleive some games like that are actually really enjoyable (ie meatboy), but more about what purpose the difficulty serve to your game. For there's different kind of diffilcuty and so no, "Hard" doesn't necessarily mean "Good".\n\nYou see, Games like volgarr the viking, crypt of the necrodancer, the binding of isaac or even dark souls are really hard games too but they're fair, because they use difficulty as a challenge you have to overcome instead of making it completly arbitrary and unforgiving. They don't throw you backward in your progression and tell you "it's because it's hard, it's fun !".\nThere's a feeling of accomplishement or pride once you've overcome an obstacle that you couldn't handle by making you learn and that's what makes them good games.\nIn DD, the difficulty is just something that randomly happens, sometimes, and you can't do things about it, making it pointless to some degree : when you finish a quest or manage to survive, you don't feel like you deserve it, in fact it just feel like that you either got lucky or that it's just the regular way the game is supposed to happens. And then you encounter a fight when suddenly everything miss and you have to wait about 20 minute for every small text bubble and zoom effect and shaking camera and death blow or alteration announcing without being able to touch or speed anything when you party just decide to kill itself, and you can't change a thing about it.\n\nIt's sad because it's quite a pretty well executed indy game besides that, considering all the trash that pass through the greenlight system.\n\nSuch a waste of potential.","December 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 59 of 110 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","59","110","4","1"

Personally, I had to restart a save file two seperate times to get the ball rolling right. If you like games that punish you when you take the easy way, but reward you if you can adapt to the curve and dwell in the darkness, then this is the game for you.\n\nHere are my thoughts, the good and the bad:\n\nPros:\n- Harsh gameplay mechanics (for those who like a challenge)\n- The art style and gritty aspects of the dungeons\n- The classes and the strategic combos you can set up with the various skill sets\n- High risk, high reward (generally)\n\nCons:\n- RNG can definitely kill a good run and be frustrating at times\n- End game content is non-existent (early access)\n- Repetitive grind to advance your characters (Randomly generated dungeons get to a point of just being giant checker boards of doom)\nX The inability to sell relic trinkets, the inability to sell base upgrade resources (They have added the ability to sell trinkets)\n\nOverall this is a great game with great potential, hoping to see more updates soon! Personally, I only recommend the game as I have enjoyed my time playing it, but if you are looking for a title with more content to dig into you may want to pass until a beta stage, or final release.","April 14, 2015","true","59.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But in the end, when you complete a dungeon alive a smile will pop in you face.\n\nThe game is all about grinding. The more dungeons you complete, the more gold you have to spend in upgrades and trinkets (equipments for your heroes). Each dungeon has a reward, and there are three kinds of dungeons: you have a short dungeon - it has fewer rooms - and its easier to complete, you also have medium dungeons - it has an considerable amount of rooms - and you get a campfire, with you can set a camp and rest/buff you heroes mid-quest, and last but no least you have long dungeons - it has a lot of rooms - you will have to go through a huge amount of rooms in order to complete those kind of dungeons.\n\nYou also have to set a strategy before going into an adventure. In certain areas of the game, monster will be more resistent as certain kind of DoT (damage over time) than others. Keep it in mind when you`re think in bring a Plague Doctor to the Weald, or remember to have a Crusader in you party when you`re going to the cursed Ruins.\n\nYou will also have to manage resources before going to an adventure. You can buy torches, food, antivenom, bandages etc. Everything to raise the chances of your crew to return alive to the town. I`d say that is still possible to complete a dungeon without bringing anything, but you`ll have to retreat 99% of the time.\n\nWell, if world isn`t perfect, why should this game be?\n\nAfter about 100 hours I`ve reached the max level with every class in the game, killed all the bosses, collected all the ancestral items and my town was fully upgraded. Well, there was anything more to do. You still have dungeons to complete, but as I said the fun part is the grinding, and when you finish grinding you don`t have much to do. You definitely can still have fun, challenging yourself to do a dark run (without torches) and so on, but that`s up to you.\n\nI`d highly recommend this game for everyone who enjoy play RPG, turn-based like games. This game is totally worth the $15 you have to pay.","November 10, 2015","true","168.7"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","2"

There are so many character classes such that I have not used them all let alone try all possible permutations of a four adventurer party. Managing your hamlet is just as stressful as combat when deciding where to spend your hard earned resources. I opted to boost the strength of my party by focusing on the guild and blacksmith but every so often I had to throw some resources to help my adventures recover from all the horrors they had seen.\n\nIt felt like I had a rich game that I was going to lose myself in for days.\n\nBut after those first few hours I realized that I felt I wasn't making any real progress. Sure I had a few adventures at level two but I wasn't really making enough money to actually upgrade their skills and equipment. I also never seemed to be sending out the same party composition more than once. The stress would be too great or some malady was would afflict an adventure and they would have to miss a week of adventuring while I spent some gold healing them up. The caravan never really seemed to bring me much variety (could I please have more than one Arbalst?) so it forced me to put together so many patchwork party compositions because I just didn't have the ones I wanted to try. Also, every time I came back from a quest I didn't really have enough money to do any major upgrades to my characters such that I felt I was ready for the next challenge.\n\nIt was at this time that I had realized I had already entered the grind of the game. I had only been doing lvl 1 short quests (either complete every room battle or explore 90% of rooms) and I was already at a point where I felt like I needed to grind for hours to make enough progress to even attempt the first boss of the game.\n\nBut OK this is a hardcore game right? Maybe I'm just playing it wrong. I set myself a goal of attempting one of the first bosses, the Swine Prince, and I picked out a party that I thought would work well and aimed to get them to level two with level one skills and armor (since my guild or blacksmith was not upgraded enough to get everything to level two). I grinded for four more hours and got exactly what I wanted and equiped my party with the best trinkets I had, provisioned them to the gills and out I went. I explored the dungeon and didn't even need to camp before I scouted the boss's lair. It was at this point where things went completely sideways. I managed to kill the boss but I lost three of my four party members. All of that time and energy was gone without much to show for it. All the gold I got for beating the boss was essentially a moot point because I would need to spend it all again to upgrade new adventurers to have that same level of skill and equipment. With respect to the boss battle I felt like I could have retreated and gone back to the hamlet with my spoils. But I would have to spend a lot of gold to reduce the stress and afflictions they had acrued on the quest so it feels like it would have been a moot point.\n\nBut again this is a hardcore game! I just gotta git gud! I mean I made progress right? Killing one of those first bosses means something does it not? Let's pick out a second boss and try again. So I picked out the Wizened Hag, put together a team, grinded for two hours to get them where they needed to be (some this time had level two armor because I finally got enough freakin' deeds) and set out into the dungeon. It went every much like the first where I got to the boss without needing to camp and I made my attempt. This time only two of my four adventurers died, although the other two came back with such high stress that they won't ever been quite the same.\n\nAnd so I am back again to where I was before I decided it was time to attempt my first boss. I have a stable of adventurers that are in no shape to make any attempt on the next boss let alone an attempt at a level three dungeon. None of my healers are above level zero since they've all died so I'll need to grind them up again. But I could do it. I could pick a boss, pick a party composition, grind 2-4 more hours doing the level one dungeons and make another attempt. Odds are I'll lose some adventurers again but thats a point of the game. How does a player deal with such great loss? To me though the grind is just far too obvious that it makes it much easier to just put down the mouse and keyboard and walk away. Its far too clear that I'll have to just grind the same dungeons over and over again, kill the same creatures and then go into another boss battle completely blind where I am likely to come away with some heavy losses. And after I kill all four of the starting bosses I'll be essentially in the same position as I was before with the exception of my hamlet being a little more upgraded. But at that point I'll have to do all of this over again for level three dungeons and I think that I need something else to pull me throught his grind.","January 31","false","12.3"," 64 of 120 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","64","120","5","3"

The fact that it came out already a good game is something of a godsend in the sea of unfinished products that we seem to be getting more and more off lately. Having your heroes and a town you slowly upgrade and bring into their own is a very good feeling, as you always feel like you are doing some amount of good at least.\n\nHowever a game is not without its flaws as the game doesn't really progress all that much, though it takes a heck of a long time to feel it since you need to constantly have the same heroes. Another problem I found is a slight lack of attachment to the heroes, as they may all have their own drives and wants, but... They hardly ever stick around long enough for you to attach to them and soon you become appthetic to their deaths "Oh well another one for the corpse pile" And that just shouldn't be in my opinion\n\nOverall a lovely game and well worth the money.","April 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

What I got was a sub-standard dungeon crawler with masochistic tendencies and a design philosophy that discourages strategic and tactical thinking. Alongside this is a meaningless progression grind that would make any mobile tower defense game proud.\n\nIt's an exercise in rolling dice that requires a large investment of time for little to no satisfaction.You will grind for hours to kit out a team to take on the end bosses but your victory rarely feels earned - careful planning and team structure will not win the day, lucky crits and blasting everything with all the ♥♥♥♥ you can muster will.","December 6, 2015","false","34.1"," 50 of 93 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","50","93","2","10"

From UI to gameplay everything transfers swiftly, yet without breaking the immersion or atmosphere. The story is simple and goes well with the gameplay. Enviromental design, art style, narrator voice and the choice of words paint an awesome, yet grim, Warhammer Fantasy-style feeling in the canvas of your mind. Several times, I have found myself sitting in front of my screen playing "one more dungeon" and doing "little more management".\n\nIn it's core Darkest Dungeon is a hardcore gaming experience that needs time and dedication to learn and master. More I learn, more I realize the outcome is in my hands. There is surprisingly little weight on RNG when compared on many other roguelikes. At times things have felt unfair but later the realization of mistakes has stroke me. For a singleplayer game, such as Darkest Dungeon, the feelings of victory and defeat are strong and enjoyable. They remind me of Dark Souls, Faster Than Light and This War of Mine.\n\nPS. I recommend renaming or adding nicknames to  your subjects whenever you feel like so. It creates a nice bond between You and your lackeys.

The art, the voice acting, the addicting gameplay, it all comes together perfectly to make a game that's already one of my favorite of all time. The game just gets better and better with each update.

It's punishing and difficult, but these nightmarish creatures can be felled, they can be beaten.\n\n\nThe Long of It:\n\nThroughout Early Access, people's opinions on the game have shifted harder than a Cultist being bombarded by a Bounty Hunter's Flash Bang, which is the main reason you'll still see negative reviews, but the solution the developers finally settled on has been the absolute best one, and people not updating their reviews to reflect this is the main reason some reviews are still negative.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a dark dungeon crawler (heh), where you lead a party of four heroes and the items you provide for them into the depths, time and again, hoping every time they'll make it out alive, knowing the possibility is very real that they won't - and if they do, they might be so traumatized and mentally scarred that you decide to let them spend the rest of their lives wandering, impoverished and unhinged.\n\nThe entire game balances on the question, 'what are your heroes worth'? Given the constant influx of new hopefuls, it'll be very tempting to dismiss heroes or send them on a suicide mission to recover as much loot as possible, simply because you can't afford to take care of them. Because while wounds of the body heal, wounds of the mind do not, at least not without a sizeable cost in gold.\n\nThat is not to say all your heroes are doomed. They can win fights and clear dungeons, grow stronger and become Heroes worthy of a capital 'H', champions honed and trained for one purpose: to brave the depths of the eponymous Darkest Dungeon.\n\nWhen your characters aren't delving in the depths of the Dankest Dungeon, you have 'free' time to upgrade the hamlet, adding some modest but interesting base building to the mix. With the heirlooms your heroes collect from the dungeons, you can upgrade buildings, whose functions range from upgrading weapons and armour to curing stress and disease or selling trinkets. Unless of course, the heirlooms remain forever in the dark, clutched in the dead hands of your adventurers.\n\n\nThe Right of It\n\nYou will get attached to your heroes, and the threat of them dying when they set out into the depths is always very real, but good preparation can minimize that risk. Darkest Dungeon uses a Random Number God who may throw a wrench in even the best-laid plans, but with the game's immensely clever and dynamic combat system, good planning and calculated responses to unexpected circumstances will do much to win the day.\n\nSo no, you have no direct control over the numbers, but yes, you can make a very significant difference as the player without success or failure hinging on die rolls. Character classes are so diverse (and individually customizable) that the possibilities of combining them are endless, and a good combination and positioning of characters is a fun challenge every time you assemble a team, as is a clear-headed response when enemies mess up your formation and heroes start having to fight in positions they're not accustomed to.\n\nThe base building aspect, while slightly grindy, is a streamlined but functional and efficient element, and seeing your hamlet get restored from a ruined ghost town to a thriving community is a joy to watch - even though the graveyards are packed with heroes who died to make it happen.\n\nAll this takes place in a world full of gothic, dark beauty, with an art style that never bores, even though the game consists mostly of still images, animated and moved to reflect what happens. This isn't to say that the game is a boring slideshow - the camera moves and pans, visual effects splatter off the screen, and thanks to good animation, the entire world is moving and alive.\n\nAdd a highly evocative narrator, Wayne June, who provides tons of atmosphere while hamming it up to just the right levels, and you've got a gripping experience that'll keep you engaged during every moment.\n\n\nThe Wrong of It\n\nIf you like high-poly 3D-models, motion capped animations and lighting that makes your 980TI Titan chug, then you'll probably want to pass on this. But it would be your loss, since the amazing art style and execution is more efficient and powerful than any amount of realism could ever be. The animators did a wonderful job too, making the still images come alive as the action unfolds.\n\nAlso, be aware that Darkest Dungeon is difficult. You'll need to stay focused if you wish to survive, because even trash mobs (and there aren't many of those) can devastate a party if the player's concentration lapses. Because of this, heroes will die. If you get attached to your heroes, like I do, this can be difficult to deal with. All players so far consider Darkest Dungeon's difficulty to be a plus, but if you want to just play a game and have fun without thinking too much, you might consider the difficulty a stumbling block.\n\nBe aware that you can - and probably should - turn off many difficulty options introduced by the devs in Early Access to discourage certain tactics or make the game more hardcore, and that's a good thing. Some of those options were, with good reason, seriously disliked by most EA players, including myself, for making the game unfairly difficult.\n\n\nThe Last of It\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a must have for any role player, save-scum hater, tactics fan, or really anyone who likes a solid challenge (s)he can overcome with clever and tactical thinking. In fact, I can recommend it to everyone except people who play video games purely as a relaxing distraction after a hard work day, because it does require concentration and active thinking.\n\nSeriously, people, Red Hook created a masterpiece.","January 26","true","26.4"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","23","41","5","11"

The 2D animations, instant load times and nice UI effects make for a pretty sight.\n\nHowever, as hard as I tried, I haven't really had any fun playing. The game is difficult, in a way where you don't really get to feel angry about your decisions and in the end learn from your mistakes. Rather, you end up feeling like you're constantly out of luck.\n\nThere are 2 phases in the game : exploring dungeons, and managing your party back in the town between adventures.\n\nIn the dungeon is where the luck element gets into play, and that could be fine. But unfortunately, the state of your party degrades exponentially rapidly. So you need to be in excellent shape for more than half of the dungeon in order to have a chance at finishing it. It rarely feels like you barely make it out alive; you either die far from the end, or you clearly had incredible luck / too powerful a party for that dungeon's level of difficuly.\n\nAlso, there are so many events and animations that I felt I was watching the game play against itself in fights. When it's finally your turn to do something, out of the 4 abilities each of your character has, there was rarely the feeling that some tactical thinking was in order. I would more or less select the offensive ones one by one, then hover above a monster to get an idea of the hit probability, then cross my fingers. There is not really any worthwile build-up of buffs, as they are not that good, and losing a turn buffing yourself is dangerous. Fights were not very exciting to me.\n\nFinally, when your party is surprised by enemies, your order is basically shuffled, which means some characters won't be able to act at all. You then need to spend one or more turn rearranging your positions, which is madenning since you don't know in which order your characters will act, and since they cannot always move to any given position in one go. All the while getting attacked, and not retaliating. Not very fun all in all.\n\nMeanwhile, in town, some design decisions made me wonder about the developer's intentions. For example, if you need to send a couple party member to the church or tavern for stress relief, you basically have to go in each building, figure out first which slots will be available to each character, which is not really fun. But then once you commit to a slot and pay, you won't get your money back if you need change your assignments. Since stress relief can easily cost more than 50% of your income, this is kinda frustrating. Please, just let me select heroes that I want to have a relaxing time, and show me options, instead of the manual, error prone and unfun assignment.\n\nAlso, when preparing to delve into a dungeon, you need to buy supplies, but anything you don't use is not refunded or kept for another go. I do not really see the point in this; there is enough reliance on the random number generator in this game without having us wild guessing how much money should be wasted on items. This just leads to grinding for more money.\n\nPros:\nGreat engine, great UI, pretty as hell\nGreat writing supported by even greater voice acting\nCons:\nDifficulty stems from luck rather than tactics; I'm not sure I could get much better at the game\nFrustrating design choices in the Town phase\nFun is not something I would describe this game as being. Not really frustrating either, just kinda boring :(","June 14, 2015","false","15.0"," 39 of 72 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","39","72","3","0"

Early on you may not notice it as much but the game quickly creeps up with the difficutly spike if your not careful. Maybe its just me but the difficulty progression feels "off".\n\nDon't get me wrong. The premise, the atomsphere, the narrator and the artsyle are all very nice. However the gameplay elements turn the game into more of a grindfest which is a shame as this game from what I remember in Early Access wasn't actually like that.\n\nA good tip I would recommend to newplayers is once you are in the Hamlet, go to your gameplay options, click Darkest  Dungeon Configuration and turn off Corpses. It will save you a few headaches. Another tip is if one of your party members is getting close 100/200 stress, leave the dungeon. As unless you have the proper quirks and trinkets, your character is usually going to be hit with an affliction and these afflictions stress out the rest of your party and cause them to get afflictions or worse... heart attacks which can kill your party member.\n\nI honestly cannot recommend this game unless your honesltly looking for a real challenge.","February 4","false","11.7"," 39 of 72 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","39","72","5","0"

It all works together. That cinematic trailer for Darkest Dungeon? It really captures exactly how the game feels.\n\nIn combat, the music is tense, and the camera zooms into attacks for effect. It's very quick, so no time is wasted, but it makes every attack feel exciting and apprehensive. There is a narrator that really pumps up the excitement as well, commending a crit or a kill... or a loss. When your stress limit hits 100%, the hero's resolve is tested... and there's a brief pause... will he become Courageous and rally his comrades? Or will he become Hopeless and become the doom of everyone?\n\nTown mechanics are pretty neat too. You upgrade the town facilities using these items you collect from your adventures, but you upgrade/fix your heroes using the gold you have accrued. This separation of resources is nice, because it lets you focus your gold on party management.\n\nParty management is pretty nifty but simple. Between adventures in dungeons, you can put various party members in the tavern or abbey to relieve the stress they have added up through adventuring. You can also slowly eliminate negative afflictions that your heroes have.\n\nThe game's main gimmick is "Stress". As your heroes fight in the dungeons, they will become stressed after witnessing unsettling things or taking critical hits or being debuffed by the enemy. The higher one hero's stress is, the more susceptible he/she is to the enemy's attacks. This can also trigger the hero's quirks (ex. Stress > 50: -2 Speed). At 100% stress, "The Hero's Resolve Will Be Tested". When this happens, RNG will happen to see if your hero can overcome this or not. It's quite epic to see your hero get a perk out of it and display his/her heroism. It also feels incredibly hope-shattering to see them become 'Hopeless' or 'Abusive'.\n\nIn addition to "Stress", there are also "Quirks". Each hero can have good quirks (perks) and bad quirks (afflictions). These are permanent attributes to a hero, and there are ALOT! There are several ways that a hero can earn a quirk. At the end of a dungeon, there is a chance for a hero to earn one. During a dungeon the hero may learn something from a book or an altar. Quirks include things like "Slugger", "Evasive", "Slayer of Eldritch" or "Syphilis", "Creeping Cough", "Deviant Tastes". You can even get quirks in town!. For example, your hero enjoyed meditation so much that they gain the "Meditator" perk which makes meditating more effective. Or perhaps they went to the bar to relieve stress but earned the affliction of "Tippler", making alcohol their only method of stress relief. There is a building in town that lets the player pay gold to rid afflictions one at a time, but it will cost gold and put the hero out of commission for one adventure.\n\nThe last gimmick of the game is the in the Dungeons. There is a light meter that continually drains as you make progress in the dungeon. The darker the dungeon is, the more dangerous and stressful it becomes (but more rewarding as well!). Before you enter the dungeon, you will buy and bring provisions with you such as food (to heal or feed your party when they get hungry) or torches (to increase the light meter as you consume them) or other misc items like shovels and bandages.\n\nAs of this review, the game has a few bugs, some more noticable than others. Notably there are bugs regarding gold and text. It's relatively stable in my experience. I had two crashes on Day One but have not had one since. There are a few questionable balance decisions that are being pointed out in the forums, and hopefully they will be weighed and addressed. Definitely feels like it's in beta, but it's very playable in it's current state and it's lots of fun. I can only imagine how this game will look once it leaves Early Access. I have high hopes here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's also this thing that people are butthurt about, and it's a kickstarter exclusive class. Though I am a kickstarter, I was not in the donation level to get it. I have no idea what it is and I totally forgot there was one. The game as-is is awesome, and the lack of one class was not detrimental to my experience. Might be the principle of the matter I guess, but I can say at least that this game is not broken without it.","February 3, 2015","true","34.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I'll sing some praise first, since the game is ok.\n\nI won't list everything that's good about Darkest Dungeon (DD), but it does have a lot of goodness tucked away inside.  I really love the artistic style, and turn based combat for example.  These two things drew me to DD.  Stress is a gimicky mechanic, I could take or leave.  It works and adds something to the game play, even though there are times I wish it didn't.\n\nThe real problems for me is game pacing, variety, and length.\n\nI've found that pacing is one of those things that rpg's in general have a poor time getting just right.  DD over complicates it by using five different currencies, and then in a rather miserly fashion not giving them out in any quantity.  To add to the worries, bag space is extremely limited, so even if you find some great hoard you might not profit by it.  Oddly enough, the exp gains might be spot on, but without the other resources your party will quickly be outmatched so there's no way I can tell for sure.  Essentially, you'll be forced to start over at some point and rebuild a team with fewer flaws, and hopefully higher earning potential.\n\nThe rebuilding of a team isn't bad in itself.  I think it fits the atmosphere the game is going for.  This does lead to problems though.  All of the heroes are rather cookie cutter.  That's not bad presuming that you'll be burning through a lot of expendable characters.  On the downside, there's no reason to be invested in any of them either.  Additionally, every dungeon run is more or less exactly the same.  There are, I don't know, three, four different quest objectives?  Each zone a handful of unique mobs, plus a handful that could appear in any zone.  It leads to dungeon runs where the only objective is to smash and grab while min/maxing the curios and bag space as best you can.  It's too expensive to take stress damage, or risk a negative quirk.  So you find your little strategy, and more or less do the same things in dungeons you could hardly tell apart.\n\nIf this game clocked in at 20 hours from start to finish, I'd feel better about it.  It's not.  There are eight bosses, each of which requires some number of zone specific dungeon grinds to open, and has to be killed three times, at slightly more difficult levels.  Why?  just because. . . I'm almost through now, and I like the game enough to finish, and possibly restart it, but come on.  Have some respect for my time.  I've also read some spoilers about the ending.  All I can say is for real?\n\nDD is a good game mired in poor design.  Everything seems to work, which is a big plus.  Guess it's suppose to be hardcore?  There are times it just feels like a hardbore, or a hardchore.  It's not at all bad, it just isn't that great once you get your teeth into it.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend a pass on this one, unless you can get it on sale.  There are some neat things to see, but once you've seen them, you'll see them again and again, and again.","February 18","false","158.2"," 101 of 192 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","101","192","3","27"

Or that the RNG is against you. For me, the problem is if you don't look up youtube videos and read the wiki cover to cover, the gameplay sucks. There's no trial and error, because your party will be wiped out, your gold reserves emptied and you'll have to start again and go through the painfully long tutorial. There are so many times where I've found a boss, tried to fight them only to realise that they endlessly summon. By the time you've worked out that this is indeed a bossfight, you've lost. I'm all for no hand holding, but DD seems to delibrately deny you any clues on what the hell is going on until it's too late.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this review quite late and upon looking at it again, see I've left off the end. There IS a good game, once you get past the ridiculous learning wall. The aesthetic is brilliant, the difficulty, once you've thoroughly read the wiki, is just right to be always challenging. The gear upgrade is a bit pointless, as are the skill levels. However, it's rather made up for by the plethora of trinkets you can equip to tweak your characters' stats.\nOverall, this is a good game if you have the patience to persevere, but I couldn't recommend it as it is with so much vital information witheld from the player.","January 26","false","38.4"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","26","47","4","0"

To truly play Darkest Dungeon you must be prepared to be flogged, punished and beaten to a pulp by the game and it's harsh rules. I cannot recommend Darkest Dungeon to everybody, because not everybody is a flagellant who revels in abuse and hardship, who can withstand the stress and push on with their resolve tested and steadfast but be wary, as your great ancestor says triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall.\n\nA big part of Darkest Dungeon, and another reason why I cannot recommend it to everybody, is that you must learn harshly from your mistakes and correct them in future endeavors. Not everybody has the stubbornness, not everybody can get over a setback, because after all failure tests the mettle of heart, brain and body but heart most of all. I consider myself masochistic enough to enjoy this game but even I have had moments of quiet contemplation wondering whether it really was worth it to continue.\n\nThere is another component of Darkest Dungeon which will shy a lot of weaker-willed people away. Luck. I don't consider myself a gambler, and I don't get thrills from playing the numbers, so personally, I'm not a huge fan of the way that luck is used in Darkest Dungeon. If you are not prepared to take risks, to compromise for chance and to expect the worst Darkest Dungeon is going to walk all over you. Almost literally every factor in the entire game is dictated by a roll of the dice and dice being the fickle ivory cuboids that they are, have no allegiance. One dungeon you might roll full sixes with a great layout and constant critical hits but in another, snake eyes.\n\nNow that I have outlined what makes this game challenging I would like to address the other reviews for Darkest Dungeon. You may be confused when you see the amount of negative reviews in the helpful section. I don't want to say that they're salty and that the people who vote them as helpful are salty, but what I will say is that many of them call for a rebalance patch, quite often on the grounds that the game used to be easier, now it's harder or it's just difficult or unreasonable or a grindfest and therefore not fun. Personally I don't believe that darkest dungeon is meant to be fun, at least not to everybody. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be a challenge, an obstacle to overcome something to work at. The game is far from impossible and if you lack the mettle, courage and perserverance to withstand the effort to triumph, you need to try harder and learn from your mistakes before slapping a "boo-hoo I failed and had to restart but I refuse to learn from my mistakes and improve" negative review on it\nTLDR: The game isn't meant to be fun for everybody get over yourself and realize not every game is tailor made to your preferred difficulty cap before you post a heavily opinionated review that doesn't help anybody understand jack.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a fantastic, hellish experience which will push you to your limits and beyond, but be warned that it is not for everybody, as the Old Road will take you to Hell, but in that gaping abyss, you will find your redemption. So, steel yourself, and remember, there can be no bravery without madness, because truly, this is the Darkest Dungeon\n\nPros\n- Fantastic Soundtrack\n- Extremely well styled art.\n- Bone-Chilling Narrator Wayne June, whom I used to listen to while he read Lovecraft novels\n- Rewarding strategy gameplay\n- Psychological Warfare\n- Gambling\n- Lovecraftian storytelling, themes and monster design\n- Heart Pounding suspense\n- Just the right amount of unpredictability to be remedied by experience, compromise and gumption\n\nCons\n- Insane difficulty spikes\n- Sometimes Victory can feel hollow, trifling even when stacked to the hardships to come\n- Extremely stressful, I've caught myself breathing hard, shaking and fearful at times, not from rage, but from terror at the unpredictable situation I've been forced into\n- Demoralizing, sometimes you might just feel like giving it all up... but regroup! Reassemble! Darkest Dungeon is timeless, after all.\n\nEDIT 01: Just Read the 6th of February patch notes Heroes with the Never Again trait (prevents hero from re-entering final stage) now gives other party members a 30% XP buff when running dungeons as well as reduced the amount of XP required to reach resolve 6. Never again and being forced to level new heroes to 6 for the final stage was one of those things people used as an excuse to call Darkest Dungeon a "grindfest" and I understand why they would think that. I'm glad they patched those and gave whiners one less thing to complain about.","February 6","true","58.9"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","26","47","7","0"

[Long Review]\n\n\n\nPlot:\n\nAfter his suicide, an old relative in his last will reveals that you will inherit of an estate cursed by an old evil dungeon.\nYou decided to claim your property and bring back order to this land.\nBut on the way your coach is attacked. Leaving you and your body guards surrounded by cutthroats and bandits. After having dealt with them, you arrive at the miserable and gloomy village that belongs to you.\nNow starts your adventure, you will bring back the old stability of the village and purify the land and, maybe, put an end to the terror lying in the nearby ...  Darkest Dungeon.\n\n\nLayout:\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a dark and mature rpg. You mission is clear, get rid of monsters that threaten your estate with the help of warriors and the village that belongs to you. The ultimate goal is to reach the guardian of the Darkest Dungeon to put to an end the madness that curses the land.\n\nThe main aspect of the game is psychology. Indeed, every character is affected by its environment, especially in the dungeons. The light in corridors, actions like opening a chest or triggering a trap, resting and even fighting can stress your warriors and make them weaker with debuffs called: Quirks.\nOf course you have many ways to reduce it, the most important is the village where you can unlock and upgrade buildings dedicated to relax your characters.\n\nBut beware, death is inevitable and permanent. And it's a part of the game to create teams of 4 characters with different   set of skills/ classes and be able to cycle between them to explore and accomplish quests effectively\n\nVenturing into dungeons needs planning, you can select characters, their skills (4 max per warrior), equipment and supplies because into dungeon they need to eat, to light their way and use items to counters bad events such as debuffs after fights or random encounters like when you are stuck in front of rubbles and you need a shovel to go through with ease... but the shovel is expensive and takes place in your inventory like loot.\nEven loot is a problem because money takes precious slots in your inventory!\nTo move in the dungeon you can use a little map to choose your direction or even see what you may encounter if you had the chance to scout the sector (random event), and after to progress in corridors using movement keys or mouse. Your group  walk in order until they find something and you will need to select one of them to activate an item that in general trigger a dice roll influenced by the skill of the character, the item you used with it or maybe the both.\n\n\nThe game is set around few phases:\nRecruiting and management of your characters, Management of the village, Planning quests where you have to buy supplies/gear for your team, Exploring Dungeons and be back alive to take another team while the last one needs to go to the bar, brothel, abbey, sanitarium... to recover from the horrors they lived.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nDarkest Dungeon works around a good fighting system. Each party has 4 characters, they are ordered in a straight line where placement is important. Even skills depend of this placement. In general close combat fighters are in front line, slots 1 and 2. And healers and range units are in slots 3 and 4. This system is great especially in front of stress which is one of the most dangerous attacks your warriors will receive. Indeed some enemy units stay behind their buddies and send attacks that fill stress quickly. So even if you have a nice combat team with good damages and restorative effects, you will need someone capable to manage the placement of the enemy. By talking of the enemy, this is a real devil capable to focus on the weak ones, ambush you or even flush your team composition, leaving you in chaos and hurry to find the best formation to endure the fight.\nThe feeling during fights is extraordinary. At the beginning you will have problems to grasp the subtleties, like for the plague Doctor who is a marvelous crowd control that will save you if you use him correctly.\nBut when you get the overall idea, you will enjoy counter attacks or even some fights where the enemy is just unable to reach you. By the way it's a part of the game to stun enemy and use this moment to heal your team and go further.\nEven light is important. It's a bar that shows the light you produce. The fact is, the more light you have, the better you heroes will be (less stress, less enemies). The funny thing is some items are related to this "light meter" and even spawn rate of monsters. You want more challenge and money ? Try your luck into the darkness!\n\nIt's one of the many funny events this game has, like when you can camp in average and long dungeons to recover some health and reduce your stress and debuffs. During camping you use a completely different set of skills for each character that you can modify and upgrade like regular combat skills. The moral feature of the game is really funny especially when your team is totally exhausted and one of you characters (it depends of the class, Hellion is my favorite for that!) is inspired and during battle brings back his comrades moral and give them strength to win.\nAnd when your team is mad it can be the contrary, like when one of your guys does little damages or misses and one of his buddies humiliates him. Even passing the turn of a character makes him angry and increase his stress ! Consider that everything I said can be applied when things are right but in a weaker mesure, like when a monster die, good events/discoveries, criticals and you have a good idea of this system.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a gem. Art work is amazing: you play in a comic. The game is in a beautiful 2D and sprites are very cool. Only the Dark design might disturb some but the game stays correct all the time. Not too gore or vulgar. I hope more developers will follow this way and give nice atmosphere and design for unrivaled gameplay.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nNice and greatly participate in the gloomy atmosphere of the game. I love the intro video where the narrator is excellent. But more voices would be great.\n\n\nTo conclude:\n\nDarkest Dungeon is already a gem, even if the game needs some balancing in combat, for an early access it's amazing.\nEverything is cool  and original, even the difficulty is correct if you consider that the enemy uses the same strategies, like in Dark Souls. The only aspect in don't like are the speech bubbles of characters that appears too often and when your team is mad it can be really annoying to wait each time they finish to talk to be able to act.\nBy the way I would like to see more interactions between characters, like friendship or the contrary. To make things more realistic and reward you when you succeed in keeping your teams alive and your characters in good shape.\nYou can notice few bugs in the game but the autosave is enough present to keep your progress saved.\n\nOkay, so if you read my review, go up , search the green button, press purchase and enjoy.\n\n\nN.B: If you think the game is in general based on luck (don't believe players reviews) it is not.\nIn fact if you take some time you will understand that taking risks or being too greedy brings bad luck.\nFew exemples: Maintain your light meter around 75% before entering a room. A team of monsters may ambush you.  Openning everything you find on your way, without knowing the appropriates items, characters will receive quirks and  stress at a higher rate.  Ambushed, retreat from the fight and come back to have a regular start, don't forget to rearange your team. Be ware or food and torches. 10 of each will save you, especially considering that meals are random event that can trigger even after a previous one... And torches reduces stress rate. So spare your money on blight and bleed items.","February 4, 2015","true","18.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","1"

But for the reasons very well articulated in the top negative reviews, I can't do so in good faith.\n\nWhich is really too bad. This could be one of my favorite games. I'm not turned off by the difficulty, the RNG, or the  lack of gameplay variety (I'm a big fan of rogue-likes though). It's the grind that makes this game painful to play after the first (awesome) dozen hours. With just a handful of small changes, this could be a phenomenal 30-40 hour game. Instead, it's about an 80 hour game where the last 50 of those are grinding away to level up enough heroes to play the last level and collect enough money and relics to buy upgrades.\n\nI checked out some past and current discussions, and the developers do look like good guys that are trying to make the best game that they can. I just don't agree with some of the high level design decisions. That's okay. They've produced a beautiful, smart game that unfortunately overstays its welcome with mechanics that turn it into a grindfest.","February 4","false","15.2"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","27","49","0","0"

But there is a catch, you will surely have lots of fun for the first 10 to 20 hours and after a while as you progress in the game your fun will diminish slowly and convert to frustration as you reach end game content. The game mechanics for the last dungeon (Darkest Dungeon) are what gamers has been complaining about. I have to admit that they are right, the game turns to be an absolute grinding cycle in the end.\n\nI have started new games several times just to fiddle with different team compositions, different trinkets and different sets of skills. After all this hours of deep playing into the game I can surely say; Yes there are balance issues, and surely the end game grinding kills the fun out of it but if you ignore the last dungeon (at least until the devs decide to rebalance or change it) you are definitely looking at a gem.\n\nPs: The narration (although it gets repetitive after a while) is simply astonishing. I have to admit that I may have watched the intro at least a dozen times and started at least half a dozen new games just to watch the beginning cinematic :)","February 9","true","170.3"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","27","49","7","0"

Visually and Aurally it's flawless. - the dark reds and blacks perfectly complementing the endlessly grim atmosphere. As someone that collects rougelikes, I can handle random turn of events and sudden death - yet in this game there is a constant elongation of that death. You are slowly losing. Slowly being eaten away like a bunch of flies digesting a almost dead warrior with no eyes on a empty battlefield. Even in dark souls, a game known for its punishment - there is some degree of immediacy. This is quite literally - torture.\n\nI admire that. I admire that some team of indie developers went out there, made a game so far departed from the norm. There is no game that quite feels like the darkest dungeon. And for that uniqueness, combined with the flawless presentation - This review is uniformly positive. However subjectively, I don't often want to actually play the damned thing. Because my time spent will involve slowly becoming as stressed as the protaganists as I am torn apart until there is nothing but an empty husk hobbling along a worn path of nothingness. While enemies point and laugh at my feeble attempts at carrying on. And in the end, that's what you do. Even if you win. You carry on. You don't come out powerful. Or even slightly enhanced. You survive another day of stress and hate.\n\nSounds a bit too much like my life.","October 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Currently at week 30-40. I will say the randomness is not as much an issue as much as a lack of agency and the fact that the game does not give the player enough info to learn how to get better. In addition many of the challenges are simply asanine. Playing with higher level characters becomes unmangeable because it costs more to do even essential things such as treating for stress. Most of the time I see challenges being shoe-horned in just to be challenging rather than being clever, thematically relevant, logical, fun, etc....\n\nOther examples:\n-How is hunger processed? I had to eat twice on one run in the first 5 rooms, while in other runs with same team I ate once after many more rooms. If I spend 8 food in camp and then 1-2 rooms later have to eat again, this seems very illogical. It just doesn't make sense at all.\n-Why does my character with 50+ dodge get hit several times in a row when my character with 5 dodge succeed 3/4 times?\n\nYou can get many hours of fun from this, but be warned that at a certain point it starts to feel like a time waster rather than a engaging challenge.","January 26","false","21.4"," 43 of 80 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","43","80","6","2"

All too often you see your carefully groomed, max-equiped level 5/6 chars killed in a single round of combat. From full health a hit/crit combo takes the character to death's door, leaving a nasty ticking damage on the character killing the character off as soon as his/her turn is up.\nOne has to understand that the death of such a character is an enormous setback because you have to grind a replacement through several lower level dungeon runs. The loss of gold and time is substantial. Basically, most of the time you grind through content you have already done ad nauseam in order to have another shot at a dungeon you actually want to play. And did I mention that the loss of a character early in a fight means that you have to quit the fight leaving all that hard-earned gear behind?\n\nThis isn't a game anymore.

I would summerize the game as a rogue like party based dungeon crawl with some city building aspects. This game introduces a stress system that acts as a second bar of life. As the bar raises party memeber resolve is tested and can lead to some nasty effects. When the bar mexes out the character dies from a heart attack. Characters gain stress from going to dungeons and relieve stress through services in the city. Services take take time and force you to leave them behind to recover. I started enjoying this mechanic as it forced me to diversify my party, level up multiple people, and continually experience different class combinations. The dungeons are difficult and various mob and boss fights can easily get our of hand. A lot of the game turn into managment of city service slots, money for services, money for upgrades, money for dungeon supplies (these are important), and character stress.\n\nI did really enjoy all the management aspects of the game until I finally was able to start leveling my pary members to level 3. Once a character reaches level 3 they can no longer run level the starter dungeons to help raise other party memebers. This ruined the game for me. The game is difficult and stress can kill characters of any level fairly easily if things get our of hand in an ambush. I did not ming struggling to unlock new tiers of content in the game but being forced to struggle in the lower level dungeons to attempt to level a new party memener to replace a higher level party memeber that died in the higher tier dungeon ruined all the fun I had in the game. Gaining levels in this game did not make a large difference in survival and allowing higher levels characters to shepherd lower level party members through dungeons for no XP gain would not be game breaking. It would not have been much easier but it would at least make the catchup process muchless stressful. The highest unlocked content would have been no easier by allowing this.

There is a warning screen which tells you that your party will die throughout the game.  The problem is that most of it is out of your control.  In combat there is no active role, you pick what your people do and they do it, which means any damage you take and whether or not you hit is completely up to the computer. Taking too much stress damage? Your character isn't high enough level.  Not dealing enough damage?  Your weapons aren't upgraded enough.  Trying to do some easy missions for money to upgrade your characters?  Too bad.  They leveled and will only do harder missions.

It's a turn-based, dark RPG with a lot of depth. One thing I absolutely love about this game is that despite being a complex RPG, it's relatively easy to get into and it doesn't bombard you with popups and tutorials. You do have 1 quick tutorialish area at the beginning which tells you the basics. When something is about to happen in the game that is a key mechanic, the game gives a window with a brief explanation of how it works. it doesn't give you a 5 paragraphic essay that you have to read through with tons of examples you don't need. It does a good job of explaining these things within a paragraph or two, and that's great because this game is HARD. However, it's also fair for the most part.\n\nWhat makes this game special compared to most turn-based RPGs is how placement works. Most games might have a few usable abilities like a cleave that will affect a few people in the front, an aoe that affects everyone and that's usually it. Darkest Dungeon takes a leap forward with mechanics such as switching, large enemy types and corpses. Certain characters work best at certain positions and while it would be nice to see enemy unit move tables, it feel it would make the game much easier but still add depth. Certain abilities used by your characters can only be used while that character is at a certain position (far left, left, right, far right) and those abilities can sometimes only be used on enemies in certain positions (far left, left, right, etc). The game does a great job of telling you where characters would prefer to fight. These are always shown in the character menus which you can view by clicking on portraits or hitting the 'C' key when a portrait is highlighted. The switching mechanic also plays into this. You can switch the placements of characters in and otuside of battle, but in battle costs a character turn. Attacks can also switch people around (both on your side and on the enemy team's side). This adds a new level of depth, you could plow your way from the front to the back but there could be a annoying stress-damage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the back who might be super week to a sword attack your knight might use because it's good again'st unhoy enemies.\n\nThat's another thing I should mention. There are a lot of modifiers in this game. From the debufs you get from playing (like getting stressed) to all your character abiltiies with various mods that can cause conditions like bleeding or blight. There are so many variables and team compositions to play around with adding so much customization for how you move out your party. God, we haven't even talked about the item system or the weapon/armor/spell upgrade system. THERE IS SO MUCH IN THIS GAME TO TALK ABOUT!\n\nAnimation, sound and art quality are outstanding. This game sucks you in to its dark and depressing world hard. Every completion of a dungeon feels stressful, as it should as stress is the main mechanic of the game. Stress can afflict debuffs to your party or even buffs at rare times. Your companions are not only battling monsters but also battling thier own psyche. You can relieve stress in the town but you have to still do dungeons if you want their stress to go down. They only lose stress when they are treated for a full in-game week, so it's a desperate struggle where you sometimes have to throw green-as-grass new characters at high level dungeons. Thankfully, new recruits are free and you can upgrade your roster. THAT'S ANOTHER THING, SO MUCH HNGGGGGG. You can upgrade buildings in town (treating more characters at a time in one area, better upgrades, etc) and you are still not even safe in towns. Stuff can happen when you are trying to relieve stress. Sending one of your guys off to gamble to relieve the pain of losing a comrad? Well he gambled away a rare item GG.\n\nOverall, this is a great value at 20USD. You are totally getting your moneys work. If games stress you out easily, stay clear because you will die of a heart attack faster than your characters will.\n\nIf you are the type of person that needs a score, I'd give the game a 9/10.

I was excited and nervous based on the reviews.  I'll summarize the important aspects of the reviews that I found positive or negative.\n\nPositive:\n1. The game is hard\n2. Your choices have permanent consequences (no redos)\n3. The game mechanics offer depth and a variety of play styles\n4. The atmosphere is awesome.\n\nNegatives:\n1. The game isn't so much hard as unfair (RNG) and tedious\n2. The changes that led to Corpses and Heart Attacks made it even more tedious without enhancing gameplay.\n\nObviously, bought the game in spite of my fears.  I don't like tedium, so I figured I might turn off the most offending bits (corpses and heart attacks) but I'd try it with them first.\n\nAlmost immediately, I lost a character to a Heart Attack and found the corpses annoying.  I recognized the heart attack was my fault and could be easily avoided, so I left it on, but turned off corpses.  Played for awhile, until I had level 3 heroes, went into a level 3 dungeon and got owned.  I realized at that point, however, that I had made a lot of mistakes, had learned a lot about the game, and generally (aside from that dungeon) had found combat kind of easy and tedious.  I was using the same skills over and over and didn't think I was playing the game very well (which was confirmed for me by that level 3 dungeon).\n\nI decided to start from scratch, w/ corpses on, and I like the game better as a result.  My heroes are happier and healthier, and I have more treasure.  A couple tips for enjoying the game:\n\n1. Corpses don't need to be destroyed.  If you have ranged weapons, sometimes you want to keep the enemy further away.  I would say it's about 50-50 on whether corpses make a battle easier or harder.  Sometimes they ♥♥♥♥ me off, but sometimes I'm glad they're there.  They certain helped push me toward utilizing more skills, which honestly helps you be better prepared for when your characters are knocked out of order (btw, prepare for that!)\n\n2. You either need to do one of the following\na) Read some guides.  Read up on the things you can interact with, what items you can use with them, etc.  Your heroes will be far less stressed and you'll get more loot.\nb) Figure it all out yourself.  You'll need to treat some excursions as scouting missions (which they are...), interact in all sorts of ways with different objects, record the results, and don't hesitate to dispense with the broken husks of heroes who return to you, rather than wasting money repairing them.  This way takes longer, but can be fun.  This is true really for any new situation in the game....boss fights, etc.  If you don't read the scouting reports (guides) of others, you'll need to do your own scouting,  Your scouts will pay for your ignorance.\n\nIs the game perfect?  Of course not.  Is the corpse mechanic kind of silly?  Sure.  With or without corpses, there are silly aspects to the combat.  The combat is stylized, so it's going to be weird at times, you just need to learn the rules.  My biggest complaint, actually, is that the system of skills and characters is actually too flexible.  It would be cool if there were missions that required certain characters (4 Crusaders, for instance).  Well, maybe there are or will be...I have a lot more game to play.  However, if you're like I was and sitting on the fence, worried about tedium, then I recommend buying the game and giving it a shot.","September 16, 2015","true","462.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"

There is simply too many times where the games major mechanics are shown to be shallow and unfinished, or enemy types bland and uninteresting. The stress system seems interesting at first but quickly devolves into a second health bar that you can't reliably heal back to acceptable levels, combined with every other enemy having massive stress damage attacks makes progression painful and unrewarding.\n\nAnother issue is player control. In one of Valves in game commentaries for Half-Life 2 they stated that the best thing a developer can do is to never take control away from the player, even if they aren't actually in control they should at least feel as if they have some say in what happens in a situation. Darkest Dungeon takes player control away so often that it's bordering on absurdity. Randomly given quirks randomly cause your character to make random arbitrary choices in combat and at town, making it seem like you have no say at all in what happens in your party. Even if you complete a hard dungeon with 0 stress across the board theres still a hefty chance of your characters gaining up to two character destroying traits that make them dead weight and functionally dead to you.\n\nThe next issue is the diversity and balance of each of the dungeons. There's a forest, a ruin, a cove, and a city for the main dungeons. Each of these supposedly has a diverse set of enemies and challenges to face, but if you examine them closely they are nearly carbon copies of one another. The ruins has skeletons that act the same as the coves fish people, the cultists have a spellcaster that has nearly the same spells as the coves fish spellcaster, the pigs have the same support abilities as the fungal growths in the forest.\n\nThe main cause of all this sameness stems from the games shallow combat system, there are only two DOT's, one stun type, forced movement attacks and then normal damage with crits. This is not a recipe for replayability at all. There are simply too few ways for the enemy to fight the player, leading to stagnation. The game tries to add another layer of complexity in its stress system, but it falls flat, with it being a near unmanagable mess of too much stress and too few ways to mitigate it within the dungeon itself. The few characters that can mend stress heal it for so little as to not be worth it, why waste turns stress healing when you could be killing the enemy to stop the stress from being placed to begin with? The stress system is also very bottom heavy, it mostly affects newer characters and seems to dissappear by level 2-3, mostly serving to kill off fresh characters by having a skeleton splash wine on them for 10 rounds.\n\nThe stat system is also very oddly designed. Dodge works like in most games, by serving as a way to completely mitigate damage in echange for reliability, but most characters will not high high enough dodge stats to take advantage of it, and will instead opt in for the much more realiable and plentiful PROT stat which functions as a flat damage reduction. Most enemies also seems to have either 100% accuracy attacks, or attacks that hit so hard that even taking the chance of focusing on dodge and having it fail makes prot all the more worth while. Why even have the chance of taking a 20 damage attack on a 22 Health character when you can always reduce that 20 damage to 10 or less?\n\nSadly Darkest Dungeon is a trainwreck of balance issues and poorly implemented game mechanics overlaid with amazing art and stellar sound and voice work. It simply isn't worth the $20 in its current state, and likely never will be.","February 1","false","25.5"," 48 of 90 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","48","90","0","4"

The artwork is talented and disturbing, the music fits the atmosphere (I love how daunting and 'uphill battle' the combat music sounds) and the game design is clever in its own unique ways.\n\nAs a game dev myself I especially enjoyed the clever game design to keep the player challenged. The game clearly has an agenda to break any sort of easy routine and strategy in managing your roster and money, and makes sure the player knows this through mechanics. For example, in the game you are forced to send a party out each week to advance time. However to prevent the player from endlessly farming easy quests with the same heroes, to prevent them from advancing a week with no effort, your heroes will eventually grow bored of the apprentice quests and refuse to take part, so you will have to spend resources to send out rookies which won't be able to easily roll those quests as much as your vets.\n\nWhile the game has a lot going for it for game design, there are still a few flaws. It feels like the game's difficulty agenda gets ahead of itself, and bad stuff can happen to you for seemingly no reason just to throw you for a loop. This would be fine if the game would outright state its trying to ♥♥♥♥ you, but instead it does it in ways that seem to resist its own rules. For example, for no reason at all, even without being Marked, the 4-creature party will continually focus one of your squishier heroes into the ground. You can try using a Man-At-Arms or Crusader to mark themselves, but when this is happening it usually doesn't help and they'll continue to slaughter the one character. You have all of these abilities but occasionally the game refuses to listen and will throw any advantages you have from those abilities out the window.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, a frustrating set back once in a while should not really overshadow the game's polish, well thought out game play and clear love the developers have for it. A game is not bad because you can't beat it.\n\nI haven't been too far along yet but I'll definitely play more, however I've seen some complaints about the end-game and it sounds incredibly unpleasant, so unless something REALLY clicks I only really see myself playing this until I succeed in my first assault.","January 25","true","21.9"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","32","59","8","1"

I was sold on the solid art style and the neat idea that mental stress is a serious factor from all the crazy-scary lovecraftian stuff your party is putting up with.  Unfortunately, how it plays out has major flaws that are just killing any existing fun for me.\n\nFirst off, the stress thing just becomes a random feeling annoyance most of the time.  It is like playing a turn based RPG where you are managing all the usual stuff, health, upgrades, gear, spells etc, BUT additonally someone is slapping your head often and usually for an unknown reason.  When it works and it is clear why stress is happening it can be interesting and part of the fun -- like when your party gets critted hard, they all do an underwear check and the narrator says "witnessing a killing blow bends the mind," or when someone freaks the hell out because they reach 100 stress and they start doing panicy actions.   But those are the far minoriy reasons.  Sometimes they will all of a sudden have a huge stress bubble, when nothing happened at all.  75% of the time it seems totally arbitrary and you won't even know why they are gaining stress.\n\nSecond, not being able to heal (health or stress) outside of combat is terrible, horrible game design.  It makes no sense whatsoever -- "hey healer help me out,  I'm bleeding and blighted and low on health." says the warrior.  "NOPE, sorry, but that last enemy just died so ... you know, my hands are tied.  Wait until someone attacks us before I can heal you, you know... just like in real life."  Aside from how stupid that is, it creates the annoying but clearly best strategy where you have to whittle the enemies down to one, and then keep that enemy alive by using non-damaging attacks until you heal up and/or reduce-stress on your whole party.  This is just boring and tedious.  Incredibly, the game then tries to punish you for you know, being smart and managing your health and stress well within the system the designers made by adding B.S. stress... because? -- "OH no, that skeleton with 2 health that we've been kicking around for the last 5 min is SO SCARY... jeez, I'm getting stressed and scared now!"  That is just more lazy, bad design trying to mask a fatal flaw in the design.\n\nLastly, you will be flooded with characters.  At first it is kind of fun and interesting to learn about the different classes and their abilities, even though it is a lot of information at once.  But even after you learn, you see that this flood will be constant.  It is really hard to find your main party members in this river of characters.  The pacing just feels very off and it makes you not care about anyone eventually.\n\nI will admit that I haven't gotten into the meat of the game, but those first two points are huge glaring issues that make it so that I can already see how tedious it will be to even keep playing at all.  Furthermore, after playing it I've been reading more about it and other reviews here confirm the grindfest that it is already feeling like.","October 11, 2015","false","40.0"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","4"

Still super fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrysoliteTechnician/recommended/262060/","ChrysoliteTechnician","Chrysolite Technician","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrysoliteTechnician/","264 products in account","Darkest Dungeon was a game that came to my attention almost as soon as it came into steam. The concept seemed interesting to me and I indulged in watching a few streams and YouTube videos of the game. Turned off by the early access label I decided to withhold my purchase and buy it some other time.\nRecently it came to my attention that the game had been "finished." I had seen numinous glowing reviews from critics I trust and I was convinced to make the purchase. To me the game looked like Xcom: the RPG with a dark graphic novel H.P. Lovecraft aesthetic.\nI am a fan of HP's stories and the narrative to me is clearly inspired by 'The statement of Randolph Carter' and of course the classic 'The call of Cthulhu.' I even encountered a rather on the nose reference to HP's work as my rambling arbalest asked my crusader "have you ever seen a colour out of space?" Referencing the HP Lovercraft story of the same name.\nI didn't even have any truck with the controversial ending (that I spoiled for myself, more on that later) it's as hopeless and grim as many a Lovecaftian tale.\nThe visual and sound design are excellent, The character sprites are very graphic novel-ly and well-drawn, the music is well composed and the disheartening ambiance that gets louder the darker the torch gets is a nice atmospheric touch.\nThese well done aspects of the game added to the exclusively positive media i had heard up to that point convinced me to buy the game. While this did not cross my mind when i first made my purchase I now remember a certain youtuber saying something along the lines of 'those people who played for 300 hours and hate it.'\nThis should have sent off warning signs in my head but sadly I did not research enough. I made my purchase and began playing. I did well (I think) initially and had a good time. I only lost 3 party members in 15 hours and I managed to beat 4 bosses and both the encounter bosses. I'm not exactly sure if I did anything wrong or if I was just unlucky but I started lousing, lots. Most of the time I would lose one or two level 3 party members and flee, But then I had my first party wipe, I lost one level 4, three level 5 heroes and some incredibly rare trinkets (including the drop I received of my hard won shambler fight).\nUp to this point I had played the game akin to the way I play Xcom. I had named each hero after someone I know in real life and had upgraded all my heroes as much as possible in an attempt for them to stop dying. This caused my string of losses to be quite costly both emotionally and financially, I understand that I may have been playing it wrong but the way the game punishes you for losing high level heroes breaks the fun of the game for me.\nFalling back on my Xcom instincts I started a new save file and started playing that. At this point my friend linked a video showing why he wouldn’t be purchasing the game after I had stated I had a good time with the first 10 to 15 hours and I realised why I would not be revisiting this game until it is significantly patched.\nThe game is SUPER grind focused. Not only that but the core gameplay loop is repetitive. The same missions: scout(search almost all rooms), exterminate(finish all room battles), and an item mission where you must find 3 'curios' and interact with them with 3 provided items repeat over and over.\nFor some reason Red Hook have padded out the game with completely unnecessary repetition and a slow progression system that will set you back HOURS of grinding a replacement hero if you are unlucky and lose even one or 2 party members.\nBoss fights are repeated 2 more times at harder difficulties for seemingly no reason and the final straw was seeing what was in store for me in the final missions of the game.\nOne your party beats an incredibly hard level in the Darkest Dungeon they will all refuse to ever go there again forcing you to grind even more on easier levels to produce max level and well equipped heroes in order to stand a chance.\nThis revelation I had has killed any desire for me to play the game. I am familiar with challenging games, even ones with RNG tied to them, I beat Xcom on ironman classic.\nBut Darkest Dungeon is not 'challenging'. It's not really. You can’t even lose. It just takes up your time to make it feel like its challenging. If the game was shorter, had more variation in the core gameplay loop and removed unnecessary features like the 'Never Again' mechanic then I may of recommended this game.\nBut in its current unfairly grindy state I do not recommend. Hopefully with the alleged addition of the steam workshop soon someone may just fix the game instead of the devs.","February 4","false","22.3"," 67 of 127 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","67","127","2","4"

What a time waste.\nI finished the game using a save game backup background program. Cause otherwise it's just too reta.rded.\nCount 40 to 100 hour to finish the game. 10 hours of fun and the rest is a painfull chore. I've got so bored so i speedran the NG+ with some uber trinkets.\n\nI dont have any game presentation. Go read some positive reviews that somebody wrote while having less thant 10 hours of gameplay (sarcasm).\n\nSo there is my review:\n\nGrinding grinding grinding gold and heirlooms ... boring boring boring.\n\nAt the start you'll be amazed how this game is great but later you'll hate everything about it.\n\nGet 4 new chars, send them for quest without supplies (as long as at least one of them survives to bring back the GOLD GOLD GOLD ) then get rid of them. Repeat 100 times. or just hack the gold.\n\nIf it's not grinding then RNG plus retar.ded logic of devs will get you:\n\nWhen you see the achievements you may already see that there is something wrong with the game. A lot of achievememts are based on you to misirably fail. "Lose you heroes this way, lose your heroes that way". Have you lost your mind! I've spend 10 hours grinding gold to build them...wtf.\nSome of these achievements require some RNG conditions that you may never meet even intentionaly.\n\nAfter restoring or healing, heroes may get a TOWN penalty that won't go away until you complete a run with them. And there is no other way to remove this debuff.\nOhh...dungens are tough, here, get some -10 to accurancy,  be useless in battles.\n\nAt levels 5+ enemies may kill one of yours chars without you been able to react. Enemies may land heavy crits and one shot any of your heroes then any additional hit or blight / bleed will terminate him.\n\nShambles...shambles everywhere. There are some rare curios that may be used to summon these minibosses. BUT you won't need em cause every fuc.king second dungeon will spawn one as a random encounter and ruin your run.\n\nCriticals, these damn criticals. It's all good... your heroes will do some then they may take some in their faces. The problem is  a retar.ded additional stress that all yours heros will get. One hero takes some misirable (0-1) damage rolled as crit and becomes 2 (yes TWO) damage and every one gets 1 million of stress.\n\nFood consumption is totaly random and you never know when it will happen. When your team need to eat, you have only two choises: feed them or starve them (health and morality penalities). Another major problem is that they may never eat or eat 5 times in a row leaving you with no supplies and pushing your run to a fail.\n\nOne dungeon run take supposedly several days. Therefore you need provisions, food and torches. Your team consumes torches while walking through a dungeon. Battles  takes no time comparing to the whole exploration because torches dont burnt out. During a battle you heroes may heal and buff themselfs but they can't dot it outside the battle. Moreover, in a battle the game forbids you from keeping stunning or ignoring an enemy while healing and stress releaving. The game will react by sending in reinformcements and blasting you heroes with stress damage.\n\nGame has no game over. So if you lose yours high level heroes all you need it's just 15 more hours to train new ones. Why not add a save game you dumb sh.it devs ? I have better things to do or games to play.\n\nConclusion: The game suffers from some major grindfests witch are exponential and also of tons of BS RNG.\nPlay it at your own risk of wasting your time for nothing.

This game has so much potential.  Stunning mood, artwork, and gameplay concepts.  But it is HARD.  I don't mind difficulty, I think only difficulty can bring a truly rewarding play experience.  But this is randomly unfair, keyboard-throwingly hard.  You can work for hours to build up a killer party grinding easy missions and buying tons of gear, only to get to a very small, easy fight where one mob crits your whole party and they all go insane and die.  You lose everything you worked for in an instant because of a fluke of bad luck.  You can put a hero out of comission for a week to cure one mental illness, only to pick up 5 more illnesses every single week on every character that participates.  You upgrade your town to make it better, but what's the point?  Nothing seems to make it any easier or less grindy.\n\nOr, there are a couple interface hiccups, like what just happened to me: Find an object which you can use a shovel on, and the interface LOOKS like you're going to use the shovel, but no, it's slightly greyed out and you messed up.  Your party digs through the thing barehanded, and (yes) goes insane and dies.\n\nI want to like this game, I kickstarted it many months ago and I've really been looking forward to it.  But the sheer sense of constantly losing an impossible battle is really too much for me.  I want to have at least some kind of fun playing videogames.  This is just this overwhelming downhill slide of frustration and failure.  I feel like I'm one of the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s inside the game, trapped and doomed.  I'm really sad that I'm not enjoying it at all.","February 7, 2015","false","4.0"," 55 of 104 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","55","104","8","1"

Everything from the visuals to the sound design to the gameplay is stunningly wonderful, and accomplishes its goals with ease. This is certainly one of the few early access games that more than earns its somewhat inflated price, and which you should play if you enjoy hard core RPGs.\n\nI see a lot of people posting negative reviews for this game who have less than 10 hours on record, complaining that they've just lost their best heroes or that a boss totally destroyed them, and so the game isn't recommended. I find it bemusingly appropriate that the game, which sets out to create an oppressive and worrisome atmosphere even for the player themself, appears to be doing its job well; the Dungeon is defeating many with its steep difficulty curve. The game warns you up front that heroes will die, and that bad things will happen no matter what. If you play this game, indeed prepare for the worst, but don't throw in the towel the first time it happens!\n\nDon't listen to them, and become Hopeless!

I have to disagree.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere and wonderful graphics and sounds that perfectly fit the mood, however, the core elements of class skills, combat, and leveling are lacking.\n\nClass skills are simple and generic leading to few relatively simple strategies for each class, which makes combat mostly about RNG, not player choices.  Since skills are cast from certain positions and hit pre-determined enemy positions, another element of player control is lost.  Accordingly, you could probably write a fairly simplistic algorithm to replace the decision making involved in fighting and not lose anything in the process.\n\nConsidering that you have do a very considerable amount of grinding to create a party capable of higher level zones, and considering that those higher level party members can no longer help in lower level zones, what you end up with is excessive repetition of tedious content where success is mostly up to the RNG gods.\n\nNo amount of chanting 'hardcore' or 'permadeath' or 'roguelike' will do anything to help with flaws like this.  To me, a good rpg requires that in game challenges be responsive to player decisions more than they are to random rolls.  In old 'roguelike' games such as Nethack, player knowledge contributed to victory at least as much as RNG factors.  A good player was one who knew the options and the capabilities of the creatures they encountered.  They were not simply lucky. RNG was a factor to overcome by foresight, preparation, and knowledge.\n\nI hope that as the game develops, this issue can be addressed.  I would happily grind away if I felt like my choices in battle made much of a difference, but, as it stands, I'd be better off placing bets with myself and rolling a d20.","April 6, 2015","false","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Buy immediately.\n\nOld review:\n\nWanted this game for a long time and couldn't bring myself to pay the $20 for it due to it's reviews as "Dark Souls"-esque in its difficulty.  I hate the Souls series of games, ever since Demon's Souls back in the day.  They started as a bad 3d action game with horrible controls and terrible balance, and then grew into a bad 3d action game with horrible controls and terrible balance _"on purpose"_ because "anyone who doesn't enjoy dying 1000 times to complete the first level is a casual and blah blah blah."\n\nI want to like this game, and probably would if it were made more clear what the order of operations is of a typical round from start to finish. As it is, you get a loose tutorial that gives you the gist of a few aspects of the screen as they come up.  In a world where we have stupid tutorial screens for simple things, and then this type of instruction on what seems to be a pretty complex game, it would be nice to strike a balance between hand-holding and whatever you would call this.  The best way I can describe this game is that it is a low-class citizen simulator.  You send your characters off dungeoneering, and the system is stacked against you.  Sometimes because many disparate interacting systems will cause inherent imbalances, and other times because the people in charge of those systems hate you and want you to die.  Every day you have to get up and go to work, but this work you have to pay for.  And if you don't work then you'll lose the job, visitation rights to your kids, and the box you live in. You make $5 a day, but the cost of living is $3.50. Every time an enemy hits you he does $2 in damage, and your job is "guy who stands in front of enemies." Try not to go into debt with that formula.\n\nThe interface could use some polish. Why do I have to click and drag heroes all the time? And even still, why do I have to drag them EXACTLY to the box, and not just the region that I'm very clearly working with? This is like having to click on the checkbox instead of the long ♥♥♥ sentence attached to the checkbox. Sort that out.\n\nThe game idea is cool, but it needs some balance tuning at lower levels so you're not piling corpses against a wall because somebody forgot to install a gate.\n\nFTL is not fair, and can be daunting to new players, but that is lauded as a classic game. Darkest Dungeon is talked about mostly for its art style.\n\nIf this game didn't look like Mike Mignola came on the computer screen far less people would give it a shot.","December 1, 2015","true","135.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

On the road, though, they quickly proved capable - dispatching a small company of bandits who camped on the only road to my isolated inheritance.  Our arrival was met with little fanfare - I heard the tavern keeper remind Dismas that he was not allowed at the gambling tables.  Reynauld refused to leave the transept of the church while in town.  While drinking at the tavern Dismas made friends with an old man at arms named Machel, a man who spends as much time in the brothels as Reynauld does in the transept.  I asked Reynauld if he and his misfortunate band of three might be ready to start excavating and clearing out some of the old ruins beneath the manor, to which he responded that they would if they had a fourth, someone to help keep them in good health.  I told him I knew of just the soul and sent for my old wrestling partner Bretel the vestal.  An old injury that had ended her career in the ring had left her with a weak grip and a torn rotator cuff, but she could still raise the spirits of any soul, bless her heart.\n\nWith a full company, the small band set out to explore a small section of the ruin.  To this day Reynauld and Dismas refuse to give account of how their first encounter with the occult and undead went.  All three of them had to spend weeks in isolation, drink, and prayer before they would speak.  Bretel will not be in the same room as either of them, calling them selfish and masochists.  None of them will tell me what happened to Machel.\n\n(x . x)\n\nThis is a great game, especially for being in Alpha.  It might be a little on the expensive side, but it's a very well balanced and playable game at this point.  It's challenging, especially at the very beginning or when starting with fresh characters.  As they level up and you unlock higher levels for your characters abilities and gear, and as you get a better sense of what classes go well together, the difficulty eases off a bit.  A lot of the mechanics which seem to be unfair and do nothing but punish you in the beginning do so much less as you learn how to mitigate them (basically, stick in there if you're having trouble, it gets better!).\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who likes dungeon crawls, rogue-like games, and/or D&D players.","June 4, 2015","true","44.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its roster and party based gameplay, with the macro game of upgrading the town to improve your squads, is akin to XCOM, and you may find yourself getting attached to specific characters!  Its turn-based combat is deep, with many customization choices of skills and character positioning.  The game's difficulty level can be intimidating at first, but the fact that it's easy to continue with new party members means you will learn for your mistakes and your hard-fought victories will be all the sweeter.  Overall, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a strategic turn-based game, especially at its current 14.99 sale price.","June 13, 2015","true","63.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Generally the whole game is about you not having real\nimpact on the outcome. Often the game even completely restricts you from doing actions, which is very frustrating\nin a round-based game. (You often wait a long time to have your turn to attack, only for the character to refuse action, wasting your turn and time)\nThe high chance to dodge of enemies (which is getting greater the further to progress, 30% dodgechances etc)\nis very infuriating, and made further frustrating by your characters having high base chance to miss, always wasting your turns for that you waited quite some time and feels terrible frustrating. The order your characters can attack are also internally rolled based on speed, so you have no impact again on the selection of which character you want to use at the moment, making a miss even worse.\n\nThe game is full of waiting and you having little impact to the outcome of things.\n\nThe outgame progression / leveling is completely redundant, you get boring linear upgrades (+2 damage, +2 armor and dodge) while enemies get stronger in the same fashion, making only damage numbers grow but unaffect gameplay.\nLeveling splits your party and artificially locks out parts of your party from various dungeons for again no reason, the whole leveling system is tacked on and adds very little to the game as it stands.\n\nAfter 1-2 hours of playsessions I always had to take a break as it was too frustrating always waiting on things only to have their actions denied by refusals and dodges which just feels like wasting your time, also there is hardly enough content as of yet. The visuals are amazing and there are some unique things, but most of the games uniqueness comes from mechanics that make the game purely frustrating without adding other values or real difficulty.","August 22, 2015","false","11.3"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","0"

The narration and sound effects are simply awesome, and the narrator encourages you with quotes of wisdom with his deep resonating and enchanting voice as you go along. This is one of the most enjoyable and best aspect of the game, which really distinguishes it and compensates for the negative aspects. If the negative aspects are sorted, the devs are looking at a block buster.\n\nWhat I didn't like is there is no difficulty setting, just an radio button option to switch corpses and heart attacks off. This makes the game a lot easier and you don't seem to be penalised for switching these off, nor is there a reward for enabling them, so there is no incentive to switch em back on.\n\nCombat is one of the main aspects of the game but a lot of luck is involved, and this will get you cursing and shouting at times. A lot of people have already reviewed this aspect so, briefly, the computer has been made to cheat to increase difficulty. But I would rather fight a tougher enemy i.e with more HP, rather than a weaker enemy who cheats. So enough from me on luck. But the silliest aspect of the game IMHO is time wasted during combat. In between in each character turn there is upto a 10 second of animations starting with a loud drum beat, then the character gets blessed, stressed, buffed or debuffed, bleeds, blighted or resists and then he/she says something which you expect given the stress/quirk e.g. "I... this...can't". Given 8 characters must play each round that is 80 seconds per round, then 70 sec, then 60 sec as you kill the enemy etc. Given you could play 20-30 rounds per combat (especially if you take your time to kill the last rogue to heal your characters) that's typically 15 - 20 minutes of time wasted per battle. Given you play a battle almost every other room you are looking at typically an hour upto 2-3 hours of pure-time-waste per mission, just to watch some animations. I haven't even counted the time while the characters are actually attacking/defending let alone the time travelling in between rooms. There is no option to speed up combat and cut the faff. Playing one mission enables you to heal your resting heroes, and to collect about 10-15k gold, 20-40 heirlooms. Hence, it is a sad time waster. I think twice before launching the game because I know I will be immersed for the best of 3-4 hours just to complete 2-3 repetitive missions, of which half the time I'm just watching animations. Do I really want to spend a few hours just watching my computer play out a battle while I interact a little? I recommend you to wait till this is fixed, because waiting for a better build could save you many many pointless hours.

That 22 initial hours of the game came from the initial early access release and damn was it a fun, mildly rng based experience.\n\nWith full release I came back with the idea to play and have fun with my hard rogue-like. Well boy was I wrong in assuming I'd have anything resembling "fun."\n\nThe big issue is that if your game is going to be nothing but dice rolls and hoping for a good start based on the rng then you need a lot of opportunities for good rng. Which there really isn't, it's you getting crit, getting stressed (both in game and out) and then when rng finally goes your way and you get that lucky crit, or that solid fight it isn't satisfying or gratifying, it feels owed. Like "finally the game is balancing out a little." And when your players can't feel good about having a good thing happen it's a problem.\n\nIf you're like me it just comes down to the idea that if the game doesn't make me feel good, if it gives me a completely uneven ratio of stress:fun, and if the game isn't rewarding or gratifying to play then it just isn't worth playing.\n\nIt's the worst type of game that you want to like but in the end is just so frustrating and annoying to try and deal with you just can't. If I could refund this title I would, I'm sorry Red Hook, you had a great idea, but you executed your gameplay and theology of it like blizzard executes hearthstone, the difference being in hearthstone the rng will always balance out, in darkest dungeon it just piles on and piles on until someday you get the luck streak you need jsut to be able to play the f***ing game.\n\nWho knows maybe someday I'll try it again and that luck streak will allow me to get past level 3 heroes.","February 3","false","41.0"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","23","42","5","0"

Even with the right tactics, some well-geared characters and a lot of experience, some encounters might still get your favorite adventurers killed. You should be aware of this, and if you hate having some very unhappy rolls on attacks, then this might be very frustrating.\n\nNow... I at first wasn't very interest in DD, but a review and stream by TB made me change my mind and try it. And I was captivated quickly. The game is a LOT of fun.\nThe graphics and animations are very simple, but also, very stylish, so they have character and are nice to look at.\nThe atmosphere is great. There is a certain Lovecraftian vibe to things (not only because madness can become a real problem for your adventurers), and the narrator does SUCH a great job (BTW, check out his readings of HPL-stories, such a cool experience).\n\nEven with a lot of training, these dungeons will be risky for your guys. Bad RNG on heals (instead of, say, 8 points, you get 0 or 1 points, which means you kinda lost a turn) or damage (sometimes, you are THAT close to killing a mob, but then, 2-3 of your guys actually MISS, and you actually end up losing), debuffs like selfishness (your character might snag loot for himself), or paranoia (he or she might actually REFUSE to be healed) etc.\n\nI did like the darkness-mechanic. There are advantages and disadvantages to letting the light go dim or using torches to get to 100 light. With this mechanic, you kinda pick how you wanna approach the dungeon, a little bit like controlling the difficulty level yourself (not that it is a cakewalk if you spam torches, mind you!), and the increased rewards you get for fights at low light levels come with increased risks too.\n\nSo, you may ask, why do people play this? Are we all out for punishment? No! The game is just very addictive in that "Come on, just one more quick dungeon before I head to bed... whoops, it's 3 AM?!?!" way.\nIt is challenging, it will often feel unfair, but boy, winning battles and completing dungeons feels so very satisfying. You start to care about your chars (and there is an achievement about beating the final boss with the chars you get at the beginning of the game), especially if you name them yourself.\n\nA guide might help you get started, as money will be an issue (supplies are expensive, so you wanna pick carefully what to take along), but even if you just dive in and go trial and error, you will learn what to do.\nTalking about that, here is one complaint I have: The supplies and treatments IMO are TOO expensive. Even when you clear out tons of tough dungeons, you might have low funds due to the prize of upgrades to your buildings, treatments and supplies like bandages and torches. Sure, those supplies shouldnt be so cheap or plentiful that you can spam them at all times, but then, simply limit the amount you can get more. I didn't mind all the bad luck with the RNG and losing fights I thought I'd rather easily win, but I found those prizes frustrating, and IMO, they should be lowered at least a tiny bit.\nOther than that: It's a great, tactical game, some fights will have you bite your nails, sometimes you will feel disappointed, especially when losing a character you leveled up. The game will eventually become kinda grindy, but at that point, you could just play it casually, like doing half an hour or so and then returning later.\n\nPros:\n- Atmospheric\n- Simple, but unique graphics and animations\n- Great narrator voice\n- Challenging\n- You get to choose your ability-loadout\n- Very satisfying when you beat a boss or dungeon...\n\nCONS\n...and very frustrating when they beat YOU\n- Expensive supplies\n- Expensive treatment to get rid of debuffs and stuff\n- Can get grindy\n- Not recommended if you hate losing RNG rolls even when your characters are leveled and equipped with good gear\n- Can feel a bit repetitive\n\nGreat game... watch some playthroughs and maybe a guide, and then decide for yourself. I thoroughly enjoy the game!","March 21","true","11.6"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","23","42","9","0"

It is difficult and unique enough to want to continue. It feels very close to the difficulty of 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. However, there are a few key aspects that make this game actually impossible.\n\n1) Most enemies have attacks that target the entire party. No one in your party has any attack that can hit more than two people except the highwayman. He can hit three. Also, some of the party wipers that are multi unit hits have afflictions (I.E. Blight, and bleeding.) The highwayman hits people, that is all. You have single unit to two unit afflictions at best.\n2) The Bosses are unreasonably difficult. The level one boss in the ruins, against the Mad Priest hiding behind pews is too difficult for a party that was level 4, with level 2 equiptment and rank 2 abilities. He is a level one rated boss.\n3) The loss of sanity is like taking a bottle of water, taking off the cap, and draining the bottle to 7/8 emptiness and then complaining that you're thirsty and it isnt enough. If anyone in your party is sane after a dungeon, you should probably go to a casino immediately to capitalize on the new found super luck you have acquired.\n\nAside from horrible balance issues, literally impossible boss fights, and god awful suicidal standards of heroes...\n\nIt isn't a bad game. It is in early access, and there is room for improvement. That does not mean i do not love this game. Totally worth it if you hate yourself or enjoy watching guinea pigs (cough, i mean adventurers) wander aimlessly into suicide and failure, or want to have PTSD like flashbacks of Dark Souls moments.\n\n8/10 so far.","June 22, 2015","true","37.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has a strong story told through a third-party narrator, the classes are unique with multiple playstyles. The group you assemble to disembark will be based on who you've got left - the remainder of the insane and too experienced. I've spent most of my weekend on this game, even though it is presently Early Access, and I will continue to spend time on this game as it develops.\n\nYou will want to get this, sooner or later. But if you get it now, know that only Three of the Five dungeons are available, with about "three" difficulty levels per dungeon. I'm finding it takes at least seven hours per difficulty level if I'm not trying to bum-rush through objectives, leading to this present "100 % completed" early access to about 30-40 hours.\n\nBe warned: Your mistakes will collapse upon your party. There is no "Reload". There are critical hits, which will happen often. Party members will die. But the key is making the best out of a difficult situation.

It is about setting you up for a frustrating exercise in futility and leaving you with absolutely no hope. The items that bestow stat boosts also carry penalties. The money and resources spent developing your hamlet will leave you without resources to purchase items for quests. You will experience random deaths and afflictions of characters, which you will be unable to cure because you lack money needed from finishing dungeons. In other words, this game has been overweighted to such an extent that it is designed to cause you to fail at every turn. And not matter how careful you are, you will lose.\n\nThe worst part is that you will be unable to level any characters up high enough to advance in the game, because they will likely gain so much stress and affliction they will die of a heart attack before reaching level 2.\n\nI appreciate the lovecraftian elements of this game. However, the developers have weighted the game to such an extent against the player, that it isn't even enjoyable to play.\n\nThat said, if you simply want to play to see how long you can go before all your characters die, then this game will provide at the least a lot of entertainment value because of the narrator commentary and creepy graphics. To be fair, I think the developers have a decent basis for what could be a very versatile game to the broader gaming community. But at this point, it is purely designed for graphic visual value, because it isn't even challenging - it's hopeless.\n\nIf anyone in the company or development actually reads this review, I would urge you to consider programming some variability into the in terms of challenge levels. It would probably have a broader appeal to the larger gaming community. As it stands now, I think it is likely a very small niche group of folks that would actually enjoy the gameplay.\n\nExamples of in-game issues: Want to heal outside of combat? Nope. Healer skils are only available during combat. And food only heals one lifepoint at a time outside of combat - while penalties like bleeding and plague continue to linger outside of combat. You can cure them with items, but if you don't have the money, you don't have the items. You can only camp to restore life in certain dungeons, so if it's a single-shot playthrough dungeon with no camping option, you have no heal ability outside of combat. Treasure drops in the dungeons are so random and rare as to be not worth it. And healing abilities in combat are somewhat random in the amount they restore. The game is designed to kill your heroes. Period.\n\nYou can leave a dungeon at any time. But if you do, it may disappear, which means you lose out on the item rewards for completion. Further, you don't get to keep provisions purchased but not used for the next dungeon. And the costs to remove and heal heros who are likely crapping themselves when they return to the hamlet means you have little resources for provisions in the next dungeon.\n\nI like the concepts in the game. And I appreciate the developers really aren't going for a game that's playable to win - it's more about sacrifice and how far you will push to complete. The problem is, if you do push then your heroes will likely die and you won't finish the dungeon anyway - and you can't advance in the game if your characters don't have higher levels, which require money and resources gained from dungeons, which cycles back to the basic problem.\n\nPsychologically, there's very little positive reinforcement in this game, and a whole lot of discouragement and negative reinforcement such that if you are attached to your characters or advancing in the game, you are in for an excercise in frustration. This type of psychological situation doesn't affect everyone negatively, so if that isn't a consideration for you, you may very well enjoy this game.\n\nI don't recommend this game to the broader gaming community. However, if you are the kind of gamer that appreciates the dark, twisted, and impossible to win kind of game that leaves you breathless and frustrated (and I know there are gamers out there like this), then you are in for a treat. This game won't disappoint.\n\nImprovements that could help this game are healing abilities being active outside of combat, or having food restore far more health. But then, I suppose that would mean your heroes might not die as quickly, which would defeat the whole purpose of the game probably. At the least, it would be good to have variable levels of challenge settings in the game in order to help players at all levels truly enjoy and appreciate the dark storyline and potentially awesome gameplay. Right now, however, it just isn't there outside of a niche group.\n\nOn another note - I spent hours investing time carefully cultivating characters to be able to take on the first boss (the hag). The turn system in this game is so random, that the hag ended up having multiple turns before I even got a shot off, and she wiped out my whole party with her pot (which she puts your heros into to cook them). The whole battle was a joke. To say that I think the game developers have a tremendous amount of work to do on this game is an understatement. The part that upsets me the most is that I cannot get my money back. But certainly, it is the last time I will ever buy a game from this company.","January 3","false","24.9"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","25","46","4","0"

However, the game artificially lengthens its playtime by throwing too many punishing mechanics against you, with too many random elements.\n\nAs one example of a problematic random element, nailing a critical hit is massively damaging, and while it can feel satisfying for your group to instant kill a target from a lucky dice roll (along with cool narrative from the narrator), the enemy can do the same to your characters (especially with chained criticals), which strips you of any tactical defensive options you'd want to employ. For this reason, it's not really a question of "if" a character will die, but "when" the character will die. You can't get too attached to your characters like you do in X-Com in Ironman mode, for example, thinking there's a chance they might survive. You actually have to grind parties to their death over and over and over and over again until you amass enough gold to upgrade your town to the point that you can then begin creating an endgame group (or try to) after another long grind of amassing wealth with suicide runs.\n","May 21","false","42.0"," 44 of 83 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","44","83","8","0"

You are not gonna be able to exit victorious in all your dungeon attemps. Sometimes you will have to flee after the first battle. But if you manage your heroes well you will eventually find that the game is getting easier. There's updates every other week or so. And the devs are really listening to the community.

Such as no stress, more gold, etc. Just an idea but one that could make this game really fun for quite a few people.

The atmosphere is good, the artwork and voicework is phenomenal, the mechanics are interesting and fresh as well.\n\nI'm going to cut the ♥♥♥♥ now though, the balance designer or game designer or whoever the ♥♥♥♥ actively makes this game worse every patch.

It hooks you in with the progression of the town and your heroes and I genuinely felt excitement and nervousness at attempting a quest because you never know whats going to happen!\n\nNow on the more neutral side of things, but ultimately the downfall of the game, is the difficulty, which is ridiculously hard... and believe me when I say I enjoy really hard games.\nIt took me about 2 dead heroes and 4 failed attempts at runs before I even finished my first run at the first basic quest. While I personally didn't mind this, I don't think this is a good way to bring new players into the game and it is going to turn a lot of people away very quickly.\n\nDespite the tough learning curve I began to piece together how things worked, I began developing my town and upgrading and recruiting a variety of heroes to put strategic compositions together to take town tough quests.\n\nIt felt good.\n\nI was absolutely loving it... then, I attempted the Wisened Hag quest for the first time... with obviously no idea of what she did or what I needed to prepare for. Fortunately, everything was going swimmingly. I breezed my way through the dungeon and headed into the boss room on full health with practically no stress... Perfect!\n\nAt which point, the boss randomly captured and reordered my units, with basically no way to stop it because they were all permanently moved into the one position they could not attack. If I tried to move one into the position it needed to be in, she just moved it back. So I completely helplessly lost my 4 best heroes at once, with no way to retreat or counter what was happening...\n\nFrustrating... to say the least.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand you're going to lose heroes, it's part of the game. And, as bad as it was, that wasn't the real issue.\nThe zero option and severity of that fight just felt hollow. I could have done nothing about what happened because I had no idea what I was in for, I just clicked that button to enter the room and lost everything.\nBut the really aggravating and ultimately insurmountable problem was that I now had nothing. No money, and therefore zero way to buy provisions for another quest; or de-stress heroes; or upgrade heroes; or in fact actually attempt to get back into the game at all.\n\nThat was it: 9-10 hours of gameplay down the toilet.\n\nSo lesson learnt, I suppose? All I need to do now is make sure I keep a buffer of gold in case things go bad right?\nSure, but  do I want to start over and build my town up from scratch?\n\nNope, do I heck. I'm done.\n\nI had a great time with it, but it just ended all my motivation to keep playing right there and then and I can't bring myself to spend the time starting over, only to hit the next boss I haven't seen before and I get set back another 10 hours.\nI'm confused why they thought this was sensible game design and what outcome something like this would have with anyone other than just feeling like you've been duped into wasting your time.\n\nSo just like the heroes in the game, my resolve was tested:\nDid I become Focused? Stalwart? Courageous?\n\nNo.\n\nAt best, they might hope that someone becomes Masochistic and starts over. But, frankly, it just left me feeling Hopeless.\n","October 13, 2015","false","11.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I cannot recommend it unfortunately. Echoing many of the other reviews that have been written recently, DD has a myriad of wonderful features, including excellent voice acting and mechanical rpg enhancements, the concept of stress, the artwork, and the music all serve to make Darkest Dungeon a joy to play to a point. That point is reached fairly quickly in the game due to the compounding effects of stress and the costs to combat stress and improve your crew. None of the provisions like torches and food you purchase for a given expedition that you don't use are lost upon return. Oversupply yourself and you lose a significant amount of coin. Underprovision yourself and you risk failing the expedition and really getting behind on your coffers. With the high costs of stress reduction and improvement opportunities, and expedition costs, I am starting to see a challenge in making any progress to the higher levels in this game. Recruiting newer characters that are too weak to explore your only choice of dungeons and being unable to use your higher level characters much due to the effects of stress or the many negative quirks they aquire that cost too much to remove means you end up playing only the very beginning portions of a given dungeon and make barely any progress.\n\nBottom line, a really great game ruined by too high of a challenge level.

I need to gush.\nLook, I'm not a big fan of RPGs. I have no patience to play through a Final Fantasy or Mass Effect game.\nAnd yet this has easily landed in my top 3 favorite games I've ever played.\n\nLet's start with my pet peeve in RPGs (or any game for that matter): lengthy story. This factor is non-existent in Darkest Dungeon.\nThe intro to the game and opening to a new playthrough both have cutscenes that last roughly 4 minutes altogether. I can easily live with that. From here, a lore is sprinkled throughout the game by a wonderfully gritty narrator that speaks during gameplay. That being said, more is revealed about the enviroment just by the interaction in the game. Interacting with objects and seeing enemies allows the player to imagine what happened (or is happening) to the dungeons they're fighting in. I adore this. There's no lengthy dialogues or other cutscenes to keep you from playing the game, let alone have a story. Granted, it's not a masterpiece novel; however, with all due respect, I gladly take this over an Assassin's Creed game where there's almost as much cuscene as gameplay (yes, I have played an Assassin's Creed game, and this is merely an opinion).\nLet's get to another great factor of this game: it's sure challenging. Overall, it's a challenge. It's not I Wanna Be the Boshy difficult, but it's harder than your average game.\nI say "Overall," because the difficulty changes throughout your playthrough. First-time players to this game will find it BRUTAL (I did). Enemies could do as much damage as you (if not more), dungeons are filled with events and hazards that greatly influence for units for that current dungeon and possibly even for the rest of their lives. What do I mean by "rest of their lives?" Well, your units will die, and death is permanent in this game. Your level 3 Highwayman is gone; go pick up a level 0 at the stagecoach. Throw in some financial issues, and you got yourself into quite a pickle buying this game.\n\nAnd yet you will learn.\n\nYou will learn what the best combination of units are. You will learn what hazards are in each dungeon and how to resist them. You will learn that not all the equipment in the game is bad and ultimately use it. You will learn how to manage your units' stress (I'll explain later) inside and outside of battle. Eventually, you will find yourself with a roster of decently-leveled units and some gold to spare on some supplies and neat-o upgrades.\n\nAnd yet you will learn (about bosses).\n\nRegardless of your units' levels and skills, all the bosses in this game will leave you either dead or scrambling. No, it's not just a big enemy with 100,000 health that deals 100,000 damage. Every boss has a unique mechanic, and you will need to learn them quickly if you want to survive your first attempt.\nFor example:\nAt the beginning of every round, the Prophet will predict that a "catasptrophe" will happen in certain spots in your party. What this means is by the end of the round, units in those spots will take massive damage. This makes the player make a decision: who to put in these spots and take the hit? This is a problem, because moved units cannot attack the Prophet. It's a matter of survival or desperate attacking.\n\nLet's go on to one of the more prominent factors of the game: stress. Dark enviroments, recieved critical hits, and stress-inducing attacks all give your units a certain number of stress. When a unit's stress reaches 100, they will gain an absolutely awful trait. These range from paranoia to selfishness to plain insanity. Each of these traits does something different. Fear causes a unit to either move back or refuse to fight. Abusive units will constantly insult their comrades. Irrational units...are irrational. In a new update, if a unit recieves 200 stress, they will die.\nNot all hope is lost! Despite all this,  there is still a small chance a unit will gain "virtue" when his/her stress hits 100. This means they will gain a GOOD trait, and stress is greatly reduced.\n\nI could go on about all the interesting mechanics this game has to offer, but then this review would rival the length of War and Peace. I am leaving a lot out to say.\n\nNow, if I could take a more personal turn in this review, this game has genuinely changed my way of thinking.\nThis game is all about making the best of a bad situation (they even tell you that), and the odds will almost always make you cautious or even be flat-out against you. Every little thing that happens could add up and ultimately destroy you.\nOr do they?\nWhen I first played this game, I felt very pressured every time a trap was triggered, a unit was blighted, etc. However, I learned these are things that will happen as I play, and I will have to deal with them and/or get rid of them if I wanted to succeed playing this game. Heck, many things in this game could be easily solved with clever thinking or even a single item.\n(This is where it gets a bit sappy, folks) In my personal life, all the littlest things would stack up every day and mentally and often physically drain me, but playing this game made me realize that these things just happen, and I should accept them and figure out how to surpress them or remove them from my everyday life altogether. It's rather easy now that I actually try instead of take the hits from the minor crap.\n\nAnd for now, I am out of things to say. All I can say now is I love this game. I have never spent more than $7 on any Steam game, but I am more than happy for paying the whole $20 for this.\n\n\n\nBy the way, everything in this game looks hand-drawn, and that is g-e-u-d goooooooooooooooood.","June 24, 2015","true","110.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The game is not so much a pure dungeon crawler, but more of a dungeon crawl management simulator (for lack of a better word). You do not only navigate the heroes through a dungeon. You also take full responsibility for their wellbeing. As heroes go through dungeons, they accumulate stress and could even get diseases, and you have to make sure you bring them back to top shape in between your dungeon runs. You do not just control a single party of heroes. You have to rotate several different heroes around and pick the ones most suitable for the job at hand.\n\nThere are 4 areas where you can take your expedition: Ruins, Warrens, Weald, and Cove, and each one has its own dangers and challenges, what means that you need to prepare your team accordingly. The dungeons also come in different lengths (Short, Medium, and Long) and of different difficulty (Apprentice, Veteran, and Champion). As of the final release, the final dungeon has been added too (have not yet had the bravery to try it out).\n\nThe combat is really fun and in my opinion has a lot of tactical depth to it. It's not just a simple turn-based battle system, but each position within your party setup is important. Some hero classes prefer frontal positions in the squad (like the melee tanks), others prefer to hang back (like healers or ranged attackers).\n\nThe game has been balanced around loads during Early Access, and though some aspects of it might feel unfair still, overall the gameplay feels pretty solid and requires a lot of strategising and adjusting to the situation when bad things start to happen. The game can be pretty punishing towards those who do not take caution. And even if you do everything right, things can still go wrong at times, and part of the gameplay is also having to deal with that. The game encourages tip-top preparation and contingency planning. That means that the game is easily not for everyone, but those who do enjoy that sort of thing will be up for a real treat.\n\nArt, music, and voice acting are also superb. Easily a cherry on an already delicious cake.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and doesn't mind it when a game occasionally throws them some curve balls. I can't remember the last time a game has kept me interested for 70 hours and counting.","December 31, 2015","true","81.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

I'll give it a go."\n\nNo, do not. It is brutual, right out of the gates.\nFatal actually - you have ZERO chance of surviving. You will not finish this game, you won't even finish a chapter. Not for lack of skill or planning however. Read on.\n\nI'm hoping perhaps a patch in the future will resolve this - but as it currently stands, the game is impossible.\n\nPLAYABLITY ISSUES: There is no "recovery" once in the dungeon - where you could fight to a certain spot, then return to town and resupply or recuperate. A rational person would say, "we can't go on, we must retreat." Retreat means failure and penalty. And the mission cannot be reattempted. It's first try, or fail.\n\nIt's a death match to the end of every mission - and because so much of the game mechanic  depends on random chance and blind luck, even a well prepared party can have one bad battle, and  literally be doomed.\n\nINTERACTIVE ITEMS: Don't bother, my experience was 99% were traps, diseases, or stress inducing maladies inflicted upon my party. that these typically occur right before a battle was no accident either.\nI was badly injured, defeated before the fight even began. Did I mention there is no retreat to recuperate?\n\nWant to start a fight poisoned, blighted, or bleeding to death? Go ahead and open that book, crate, or sarcoghagus.\n\nRANDOM LUCK, NO SKILL INVOLVED: As others have stated here earlier, you can go through a fight with out a scratch against a superior opponent, only to be taken apart by a pack of maggots that all score critical hits the next fight. It's maddening.\n\nThere is no healing AFTER battle, (And your healers forgo offense to heal during) heavy wounds give a variety of diseases and stress-related offenses, and of course nothing tops the battle where a necromancer hit my entire party with a massive stress-inducing spell ("6 feet under") and they ALL died due to heart attack. In the same round...simultaneously. Wheee....\n\nOn many missions you can camp - ONCE - and recover a slight amount - but you'll never return to proper fighting form. If I was lucky, I might get back to about 50% of my original strength. And this was typically after 2-3 fights!\n\nVERDICT: This game shows a lot of promise, but currently the game mechanic renders it  unplayable.\n\nI'll leave it in my library for a bit and see if there's a patch in the near future.\nOtherwise, it's done.","August 2, 2015","false","17.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack4Lope/recommended/262060/","Jack4Lope","Jack4Lope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack4Lope/","266 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPretty cool game, but it's one of those games where they have probably spend countless nights balancing the random. A "roguelike" in only the sense that it's randomly generated and replayable with severe consequences. It just goes too far into the severe consequences it gets rediculous. It's like it's set on a hardcore mode that only a few would enjoy. It's got a tone, that just oozes smugness, telling you in the start "Don't worry, we made this game to be no fun at all, because..."\n\nTake provisions as an example. Apparently these spoil instantly as they enter a ruin, and cannot possibly be used afterwards, they loose all value and probably get thrown away even though at the end of the journey they eat into your carrying capactiy on what you can bring back. So you are constantly in need of balance for how much you might get out of a quest, how much stuff you might need to pass a dungeon, and how much you might find? Add to this the fact that dungeons "level up" for no reason, and you're running out of capable warriors, it's like your playing a game over and over again, just increasing the difficulty level but not really getting anywhere.\n\nAnother awkward balance to keep things "tense" is healing, you may have healers, but they can't heal out of battle. So instead of figuring out a system to balance having too much healing ability, the game designers chose to make an arbitrary descision on not being able to do something outside of lethal situations. This lack of strategy just leaves me bummed. This also makes it that there are tons of helaing abilties, and you just need to balance multiple party builds with enough healing, but not too much. Oh the fun.\n\nLastly the need for 4 people in your party is just contrary to how the game begins with 2 characters. So even if you'd be okay with your 3 fresh and sane adventurers, to maybe just take a half way excursion into the dungeon, you NEED to take gibbering jim who really should really be spending time in the asylum instead. I mean it just wouldn't be fun if the game couldn't force its stress mechanic onto you every step of the way, would it? The characters in this world are also by far the most fragile examples of humanity. Someone says something bad more then once, steals all valuable loot, refuses to help, and then DIES!? Well oh no, why don't you all just slip on into eternal hopelessness. This is a game that was obviously designed by people who think getting "triggered" is as serious as social science wants you to belive. I suppose the real answer was to just let gibbering jim go, not get him help and maybe then the game would let me just play with 3 characters- ah who am I kidding, probably would have shown a kill screen and ended it all if I was that sick.\n\nI havn't really gotten too far into this game, and my above examples probably makes that clear. Its just one of those games where you need a community forum to go read over, to learn the basic concepts, ammounts and progression just to have fun. Although this is apparently what "ruined" the original game (before the hound and whatnot update)  because there was a strategy which could be applied, to far too great an effect. This broken game from the past apparently got all glowing reviews, and now tha game is just completely different, but some people are happy about it I guess?\n\nThere is no amateur mode. The game also does such a poor job at teaching you anything I have the feeling the game creators just thought Deamons Souls was the greatest game in the world because who knows what the heck that game wanted, was really more of a community puzzle then a game. Those outside of the community aspects just had to try and fail countless times. However that game got one thing right which this didn't, you failed a lot but this was the "normal" state of things and it kept going. In this game you fail a lot and you just start over and over again, doing that same tedious fight, see the same tired cut scenes, progress the same 3 missions before you get everything in the game... Ugh. This games "normal state" is to fail, and get nowhere and start over again, so if that sounds like fun by all means, sign up to the closest darkest dungeon community forum, load up a ton of reading and pull an all nighter. Its got charm, it's got variety, it's just too much "raw" for my taste.","August 30, 2015","false","12.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Just without the art.\n======\nTL;DR for people with reading comprehension problems:\n\nIt is a nearly finished product\nIt is not necessarily ready for broad consumption as an early access piece\nIt is worth your support if it is a game you would like see reach its full potential.\nIf you are going to support it, be involved with the community and developers, don't just throw money at it.\n\n=======\nAMAZING aesthetic. In its current state, it is a fully finished art piece, which will be regarded as a gem...\n\nWhen the rest of it is finished.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are fully realized, the systems and etc are fleshed out, functional, and understandable (if not a little obfuscated behind menus in some cases), so that's not necessarily the issue.\n\nThe problems you will find will relate to the game design and the user experience.  Yes, the game is hard, in ways that you may even find unfair due to randomness, but that's kind of where the fun is, in this reenvisioning of the popular dungeoncrawler idea.\n\nWhat you'll find is a game that, in many cases, doesn't care whether or not you're having fun, which is a real shame, because the developers clearly care about making it a good game, but in its current state you will be hit, full force, with the sense that they don't, amist an equal amount of force saying they want to make a great product.\n\nWhile I am giving this a negative recommendation, I say this:\n\nIf you think you would enjoy this game, or this is a game that you would like to see succeed, do buy it.  However, don't just buy the game, but play it and provide good constructive and analytic feedback to the developers about the areas that need it.  This is an early access game, which means it is technically an unfinished product, but while early access is often a variant form of a kickstarter money grab kind of thing, this game is a near complete product, and if it's something you would like, the best thing you can do is support it not only with money, but with the intention to beta test it the way early access is somewhat meant to be for.\n\nDo not entertain ideas of fanboy hype and vapid support of various features of the game, because that is only appeal to enthusiasm and emotion.  If you feel something is wrong with the game, take some time to analyze it and understand how it affects the game, how it fails to benefit it, or, maybe, how it actually does its job well, and use these understandings to notice the cracks that need to be filled.  And then communicate them.","February 5, 2015","false","7.7"," 286 of 555 people (52%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","52","286","555","29","8"

Yeah, I get it, turn based RPGs do have an element of RNG to them, but mechanically this game is just bad. Enemies out hit you and out stress you. I don't mind that there isn't a good way to heal out of battle, as it makes the game feel more like a test of endurance, but it's not uncommon that I will just get to an easy fight and drag it out for an hour just to heal, because all in combat heals restor a pathetic amount of HP.\n\nAlso the Vestel feels like a necessary class due to having by FAR the strongest heals. In my opinion, having any class feel necessary is just BAD. This game really needs something of a way to heal out of combat. Add to that the fact that when you get a character to level 3 they refuse to do low level quests (apparently all the heroes in this game are just jackasses) Ugh...

Hire level 0 adventurers and give them no items.\n\nStep 2. go as far into a dungeon as you can collecting loot.\n\nStep 3. Fire all of them and hire new level 0 heros.\n\nRepeat forever.\n\nDarkest dungeon has no way to lose the game and most upgrades just reduce prices by a negible amount. And everything costs large amounts of money. I'd swear this was suppose to be a buy cash mobile game with how much everything costs, how grindy it is, and that is just impossible to lose.\n\nThe first thing you will want to do after your first day of playing is turn the narrator volume off. He repeats himself CONSTANTLY and just plain ticks you off stealing slots at the tavern or church. He doesn't act insane or woe is me at all, and neither would I spending all my time gambling, drinking, and sleeping with a brothel.\n\nI'm not sure what is more annoying. The fact that after each dungeon run up to all 4 adventurers might gain a negative trait or how often enemies can dodge, especially enemies in the back that like to use sanity lowering moves.\n\nThe game does have items called trinkets, but most have negatives that rarely seem to make them worth using. You can't even sell them, yet the game will offer to sell them to you for high amounts.\n\nTheres camping that can heal or boost your heros, but your likely to get attacked after in the dark. So the advantage camping gave might go right out the window and end your run right then and there.\n\nThe fact that heros gain zero exp from battles and only from completing a dungeon. Makes battles just feel pointless. Completely 100% pointless and worthless. The time I spent in that battle I could have found and open 4 treasures or more.\n\nIts not a hard game, its not a fair game, its not much fun. I'm always loading it forgetting its not fun and then one dungeon later I remember and turn it off. Lots of rougelikes/lites have unfair enemies or traps, but they are usually consistant. Not miss every attack and every enemy gets a critical vs the same groups you always stomped before. Going from 22,000 to nothing because I upgraded 4 of my heros is not fun. This is the only game I can remember where after an entire day of grind my characters are level two. Making it possibly the most grindy game I've ever played, worse than silk road.\n\nThe money grind just ruins it for me. If I wanted this much money grind I'd play a ftp mmo.

It's unbridled focus on Necromancy, Cosmic Horrors, Weird Fiction Tropes and recently on an Innsmouth-centric revolt allows an atmosphere of insidious dread to prevail through such terrible game mechanics. Yes, I said it. Reveling in the diverse rogue gallery of lore-centric enemies is awesome. You'll feel like you got lost inbetween Algernon Blackwood and Lovecraft while crawling through catacombs as Wayne June proclaims your inevitable failure, and the masked Leper leading your party suddenly cracks.\n\nBut I feel a unique, separate kind of dread when all four of my level 5's miss the basic skeletals and get wrecked.

DD's combat engine is dicerolls from D&D, home brewed, without much semblance of balance.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a sidescrolling click-n-crawl much like Grimrock, with a tiered party of 4 classes taking different depth charts. Positioning is important, as archers can't shoot from the front, and your crusader can't swing from the back. Following? You crawl down hallways, which are littered with procedurally generated loot, into rooms, filled usually with bad guys. That's all it is, besides for a feature creep styled town where heirlooms acquired can upgrade it to provide cheaper upgrades. No town events, invasions, 1-day missions, or anything resembling variation. Objectives range from scouting all the rooms, killing all the bad guys, or collecting 3 pieces of unique loot. All 3's results do not effect your party any differently, leading me to realize DD is a monotonous descent into the uniquely terrifiyng realm of boredom, and boredom that punishes you for being alive.","November 10, 2015","false","40.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

I am glad to say the game is still awesome. Very well polished, though some of the classes could use some balancing. The mechanics are solid and the gameplay is as addictive as ever. Corpses really make no difference to me. I find them to be pretty easy to deal with to the point that, IMO, they are inconsequential.\n\nSo my recommendation remains the same. By it, especially if you like games with brutal difficulty. It is rewarding to play and satisfying to overcome the odds.\n\nOne of the most polished Early Access games I have ever played, Darkest Dungeon is a gem that deserves your time. A wonderful mish-mash of genres with the addition of the excellent Stress mechanics make this one of the most brutal RPG/Strategy/Rouge-Lite games in recent memory as well.\n\nThe art style is beautiful as well, conveying the gothic atmosphere well. In fact, I can't find to much bad to say about this game. If you are interested in a challenging game that is only going to get better as it gets closer to its projected summer release day, you now have your game.. The addicting gameplay will bring you back for more, More of your adventurers suffering brutal deaths and mind-crushing insanities. Managing the stress that leads to insanity is one of the more gripping and complex of the mechanics in the game. In my opinion, it is one of the defining traits of this game.\n\nEven if these types of games don't exactly appeal to you, I still recommend it. The addicting gameplay will bring you in and the amount of polish will impress.

Although it shares a lot in common with most "rogue-like" games (i.e. death in permanent, life is cheap, dungeons are randomized) it also has a number of unique features that add spice to the game play. There is no resurrect spell, dungeons aren't overflowing with loot, dungeon items can yield unpredictable results, and the character's stress levels are as important as their hit points. Also, it's not a game where you have the straightforward classification of "tank,healer,thief,mage," there's a number of unique classes that combine different aspects of all three classes. For example, Amazonian "Hellion" can heal herself, and a properly equipped mage "Occultist" can hold his own in front-line combat. It's probably the only game where a lute playing Jester can die of a heart attack from burning books.\n\nAll this makes for a refreshing twist on the typical dungeon crawler experience, but it takes some time to orient yourself to the game. What initially seems like a brutal game turns into a strategic challenge as you learn the classes, their tactics, and how they all work together. This is not a game that ceases to be a challenge at higher levels, unlike other games where a top-level tank can laugh off most opponents.\n\nSo, for me, if you are done with the old, tired dungeon crawlers but like the "rogue-likes," then this is this year's game for you. If you are looking for one of those games where your 53rd level Cleric can resurrect a person from a corpse to a fighting machine in the middle of combat without skipping a beat, this is probably not the game for you. It's different, it's challenging, it's fun, you shoudl try it.","October 9, 2015","true","192.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

The former was enjoyably demanding, the latter was a chore.\n\nI enjoyed the first 30 hours but after accumulating 7 characters of final tier level I realised that in order for them to meet their full potential and have a good chance of beating the final dungeons they'd need to have afflictions removed, have good equipment and positive traits locked in.  Which takes money, LOTS of money.  Which means repeating dungeons, LOTS of dungeons, to the point of boredom.\n\nI already felt slightly weary with the repetition when entering 30+ hour mark but carried on since I felt the end was in sight.  However, another 10 hours later, when I realised what would be required to complete the game, I felt like I was facing another 40+ hours - mainly grinding at lower level stuff.\n\nIt's a shame since there are so many cool things to do with the characters and so many classes to mess around with.   From experimenting with and increasing certain skill sets, to paying to permanently keep certain bonuses they have earned, it's an exciting prospect.  Doing this would really individualise them, add an extra layer of depth and greatly increase the RPG feel of it all but again, this costs money, TONS of money.  Cue even more grinding.\n\nSimply put, I feel this could have been a great 40-50 hour game but the constant halt in progress to get obscene amounts of gold to heal, cure and upgrade the roster is so time consuming the game ends up artificially increasing its playtime beyond my interest and desire.  I'm guessing they made this decision in order to 'double down' on the difficulty but I find testing people's patience through grinding isn't a fun form of challenge.\n\nHaving said all that, if you pick it up cheap and get 30+ hours of enjoyment before repetition sets in then I guess that could be viewed as money well spent....just take into consideration that you won't finish the game in that time frame, beat the bosses nor see your characters and township reach their full potential.  Not even close. Whether that's a deal breaker is, of course, for you to decide.

Certain classes are just better and the changes made over time with this game have not made it so those classes are stronger, at best, the strong classes became weaker or were changed in ways to make them weaker. When I first bought this game, I would take random parties for no light dungeon runs in order to make some quick cash for my main party to be able to afford some upgrades or be able to afford to prepare for a dungeon after buying a very good trinket.\n\nI came back to the game just today and have played for a few hours. I attempted what I did before with a little mix and match. It did not go well and not in an RNG sort of way. The party was just not effective and I abandoned the quest and them pretty quickly. Thus I was able to get back to my good party who was getting through dungeons with only minor problems and the occasional amount of stress reaching a moderate level where I would need to go to an off team to deal with the stress. The problem here is that it creates an absolute issue with regards to the classes. There are classes that are good and there are classes that are not. If you take the wrong classes, the game is hard. If you take the right classes, the game is not hard.\n\nNow I will say that the art, sound, and music are all top notch. They have been from the beginning. The story is Lovecraftian Horror, so think depressing. If you don't like the idea of a cosmic horror that is going to win no matter what and we are just delaying the inevitable. Do not play this game.\n\nPersonally for me, I used to have fun experimenting with different parties and seeing whether they could scrape by while doing something that no sane real adventurers would do. That's not possible anymore and the design decisions all led here. I once told myself I wouldn't buy early access games anymore and this game reinforces that decision. Until I see the final product, I do not plan on buying most games.\n\nTL:DR This game might be for you if you like a game where there is one way to win and you like Lovecraftian Horror with a touch of RNG.","January 21","false","84.2"," 35 of 66 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","35","66","5","0"

What can I honestly say?\nThe game is made to make you go insane with frustration and anger,\nIt is build to go against you, Wich makes it really addicting because you really want to beat the game.\n\nSomehow one of your hero's gets rabbies, or gets scared and therefor moves to the last position.\nYou just start cursing on how they react and wish you where in the game yourself.\nBut the more frustrating the more you get into the game.\n\nThe longer you play the more you realise how hard it is, how hard it is to collect gold,\nto delete the negative effects from your hero's. give it positive effects,and so on.\n\nIn the end you can let your hero's gamble- drink-rest. everything to make them happy right?\nThey can sing to eachother peacefully next to a campfire, or be selfish and take all the food for themself.\n\nYou will need some strategy tho, see what fits together. So theorycrafting is also fun in this game\nwith strategy I mean more : with what hero will you pick up the bookcase, Will you leave it?\nor will you take the risk? It is something you will need to think about.\n\n*Soundtrack : Just like the graphics, it isn't something you find generally in an RPG\nIt is quite stressfull music when everything goes dark, a little bit halloween style.\n\n*Money-wise : Do I think the game is worth so much? Yes I do, the game is something you can play for hours non stop. You can start over or you can continue. so the time you would put into this\nis for me worth the money.\n\n\nOverall VerdictIf you are willing to have patience, anger, frustration, sadness (because oh no all your effort)\nthen this is tottaly worth it.\n\nDo not forget this is an early acces game, things can still change.\nThere will still be some bugs, and changing incomming.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10","August 31, 2015","true","4.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

I had such high hopes for it. It is a great concept, it has great art, it has a great vibe, the voice acting is terrific so what could have gone so wrong?\n\nThe gameplay.\n\nIt all boils down to one problem. If you want to have a game about psychological damage the most important thing is that the player should care about the characters, a lot. You have to set it up to say "you are stuck with this guy however insane it gets". You have to feel like you are on a minecart ride to hell where then only way out is to go all the way down.\n\nInstead what this game does is throw hundreds of characters at you. You need 4 per week to make an adventuring squad but you can get up to 8 replacements! So yeah you end up with a massive squad of 16 adventurers whose names you don't even know. Has one of them gone insane? Chuck them out and get another to fill their place. Everyone is disposable.\n\nDrowning in characters means it's impossible to care about any of them. It's such a shame because this game could have been a true great, instead it's a complete fail.\n\nIf they just made it so that you had a small squad which you needed to cherish, with maybe a replacement every once in a while. If only you had to sit in the town thinking "I really want to stay here for another week to rest but I need to keep pressing on deeper into the dungeon because I have to beat the timer" this really could have been a huge win.\n\nInstead they bungled it.","May 28","false","4.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

In the last month at all, they had Reddit manipulate reviews so that the 100+ negative reviews that had dominated for the last 6 months would be buried, and replaced with recent positive reviews. They have spammed everywhere about how they recieved awards for looking good, from an organization that literally only deals with indie devs who bribe them. And now, in the hours before they expose themselves, all they have done is spam Twitch streamers with custom narrator quotes for their channels and not ya know, actually fix or complete the game. Now they no longer have that shield, so I can fully blast them for their myriad failings from a design perspective, a marketing perspective, and a community management perspective. You can read all the old stuff here.[pastebin.com] Here's a TL;DR of this game's stagnation and a quick Q and A:\n\nHas the game added content during Early Access? No, not really. There's a fourth and fifth area you grind through the same as the other 3, and there's four new classes that run off the same one dimensional game mechanics and that's about it. That's all the game has gotten in nearly 12 months, so if you think all the missing content will be added in the last month I offer great deals on bridges. Missing content such as actual Roguelike elements, proper exploration mechanics, tactical (instead of damage spam based) combat... you know, the things that would make this a game and not a walking simulator.\n\nHas the game improved during Early Access? Nope. In Feburary the game was shallow but has the promise of potential that let people see it through and have bright hopes for the future. It's still shallow, and it's actively moved away from its own vision with every patch while the developers continually prattle about that very thing.\n\nHas the marketing strategy improved since Early Access? No, it has also degenerated. They are even more aggressively spammy than ever, particularly regarding video content creators. What's more, the game goes on ever increasing sales every month, often more than once on the same month. Any time you see an Early Access game getting massive discounts you should smell the desperation a mile off, and it shows because sales are the only time the game gets any sales (along with large numbers of votes on the negative reviews that have wholly dominated it for the past 6 months). Curiously, despite that they had the audacity of raising the price on release.\n\nHas the community management improved during Early Access?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2V-D-Xdq8 They started merely ignoring criticisms, then became corrupt, censoring, suicidal indie devs. After attracting the ire of Jim Sterling Son they became marginally more subtle (and also already censored most of the prime targets) Mostly they stick with letting their community stalk, harass, and commit real world crimes against their critics with their unspoken permission, while spinning delusional narratives during every "interview" of the past 6 months about how critics in general, or one specific critic in particular (me) have no valid points because their game is perfect since the only things anyone could have any problems with are optional (and that's not true either). During these mock interviews they spend more time in rampant denial their game has any problems whatsoever than they do discussing what they believe are its positive traits. Should the interviewer put on a sufficiently shillish performance they will even be hired (see: RektHookJohn).\n\nHas the community improved during Early Access? No, that's the biggest casualty. It started out about what you'd expect. Lots of challenge gamers, pretty level minded and intelligent people. Most of them left early because this game was nothing like that (and still isn't). Those that haven't have became very vindictive (see: me). And filling the gap is a lot of Johnny Come Latelies who are either unfortunately caught in the crossfire or the sorts that imploded what community that once existed in a manner of days with their raging hostility at all forms of criticism. Fun fact: No supporter has ever been banned no matter how out of line their actions were. They barely get warned, and reporting them is considered abusing the report feature.\n\nWhat else are they doing wrong? Revisionist history for one thing, where they conviently forget about things they've already done or that have already happened so they look good now and people not familiar with their past history but who are following them (most people) will be fooled. Very large amounts of tedium and grind mismarketed as difficulty - hell, they even hired the tedium/grind mod guy and used his ideas which you can already see discussed at length in most of the other helpful reviews. The game's still one dimensional: If you just spam damage you will see the game for what it is[www.darkestdungeon.com], if you pretend it's somehow tactical you might buy in on this meme this game is somehow difficult because your trash classes and skills will not kill the enemies. Their favorite thing is putting on a good show - for example, making a patch in which some (not all) of the tedium is made "optional" right before both a sale (gotta Suicide Squad more real people so they can get more moneys), and announcing that if you want the real quality difficult Roguelike experience that you allegedly came for, you gotta wait until release, grind through various ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 3 times so you unlock "NG+", and at that point all the tedium is locked "on" because that's what difficulty is about apparently.\n\nIt seems their business plan at this point is making the game so long and grindy and tedious that no one will actually sit through it all, at which point any complaints about the game being hollow/shallow/etc will just be dismissed. It will then be mismarketed as "difficult", because people are having extreme difficulty remaining awake for it and you'll see more memes about how it's just like XCOM or Dark Souls (without stripping out nearly every feature both of those games have and being very generous with narrative liberties).\n\nAnd before anyone points out the 800 pound gorilla in the room: At one point I believed in this game's potential enough that I made it a proper game myself. After a few months it became so broken this was no longer possible, as there were now massive amounts of hardcoded imbalances. But I am not reviewing my work, I am reviewing theirs so the large hour count just means both that I at least have a grasp on what a difficult Roguelike is and what it is about and as a reminder of what could have been if we had a competent development team and overconfidence were not a slow, and insidious killer...","January 19","false","337.0"," 1,511 of 2,949 people (51%) found this review helpful 242 people found this review funny","51","511","2","242","362"

So much of the game becomes recruiting fodder to send into the dungeons with no supplies so you can grind gold and other currency to heal your main group. Once the main group is healed you send them in to go for a boss, hoping that RNG doesn't bend you over and ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥, forcing you to retreat and start the whole grind process all over again. It's fun at first, but the game becomes really tedious once you realize you're basically throwing expendable resources into a rng machine and hoping that something good comes out of it.\n\nIt's not all bad though, since I honestly love the art style and the narration is some of the best I've heard in any game. It's just an overall disappointing feeling because I'll see a snapshot of it on the store page or scroll by it in my library and say to myself  "God dammit, I really wish I liked that game more than I do".","February 12","false","9.1"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","36","68","2","1"

I get how the game is made to be brutal and unforgiving but it's at a level to where sometimes it's not even fun to play and mayble a bit unfair. A lot of times after the first few rooms in a dungeon I would be forced to back out of the "easy" level 1 quests early. Not just because of how overwhelmed your party gets, but also how fast RNGesus can smite your luck out of the sky like a bird hit by a lightning bolt. Like I'm on the last room of a boss dungeon and my party gets knocked out by the bandits Blanket Fire while they stumble to get the big bandit out of the way.

I was very much enjoying it for a time and when hitting lvl 3 dungeons (not even on a boss yet) some of my main team died, the loss was unrecoverable. Stress generation is insane and needs to be lowered, just walking randomly in a hall you accumulate stress for instance. Heirlooms seem to be far too heavy on certin types, id have 3 of one and 60 of another which I couldnt use as everything takes multiple types. Debuff heaven!!! I think most of my charaters had about 5-6 negative effects each which you cant keep up with removing as there far too expensive at first and take a whole dungeon round to remove as well rendering the charater useless (and you can only do one at a time!). There are some small things I think would make the game better as well for instance a "Rooms: #" on each dungeon so you can better plan for torches and food supply. Some GUI things i noticed were a little odd that could use improvement as well like when equiping items to charaters before a battle and having to close and open tons of windows to equip just 4 guys (a little popup would be cool as well if you have avalible items and one of your charaters is itemless, something along the lines of "Are you sure? Your not fully equiped" because using 15 guys you are always removing and requiping items I did find some dungeons I had missed outfitting on accident.","November 27, 2015","false","9.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

Really. In theory it sounds great: a combination of Cthulhu with heroes/anti-heroes, a dungeon crawl and RPG elements. The problem is the game is SO weighted against you that it ceases being fun. If your party isn't wiped out first, chances are really good after a couple of missions your "primary" characters will be useless due to their stress and negative quirks and you constantly have to start missions with Level 0 characters. There are mechanics for you to reduce stress and remove quirks but it is so expensive to do so it renders the option useless.\n\nI understand this used to be a fun game to play before a recent patch that tilted the odds to "unfair" against the players. I did not get a chance to experience this "fun" version. I can only hope the devs recognize they are frustrating their player base that they will clean this up. There's a good game lurking beneath the surface.

The reason for this is the much-too-punishing RNG over which the player has little control and there is simply no strategy to overcome. Because a single surprise attack can instantly destroy any character in your party, the only sensible way to proceed is to avoid taking any extra risks whatsoever. In the language of this game, this means sending out parties of throwaway characters and deleting them.\n\nThe game advertises itself as "difficult" but a better explanation is that it is "grindy," and the player forced into the role of an HR manager of a fast food restaurant where employees quit at random.\n\nDoubling down on the resource Facebook-game aspect of DD, the game forces the player to "gamble" prior to each mission and expend money on tools. This aspect of the game feels like a money trough.\n\nOverall, game has some nice graphics and some promising features, but feels more like managing a Wendy's restaurant than a horror RPG.","February 17","false","14.8"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

I don't mind playing difficult games, but when you invest hours of game play and this game just decides when you are going to lose. No matter what your numbers are, no matter how much planning went into your team, you are just going to lose because the game decides you need to lose your good squad. The gameplay is artificially being extended by creating impossible battles so you can lose your best squad and have to start over.\n\nThe game has some good ideas, it's just too bad the developers got lazy and took the easy way out by forcing your squad to get killed off artificially instead of having actual realistic game mechanics. There are instances in many games that involve good and bad luck and then there are games like Darkest Dungeon where the outcomes are predetermined. Predetermined outcomes are lazy and unenjoyable for the player. I won't play this game again and I wouldn't recoomend that anyone buy it either unless you enjoy frustration and being manipulated.

None of which I've played because I don't like over powered RNGs, difficulty for the sake of difficulty, and insufferably long grinds.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I really did.  I love the visuals, I love the concepts, I even love some of the mechanics.  But what I love about the game doesn't override the horrible grind necessary to overcome its difficulty.  This game is about grind.  Only get this game if you have absolutely no intention of getting attached to any character ever.  The only path I have seen to success resides in the slow meat grinder approach.  If you can't accept that in any given encounter your favorite character (or any/all character(s) for that matter) might go from full health to dead then this is not the game for you.\n\nFurthermore, one of the biggest problems I have with this game is with its community.  Anytime someone has a legitimate complaint about the game (mostly its difficulty) there is a litany of grinders that show up to scream "git gud", "u goofed", "read homework", etc.  The problem is this game was designed for those people.  They're not sympathetic, they're not helpful, and they'll treat you like any of the numerous faceless characters they send to slaughter to get ahead in this game.  I never used to consider myself a casual gamer, but these days I'm beginning to embrace the title, if it means wanting some ability to balance a game by having the option of tipping the scales a little more in my favor than the computer's without having to rely on downloading mods.  It's an easy matter to implement a difficulty scale, yet the developers opted out of this very reasonable option to cater to these "hardcore" gamers.  I think that is a huge mistake, and it is for that reason that I have shelved this game until it is made more playable for "casual" gamers.","October 24, 2015","false","34.6"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","2"

At least in a game like Dark Souls skill takes precedence and makes the game gradually more enjoyable. In this game, you are never not a victim to the RNG. When things go well, they go very well. But when things go bad, it honestly feels like the developers are giving you the finger and kicking you in the balls with a smug smirk for good measure.\n\nI've pushed on through this game and managed to defeat every beginner and veteran boss with two of the intermediate bosses (the dreaded Swine God and the Hag Witch) under my belt. But I've recently thrown in the towel and decided I can't push myself any further. It isn't simply a matter of the RNG either; the intermediate dungeons are too difficult with enemies that will frequently have both high dodging AND protection stats making each battle a slow grind and a fight for your life. That there are ways to mitigate the enemies ability to survive your attacks with debuffs barely helps when the debuffs tragically miss, making that character's turn wasted, or when you simply don't have anyone on your team available to do such a thing. It doesn't help that you can't ever go anywhere without a healer, whose healing skills are so hit and miss you're constantly on the edge of your seat whenever they attempt to patch your crumbling team together.\n\nWhere the difficulty goes overboard is with an enemy called The Collector that you are guaranteed to fight at least once randomly in EVERY intermediate level dungeon. These enemies are the biggest asshats due to their ability to continually respawn allies which can either heal or protect it while it too heals itself by draining life from your team to refresh its already huge pool of helth. The reward for defeating this enemy, an item worth a lot of gold, won't even cover your losses at the end of the quest when you have to send your team to the tavern or the abbey to undo their accumulated stress (assuming you can even survive).\n\nWhere I quit was in a dungeon where I had just barely survived an encounter with this most dreaded of foes only for TWO of my high level heroes whom I had already invested much money into upgrading, BOTH died, in a game with perma death no less. That brought the toll of dead heroes to ten and caused me to delete my save file in frustration. I don't mind (too much) if a hero dies valiantly while fighting a boss which I then proceed to defeat, but when it happens randomly due to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG it brings my blood to a boil and I have to fight not to hurl my laptop across the room.\n\nIt's sad, because I like this game. I really, truly do. But it is TOO F&%#ing hard!!! Would it honestly kill them to dial down the difficulty just a bit? Even to allow you to purchase disposable healing items so you're not constantly relying on healers who can only heal during battle? When every quest becomes a desperate roll of the dice not just to progress the game but to just get yourself out of the black so you can invest in hero upgrades then it becomes more of a painful chore than a thrill. Especially when you see all that hard work go down the drain due to some random trick of the RNG. (Like missing four times in a row when trying to kill even a single enemy!)\n\nI like hard games but I'm getting sick and tired of this meat-head "git gud" mentality which is plaguing games lately and making people feel ashamed for just wanting to have fun.\n\nThis game is too hard. Not hard but rewarding kind of hard, but hard and painful, like the worst day of your life at the worst job you've ever had and when deep in debt to boot. Would it be such a bad thing if they just make it a little more forgiving?????","February 10","false","69.1"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","0"

I really tried. A friend of mine recommended the game and the style and scenario sounded awesome. And it really is a good game and one day I might try it again.\n\nBought it during mid-week sale and started playing; 4 days later on Saturday morning I was fed up with it. Most of the time you are just hoping that nothing “too” bad might happen. And most of the time things happen, which you cannot influence. A hard game is nice, but starting the game right now is just unfair. Even more experienced players might disagree, my friend also did.\n\nFollowing I like to point out why I do stand by my opinion:\n\n1. The difference between virtue und afflictions is just too much; if one reaches virtue everything is fine. If on the other side reaches one affliction like irrational the changes of "success" in the expedition are very low to no existing any more. One affliction will cause another one (best were three irrational people during one fight) and heardattacks are just waiting.\n\n2. Getting rid of stress is too hard. The enemy crits you: 10 stress for the target and some stress for the person next to him. You crit, maybe 3 or 5 stress relief. That's ok, but if you are a Vestal or a Plague Doctor who heals, the crits are rare. And lasts due to DOT's like blight or bleed do not grand stress relief. So no stress relief for you Plague Doctor. The worst is having a hero with a stress level of 40-50 in your town. Sending him into the tavern or the abbey costs a lot of gold (compared to your loot, I will get to that) and it might have a "nice" perk, like losing additional resources or him just leaving for a while. On the other side there might also be a disease (I love the plagues) or some negative character quirks which you was gifted during your last journey and might need treatment. I had one Level 3 hero which was then to proud to join my expeditions any more, due to all abovementioned I was not able to bring any other heroes up to his level and continue.\n\n3. The loot is just not enough for the current costs. I equipped not too much food, torches etc. but still I was barely able to loot enough to cover the costs of the expedition and heal from afflictions, sicknesses or negative character quirks. Not even speaking of healing a permanent negative character quirk or locking in positive one. That was much out of reach.\n\nAll the mentioned things were not part of the game before. From what I read they became mostly part of the game during the last bigger patches and its unfortunate I just started playing; but I seems that many players who just started faced the same troubles.\n\nMore experienced players seem to disagree. In my opinion they tend to disagree mostly due to affect that their mentions are already maxed out, the higher costs did not hit them that hard. Their heroes are already high level and are able to face the fears; just coping with them became harder. So more experienced are happy with these new dangers. But starting right now with them is just too much burden. RNG just crashes your endeavors from try to try.\n\nAnd to try dark runs without any equipment to gain a small amount of loot and get rid of the poor "victims" is no opinion for me; that is just stupid grinding! Furthermore it does not help the heroes you try to prepare for higher level dungeons and they might get die anyway due to RNG.\n\nSo in conclusion I cannot recommend the game right now. Even with the option to disable heart attacks or corpses (which I think is not the worst of ideas due the importance of the hero and the enemy position for some attacks) I will recommend it.

Simply flip the coin; if it's heads, you win and everybody is happy. Tails, you lose and you can try again.\n\nSeriously, though, 90% of the game is dictated by dice rolls. There are certainly some levels of strategy, team building, and upgrades, but overall it's just dice rolls. Unlike good RPG's, you can't do much of anything to affect those dice rolls. It's quite possible that it becomes more affected by choice later on, but certainly in the beginning, choices don't matter at all. Why play a game where your choices make no difference? You get just as much enjoyment out of watching someone else play, because choice genuinely doesn't matter.\n\nI had really high hopes for this game, and it looks so great - both the art style, and the gameplay in general. But in practice, the game completely fails to deliver. I wish I had a game that was exactly like Darkest Dungeon in every way, just it punished you for having poor tactics instead of punishing you for simply playing the game. Every time I play, I hope I can find what others apparently see in the game, that same ideal that I had hoped for when I first bought it. Instead, I can't help but feel that the developers are laughing at me for buying their game.","February 14","false","14.6"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","0"

I really did. I gave it a fair trial.\n\nThe central problem lies with sheer randomness. You simply cannot know when an enemy attack will inflict a massive critical hit, taking one of your heroes from full health to "death's door" in a single blow. In my final attempt to send a fully-outfitted expedition to destroy the "Formless Flesh," I encountered a troup of common rogues, the kind I'd fought many times before. This time, a couple of critical hits took my knight and my bounty hunter down to death's door, and a bullwhip multi-strike killed both of them before I could take meaningful action. Random chance of so wide a range is simply not fun in a game.\n\nMind, I like difficult games! For example, I thoroughly enjoyed Alien: Isolation. But there, one dies because one fails to understand the antagonist and anticipate its next move. In Darkest Dungeon, no amount of preparation or strategy will save you from the true enemy -- sheer dumb luck.\n\nAdditionally, while the bosses (the necromancer, the Formless Flesh, the Swine King, the Hag, and the Ghost Pirates) are all well-conceived and executed, the game demands you fight each no less than four times, making the game repetitive. The campaign long overstays its welcome.\n\nThe creators have created an involving game, with many fun elements. If they made critical hits far less frequent and less devastating, and trimmed the tedious recycling, I would try this again. But I sadly cannot recommend it in its current state.\n\nAddendum: I have now tried many mods in an attempt to rebalance the game. Unfortunately, the latest patch appears to have rendered existing mods obsolete, as most of them now cause the game to crash or lock.","May 23","false","174.8"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","22","41","0","0"

I'm aware that the game is designed to involve constant meat-grinding of the characters. That is not an issue I cannot overcome. There is a lot that, with enough polish, would make for an amazing game. Even meat-grinders have their place.\n\nSo what went wrong? You know that feeling where you're telling Windows to do something but Windows is ignoring you to do something else? This game has something even worse. In this game, that frustration is an intentional feature. As you play the characters you're controlling go insane, and they have a chance of ignoring your input to perform other, deliberately inconvenient, actions. The game's designers believe they are trying to model mental illnesses, but instead all that's happening is they refuse to do what's in their own best interests.\n\nReviewing a game like this is particularly gut-wrenching because the developers had a really good game. The earlier sections, where the characters are still usable, have definite promise. There is a lot of nuance and a lot of interesting stuff in those sections, but the developers lost sight of what appeals to the fans of strategy games. If they had simply placed limits that were somehow understandable so that the player could work around them in-the-moment then cope with the baggage later on, the game could have been amazing. Unfortunately, what starts out as an engrossing every-move-matters strategy game quickly degenerates into something unpredictable. No more strategy. When your planning doesn't matter anymore there's just a typical par-for-the-course "you have to have a healer" click-fest.\n\nHit points are all that matters in this game. Heal people. Damage people. Heal yourself more than they damage you. You can't account for the nuance anymore, so who cares about all of the flavor and the details. The game is just going to have disorganized shizophrenia anyway.","September 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","23","43","3","8"

The dark world you need to traverse affects your heroes on an emotinal and mental level. It really helps you feel the impact of the insane situation you find yourself in, watching your party slowly lose their minds from the horror they face.\n\nEvery battle and dungeon expedition is narrated by excellent voice acting, and going into dungeons forces you to think about what supplies to bring and what to throw away for space. Sometimes bandages are more valuable than gold.\n\nI have a great deal of respect for what this game tries to do\n\nHowever...\n\nMany pivotal moments in this game come down to a throw of the dice. No matter how hard you preapre, no matter how well thought out your stratagy, everything can fall apart at a instant. A poorly timed miss, a weak heal, or a well placed crit can spell out death for the party youve spent a long time preparing, and there is nothing you can do about it. Hours of progress can be wiped in an instant.\n\nThis unfortunately can and will lead to large amounts of grinding, whether for money or levels, through the same dungeons youve been to time and time again. Progress in this game is slow, painfully so, and the final darkest dungeon requires many heroes to be max level. Fully upgraded max level heroes that can die at a moments notice.\n\nI imagine the devolpers of this game wanted the player to feel as stressed as the party they are playing as, because every fight is a challenge, and the fear of losing it all will put you on edge, but when you lose a full team (or even a half team) of level 6 heroes, it can be depressing to the point of game quitting especially near the end game. Its like putting 50 hours into a big game youre trying to 100% only to have your file deleted.\n\nThis game absolutely has its merits and you can tell the developer put much time into it.

The Devs have been very clear that they only want you to play the game the way that they want and have spammed the game with ridiculous mechanics changes in order to punish players; the most prominent is the 'Stall' mechanic that punishes you for trying to heal your party in combat, the only time that you can heal them. Setting aside that they are giving the finger to people that prefer a slower, more cautious playstyle, the mechanic itself is broken it will hit you if you don't manage to kill a single remaining opponent before the round ends and you can completely sidestep it by leaving 2 weak monsters alive instead of one.\n\nTL;DR\nThe Devs seem to be hellbent on taking a great game and ruining it as thoroughly as they possibly can.

I had a lot of fun with this game getting my characters up through the initial stages and into medium and hard dungeons. Unfortunatly the game becomes a huge grind at this point.  Because death is permament and sudden a few bad encounters or even a couple of bad rolls within an encounter can kill a character that can take upwards of 3 hours to replace, and that is just the for the xp. Currently the best stratagy for seeing end game content in a reasonable period of time is to take a set of 4 newbies from the stagecoach (they are free and how you replenish lost heros) and tossing them into a dungeon with no supplies and getting rid of the survivors.\n\nThe RNG in this game is really heavy, and don't let people explain it away as skill. Every attack in the game can miss, can be dodged, can hit, or can crit. Dodges and Misses do no dammage while normal attacks have fairly large ranges, a level 4 hellion hit for between 9-19 dammage on normal mobs who had health in the 20-30 range. So you could concievably crit and 1 shot a guy or miss twice and have 2 low dammage rolls and have him still alive on turn 5. Even outside of combat the RNG is pretty random. The one that gets me the most is the hunger checks, before you enter a dungeon you must supply your group with food, torches, and utility items like keys and shovels.  You eat food while crawling to replenish small amouts of HP and when camping in medium and long dungeons.  You also need food randomly when moving between rooms, doesn't matter when your previously ate, or if your party was full (you get full by eating 2-3 food). I have gotten 3 hunger checks before i cleared 5 rooms and have never had one in long dungeons.  Makes everything you provision for exept torches a gamble.\n\nBut all that RNG is in the spirit of a dungeon crawler like this.  My real issue with the game is the late game grind.  In my experiance it takes 11 sucessful runs to get a hero to level 6, on top of that you will likely need to rest a hero at least once between runs to reduce stress, cure diseases, and purge negitive perks, you can only do 1 of these at a time and they all cost increasing ammonts of gold as you level up.  You also need to upgrade, linearly, a heros skills, armor, and weapons. I would love to see what ammount of money i put into my A-team members, a wild guess would put the number in the neighborhood of around 70,000 each.  And considering the most money i have ever pulled from a dungeon was around 25k means losing 1 or 2 of them like I did on a hard boss makes me quit the game because i am unwilling to grind out the multiple hours of repeditive gampleay needed to replace them.\n\nI still play the game in short sessions now but i seriously doubt i will ever have enough time or energy to finish it.  There is a core of a good game here that is padded out unnessaraly to the point that (as of now) only 0.4% of people have finished it (according to achievments) and only 0.2% of people have completed without changing any of the settings to make the game easier.","February 19","false","48.3"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","0"

Then this is the game for you.  I can't even focus on enjoying the game because I'm constantly having to manage all the stress, diseases, and negative quarks the game throws at you.  95% of the books and chests result in negative stats.

I had a warrior gain 100+ stress in one random battle and die of a heart attack 5 minutes into a level.  If you manage to make it out alive, you have to send all of your warriors with high stress (so basically all of them) on to stress relief hubs, where you have to pay extremely hefty fees and lose them for the next round.  Then you run out of money and cannot buy food and torchs, so you're forced to go into the level with base stat recruits with no money, food, or torches.  Sould like fun yet?

It makes you wonder why fully priced AAA titles can't be as polished as this game is right now, but I digress.\n\nThis is a game as much about party management as it is exploring dungeons. The more you use each member of your pary, the more stress they gain, gain enough and they're unusable until you remove it. This forces you to use a wide varity or party members, running the same random generated dungeon doing different quests to get rewards.\n\nThis is not a game for those who want something light and fun. You'll lose party members (permadeath), you constantly have to balance each members positive ance negative attributes, watch their stress and weigh weather continuing with almost no health and dying is better than escaping early and putting one or more of your party into a fully stressed state, not to mention watching your supplies.\n\nThis is not an easy game, but it is damn fun and well worth the investment if you're up to the challenge.  Seriously, even if you're against buying games in Early Access, this is one of those rare exceptions where what you're getting is already getting enough content to call this a complete game by many peoples standards.\n\nEDIT; In the interest of fairness, there is one aspect of the game pertaining to combat that I dislike greatly. That is how your party will get rearranged if suprised. It's an annoyance since you need to spend turns getting people back into position where they're most effective.","March 16, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Darkest Dungeon is one of those games that's simple to grasp the basics of but difficult to master - add in the randomly generated dungeons and you have a recipe for instant chaos for the unwary.  I hesitated when buying it at full price, but for a pre-released game it is suprisingly slick with very few bugs - running better than some fully released games!\n\nThe dark, lovecraftian story breeds an atmosphere that will get your own heart pounding as your heroes adventure deep into the dungeon.

I really like what the developers have done here and where the game has the potential to go with regards to its continued development, expansions and sequels. It's a hard dungeon-crawler, but it is not impossible to complete once you have an understanding of all the mechanics. I like the looting system. I like the tension the game builds as you become more and more attached to your characters. I like how your characters have distinct personality traits that actually impact gameplay. Basically, this game goes places that are beyond the limited brains of most committee-run, AAA game development companies.\n\nSo, Darkest Dungeon is a rogue-like (not rouge-like) dungeon crawler with great art design and excellent immersion. It is definitely worth the money. In actual fact, it is the best purchase I have made in a while. Bravo! Seriously, this game is worth it for $20!

That said, there are still some things I dislike about the game.\n\n1. The RNG can feel a little TOO RNG and doesn't feel like you can manipulate it enough in your favor early on.\n\n2. Buffs besides the Jester's Battle Ballad seem extremely underwhelming as you could just as easily deal more damage or keep yourself from taking more damage by attacking instead.\n\n3. The lock on lower level quests when a character hits level 3 kind of sucks. It makes sense that they did this since it keeps on from power leveling characters, but since there is no middle point between dungeon lvls 3 and 1 (i.e. lvl 2) it is a huge spike in difficulty especially if one does not yet have the money/resources to unlock and upgrade their skills, armor, and weapons to a high enough level. On the topic of powerleveling lower levels, it is an even bigger slap in the face since Dungeons get harder the more they are beaten. In turn, it is harder to level up new recruits and becomes almost impossible. While this is somewhat interesting and gives a psuedo time limit on how quickly you need to beat the game, it is also extremely annoying and makes you want to almost start all over again and just say ♥♥♥♥ IT to your current save file.\n\nSolution to 3: If they want to keep this kind of setup it would be nice if they had dungeons set up so that even though they do increase in difficulty, there will always be one apprentice mission available for lower level characters. This will allow new characters to be recruited and allow people to play with party compositions more without hurting the increasing difficulty of the game's dungeons overall.\n\nThese are my major gripes with the game. The rest of the game I find quite great besides a few minor things that will most likely either be tweaked or added to in the future.\n\nTL;DR This game is great besides a few things that will make you wanna flip a table.\n\n\nI will most likely update this review as the game gets updated and as I progress further in the game. I do enjoy this game deeply and have been looking for a turn based rpg like this for a while.

I got to week 19 before I ran out of cash after a couple of bad runs. I thoroughly enjoyed the games setting, mood, and mechanics.\n\nI eagerly started a 2nd run, and that's where things just went bad. I found myself failing on the first quest I set out on, before I had to restart a new game, and this happened at least 8 times before I packed it in. The game is HUGELY unbalanced at the moment, and is very reliant on luck.\n\nThe first quest you go on should ease you into the game. Now, while I understand this is an unforgiving roguelike, you need to at least be able to get your foot in the door before your good or bad decisions in the hamlet start affecting your survivability. On the first quest, you have no options, no chance to improve your party, you just get 4 guys and off you go.\n\nLiterally every first quest I've restarted since my first playthrough has been littered with misses, enemies dodging, whilst they constantly crit crit crit. At the end of the first quest, if I even made it that far, they were all maxed on stress and bleeding out. Back at the hamlet, you spend all your gold treating them, only able to take 2/3 people with you next run due to stress, and then die.\n\nAlso, why would it recommend on the provisions screen to take just food and torches, when on the first screen...the FIRST screen, I'm faced with 2 piles of rubble. No shovels! Great! That's 50% stress on all characters just after getting in to the dungeon!\n\nEventually I gave up. Today I tried another 2 playthroughs, but each time on the first mission, as badly as it went, I now started getting a crash error when walking near a lootable object which prevented me from proceeding. So never mind the RNG royally screwing you over constantly, now there's game ending bugs in it.\n\nThe game needs rebalancing hugely. I must have been very lucky my first playthrough, but since then, just extremely unlucky. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. When these game breaking bugs are fixed and the game actually gets balanced, it would be a very very enjoyable game indeed, but until then, based on how random the game is, it doesn't even allow you to play it, and cannot be recommended.\n\nImmensely disappointed.","May 7, 2015","false","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ardicus1/recommended/262060/","ardicus1","theguythatiam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ardicus1/","81 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWHY THIS GAME IS UNIQUE:\n\nI recently picked up Darkest Dungeon because it appealed to my inner masochist and fascination with the whole medieval/gothic atmosphere thing. As an avid veteran of Demon's Souls/Dark Souls series, I came into this game literally prepared to die, but mostly aware of the challenges I would probably face. I also knew that being in early access development, some mechanics may be a little off or missing altogether. That is why I was so surprised only a couple hours in by how engrossing and complete this dark world felt. Immediately, the narrator steals the scene, reminding me of something akin to running commentary in Bastion. This constant audio companion (voiced by Wayne June) comments on your adventure at nearly every turn, whether in town to tell you a random tidbit of lore, or in battle to convey the sense of the turning of the tide. It is exciting and easily the most unique aspect of this game. Honestly, this man was nearly enough to keep the whole game going on his own.\n\nEventually, though, the glaring problems arise, and they had me scratching my head as to why. The biggest enemy in Darkest Dungeon is not the end boss, the unpredictable fights and traps along the way, or the growing list of mental problems besieging your heroes. The biggest issue is gameplay balance during what you do most - fights. It is curious because these mathematical equations that they have in place are possibly the easiest thing about the game to fix because they are not design hurdles, but rather poor ratios and percentages that might be fixed in a patch. As a veteran of XCOM, I was prepared for the occasional "how is it possible to miss a shot at 97% three times in row?" However, Darkest Dungeon punishes the player, so much so that it actively forced me out of my initial fascination and into realizing that this is poor design by choice. You stop believing or even caring about this difficult world to live in because it turns into a Game of Thrones on steroids - a punishment just for punishment sake. You may realize this when you are fully prepared for an "easy" dungeon, just to see your crew ambushed and critical hit 3-4 times before you can do anything about it. Before you can even make a choice, half of your party is dead. That 2-3 hours you put into keeping those characters prepared and well-equipped destroyed by some meager random encounter. This is what you must be willing to face in Darkest Dungeon. No measure of preparation can save you, no measure of finesse. The sad state of balancing extends to the characters, whose abilities range from average to completely useless. Upgrading, leveling or any sense of progression here doesn't do much other than raise your chance to hit, something that the monsters in these "dark" dungeons have no problem doing.\n\nTo further exemplify my point that this is not just a small balance tweak, but a poor design choice, is the game's forcible handicap system. Even if you get stronger and finally, by chance, nurture your champ to the height of power they were meant to claim, and you go back to that dungeon that has kicked your ♥♥♥ time and time again - guess what? Your character is slightly too high a level and will refuse to accompany the rest of your team. "You cannot adapt and overcome," the game says, "you must die."\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIt is an active decision that is being made Darkest Dungeon - one that is so deranged that it simply is set to do one thing and one thing only - hurt you. In the end, a challenge that cannot be overcome, if only by chance, is not a challenge worth having. Indeed Darkest Dungeon is too dark and its forlorn estate not a place that will keep the attention of this weary adventurer.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe narrator, Wayne June, perfectly delivers the audio narrative and pacing in battle\nAtmosphere is tense and engrossing\nInitially sucks you in\nTurn-based system has potential\n\nCONS:\n\nBattle system is a game of roulette at its current state\nProgression is slow and mostly involves meaningless upgrades\nNavigation system in dungeons lack any meaningful plot events (missed opportunity)\nCurrent system forces you to play handicapped\nEnemies almost always hit you first, and they hit hard\nDifficulty balance issues\n\nYOU MIGHT LIKE THIS GAME IF YOU:\n\nEnjoy rogue-like games\nInterested in gothic, fantasy setting\nCan look past punishing difficulty and roulette-style gameplay\n","May 11, 2015","false","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The markers of heroes crowd the graveyard, many standing over empty earth, in memorial for champions left in the field. A few familiar faces remain. Brinon, a Hellion who has served me for almost a full year, as fierce as she is resolute in the face of madness. Papelion, a Crusader stricken by his trauma, yet still a mighty sword arm. They make their home in the guild house, become now an imposing keep, the hamlet's only bulwark against predation. The blacksmith is their armory, ringing day and night with the industry of our crusade. Even now, a party patrols the ruins, risking all to end the devilry of a Necromancer lurking there. The odds are dire. Many have sacrificed life or soul to aid me in my quest to cleanse my ancestral home. And while I do not take the field, sometimes I wonder... What has it cost me to send so many to their deaths?","February 27, 2015","true","125.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Many of the themes are very mature, to the point of being off-putting. (We're talking about blood, torture, prostitution, alcohol, gambling, etc.) While the way each of these is used adds to the overall atmosphere of degradation and mortality that really makes this game come alive, the disappointing thing is that this game plays so well and is so well put together that you would love to share it with everyone you know that likes videogames in your family. Be forewarned: This is not a family title, and you won't be able to play it in front of younger kids.\n\nPersonally, I myself find this game a little too graphic as an adult. And I'm not a huge fan of rogue-likes either. But as I stated a little while ago, this game uses these themes to make something that is unique and interesting. Besides these two complaints, I really can't find anything to dislike about the game. The artwork, sound, mechanics, the pace of the game, the goals, the obstacles and solutions, are all reminiscent of tabletop horror classics like Call of Cthulu, Werewolf: The Apocalypse and Vampire: The Masquerade. None of the negative mechanics feel fair or surmountable at first, but that's not the point; You're supposed to feel hopeless, fragile and overwhelmed in games like this. It makes you care about the outcome more knowing you can lose and that the consequences of your poor decisions are irreversible.\n\nThe game is centered around the idea that you're hiring mercenaries to dive dungeons in a doomed town where a prominent family is in need of them to reclaim their heirlooms. In exchange for cash and loot, the heroes agree to help recover the family valuables. You use these items to improve the services to and quality of the heroes that come there from abroad. While you can lose allies forever, you can easily replace them, and that makes these losses acceptable. Moreover, every character and class has things they're good and bad at even down to which of the class' abilities they start with, which makes you want to see more new heroes and take advantage of the ones you like once you can afford to equip them more thoroughly.\n\nAll in all, from the excellence of the plot, the depth of the combat and the beautiful presentation, Darkest Dungeon is undeniably a 10 out of 10 game. Nobody would expect to get an experience this complete with visuals and sound this spot-on from a team this small and underfunded. On top of all that, the price is fantastic. There's a ton of content here for $20. They did an excellent job, but just... This game just isn't my cup of tea. xD;\n\nUpdate: Did I mention this game is *hard*? This game is really really hard. If you like difficult games, saddle up. This is for you.","February 12, 2015","true","48.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Mostly it is just rubbish that just gets tossed out in an attempt to make lots of money. But this is one of my favourite games already. I've got to say if it hadn't said early access, I wouldn't have noticed. The game feels well thought out, solidly coded and bug free so far.\n\nI truely enjoy the gameplay and the difficulty. If you like turn based strategy combat, this game will be a great addition to your library. Having to juggle so many unavoidable things, such as resources, sanity and health. It is almost impossible to keep everyone in your party in the best conditions.\n\nControlling a ragtag group of adventurers through a dark and dangerous ruin is far from easy, but it is fun. Be warned, this game is not for the faint-hearted. The environment is against you, enemies are against you, and sometimes even your party is against you.\n\nHeartily recommend.","February 9, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It reminds me of the good days of my youth with a traditional turn based game. I've spent many an hour playing and building my favorite party and I get to relive that in Darkest Dungeon. Im a Lovecraft fan to, so the backstory and mythos of this game really draws me in as it is, not to mention the customization for each class/character and party combinations. The survival/camping section is great idea because it lets groups with less healing to recover a bit of health and stress but each member could possibly gain/grant a buff to someone. There are a variety of enemies as well with different strengths and weaknesses that keeps you minding party composition and abilities. If there ever was a turn based Dark Souls game, this is what i would picture it as.\nOne thing i would like to see different is a little bit deeper of item customization but in this type of game i do not know how the coding would work, but thats fine, its great as it is.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game and I would highly recomend it to any one who loves turn based horror and/or Lovecraftian games.","February 9, 2015","true","38.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Superbly polished, innovative, and complete enough to provide a real picture of a final product.\n\nAs of this writing the game is in a complete and playable state, but missing a few planned character classes, and two of the five dungeons.\n\nIt is relentless, unforgiving, and gripping. The game does not lie to you when it tells you that Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best of a bad situation. There are no save points. Your best adventurers will abandon you, or crack under pressure at the worst possible time. People will die. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, with an entire roster of skilled and meticulously set up adventurers you'll discover that your seasoned veterans are either too broken by the horrors they've seen, or too filled with pride to continue to casually stroll through the ease from whence they came.\n\nThere is a light at the end of the tunnel. It is within your power to leave those fetid halls at any time, forfeiting the rewards intended for the completion of your quest, but allowing you to keep what you've found during its execution. Should your army fall to darkness and madness, there is always a fresh supply of the wide eyed and eager arriving by coach to replenish your ranks at no cost but your own guilt.\n\nYou could have saved them. Most of them anyway. But you thought you could finish one more room. You thought it would all work out. You thought that a few thousand gold and a shiny trinket was worth the risk.\n\nYou were wrong. Those that you sacrificed on the altar of avarice and pride are commended to eternal sleep in your graveyard, and those that remain are broken by what they've seen.\n\nSo you send them to pray, or to drink, or you strap them down and attempt to stem the tide of insanity within the walls of your sanitarium. You replace the fallen and send them all further and deeper.\n\nThere is no game over. No real defeat. Not for you. You're simply the puppet master, and by the end you'll still be there, behind the stage, collecting the fee for this macabre theatre of the damned.\n\nAnd you'll do it from atop a pile of broken, warped, and unrecognizable puppets.","February 10, 2015","true","105.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's hard to believe the early access tag.\n\nThis game aims to keep the player in a perpetual state of discomfort. If you're looking to play an indestructible badass then stay away. Your party of heroes will be fighting in the dark, often bleeding and slowly losing their minds. As the game puts it "It's about making the best of a bad situation".\n\nThe classes feel unique and combat flows well. There's just enough numbers to give the system depth while trying to keep things simple. Debuffs are easy to understand and the importance of positioning quickly becomes apparent.\n\nThe game's not perfect by any means. The characters talk often and it wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't stop you from doing anything every time a dialog bubble pops up. My only other gripe is being subject to the randomness of available missions. Since specific mission rewards are needed for upgrades, not having any control is frustrating.\n\nThen again, the game is about making the best of bad situations.\n\nTL:DR Buy this game.

I love to be able to start from where i left off. I get emotionally attached to my characters and i like being the savior of the universe, with no help from some stinkin friends!!\n\nThat said, i love this game. Bought it yesterday and played it,non stop, for about 10 hours afterwards.\n\nThe only bug i have had so far is i got shorted on one trip into the dungeons and somehow only 3 characters showed up on a trip to kill one of the bosses or mini bosses. I thought after reading all the comments on the game that id be meat. Turns out  i  must have had a killer 3 party members(one lvl 1 2 lvl 2, unsure of the exact party makeup but def had a vestal for healing 2 of the 3 were def maxed on armor and 2nd lvl spells) I believe the boss was the necromancer. But with stuns, which i expected to fail half of the time, it was a pretty easy beatdown. (one hit would stun first 2 combatants) Im sure it was also combined with the luck i had in finding the boss in one of the fist 5 rooms.\n\nand so far, i am loving the gameplay, style, music, voiceovers and yes even the banter amuses me wholeheartedly.\n\nSure its rough at the start, but shouldnt all games be? Yes you have to run from battles and possibly give up on quests before your done with them and either retrain or party up your toons to get rid of stress/personality disorders you can accrue, and you WILL accrue A LOT of them if your not careful.\n\nSomeone likened it to an adventuerer simulator? Not a bad analogy. You can expand your roster(so far i have a pool of 13, 3 to choose from at any given time, but also can be expanded), build your city up to be able to get rid of personality traits that can cripple you in battles, releive stress after a dungeon crawl and build your abilities.\n\nI reccomend getting all the different classes and having fun with each, as they all have differing enough abilities that they all have SOME use, albeit, not all are as fun to use. (and im sure everyone has a favorite/least favorite class, which is what every game SHOULD have!)\n\nAt this point ive only "lost" 1 starting character and 1 character from stupidity of not running. Any other than the ones ive re-named for myself have been "let go" by me because of the playstyle or just not wanting to relieve their stress. ;)\n\nIve found if you have a deep roster of characters you like and some throwaways, you can run dungeons to stock up on cash and prizes while using said cash and prizes to upgrade your "mains".\n\nDo be aware once your mains hit a certain level they will not go back into beginner dungeons. (veteran 3 was when i found out that they refuse to go back into lvl 2 and 1 type dungeons) So if youll probably end up not using your mains when you hit up some of the bosses for the first few levels.\n\nI also realize im just scratching the surface of the game even after 10 hours of romping around dungeons, sometimes barely making it out alive, and sometimes..well not everyone makes it out.\n\nDo you have to pay attention? HELL YES.  Can it be frustrating? also HELL YES. Is it SUPER HARD? I wouldnt say so.\n\nIts a CHALLENGE, something that is sorely missed in alot of the AAA titles nowadays and i thank god we have a few indie devs that get that and make the games THEY want to make while hoping we as a community like it to.\n\nAnd for whatever reason this game just has "it" for me.","February 5, 2015","true","34.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's the one pitfall of this game; the difficulty actually seems okay.  It becomes ridiculously difficult, however, at random.

When those hits can count for half your characters' health... yeah.  This isn't "Dark Souls" difficulty, punishing you for being negligent.

I have not played the game heavily as of yet but definitely plan too in the future. This game allows you to actually show sympathy towards your heros, actually caring when your favourite character is on deaths door. Or when they cheer up the whole team with their amazing bard skills. Regardless this game made a brilliant first impression with its amazing looking hand-drawn art style and the narrations is top notch!\n\nThe game always keeps you on your feet and requires you to carefully think about your actions instead of mindlessly trying to take on bosses without carefully considering there move set and positioning. From personal experience I can say this game is both unforgiving and so rewarding at the same time. There have few occasions when my characters have died, but theese were to silly mistakes or being too confident and forgetting to bring a bandage.\n\nOverall, this game is outstanding for early acces and cant wait to play when fully released. The combat feels great and works well with the dark atmosphere of the game. But most of the time I have to admit you rely on the RNGesus for quite alot of deaths making some really unique and funny moments. :)","March 16, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well done Red Hook Studios!\n\nThe game is just what they said it would be; it's a game about doing the best you can, in a pissy situation. It's not going to be a perfect journey from start to finish, you will lose some of your most valued adventurers and you will be frustrated and angry. You will consider sacrificing a family member to RNGesus. But, if you're a masochist like me, you will press on... and on... and on.\n\nIt's a damn hard game. Some will argue that it's too random, and I can see their point. You will lose some battles because of bad RNG, that's the way it is. You will get some characters who are just better than the others because of RNG. RNG will screw you.\n\nBut to me, it's not unfair. It's part of what I signed up for. I personally like the feeling of not being in total control, not being able to predict just what will happen all the time. It's part of the theme of desperation, at least for me. Even though it feels personal, a lot of the times.\n\nThe game is absolutely beautiful, it has an atmosphere that few other games have ever matched. You are there, in the deep, dark and dangerous dungeons with your desperate adventurers, trying to stay alive. It's one of the few games where I still have the sound on, listening to the music and the narrator's voice as he tells me that I have once again lost an adventurer to madness...\n\nThe game does, however, come with a price, and that price is grinding. The game requires a lot of repetition to get anywhere, there's no denying that. And when the party you have invested the most in dies because of bad RNG or some other mistake, well, then you are punished twice: first by losing the party and then by realizing that you will need to grind your way back up again.\n\nThis can, and has, made me lose heart a couple of times.\n\nI've put the game on the shelf, only to pick it up a month or so later.\n\nBut I still love it though, and I can't wait what Red Hook Studios are gonna do next!","February 6, 2015","true","188.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Art direction and story for this game are top notch. What it all boils down to is cool edgy art, great tone, fair story and quality voice acting, on top of a 2d side scrolling dungeon crawl. Sort of like graphic rich side scrolling Rogue - no wait.... huh? Yeah if this was the 80's, this game would have blown my mind. Even as an app this game would be credible. No app yet.\n\nThe game is actually...predictable... Every time you enter combat you use your best skill - the first one - to out dmg the enemy (the game is simply about the combats, there is very little else to the game, a little bit of managing another HP counter for "madness" which essentially enables the monsters to take down your toons two ways instead of one). Yes its perma-death. But its not. You have a stable of toons to use so they are basicly just foder. At the end of the day gp/gippers/gold/money, is what's going to kill your game and make you restart. That's probably not going to happen if you play in beatstick mode.\n\nOn madness: its really just another resource. It acts like even worse hit points. You take madness from attacks and from being in the darkness and other spooky ♥♥♥♥. Only not only do you gain madnes points and eventually die from a heart attack, you get hard to remove character traits along the way. Yes you can have a TPK from madness and heart attacks. so like I said two hit point tracks both of which can kill you.\n\nThere is little to no synergy between the character powers. The nuanced powers - bleed, blight, all the fun little tricks, are less effective, than simply using each character's first direct dmg skill. With the possible exception of stun. As a result the game is extremely... predictable..? Pretty but simplistic. Oh and random, its got a survival shtick going on, and the randomness is meant to be something you manage ... but the gameplay feels too random and chaotic. Player agency is apparently very low, UNLESS you just use your beatstick pwr ..in which case ... no actually player agency is very low.\n\nWhat could have been the interesting part of combat, the synergies and combos, are unfortunately lackluster, when compared to outright beatstick powers. Instead as it stands the game could nearly play on autopilot. Beatsticks + Heals wash, rinse, repeat. Go old school!!! Or not ....\n\nThe strategic resource management is ham fisted and basic - you have to provision your expedition, and any provisions mysteriously evaporate on successful mission completion, with no return or refund. Its not flavourful, it just looks like a programing error they turned into a "feature'. There is little in the way of actual real, exploration, logistics or strategy over long term in the game.\n\nThis would make a fun pen and papper rpg, or maybe a smart phone app. as a PC app its lackluster.","August 28, 2015","false","17.8"," 30 of 57 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","30","57","2","5"

It was brutal at first, even daunting and futile until you get your ♥♥♥ whipped enough to realize it's not just the game being complex and difficult - it's you failing to learn and pay attention to the finer mechanics involved. From the specific text dialog in interactive prompts that give you a hint, to the varying degrees of provisions, management, and enemies you may encounter. Monsters and bosses scale and change with dungeon progression, as do the workings that govern and inhabit each of these places.\n\nIf there is ONE game that has done replayability correctly, it's this one. There are so many variables to take into account at every turn of this game that it's never the same, and there is always something new to experience and learn.\n\nI will say that there is A LOT of management involved if you are going to play this game 'correctly'. Every aspect of this game has things you may CHOOSE to manage and take into account. You can do the basic necissities, but you're going to feel the burn when you took your Plague Doctor with 4 bad quirks related to the dungeon you just entered, and you didn't have enough money for a satisfying quantity of both torches and shovels. Or completely forgetting that you can change  skills while you camp, and abilities when you're out of combat before a crucial fight. There is much to cover if you want to consistently maximize your effectiveness at every stage; alot but never too much. An important and well struck balance in roguelikes.\n\nThis game will test your wits, and challenge your attentiveness with: money, hero, and ability managamenet, limited inventory space, hero stress and health, trinkets, virtues and quirks which effect stats positively and negatively respectively. The list goes on and on. The more you play, the more you learn to manage if you want to stay one small step ahead of the challenges in this game.\n\nIt's exhilerating. When you do things right and keep up with the learning curve it's a great feeling of triumph and understanding. You take that with you far enough until you foolishly bring two level 1's on a rank 3 dungeon and get your Legend Crusader sent to graveyard because you thought the game got easy all of a sudden.\n\nI could go on about this, but instead you should probably just buy and play this game and save me the time.\n\nCurrently this game in my mind stands as 9.5/10 and this is still early access, with 2 major content areas still to be added along with loads more features, and improvements. The art is great, the narrator is awesome and even though you hear him a lot it really never gets old. There are times in the game I swear the developer put in small hidden scripts that respond to certain optional choices you make.\n\nThis game is a ravenous evolving beast that wants you dead.","June 13, 2015","true","212.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

His boned shattered like so many dreams upon the club of a Pig man.\n\nNext was Raynauld. In his time praying at the Abbey, he had witnessed true horrors, and refused to return. His own mind betrayed him in the bowels of the Weald.\n\nNext up was a Leper that went by the name of DuFrask. Dufrask was everything anyone could want in a leader, save for his nasty habit of cheating while Gambling. He was Sturdy, and a seasoned Weald Explorer. In stressful situations, he would bend like the willow but cut deep like the bramble. He lead multiple fools through the depths of the abyssal caverns beneath the estate, many died, but many rose to glory.\n\nIn my hubris, I told DuFrask that he would be taking a regiment of men to face off against the Wizened Hag who'd taken up residence there. Much like the fools who still came to this town thinking they'd find anything but despair and death, I allowed myself a small portion of Hope. I see now that this was a mistake.\n\nDuFrask was accompanied by two other veterans of the caverns; Laci the Jester and Millith, a Vestal, as well as a newer edition to my regiment of explorers, Holland, a Bounty Hunter of few words.\n\nTo make a long story short; it was a nightmare.\n\nMillith was killed almost as soon as we'd stepped foot in the dungeon. Like the fool I was, blinded by my own pride in my best warrior, I pushed on, ignoring the warning Millith had given us with her death, "We are all doomed!" Without healing, Laci was soon to follow the Vestal's example.\n\nDuFrask and Holland pushed on into the dungeon, but we never did find the hag. DuFrask was slaughtered by the repeated assault of several corpses, leaving only the Bounty Hunter standing after all was said and done.\n\nWith no foreseeable chance of victory, I pulled Holland out and we returned to our dreary home above. He cloistered himself soon after that, and I did not hear from him for a week. When he finally returned to me, he was a changed man. This dungeon, it does not simply end when you leave its blackened halls. The darkness, the suffering, the pure malice of it stays with you, haunts you.

Here's the thing: You're going to lose or suffer horrible setbacks. That's pretty non-negotiable. However, the game is seemingly made entirely around that concept and it works. Under ideal circumstances it really feels like you're walking on thin ice and at any given moment it can break. Then, one of your 4-member Dungeon crawling group goes temporarily insane and every action you can possibly take seems to have negative and dire consquences - and it's equal parts crushing, hilarious and entertaining while it happens.\n\nVery quickly you will need to let go of any "perfect gameplay" style of gaming here. Even leveling up can bring negative quirks. Every magic item in the  game has a bonus but also a drawback aspect to it. While many games start out easier and get harder as they go along, Darkest Dungeon seems to take the opposite direction, although so far I'd never say it gets "easy", it simply goes from your adventures almost always ending with someone dead or crippled to a situation where now and again you can scrape by. Victories are rare but all the more sweet for the rareness.\n\nIt's hard not to love this game.\n\nAlso, while it is a work in progress, much of the foundation appears to be laid.

Purge the realm of undead, tentacle monsters, spiders, bloodthirsty brigands, and cultists, or just go insane.\n\nCan be more unforgiving than Hand of Fate. Where that was a game about building up your singular hero in a relaxing, tavern-esque adventuring tale, Darkest Dungeons is more about resisting entropy--knowing to recognize when your group is headed the way of a complete nervous breakdown, while facing a dungeon's monstrosities.\n\nThe combat is Turn-based, but with a unique system of class and position management, and a stress system that will utterly destroy the cohesion of your group if you're not wary. This would almost make for a horror game, if it weren't mildly humorous, and tactically-minded. Each of the different class characters will eventually go paranoid, steal from the party, become masochistic pain-freaks (the plague doctors in particular remind me of the TF2 medic, if they take enough physical abuse), or start hallucinating calls to action from their God, that make your entire party come alive in a random, somewhat prefab, but nonetheless characteristic way.\n\nOf particular note, I enjoyed the resting mechanic, which basically lets you pick a good time to rally the party with food and firelight, and offers a number of abilities each class can use to maintain the party's cohesion. For instance, if you're carrying a leper, you can have him considerately confine himself from the rest of the group, at his own expense, to help reduce the team's stress. Or, you could just have him lift his mask and get some physical relief, putting everyone off. The crusader gives pious rants, the barbarian can curse and swear for personal relief at other's expense, the rogue can scout for monsters, the priest can say a prayer for everyone or put up a protective ward around the camp.\n\nResting almost becomes like its own recovery-based combat round, and the varied options for each class felt fresh and neat. It puts cRPGs to absolute shame, with their rest-spamming cutscene to forget all the party's wear and tear in one instance. (Obsidian and Bioware could take a page from these devs.)\n\nThe soundtrack isn't anything unforgettable, but like Monaco, the music conjures elements of tension, fitting your gamestate. Unlike that game's ragtime jingles though, in Darkest Dungeon, when you're on a mission, you get tense metal, percussion, and ambient noise that intensifies the closer your torch comes to sputtering into total darkness. Of especially horrific note, is a sewer/catacombs themed level, filled with emaciated pigmen to put Amnesia to shame. When things go pitch black, the soundtrack fills with the echo of their distant squeals. It's a fantastically chilling touch. Meanwhile, your narrator, in the spirit of Cthuulhu callback games like Eternal Darkness--is a dead ancestor with an ominous voice like an evil Don LaFontaine, egging you on with encouragements, and grimly announcing your stumbles into starvation or  mortal injury.\n\nThe game has a nagging issue with difficulty, in a similar sense to X-Com: Enemy Unknown, in that you'll be dealt a starting tutorial prefab that gets you utterly ♥♥♥♥ed the first few times you play. In particular, your starting crusader always has Kleptomania, and will often deprive you of loot you try to scavenge, until you take him to the Sanitarium--a facility that doesn't unlock for you for a few adventures.\n\nAdditionally, you do not gain access to a balanced assortment of classes all the time, and there's definitely an ongoing resource-climb that you can fail, if you spend too much on the wrong things. I would compare it to luck rolling underground steam vents and UFOs in the resource-management portion of Enemy Unknown--a bit of a merciless crapshoot that might demand you scum the whole game.\n\nAll in all, Darkest Dungeons captures the bleakness of Lovecraftian horror in a fun little procedurally generated, resource-gathering dungeon crawl. The kind that takes breaks in the style of X-Com or Patapon, but reminds you that starvation or defeat is only a few bad moves away, nonetheless. Enjoy it if you like that kind of thing. I did.","April 7, 2015","true","44.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is what I wanted Rogue Legacy to be.  The RNG can be brutal, but if you put lots of your focus into upgrading your town, if you wipe you always have the option of raising up new heroes, now with a bit easier time of it.  For my run, it never felt TOO hard, though things can turn on a dime in battle.\n\nLots of variety baked in:  each character class has enough skills to let you play them at least 2-3 different ways.  Items which will up one stat while reducing another.  The various advantages and disadvantages can lead to a sort of grooming game with your characters:  which disadvantages are relatively harmless and which ones do you really need to spend time/money to get rid of?  Armor and weapons are a straight upgrade system, and you can upgrade skills as well.  That said, don't get attached to any characters.\n\nGreat visuals, great sound effects.  Great game.

The atmosphere and narration really do a great job at bringing you into the world.  I like the combat , but accuracy is a little too low for my liking as more often than not, my party members are just swinging at air, but thats probably just bad luck on my end.  One thing I would like to see is the ability to throw out members that losing their mind.  This would allow the rest of your party members not to be dragged down by a few unlucky crits or focused fire from the enemy causing one of your characters to go insane in barely the second area of a dungeon.  I think this would be fine as you would lose a party member for the rest of the quest and that should be enough of a disadvantage in exhance for saving stress for the others.\n\nAll in all, I recommend people play this game, It really is good even if rage inducing difficult at times :D.","February 6, 2015","true","21.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Team management requires timing (who rests for how long and where) and attention to resources, as well as a fine awareness of each character's perks and disabilities (which evolve over the course of the game).  The Lovecraftian dungeon exploration theme is wrapped in Mignola-esque, heavily inked art and set to a dark, oppressive soundtrack.

She proved to be an invaluble member of the team she worked with. Her skill in alchemy was unrivaled, and even the mightiest foes quivered at how she killed her opponents: making the enemy ill, and cutting them down if the other members of the party didn't do it before her. The team was glad to have her with them.\n\nBut even the best fighters are not invincible.\n\nDuring one fateful expedition, the plague doctor was poisoned to death...a truly ironic fate, indeed. Her team was devestated. A fellow teammate, Dismas, lost all hope. He resorted to drinking, made even worse since he was a known cheat at gambling. The bottle was his only friend until he finally accepted that his friend was gone, and she was never coming back.\n\nThe party has never been the same since. However, the people she worked for still carries on her legacy. They will finish what they started...for Pancevolt...."\n\nYou'd probably think the above is a sob story I made up, but this actually happened to me in the game. Expect the same kind of thing to happen to you during your playthrough, as it is pretty much unavoidable given the game's unforgiving nature. Think of it as the Dark Souls of turn-based dungeon crawlers; except all deaths are final. Any sort of small mistake can potentially screw you over; especially when your fighters can actually go insane is they become too stressed, or even straight up have a heart attack if it goes too far beyond that.\n\nThis game will kick your ♥♥♥. It will not apologize. It will even keep a graveyard with a list of those who have died. I often have to abandon missions because I fear for the lives of those I put in the party.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ing love it for that.\n\nIf you don't like difficult games, don't bother with this one. For those of you like a challenge, however, you should AT LEAST try this game. I can guarantee you will not regret it, unlike the countless expeditions you will go on where party members will inevitably die trying to reach their objective. If you're a hardcore gamer like myself, or even casual gamers that may want to test their dungeon crawling skills, I cannot recommend this one enough.","June 3, 2015","true","21.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Putting your adventurers into the brothel to recover stress is amusing, leveling up that same brothel to level 10 is NOT fun or enjoyable in ANY way. You have to level up EVERYTHING in this game. The town buildings, the skills, weapons and armor of your adventurers. And all of those upgrades are just small improvements of basic numbers. After the initial phase of the game, which is very enjoyable, these treadmill mechanics kick in, and advancing in the game just feels like a hassle.\n\nIt saddens me that would these mechanics be stripped out, the game would probably be amazing. The treadmill adds nothing to the gameplay and atmosphere, it undermines these at several fronts. While fighting for the life of your adventures can be tense and fun if you're into this sort of gameplay, losing leveled up characters to RNG is NOT fun. Because this event again demands more farming of you to level up a new character... ugh. No respect for a player's time.\n\nTo further illustriate my point, let us compare to another roguelike-like game beloved by me and many - FTL: Faster than Light. In FTL the game is structured in 'runs' which last up to an hour at the most. Each of these runs is unique, and nothing is carried over into the next game (except unlocking new ships). This means that the gameplay is intense and it is all about about achieving things within THIS run. Nothing is there to be farmed.

I like the concept, I like the premise, I love the art, I like a lot of the gameplay, but I really can't reconcile with how heavily RNG factors in. I've lost characters because they refused to be healed while they were on death's door. That's a special kind of unfairness that you have to be actively searching for in a game to find enjoyable.

A videogame is meant to be enjoyable and fun, but apparently nobody at Red Hook Studios was informed of ths. Every design decision seems to have been purposefully made to irritate, annoy and take the fun out of playing it. There is absolutely no enjoyment whatsoever to be had in this game, and this comes down to every element of the game being either mostly or entirely outside of your control.  Almost everything in this game is arbitrary. Random dice rolls are quite clearly rigged to favour good results for the enemy and bad results for you, and systems that supposedly work on fixed numbers cheat to produce unfavourable outcomes seemingly on a whim.\n\nThe money spent to keep party members alive and sane outside of missions is inexpicably subtracted from the same pool from which you need to purchase supplies to keep them alive and sane during missions, and money, supplies and upgrade resources are never numerous enough to allow you to make any real progress except by sheer, blind luck (and don't expect that to ever come at a time when it might genuinely help you). Stress accumulates extremely quickly and can instantly kill your heroes even if you keep their health topped up. Enemy dodge rolls seem insanely slanted as compared to how often your own characters are able to do it. The items required to cure damage-over-time effects are insanely expensive compared to the average income of a mission and the maintenance costs of your characters.\n\nThe game also crashes randomly with little explanation.\n\nEvery single one of these issues confront you within the first twenty minutes of the game. You will not complete this game. You will not enjoy a single moment of playing it. Spend your money somewher else. If you have under 120 minutes of play, demand the refund that Steam promises you. This game does not deserve your custom.","December 16, 2015","false","4.7"," 59 of 114 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","59","114","7","0"

With some games, the added difficulty makes the overall experience more enjoyable and makes victory feel rewarding. This game however, is difficult just to be difficult. It doesn't matter how well you prepare, your team could get wiped out in battles you should have won handidly because the enemy managed to crit your healer three times in a row. Speaking of RNG, the RNG in this game is bull****. Attacks that have a 100% accuracy rating miss fairly frequently, it's like the actual accuracy rating is 30% less than what they tell you it is. I know this happens a lot with other games that have RNG (Hello X-COM) but no other game has infuriated me quite like Darkest Dungeon has.

The game itself is great, but the developers are rockstars. Frequent updates, problems quickly addressed, community input is considered but doesn't stop them realizing their vision. So what is that vision?\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game about stress, glory, and adventure. Your goal is to reclaim this manor from the horrors discovered below it. And you will do so with pure management, dungeon diving, and perhaps a few trips to the brothel, pub, church, and asylum. You will care about your adventurers, because only so many will consistently gain good traits. You will care more becasue any worth keeping will need care to have bad traits removed and stress reduced. You will still care about losing bad adventurers because you need every one in a run to have a shot at getting the loot at the end.\n\nThe game is RNG heavy, and it gets some bad press for it, but don't listen to the whiners, just do your research beforehand to see if it is for you. Any game with rogue-like or rogue-lite elements has RNG elements, and any game with RNG elements is about overcoming adversity. Just keep in mind this isn't a linear game with a carved out path and progression curve. This is a game that will try to kill you(r adventurers,) and you will try to conquer it. Sometimes this can result in a bit of tedium or grind, so don't be afraid to mix up your playstyle.\n\nThe enemies are varied and fun to deal with. Some are very stressful as they are currently, but again, that's a PART of the fun of a game like this. You will still see the same mobs a lot, but it's like meeting an old friend, the fun sticks because of having to deal with them in different combinations and formations. Also, you can be surprised and have your party shuffled about, and they could be surprised and you get a free turn. So this game likes to encourage mixing things up, experimenting, and at its core, is very much a management game, but still seamlessly blends in dungeon crawling, and rather beautifully at that.\n\nThe art style is refreshing and fun, for me. I love the aesthetic, and between it and the sounds, it sets the tone well. It's not lavish, it's not hyper-detailed, and it isn't supposed to be. It's supposed to be vague and dark. One thing I can say though, is if the screenshots don't impress you, there's a chance the art will still work its magic on you while playing. The little bit of motion, the way everything ties together, and the feelings associated with trudging through the dungeons personally can add a lot of impact.\n\nThis game has depth, accessibility, polish, great devs, good art, and great sound. It's a wonderful offering, even with a few shortcomings or the stress of RNG, and I wouldn't be surprised if the devs address that, too.\n\nThe best part is, while what's there is so well put together, there's still more to come!","March 5, 2015","true","23.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","6"

But the main problem is that the every high level "unfortunate event" of that type has the only consequence - more boring repetitive grind in leveling up another hero from 1 to 6. This game in its core is just the same old poorly designed RPG with the only way to victory - through tedious, boring, and repetitive grinding of the same content.

The stress mechanics alone are enough to make the game stand out from its predecessors, but the game goes a step further with interesting line combat mechanics and customization options which serve to distinguish the game from any others like it.  The game drips with atmosphere from the outstanding artwork to the enriching, if at times sesquipedalian, narration.\n\nI feel the game stands out for its emphasis on resourcefulness.  Due to the randomness of recruitment, character trait assignment and dungeon generation, it's extraordinarily rare to put together an optimal party for all situations.  There are times where your primary healer will be nursing her paranoia in a tavern, or you'll design a team to defeat a boss only to have it ripped apart by an unfortunate monster spawn.

As a result, you often find yourself assembling teams and kits which aren't great for any situation, but are good enough for every situation, and therein lies the beauty as you tend to scrape by tough encounters more often than dominate them, making those encounters memorable and engaging.\n\nMy critique in its current form are tied with the volume of information you must keep track of.  Each character in your group may possess as many as 10 traits, both positive and negative (and might have some diseases on top of that) which can have various impacts on their abilities.  These traits will also change over time after each successful dungeon run.  Add onto that having to manage equipment, skill and camping skill layouts for numerous party members and it can be a bit daunting to remember what role each character plays in your group and which dungeons they would best serve in.  Consequently, at least for me, most of this information ends up being ignored.\n\nThere is some commotion over the new mechanics introduced by Red Hook, but I personally feel the game has continuously improved over the course of its time since its beta release.  To cover some of the more recent changes, corpses present another opportunity cost question to your party (should I scrap a more general purpose ability for one that's not as useful, but clears corpses) while heart attacks further test your risk/reward assessment abilities.  Increased PROT for monsters adds value to blight/bleed effects, which themselves require planning around as enemies might be more resistant to one or the other.  I do not endorse early access games by in large, but I will endorse this game.  If you are looking for a dark, unforgiving game that tests your resourcefulness and willingness to take dangerous risks for the promise of substancial rewards, purchase this game immediately.  For $19.99, you are getting an exceptional bargain for the entertainment you'll get with this title.\n\nAs a bonus, the game's narrator will also likely improve your vocabulary.","August 22, 2015","true","67.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

You and your characters travel through an atmospheric world that perfectly captures the feeling of despondence felt by the towns folk and your long suffering party members. The upgrade system in the game is scaled very well and the enemies are also well suited to keep you and your characters in check as you go up in level. Balancing stress and health, especially when camping, is an important part of the game and really gets you invested as some enemies attack physically and others make your characters really feel the psychological strain of the quest. The enemy types are also quite varied so each new attack feels interesting as you plunge through the depressing landscapes.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum it is sometimes hard to keep track of your characters. There were several times in the game where I tossed high stress individuals into my party because I didn't notice they were already at 100 but I do blame that more on my own inattention than the game itself. I also find myself getting angry at the characters when they fail a saving throw, again, it's an important part of the game and it does really well in making you think about human nature and all but the 3rd time your Hound Master becomes Selfish and steals 2500 worth of loot you're going to wish you could order your highwayman to shoot him. There are also a few bugs for me but it is in early access so I'm not worried, they go away when I restart the game(which takes about 1.5 minutes).\n\nAll in all I thought it was a great game! Sorry for my disjointed ramble, hope it helps you decide if you want to buy the game!\n","August 24, 2015","true","52.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I adore turn based rpgs like this one and darkest dungeon does everything right when it comes to the cobat and the insanity system. The attacks and the limited position for attacks and hits give this game a great deal of stratagy. The hamlet is another strong point in the game the variety of skills and upgrades that can be unlocked, and the sanitarium, tavern, and chaple give a indepth feel to the game and the insanity system. You can choose what type of attacks and abilites that you want your team of four to have and customize them to fit together. However there are a few misteps that have to be disscused. The leveling system is frustragting at best  but more often it is a detrement to the game. It is not frustrating because the game is hard or that you will often lose characters, this is part of the fun and challange of the game. The problem is that at level 3 and level 5 your character will be locked of from doing other low level quests. My evample of this was i was training my team to be able to fight the Necromancers apprentice  boss, after finishing the last dungeon my crusader and bounty hunter leveled up to level 3 and thus refused to fight the boss. It does not seem fair that the game wants you to become good with your stratagy to keep people alive and sain but then they will take them away. Clearly this was to keep grinding with a good team to a minimum but since the rewards for the quest are quite small and the levels only unlock more expencive upgrades it seems like this is a mistep. This is one of the only major problems for a game that is still only in early access which is quite a possitive statment given how poor more early access games are. It is hard for me to rate this game  I personaly would give this game a 9 out of 10 but i think that a more realistic score would be 7 out of ten. If you like rpgs you will love this game, if you like a challange you will love this game, if you like stagigic planning for battles you will love this game. if not you will find the game a frustrating grind that then punishes you for succeding. All and all i would highly recomend this game.","August 25, 2015","true","30.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

To me, the pleasure of a game is figuring out strategies to overcome challenging situations, rather than relying on luck from a random number generator.\n\nEven with the nerfs to your characters and the power boosts to the enemies, the game is still manageable and is not nearly as difficult as you might be lead to believe based on the reviews of other gamers on here.\n\nHowever, the game gets boring because of the lack of customization for the characters.  There aren't any special armors or weapons to find.  You simply have generic upgrades, so when going on your quests/missions, there isn't really anything too exciting that you will ever find.  It just the the same old gold, and items that help you unlock generic upgrades.  There are "trinkets," but these are nothing to write home about, and are also generic.  You will get multiple copies of the same useless trinkets.\n\nThe bosses can be cool, but it seems like the developers got lazy.  Rather than making new bosses, they just re-used the old bosses, but made them tougher.  So you have to fight necromancer level 1, level 2, and level 3.  This just adds to the lack of excitement.\n\nI guess I get a certain level of satisfaction successfully going through this game while having only minimal causalties when I read how so many others are frustrated and can't seem to figure how to achieve consistent success.  However, this minor joy is not enough to keep me coming back for more.\n\nIn summary, the game a lot more content (far more than it will ever have) in order for this game to be noteworthy.  Will you enjoy the game for the first 40 hours or so?  Probably.  Then you will realize that you are tired of going through the same process over and over again without any hope of a unique reward.  I am hopeful that someone out there will create a mod which makes the game a lot better.","November 7, 2015","false","141.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

I've logged many hours myself, but I still find the game tricky to recommend. It's a really a "you'll like it if..." kind of game.\n\nWhat draws me to the game is its artwork and atmosphere, as well as the strategy and tactics of managing a team of characters. The aesthetics in particular are fantastic! Very inventive and compelling dark fantasy stuff. And there isn't exactly an abundance of turn-based team management games, either. Both strong factors for the game.\n\nHowever, Darkest Dungeon has abundant frustration, and not just the challenge-based or stress-based frustration you would expect, but sheer irritation due to the way many of the otherwise clever game mechanics have been executed in practice.\n\nThe root cause of that frustration seems to be that the game's designers are incredibly paranoid that the player won't play the game 'correctly'. It really can give you the feeling of a judgmental game designer hovering over your shoulder, telling you that you're doing it wrong.\n\n\n-You shouldn't extend a fight against a weak enemy in order to have extra turns to heal your weakened heroes. If you do, your heroes will say some nonsense about "inviting danger" and get stressed out! (the newest patch has made that REALLY obnoxious)\n\n-You shouldn't set up a control-heavy team where you try to keep dangerous enemies stunned. After something is stunned it gains magical, inexplicable resistance to being stunned again. (Plus your heroes will get bonus stress from the previous issue, because you'll take too long to finish fights.)\n\n-You can't grind out easier levels with your best heroes in an effort to afford upgrades, now that everything costs an arm and a leg. Heroes of a high enough level will refuse to go on easier missions. Still gotta grind a lot, but it'll always require you to be careful!\n\n-You shouldn't put together a team that focuses solely on killing the front two enemies quickly, because there are corpses that block your way. Attacking the corpses to clear them out of the way doesn't count as proactive behavior anymore either, so your heroes will again get stressed out as if you were intentionally trying to delay the fight.\n\n\nFrustratingly, none of that makes any sense in practical or thematic terms for the game's dark fantasy world.\n\nSo, the game has the awesome and rare core design of being a dark fantasy team management game, but seems to be designed by someone who's absolutely paranoid that you will Play It The Wrong Way.

No you just wait and wait watching the enemy attack while your party members freak out and skip their turns because they dont like scurry monsters. I would think a Crusading Knight or a Murderous Highwayman wouldnt be affraid of little slug things or skeltons.\n\nHow ever beautful and interesting it is i just dont find it a fun game. Its more like a sim of watching fail adventurers suck at DnD.\n\nUPDATE- Spent over 3 more hours, had lots of fun building a strong team of a healer, 2 gunmen and a crusader, fought through 3-4 dungeons using good tactics and won each battle, had a few close calls but i was ok, made it to the first boss and it ruined the game.\n\nThe Wizened Hag, first turn she put my knight into a boiling pot instantly, the pot damages the hero inside every turn, not round, after each unit move, and she gets a turn after every pot breaks and after each of your turns, she spams area attacks that never miss, and 9/10 my attacks missed, also causes over 20-30 stress per attack, when a hero is not in the pot it is indestrucible and makes melee attacks vs her blocked.\n\nShe killed one of my guys after haver 4 attacks in a row against me, i quit the fight finally after 3 failed attempts and i quit the game period, until they nerf the AI in many ways and make the fighting fair i cannot recommend this game, it is annoying, unfair, and overall very boring once you get spammed by enemies.\n\nUpdate: Nothing much has changed in the last week, still gameplay that is completely random and unfair, you still spend 80% of the game watching the enemy attack you and spam area attacks, still needs loads of balance work and refinement of the gameplay.\n\nAdd- 8/15/2015\nNew updates, same errors, just fought the wizened hag again, fight went well got her down to 20 health out of 66 with 2 highway men, 1 arbelest and 1 hellion when she dumped the hellion out of the pot at deathsdoor then istantly put 1 highwayman into the pot THEN Seasoned the hellion and instantly killed her,  then spew the highwayman out to deaths door, then took the other highwayman into the pot, THEN i got to attack, but none of the 2 could hit her, expect the highwaymans tracking shot for 3 dmg, then she AoE attacked and killed those 2 and i lost just like that.\n\nIn summary the game has such amazing art, sound and setting but it suffers from boring and repetitive fighting, horrible RNG , unfair inbalances, and tedious and time wasting animations and dialauges that interupt the flow of the game and literally prevent player actions. I do not recomend this game to anyone until it gets a major gameplay overhaul.","March 10, 2015","false","47.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

This game in my short time I had with it had me wanting to come back for more. The game is quite creative with it's combat system in the way that after so many times your party comes close to death their mind is tested in which their mind will either snap or they will be heroic and reward your roster with buffs; or if their mind snaps it will cause some debuff to that character such as paranoia or selfishness. That system alone had this game sticking as unique in my mind. As for the rest i'm just going to do a quick Pros/Cons list.\nPros:\n1-Creative Combat System\n2-Unique Art Style\n3-Great Environments and Ambience\n4-Good Voice acting\n5-Creative foes and Quests.\n6-Great Balance Combat and Exploration.\n7-Adds in Realistic Hunger elements to the Chaos\nCons:\n1- Game is buggy and tends to crash but fixes can be found, i personally had a glitch where it'd freeze at the hamlet screen n i'd have to wait for it to load and not respond then begin responding.\n2- hard for players new to rpgs or dont have previous expirience\n3- some deciscions you make due to the Randomness screw you over in ways you cant manage no matter what ^.^\nVerdict:\n9/10 - Amazing game but due to the bugs I had to lower it a notch however for an Early Access game it is superbly done and I would recommend this game to any of my friends.

Our food rations and torches are running low. The gurgling of our stomachs is only offset by the oppressive darkness surrounding us. Every step is another step towards either  death or hard fought victory. The Crusader has become abusive towards the rest of us and the Vestal has started stealing from the loot piles. The Crusader is beginning to wear on my patience and puts all of us on edge with his incessant insults and ridiculing.  I fear will we not even reach the wisened Hag at this rate. The Bounty Hunter has managed to keep his wits about him so far, though. We trudge from room to room battling all foes that appear in front of us. I have been poisoned by those damnable spitting spiders and we have no antivenom left. I manage to overcome the poison's effects by the time we reach the entrance to the Hag's room. We enter the room and the Hag immediately throws the Crusader in her stewpot. She then proceeds to bludgeon me with a meat tenderizer. I contemplate letting the Crusader die, but he is too valuable against tough and unholy foes.The hag throws frogs and eyeballs at the Vestal and calls it "seasoning the food". The Vestal is terribly unhappy about being pummeled by eyballs and dead frogs and finally cracks. She sobs, calling out to her god, begging him to save her from death. The Bounty Hunter marks the hag for death while I take aim and shoot her in the face. The Vestal tries to knock the stew pot over to save the Crusader and is eventually successful. The Crusader suffers some burns from the boiling stew but is otherwise intact. The Hag keeps bludgeoning us with that bloody tenderizing hammer. The Vestal is barely surviving and only because the Crusader keeps healing her. The Bounty hunter hacks at her with his axe dealing critical damage. I blast the hag in the face once more and the Crusader charges forward ramming his blade into her bloated body. She screams her death knell and we are showered in blood and riches. We make our way back to town laden with treasure and horror-filled minds.We were lucky to survive those infernal ruins. I spend the next week drinking to decompress while the Crusader buys hookers and the Vestal prays in the cathedral. The Bounty Hunter gets banned from both the brothel (for having...curious tastes) and the bar so we let him gamble to blow off steam. After the Vestal finishes her praying we send her to the sanitarium to be cured of her kleptomania. It's quite hard to steal loot when you're strapped to a bed, isn't it Vestal?"\n\nTLDR: Turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler with sanity, personality quirks, diseases, permadeath and other factors making it a pretty robust game for being in Early Access. It's very polished with no apparent bugs other than some grammatical errors and script showing on occasion.","February 3, 2015","true","84.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

Come to think of it, it would certainly be in my top 15 games of all time. But, before I sing this game any praises, I want to share my thoughts on some criticisms people bring up when talking about Darkest Dungeon and how I feel about gameplay in general. This is going to be a long one, but I just feel the need to talk about this in detail.\n\nMany people like to compare Darkest Dungeon to Dark Souls. And I think it is fair to a degree - both games have dark, brooding aesthetics and pose a significant challenge to the player, while having a steep learning curve. But I don't think the core principles of these games are alike. In Dark Souls, the player is in control all the time, the game will not offer you help, nor will it deliberately undermine your progress and make your life harder. There are no unknown variables either, as soon as you are comfortable with your character and know all the patterns, that's it, you will never lose if your mechanical execution is perfect.\n\nIt is not the case with Darkest Dungeon however. There is only so much you can do to succeed, but it is not entirely up to you. This is why a major component of the game is risk management. Since you can't outskill your enemies with perfect tactics when your party is at the brink of death, sometimes you just have to cut your losses and escape. This is a big part of getting good at Darkest Dungeon, learning when you should and, more importantly, shouldn't press on. To be fair, if you get good at this game, you will succeed at the overwhelming majority of your quests, but sometimes the game will destroy you. This is why I think an apt comparison would be online poker (an important distinction, because in ordinary poker there is a whole another level of mind games). You have to play smart and hedge your bets, if the odds are not in your favour, it isn't worth committing in many cases. Of course, there are times, when you have full house, but the game has straight flush. The thing about Darkest Dungeon however, it lets you stack the "deck" in your favor by effectively utilizing party combinations, properly equipping your characters, and using tactics to your advantage.\n\nWhy am I telling you this and why is it important? I feel like a lot of people go into game with false expectations, feeling that it's gonna be a Dark Souls experience to the letter and end up being disappointed or thinking they were misled. Which is often followed by criticizing the game for not being what it never supposed to be. The game does well what it was created to do and it never pretended it is something more than it is. So before you post an angry review, blaming "stupid RNG", remember that it was a part of the deal and you agreed to it. I think RNG is pretty well-tuned actually, fringe cases don't happen that often. Does RNG makes the game worse than similar games that don't rely on it? I don't think so, and the good thing is there is plenty of room for all kinds of games, with RNG or without it.\n\nNow, let's talk about the game being grindy. By nature, many games are grindy in one way or another, because all of them have some sort of gameplay loop. If you don't enjoy the loop itself or have no incentive to continue, you will be bored, and it is, of course, very subjective. I'm gonna be honest here, via gameplay means the game doesn't do a very good job of motivating you to keep playing. It doesn't make you feel empowered as you progress, nor does it let you essentially overpower the game by putting in time, like some RPG games that let you get the best equipment and faceroll through hordes of previously challenging enemies. What did it for me is that I actually enjoy said gameplay loop and the fact that the world of the game and the story intrigue me greatly, so I was very excited to uncover bits and pieces about it as I go.\n\nWith gameplay out of the way, it's time to talk about other things the game has to offer, and boy, it has to offer a lot. It is hard to me to separate from each other elements like music, visuals, sound design and story, because they work together so well. Yeah, let's call it presentation and it is mindblowingly good. If I had to name a game I played that nail its aesthetic and presentation the most, I'd name Darkest Dungeon in a heartbeat. The art in this game is great and consistently dark and depressing, enemy design is terrifying and intimidating, accompanied by wonderful sound design and music that gets progressively more intense as your torch runs out of steam. The story is intriguing and for the most part told by the narrator, voiced by one and only Wayne June. It is so ridiculously well-written and voiced that I'd dare to say that it is even better than narrators from games like Bastion and The Stanley Parable and believe me, it hurts to admit it, because I absolutely love Bastion and Rucks, but the Ancestor is just too good. Did I already tell you how well-written it is? Even if I did, it is worth mentioning twice. I don't know how they haven't tun out of pompous words to use, the writing is chock full of them. I wouldn't be surprised if a typical dinner at Red Hook consists of Oxford Paperback Thesaurus, a couple of entries form H. P. Lovecraft: The Complete Collection and for the dessert, a vintage Webster's Third New International Dictionary '61 (that was a good year).\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely recommend you to buy the game, unless you don't like challenging games, hate any degree of RNG in games or don't like playing games, unless they constantly motivate you to keep playing.\nMaybe this review is too long and nobody will read it or it will be downvoted into oblivion just because, I am happy I said whet I wanted to say.","January 24","true","95.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","11","20","6","0"

You blow through characters like cleenex and combat/sanity mechanics are just unpleasant. You just barely survived that fight? Well you're going to walk into literally invisible traps. Nothing you can do to avoid it. Oh, you have a good order for your characters? Well screw you! You get "surprised" and they change order for no reason. It will take you like 4 turns getting them repositioned during which you will be hammered by enemies. Just walking along minding your own business? Well people in your party just starts accumulating "stress" for no reason. Also, you can't use the healing abilities of your characters out of combat (for some inexplicable reason) and your one healing item - food - is basically garbage.\n\nOverall, this game is fine, but not really worth the money. It just isn't fun to play. The mood is great and the art is nice, but the deck is SO stacked against the player that you end up killing A LOT of your sprites which ruins any sense of accomplishment for the RPG mechanic.

I mean seriously, people are complaining because the classes like the leper, simultaneously in contention for the title of toughest tank and highest melee dps, doesn't also have a way to hit enemies in the back row.  He has a freaking ability that clears all corpses so that, with the exception of a few boss fights, you sometimes have to waste a single turn!  That's so unfair!!

Fight thru it and level new people. 9.3/10 Because of the constant NEGITIVE EFFECTS and not enough POSITIVE EFFECTS. Overall great tho :)\n\n\nEdit: Im starting to agree with all the other posts i have read. It was fun in the start. The challange is there. the good art is there. This game has alot going for it . BUT the constant NEGITIVE MODS and STRESS are fairly stupid .\n\nCoulda been a fun one , the reason i would not recommend at this point is blunt : Creaters of the game dont care about you :) they just pelt you NEGITIVE NEGITIVE NEGITIVE , making it hard to stay in the game and not GET REAL STRESS trying to keep you guys squared away. even my 3 best charecters all died after going INSANE due to STRESS.

There are so many different things to manage during battles that you can often find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of crap that your poor characters are having to deal with. Your health points are being smashed, bled and blighted away and all the while their sanity is fading to nothing which just makes the fight that much more difficult. You finally reach the end of a dungeon and give a sigh of relief that somehow you managed to make it out the other end...except it feels a lot more like luck than your own skill and perseverance that got you there.\n\nDarkest Dungeon presents itself as a game that is meant to be unfair, characters are supposed to die and become afflicted with various disorders and you're forced to find yourself in very difficult situations that there is no way out of other than to call it quits. Money is the main issue as no matter how many succesful dungeon runs you have you always seem to find yourself scrambling for cash and you spend a fortune getting your adventurers back into fighting shape, upgrading their skills and gear and providing enough provisions so that their run is not a complete failure. The game is difficult and challenging but not in a good way.\n\nBlight and bleed effects work very well against your adventurers but are next to useless against the enemy. It's better to just hammer away at then with your most damaging skills as depending on bleed or blight effects will just end up getting you killed. Stunning is occasionaly useful but not enough. Simply put there isn't much variety in how to win a fight, keep your team healed whilst the hard hitters smash away at the opponent and keep a jester around to buff or a plague doctor to stun.\n\nThe game itself is very pretty and the presentation of the game is brilliant. It's succesful in creating a sense of impending doom and hopelesness that you will inevitably feel at many times. The main problem of the game is that it's difficult for all the wrong reasons, no matter how many provisions you take or how much time you spend organising the right team you will still be forced to abandon quests and say goodbye to adventurers simply because the chaos of the game is unmanageable. There is a challenge and then there is Darkest Dungeon, if you enjoy being a punching bag then by all means pick this up otherwise you should probably just give it a miss.","August 28, 2015","false","15.9"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","2"

It's not a roguelike and it's more frustrating than fun.  There is very little editability to heroes, you can upgrade their abilities but all this does is lower the RNG essentially--they hit more frequently and do more damage or heal more/apply an effect more often.  Because of this, there is a massive illusion of customizibility but it's guised in the idea that a level 0 hero is different than a level 1 hero.\n\nThe really not fun part about this game is that skillful play is not rewarded and the signal to the player that what they're doing is effective or not is clouded by a serious roll of the dice in every fight.  Every fight you risk 1 member in your party screwing over everyone else, in every fight if the AI all decide to screw over 1 key person they die.\n\nAnd that's the real problem--anytime someone dies you're punished for it.  It costs around 5-6 missions in gold rewards just to fully upgrade / unlock the key things you want a hero to have.  So 1 small error, possibly one you have absolutely no idea exists yet, is punished to the maximum.  I find this incredibly poor game design.  The game would be signfiicantly more fun if characters were injured.\n\nEven more troubling is that killing hours of your time in a hero, how about those trinkets you equip that are vital as you move onward through the game?  Well if you get wiped or have to run from combat--you lose everything that was dropped as people die or you simply don't have inventory space to hold.\n\nI really want to like this game, but I'm a stickler for good game design.  I am a huge fan of zangband/angband and actual roguelike titles.  It irritates me when developers slap the 'roguelike' title on firstly a game that is not actually a roguelike and then use permadeath as a means to feign difficulty when the difficulty is that all of the game's mechanics remove skill and your only real strategy is to move the goalposts of high/low RNG far enough away from people dying so you can progress--but there's always a chance of just losing everything.  It's bad design and shouldn't be given the acclaim it is getting.\n\nI greatly enjoy massively difficult games--xcom is a difficult game (both the new and old), you can wipe and lose in a fight but there is a wide variety of what skillful play can achieve over non-skillful play and that is what Darkest Dungeon massively lacks.  Grinding back for hours to retry the dungeon boss that has a mechanic you simply must bring certain protection/strategy/units for...that's just idiotic, manufactured difficulty.\n\nIf you play this game I highly recommend save scumming--if you could restart your hour long dungeon that ends in failure, I'd take away my negative review.  I really like the idea of permadeath though, just the execution of it is flawed.","October 24, 2015","false","53.1"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","13","24","3","0"

You can't apply skill, practice, or even time; to simply randomly losing hours of work.\n\nThe game has many ways in which it randomly screws you, I think it is supposed to be difficulty. However, on a regular basis they combine to simply mean 'instant game over'.  Why is there an escape button if it never lets you? And if you can't escape, why not at least turn the button off? There is no way to tell the difficulty of a level besides, "do you get to camp". I loved camping and failing every single players skill attempt at healing. Every time I camped.\n\nOnce you run out of money, you can't buy supplies to go on more missions, and your skilled people are dead. You get to start a new game, or hope for a 'lucky' streak.\n\nAre the chests a joke by the developer? I've yet to get one that wasn't trapped. I started bringing keys and using them, but that gets right back to the point about being down on your luck. No money? Well no keys for you, so no chests. It wasn't any fun at all. It reminds me of the "Giant alien spiders are no joke" encounter in FTL. You have to learn the hard way that its just a joke at your expense.\n\nSome of it is a lot of fun, and the game begs you to play it. I like the mechanics, approach, and atmosphere. But every single portion of the game fights you. Did you send someone off to drink for a week? Well now they're an alcoholic. You can spend a week having that removed, if you have the cash.\n\nI'd like to go back and play this game right now, just like Faster Than Light. It's like a slot machine. But the same problem remains.... I get a few hours a week to play video games; and I do prefer they be hard. But randomly starting over every 90 minutes is gut wrenching and lacks thought.\n\nI'd love it if the game was slightly more skill based, and if some of the ridiculous slights were removed. I have a guy who wants to drink; but hey the caretaker is randomly in that slot this week. Did they add that because the game was too easy, or did they just think it would be a cool idea? It's infuriating.\n\nUnlike FTL, this game lacks the reward of success. Beat FTL once and a hundred failed attempts suddently feels vanquished. Even if you die in most 'rogue likes', you can feel like you had a good run. But success here just feels empty.\n\nFinally, if a game is going to be so masochist. Hurry up about it. They seemed to add this game mechanic where an almost-dead party is more 'lucky' than a healthy one. So you end up with one character left who can't win but isn't dying, and can't flee. Yeah, I totally want to sit here for 10 more minutes. Just kill the player!\n\nI'm going to watch for patches and maybe play a bit more; hopefully this review ends up incorrect. As it stands, you get nowhere quickly and it just ends up feeling like a waste of an evening.\n\nTLDR; Fantastic idea, fantastic art, superb atmosphere. Infuriating to play.","February 7, 2015","false","5.3"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dadhole/recommended/262060/","dadhole","Mr. SlippyFist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dadhole/","24 products in account","Any character you grow attacthed to will ultimately die. It won't be because you're bad at the game. It's simply because everything in this game is completely ♥♥♥♥ing random. You will miss in the worst moments, your characters wiill get debuffs while yours will never stick. Nothing on this game is on your side. There are these things called quirks that certain characters recieved after each quest that are passive buffs and debuffs. 95% of the time you will get a debuff. How the hell is that fun? How can you reward a player with a debuff? Don't listen to the idiots saying "git gud" in the reviews. You literally have to grind for hours to gain any sense of progression. The entire game is just walking left and right through the same couple backgrounds repeatedly for each of the four areas. While there, there are objects you can inspect for loot, but it's ultimately pointless because 20% they're empty, 70% there's a trap, and 10% of the time there's actually some sort of mediocre reward waiting. You also fight groups of disgusting beasts or menacing undead/bandits in a turn-based setting.\n\nOne of the main mechanics of the game is stress. At 100 stress you gain afflictions that basically make your characters destroy themselves. Of course, this usually happens to all 4 of your pathetic underpowered characters at once, so you have to sit there and wait for them to take damage everytime they are about to take a turn. Pretty fun. Not. At 200 stress your character has a heart attack and dies. Stress is something that is ultimately dealt to you 10x more than it could ever be healed in battle. You gain about 20 stress per hit eventually, and the developers throw a big ♥♥♥♥ you in your face by giving you petty skills that heal 3-6 stress. Yes, let me spend 3 turns healing that 20 stress while I gain it 3x over. How about no, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. Of course, you can heal your stress by basically incapacitating your characters until the next mission is over, and you must pay a lump sum of cash to do so. This is cash that you probably won't have because you need to grind for it. You'll find yourself investing gold in characters and then watching them die because of the unfair gameplay mechanics. Eventually you will be totally broke and unable to heal any stress or buy food, torches, etc (which are necessary). That's where this game really excels: stressing the player out.\n\nThe thing that really peeves me the most, is that even if you are smart about how you play, the enemy usually is 2x faster than you, and they hit the same, if not more damage than you do. All characters have about 8 skills in total and you must pick 4 to use in battle. Most of these are terrible. They have horrible damage modifiers, so you are mostly stuck using the same two skills. On top of that the RNG is almost never in your favor. You will find yourself hitting in the lower half of the damage range of your already-weak skills most of the time. Because of this, utility skills usually don't proc their debuff, so you just wasted a turn. Yet another ♥♥♥♥ you from the developers.The game gives you hardly any reward. It only punishes you.\n\nI could go on and on about what's wrong with this game and the horrible design choices that were made, but now I'm going to discuss some good things about the game:\n\nThe narrator's voice. Yep. that's it.\n\nCan I have my $20 back? Please? The amount of stress this game generates will probably give you a heart attack. Thankfully, I stopped playing the game at 100 stress, where I began to suffer from severe disappointment, intense regret, and a really sore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from getting ♥♥♥♥ed so hard. lol. Seriously though, don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game. I'd rather do jumping jacks in an iron maiden than play this.","May 26","false","2.6"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","13","24","5","0"

The gameplay and narration are excellent and I think the graphics/battle animations are superb, as well.  The storyline reminds me of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Rats In The Walls" and that's a great thing!  Kudos to Red Hook on capturing the same dark, dreary feel.\n\nI found the game to be very difficult early on because I was trying to save all of the party members after each mission and didn't have enough gold to fix all of their problems.  Once I accepted that the level 0-1 characters were simply cannon fodder to use for the greater good of the Hamlet (sending out on no provision runs to gather gold/resources and then dismissing the entire party afterwards), the game became easier.  Using the gold to fund real mission and item/ability upgrades for my main characters, I slowly built up my roster and continued doing no provision runs when my core teams required rest.\n\nNow, I have a full roster of upgraded (though not max level) characters.  The days of no provision runs with new recruits is over but they served their purpose.  My "A-Team" (Grave Robber/Vestal/Crusader/Man-at-Arms) is level 5 and has completed several Champion runs; the remaining heroes are level 3-4 and are capable of completing the Veteran runs in various party combinations.\n\nIn my opinion, the best classes are the Man-at-Arms and the Vestal; I haven't had any success with the Occultist or the Plague Doctor.  It seems like the Occultist's heal fails at a critical time and isn't worth the risk, the Vestal has proven to be a more reliable healer.  The Plague Doctor hasn't been a strong enough healer or damage dealer in my expeience; I'd take the Vestal/Crusader for healing or just about anything else (Arbalest/Bountry Hunter/Grave Robber/Highway Man) for damage dealing, over the Plague Doctor.\n\nWould I recommend this game to others?  Absolutely!  For only $20 (about the same price as a movie or two at the theater), I've had over 70 hours of enjoyment and I am looking forward to the next 70+ hours of gameplay.","August 15, 2015","true","240.9"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

This game is not a challenge, it's skewed by design to make you fail all the time. The difficulty is insane simply because all the chances are stacked against you and all RNG is tilted to make sure you are _ALWAYS_ on the losing end.\n\nThe self-admitted intention from the designers is that you need to not care about your specific characters, you just need to send waves after waves of goons to try to defeat the (artificially) insanely difficult quests. Well, guess what, if that's the way the game is supposed to be played, it actually completely defeats its own purpose. What's the point of making something so incredibly difficult when overcoming the difficulty is actually completely unmeaningful? I can just hire four new random guys from the stagecoach and send them to a dungeon.\n\nThe graphical style is charming and excellent, the sound is great, I personally liked the voice over too. The atmosphere is great, it could be a great game.\n\nSimply, it's a plain not fun experience because everything that you do as a player has no meaningful impact on what happens in the game.\n\n...Thinking about it, that makes Darkest Dungeon probably not eligible for the definition of "being a game".\n\nI know the developers have their adamant, obstinate, stubborn vision of how they want the game to play out, but when your difficult but playable and enjoyable game (one year ago, give or take a few months) starts raking in more than 1000 negative reviews because of how unplayable and unfun you have turned the game into, shouldn't you start asking yourselves if your vision is just plain WRONG?\n\nIf I could, I'd refund this.

There is a fun game in there; the concepts are brilliant but the frustration is huge.  The spread in outcomes of the various RNG rolls results in unavoidable failure spirals where things will be going along brilliantly and then suddenly all of your heros are fully stressed, you are out of money, and no easy quests are available to attempt a recovery.  The overall balance seems extremely poor; some dungeons you will receive 50% the number of enemies, and they will all be of an easy type and other dugeons will have twice as many enemies and each fight will decimate your party.  Add in the unavoidable RNG (you can be unlucky with what hero types are available, giving you an unfeasable party configuration leading to certain failure) and this game is just not worth the price of admission.  I hope they refine it, because I feel like this could be a really good game.  One last thing; many people are saying the root problem is that you have to learn the game.

The classes are still largely unbalanced, even more time and money is now required to purge the endless stream of new diseases and debuffs, and trinkets are either net positive or net negative making only a select few worth anything. Near constant attacks to your moral and severe and often permanent punishments for looting anything in the level put me off experimenting in the game extremely quickely, including trying the new classes. The investment of time to train new units up from 0-2 is boring and unrewarding, and it's often easier to simply dismiss new units and recruit fresh untainted ones. To succeed I had to run the same team, use the same ability combinations and ignore as many RNG based elements as possible to avoid a majority of the games 'difficulty'. Even for a roguelike Darket Dungeon likes taking control away from the player way too often.\n\nI'd hoped more skill and squad composition mechanics would be explored as the game progressed, maybe even some relief from the frustrating requirment of destressing and purging abilities after almost every single run. While I understand this title is invested in being as crushingly hard as possible, many of the mechanics come across as merely stalling for time and forcing players to repeat low level areas.\n\n","May 23","false","7.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

I forgot to buy *food*(!) and torches, not doing a dark run, and combined with the expenses of what I bought dropped me down to less than 5k gold.

But then I noticed something huge that couldn't be ignored: The enemy got some new debuff attacks. Not one or two. ALL of them. The stress damage and the crit rate was also alarming. The first five dungeons I tried angered me so much because I always lost at least one party member (the thrid one was a TPK). It was the sixth that I got a lucky break and convinced me to stick it out. So, out of six dungeon crawls, only one went the way I wanted it to?

A pretty important one is that you shouldn't take the players' hours of work and investment and then roll the dice to see if he or she keeps it.\n\nIn this game I designed a fun, powerful composition and was having a lot of success with it. It took me somewhere around 10 hours to feel confident and prepared, and the team was blazing through dungeons. Seeing my team was now far over-levelled and overgeared I decided it was time to take on the second boss. I entered, went through the dungeon unscathed and finally reached the boss. Then he immediately hit my entire team with a massive critical hit, permanently killing two of them and essentially erasing hours of work with no warning or counterplay.\n\nThe best example I can think of the compare how that feels is to suggest how one would feel after 10 hours of adventuring on skyrim, only to have the game say "Woops! We decided to delete your save file to keep you on your toes!"\n\nArtificial difficulty is thrown around a lot these days, but this is a perfect example. It's poor game design that punishes the player for doing everything right. In what way does this kind of thing inscentivize the player to continiue playing?\n\nOne could argue that events like this add to the overall horrific feel of the game, to which I respond that events like that add to the overall feel of me wishing I had spent my money on something that didn't make me feel like I wasted the last 10 hours of my life.\n\nThe game has a lot of possitive qualities, but I can't recommend it currently.","March 13, 2015","false","6.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","4"

But at the moment it´s just unfinished and rediculous unfair.\n\nI mean after finished - by the way unfair - darkest dungeon game, if you change to NG+ (harder lvl.), well you expect usually a better loot or more rewards for the missions with more difficult monsters. It is there? NOPE! The loot and rewards are absolutely the same! So redhook whats the point for playing an difficulty NG+ if there is absolutely the same loot, as on normal difficulty by higher expenditures? Imagine Diablo III would have the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot on the highest torment X as on the lvl 1 normal.... So whats the point of raising the difficulty for the same useless loot, that normally you are forced to sell, because of lack of ♥♥♥♥in money by the way. And yes, we are talking about the grind, because you need all the loot for improving your estate and abilities/armor/weapons of your team, for at least one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit on a grandma in the weald, which  has redicoulus high dodgings. I don´t talking about darkest dungeon, which is by the way absolutely empty on loot!!!!! Do you call this normal??? or 15.000 reward on difficulty normal and the same amount on NG+!!!! Why??? For only stressing myself??? NO thanks, my job gives me already enough stress... no thanks...\n\nObout the Roleplay... well it´s very limited... from the one side you see that holy fated crusader or leper do not want to be in the same group with dark suffered and plagued from tourtures abomination, which is very cool hero class by the way. I wished there were more like him in the game, and I like also comments of heros, depending on their stress state in dungeons during the fights, camping or just in the state or depending from their quirks. It´s very nice done. You But that´s all!!! The speaker charmous at the beginning becomes repetative with the time especially if monsters hit you critically over and over and over.... "how quickly the time turns" - can not hear that ♥♥♥♥ anymore!!!! The monsters by the way compared to your heroes, beside ancestor, don´t have any personality. It doesn´t matter where you go: cave, weald or ruins or darkest dungeon itself. Their behavior is absolutely the same. They never give comments or never change positions after got suprised, which is absolutely unfair because your heroes, if suprised, very often change positions, so your tank have to make 2 - 3 turns before he can even make some damage, and on ng+, or even on normal all the monsters, if they attacking the same hero and make 3 crit hits in the row, well it´s not fun at all!!!!!\n\nSo if this game really focused on roleplay, so why with the time my heroes on the highest lvl. do not get more stress or move resistantce, or better chance for stress resolve tests, which gives by the way some nice buffs, if even each of them killed about 2000 monsters during the endless grind, cause you ♥♥♥♥ing need that money for raising heros????!!!!! and plz answere the simple question: why should I even start on ng+??? There are no incentives for that! Just for the feelings like "self contentment" for finished the game on ng+??? are you serious?????\n\nYou want more suggestions about role play? How about introduce experience system for the legendary heroes? For example with defeating 50 enemies the critical hit chance of grave robber increase at 1 %. next aim would be 100 enemies, for man-at-arms, for example increase the protection stat. I mean at the moment there is no differece between just gradueded lvl 6 heroes noobs and lvl. 6 heroes who already defeated a lot of enemies. I mean with the time, you get experience, isn´t that right??? Sure! But not in this game! How about paragon system like in the diablo III? Why you don´t implement rewarding system for experienced heroes? Why not? At the moment I don´t really give a ♥♥♥♥, if my entirely party wipes. I don´t have favourite hero at the moment, because they are ♥♥♥♥ing  the same!!!!! And thats the RolePlay at the moment game....\n\nI feel like that redhook spend more time in steam for giving negative feedback for reviews, instead of improving their game. Or it is perhaps the community without RL? If its so, I don´t wann part of it...\n\nI want enjoy this game, and  NOT use it as instrument for self torture! I have enough stress at my ♥♥♥♥ing work, and don´t need this random ♥♥♥♥!

No one enjoys throwing 50-75% of their earnings into a gold-sink mechanic after every dungeon.\n2) Battles and game mechanics in general are too reliant on RNG. No matter how well made your decisions are in battle, you are regularly put to your knees by crits/dodges/resists and other such nonsense. RNG is fine, but it needs to be used in moderation if the player wishes to maintain some sense of control.\n3) If you level a character quicker than  you complete dungeons, he becomes useless as he refuses to enter a dungeon that is a level below him. There are several mechanics that the devs could have implemented to stop high level characters farming dungeons. Simply making a character unusable and forcing you to draft a newbie is frustrating as hell.\n\nGood things to be found here, but not enough.

Everything is RNG dependant, as well as being designed to work against you. Your healers barely heal even with trinkets and buffs, your sluggers often miss regardless of traits and buffs, and taking on the actual, literal 'Darkest Dungeon' portion of the game is simply an exercise in sadomasochism.\n\nMany are quick to defend the 'difficulty' of this game because of the current trend in video games (difficult games, ala Dark Souls, Binding of Isaac, etc.), however, the simple fact is that Darkest Dungeon isn't as tough as it is dependant on sheer luck. Crits, dodges, empty rooms and hallways, the discovery of treasure and trinkets that aren't totally useless and the like. Player skill is much less important than simply scoring a critical hit on a cultist with your Crusader or Leper.\n\nUntil you struggle through the game and become rich, many of the upgrades to both buildings and equipment are simply too expensive to afford. The hero roster is pitifully small despite how easy it is for them to die, training heroes to their max level takes too long given how tiny said roster is and how quickly they can be killed, trinkets are often as needlessly debilitating as they are helpful, heroes become too stressed too easily (especially in the final dungeon).\n\nThe game simply isn't fun to play...but at the same time, the gambling nature of DD makes it addicting. After 100+ hours I've come to realize that I've only been playing this game for those sporadic moments of utter joy that follow criting a tough enemy party three to four times in a row. Those times are wonderful, but they're also far and few between. More often than not, the enemy will be punishing YOU relentlessly, not the other way around.\n\nIn summation: buy this game if you like to gamble. It's good for that. The art is fun to look at for a while as well and the narrator is a nice touch...at first. After completing your 20th quest, though, his repeated quips become reminiscent of nails on a chalkboard. The mechanics, however - the actual meat of the game, are rather unenjoyable.","February 17","false","251.7"," 32 of 62 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","32","62","2","0"

The Cthulhu-based story drew me in. The terrible design drove me away. Challenge comes only through non-sensical design choices and the intense over-use of RNG.\n\nWant to do something? RNG will stop you. Want to heal out of combat? You can't, even though you are a healer. Want to kill monsters? Well, you may get an occasional kill, but bodies just pile up, even though you are killing less than 3 at a time. Said bodies will block you from attacking. Everything is range based, and the game keeps finding ways to randomly change your positioning. The monsters can get though the piled up bodies just fine though, for some reason. If this were an action game, zombies and skeletons would be more nimble than humans. All of this doesn't entirely matter though, because your party usually dies from massive amounts of stress damage, which can't be mitigated much, in a handful of fights. It can be mitigated, sure, but you take about 500 damage in a dungeon, and you can mitigate about 20.\n\nParty members are essentially canon fodder, and your goal is to build up your estate as they all die from horrible deaths. Yet, you will not be interested in doing so, because it's an excessive RNG-based grind fest where you see the same tiles and the same monsters over and over and over again....\n\nI tried to return the game, but they won't let me.

Lots of fun with a unique art style.\n\nGame balance is much improved over the earlier builds.  It's challenging but without the frustrating party wipes due to bad luck and poor design.\n\nWhile you can start multiple campaigns, each campaign has only one save that the game auto-updates.  Characters can and will die and there's no bringing them back.  With that said, once you know the game mechanics, you have to be overconfident or unlucky to get a character killed.   What's more likely is that they will become so riddled with afflictions and phobias that you start wondering if it's worth the time and money to cure them.\n\n"Alas, poor Dismas.  He grew un-well."\n\nThe game mechanics appear simple at first, but the more you play, the deeper you realize the strategy elements go.\nWith multiple classes, quirks, afflictions, equipment levels, learned skills, trinkets, and character position, there are a lot of things to consider when putting together a party.  There's also a limited amount of supplies you can carry, so you have to consider carefully what to bring. Supplies and loot occupy the same space. Bring too many supplies, and there's no room for loot.  Bring too few supplies, and you starve in the dark.\n\nVisually, characters of the same class look the same.  Crusader Bill looks just like crusader Bob. You can change their name and choose an overall color scheme, but they look the same.  You'd think this would make the characters feel generic, but it doesn't.   Over the course of a campaign - for however long they survive - each character will develop differently.  Bill is smitten by a worker in the brothel and that is the only place he will go to de-stress.  Bob finds religion and will only de-stress in the abbey.  Bill becomes paranoid and mutters constantly when in a party. Bob becomes vigorous and regenerates a bit of health.  Visually the same, but in character totally different.\n\nIs Darkest Dungeon a perfect game? Hard to answer. I think it is a game that is perfectly itself - and that self is very engaging.\n\nIf you're looking for a turn-based, dungeon experience with a unique art style, challenging game play, and a lengthy campaign ( broken into manageable bites ),  give Darkest Dungeon a try .\n\n","December 25, 2015","true","38.5"," 40 of 78 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","40","78","3","0"

So far it's the best one I've played in 2015, and I can't wait to see what they add.\n\nUnlike many other early access games, this one feels complete at its foundation. Core gameplay is very much there, and more importantly it's fun. It seems like anything they add now will just be extra content and balance passes, the latter of which could admittedly throw things into disarray.\n\nThis game is punishing, and sometimes it can seem unfairly so. But a bad roll of the dice usually serves to compound existing problems and flaws in strategy rather than turning an absolute win into an absolute failure. Bad luck can definitely ruin your day, but preparedness is key and the game's system for this feels innovative if a bit samey after a while.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this one, just get it.

Your heroes are essentially like the nameless low-levels that you always hear about dying at the start of any D&D adventure. They're nobodies. It's the player's job to bring them up into a somebody, either by sheer dumb luck in dungeons, right choices in tactics, and perhaps running away. A lot.\n\nDarkest Dungeon's quirks system adds a new, well-needed flavor to the roleplaying genre. For those that go in-depth, it can give new life to a character and turn a blank slate into a flavorful portrait. For those who simply run at it as a roguelike, the quirks system gives new variables that can spice up the game.  As heroes survive dungeon after terrifying dungeon, they grow in their quirks and their prowess, eventually becoming champions in their own right.\n\nThat doesn't make them any less mortal, however. A big component of Darkest Dungeon's, well, darkness, is the fact that any character can be susceptible to the perils and sometimes fatal clutches of the terrors beneath the estate, regardless of level. For some, this might be a turnoff. For others, it's a welcome challenge. I know most players complain when their characters get too powerful and can "one-shot" everything. Well, here you go. The combat system does this justice by balancing attacks with physical damage as well as increasing a character's "Stress Level", invoking sanity crushing effects that can, in turn, have effects in and out of combat. The character's are able to buff their own stress levels with different attacks, in-game interactions, relief in town, and camaraderie around the campfire. But survival ultimately is determined by making the right choices for the right situation in combat. Even a wrong formation can quickly spell ruin for a party.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is beautifully composed, fitting well with changes in light, atmosphere, and situation. Blend that with the crowquill art style, and you have yourself a terrifying immersion experience. As the torch burns lower, the music grows more intense. The howls of whatever foul creatures nearby become clarified, and the stress of going in without light becomes a very harsh reality.\n\nOverall, I would say that Darkest Dungeon is a game worthy of being played by any horror buff or roguelike enthusiast. It's a delightful romp into the realm of the mad, despondent, hopeless, and generally downtrodden mercenaries in a world bereft of the all-powerful heroes of the light that we see in most games. Just be prepared to get thrown into the grinder. It's going to get messy.","February 10, 2015","true","73.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The artstyle and atmosphere is grittty yet gorgeous. The combat system is standard for most turn-based strategy RPGs, but it's visceral enough to make every turn tense. Upgrading your town and adventurers is done smooth with enough depth to give you plenty of choices for your party structure. Overall, the game has just about everything a good rogue-like RPG would need.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. The sanity and stress mechanics are what make the game different from anything else. Not only does it make the game more difficult, but it will completely change how you play the game from any other. There is a lot more micro-management along with trial-and-error when your adventurers start taking turns for the worst.\n\nI can only imagine just how much more they could add to this game considering it's still in Early Access. At it's current state, it's definitely a must-buy for anyone who likes dark fantasy RPGs.","February 9, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This However does not take from the game at all, it is still grueling, heartwrenching, eye covering, breath stopping, time slowingly cruel and heroes come and go. The turn mechanics are hidden to leave you in suspenceand you cant heal out of combat (i feel this really is good to keep you cowering) and the artwork is to die for. it is an original clever game.... its like darksouls had a baby with the love child of dontstave and final fantasy.

As a forward, I absolutely LOVE difficulty in gaming. I have way too many hours logged onto DotA 2, Dark Souls 1 & 2, XCOM, etc. because I look for that punishment in my gaming. That being said, Darkest Dungeon lived up EXACTLY to the absurdly high standard its hype set for me. I was glued to my computer for hours and hours, praying that the hag's cleave wouldn't snuff out my party at death's door, hoping to land that fateful crit or stun, and damn if I haven't lost a lot of dudes. But I knew exactly what I was getting in to (thanks to the folks at Red Hook being very open throughout development) and damn if I didn't get exactly what I wanted.\n\nNow, of course the game isn't perfect. There are a few typos, a couple issues, and ♥♥♥♥ Lockjaw. The divine wrath of RNGsus can, at times, be absolutely heartbreaking. But is that a bad thing? In this case, no. The game marketed itself on its punishing, brutal style. On its hopelessness, and on its faint glimmers of heroism. And they are all very, very real.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of any of DD's qualities other than its fantastic gameplay; I'm not sure if anyone has had an issue with the art style, or the narration, but they're both spot on for the game's atmosphere. The chilling voice of the narrator can praise your heroes for crits and kills, or comdemn them for their failures and disappointments. One issue that was more annoying than invasive was that if a cleave attack (Breakthru, Grapeshot, etc) crits, especially if the crit kills, the narrator states his lines on cue, over and over per crit/kill long after the moment had passed, and sometimes after combat had ended. But more of that ghastly voice filling the halls? Not too bad an issue at all.\n\nAll this said, and the game's just released on early access. JUST RELEASED. Early access has, as a concept, been plagued by the lack of developer care (abandoned titles, quick cash outs, AAA devs using it as an excuse, you name it) but this title is very clearly polished, and cherished by its creators.

There are some bugs pertaining to launching the game that require a workaround (I had to disable the Steam overlay to run it), but the game otherwise runs fine for the most part.

Yes, there are randomly generated dungeons and adventurers. Yes, death of an adventurer is permanent.

I remember it from my childhood; a beautiful land full of colour, surrounded by warm fields and swaying trees...\n\nNow I stood, letter in one hand and gore soaked sword in the other as I looked upon what had happened to this land. I found the caretaker buttoning up his trousers as he left a ♥♥♥♥♥ to greet me in the centre of village. Welcome, he rasped, to the Darkest Estate. With that greeting, he began to fill me in on my new duties as Lord of the Estate. I suppose that made me Lord Darkest. This grim sense of humour would become commonplace in my world soon enough.\n\nThe forest had become a land of bandits and mutant swine, their Prince and King strutting and rutting and ruining the land, poisoning all they touched. What had once been a place of beautiful harvest had become nothing more than a land of danger; food supplies could no longer get through and what few rangers he had sent to scout didn't return.\n\nHe discussed the old estate, filled with monstrous creatures and the undead, led by a Necromancer and his kin. The caretaker dared to imply a connection between these and my late Uncle, but a quick look put that line of reasoning to its end. These would have to be taken care of, as well.\n\nAnd to the ruins in the south, a coven of witches (hags, he muttered between swigs of whisky) had taken over and what few survivors returned spoke of great, sweaty and cackling loonies who ate those who dared to confront them. Their cannibalism had long since driven them insane. He began muttering about how they had come to my Uncle in a guise of beauty, but soon began to splutter and rant without reason or even words. I left him to his ramblings, and his mind.\n\nWhen the latest camp arrived, three nervous individuals had come. One, a woman with a similar faith to myself, a large mace, and a dour grimace. Another women, wrapped mostly in bandages and utterly unrecognisable without her phlaegm coated voice laughing at some joke no one told, echoing inside the bird mask of a Plague Doctor. Lastly, a Bounty Hunter, who simply handed me a picture of a large man in red. When I inquired further, he said he'd help me take his head with the non-expression of a sociopath. I stopped inquiring.\n\nWe began on this estate, exploring the ruins. We packed food and torches, but little else. Our goal was revenge, although the bounty hunter said it left our pockets empty for recovering assets. The Sister frowned at him, and said donations to the church. The Plague Doctor kept laughing to herself, but I noticed she would pick up whatever diamonds we found.\n\nThe torch began sputtering immediately, as it fought to hold back the darkness. I held it ahead of me, as much as weapon as the sword I held in my hand. I tried to sheave it, but the idea of not having it ready terrifed me more. The flickering firelight gave movement to every shadow, and every shadow an evil eye glaring at me. It was with a shove that the Bounty Hunter pushed me aside, an arrow flying past me and burying itself in the meat of the Sister's thigh. As we looked ahead, I saw skeletons charged at us down the corridor.\n\nNo, this is true. Actual skeletons, like inside of you or I, but these moved with a foul purpose, carrying swords, armour and even one in robes with a staff. As he raised it, a dark light surrounded our Plague Doctor, and she began to laugh a little more maniacally. Stuffing her hand in her pocket and shouting about traps, she threw a glittering powder over the the skeletons, which exploded in pops of light. The Bounty Hunter charged ahead, using the dazedness of the skeletons to take the head of the first. Feeling heartened, I picked up my sword and purpose and smashed the largest one in the face with my hilt. It seemed they still felt pain. As he reeled, I pulled a scroll from my belt and banished whatever foul magicks animated him back to hell.\n\nThe Sister prayed to her god, and a green grow began to close our wounds. However, the damage to our minds remained fresh, and for the Plague Doctor, lethal. We just didn't know it yet.\n\nAt least, after a night in this place, we found the Necromancer. Foul smelling thing, with a rusty red robe and its face hidden in shadow except for a malign glint, he brought up the bodies of fellow fighters to face us. The Bounty Hunter shouted that the Necromancer was his; poor fool. As I and the Sister contended with the skeletons, the Necromancer surrounded the Bounty Hunter with darkness. As his mind broke, the Necromancer then began to break his body.\n\nThe Plague Doctor used this time to surround the Necromancer with a special poison gas, and the Sister tried to heal the rest of us, as we watched the Bounty Hunter die. It took an agonisingly long time, and when he was done, all that was left of him that I could recognise was his dying screams in my ears. The Plague Doctor continued laughing. The Sister started praying. All I remember is screaming. Mine or someone else, I don't know.\n\nThe torch went out. We fought in the dark.\n\nA few days, we three came out. The caretaker threw me into the temple, a run down thing, to begin prayer. The Plague Doctor apparently shut herself up in the brothel for days at a time, only leaving for more beer or meat. The Sister whipped herself bloody; I could hear her moans of pleasure echoing through the walls.\n\nAfter several days, they let me out to greet the new arrivals. More had come, apparently word has spread of adventure. I smiled. Welcome to the Darkest Estate. I promise you, there is gold enough for everyone who is brave enough to fight.","March 14, 2015","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Second, this game still needs some work. Levels 1-3 seem...unbalanced. I love a good challenge, but the level of frustration was immense. I like "perma-death" and sending players to the graveyard, etc., but it just seemed that everything revolved around critical hits and, as another review mentioned, the infamous Random Number Generator. I love the stress mechanic but there needs to be more viable means to manage it. My jester (bard) reduces stress by 3 (sometimes), and same with the crusader--and besides those two, who else can manage stress?, while every enemy attack is increasing stress by around 14 or so. This is riduclous, and it repeats itself over and over again--within minutes every last party member is a raving lunatic adding yet more stress and refusing to cooperate in the mission (which is cool in it's own way). Also, the mission format was so streamlined and RNG-driven that it felt like I was playing a slot machine: did I get enough crits to survive and then get lucky enough to receive large enough cash drops? If yes, then BLING BLING BLING--the game even makes a slot machine noise as it counts out your chips; if no, then the rest of your game is doomed because you won't have money to manage your characters stress back in the hamlet, or to level their skills...or to buy armor...or weapons, etc., etc., etc.--there are a riduclous number of things that you need to spend money on and very little of it coming your way. At this point the whole game enters a DEATH SPIRAL, which seems entirely too easy to do: all of your missions are past the level of the new characters that you have to recruit after you can't afford to de-stress and level up your old characters, and soon you're just throwing your favorite characters into suicidal missions just hoping to get them off your hands and then praying that a decent Level 1 mission will pop up again so you can basically start the whole, very stressful, cycle of gameplay all over again. So, this game is AWESOME--aesthetics, script, role-playing vitality, underlying game mechanics, and storyline. I love it! Can't wait for full release...6 months from now. Keep up the good work, though, for real. This promises to be one of the best single player RPG's in a long, long time!

Here is a quick summary to why I love playing it:\n\n+ This game oozes theme and style. The aesthetic look and music really matches the gothic dungeon crawler nature.\n+ Gameplay mechanics that fit with the game's theme. Relating to the point above, but this game has great smaller mechanics that fit very well together like the stress system of seeing the horrors of the night. The torch mechanic, allowing you to burn up your torches to make things easier or let them burn down for a tougher challenge but greater rewards is great. But what if you run out of torches? Well then you are definitely in for a tough time.\n+ Varied characters and classes. Loads of variety here in both combat and camping skills that create charaters with purpose.\n+ Loads of content for an early access release. This is what early access should be: I've played 4 hours and I've only defeated the first boss out of nine. There is three areas to explore with two more on the way (I presume for the full release). I've only seen one bug, which was incorrect text and it wasn't gamebreaking at all, and has already been patched.\n+ Lots of player choice. This game is tough, everything goes wrong, but is still a lot of choice available to the player as they explore.\n\nThis game is exactly my type of game: A game where there is tough choices (like XCOM), short rougelike missions (like Rouge Legacy/Binding of Issac), but have lasting effects and purpose over a longer campaign (like XCOM and Rouge Legacy again).\n\nOne point to note:\n- This is not a negative, but there is a lot of random generation involved for if you hit or miss, if you do 4 or 7 damage, etc. Some players may not enjoy that aspect, I love it as it creates unique experience and amusing moments when my\noccultist healer does more bleeding damage than he healed.\n\nFrom the start you can see that this game has a lot of love and polish put into it. Every day over the past week, I have always been excited to return to Darkest Dungeon. Highly recommended by me, I'll keep updating the review if something comes up, and when it is fully released.\n\nIf you wish to see dungeon gameplay, here is an episode part way through my Darkest Dungeon series that starts with dungeon crawling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFWyMhQYjeM","February 3, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It reminds me of the frustration/reward feeling of Dark Souls. It's by no means anything like Dark Souls, but that same kind of harshness is there, and it's extremely frustrating, but feels great when you recover some of the crazy odds against you.\n\nThe heroes you can recruit and level, then have them die to recruit them again is interesting, and I like that you yourself are none of them in the game technically. The skill upgrade and equipment upgrade system is great. I wish the items would change a little more in appearance as you upgrade them, but I've only upgraded to level 3 weapons so maybe it does at the end rank?\n\nThe trinkets are odd. I haven't found too many yet that I really want to use with the strong negatives they can possess, but there are a few that are crazy good when their class specific.\n\nI think the stress system and test of resolve with the afflications is fantastic as well. Similar to Rogue Legacy with descendants having these afflications, but your heroes will be recruited with them or attain them as you progress through the story. It's funny to have an abusive character tell a crusader that just crit for 28 say, "Not bad, but aim next time" or something that like haha.\n\nI do think the enemies that can just inflict stress with minor damage are a little overpowered, and their stress damage might need to be toned down a little bit, but if it stays the same, it's not a big deal.\n\n11/10, great game. Would recommend to anyone who looks a challenge.\n\np.s.: I really like the art of the game as well.","February 6, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
