And probably the best P&C mystery/detective adventure I've ever played. I really enjoyed Testament of Sherlock Holmes as well, but this was better done, in my opinion.\n\nMany, many video games seem to be built by developers, programmers and artists, and then have a story sort of try and glue the pieces together loosely for an enjoyable experience. There is nothing wrong with that. There are a ton of really fun games out there with this formula.\n\nIn the case of The Raven, it felt like a team of writers (or maybe just one, I dunno) put together a fine story, and then built a game to wrap around it. For me, this was a departure from the typical game formula and a breath of fresh air. BUT, it won't be for everyone.\n\nYou get to play three different characters in the game (two male, one female) as you both try to unravel a mystery, and become a deeper part of it at the same time.\n\nThe game play is fairly typical P&C, with a few treats in regard to "repeat performances" at very specific "crossroads" in the game (I won't spoil it).\n\nThe game isn't without flaws. There are inconsitent commands when it comes to character movement, occasionally sloppy pixel area matching (when your mouse cursor can either click on an object well outside the object, or not at all). Audio sometimes cuts out, and the cutscenes occasionally get wonky. The game crashed on me a handful of times in the 14 hours I spent playing it. It has some warts when it comes to gameplay mechanics and execution.\n\nBut all that being said, it was STILL a joy to play. The character development is among some of the best I've ever experienced in decades of gaming. Dialogue that seems nebulous at times ties in wonderfully by the end of the game. In fact, SO good, that you'll even chuckle at the end at encounters that occurred earlier in the game when you realize the full context of the conversation later.\n\nThere is subtle and mature humor in just the right places when you've had enough serious dialogue. There are extremely mature subjects that are covered, and conversations that really pull you in if you've lived for longer than a few decades on this planet. And when I say "mature" I don't mean an ESRB version of it. There's not much in the way of sophomoric language or gratuitious violence. But there are very adult themes that many of us become sadly familiar with (or can laugh about) when we get older. And some we'll never laugh about.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is a true adult mystery with several wonderful twists, a killer storyline, some fun (but typical) P&C mechanics, and some fun and mostly logical puzzles.\n\nIf you enjoy a strong story in your games (or at all), or enjoy mysteries, or generally enjoy P&C adventures, I can recommend this. If you enjoy all three, then I think this title is a "can't miss" and even a bit underrated.","August 21, 2014","true","14.1"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","62","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oceanwilde/recommended/233370/","oceanwilde","Lucifalle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oceanwilde/","484 products in account","I initially bought this game at full price due to the positive early reviews (which were mostly based on the first chapter).\n\nUnfortunately, the game is severely broken for many users and the developers have done little to fix these issues since the game's release. These are not only minor bugs or annoyances, but critical game breaking issues.\n\nI usually love these types of adventure games, but in this case, I have been unable to progress beyond the first chapter (disregard the deceptive amount of hours on record; I have left the game running in the background on several occasions while running errands, sleeping or looking for solutions to the problems I've encountered). It is unlikely that I will get a refund as I bought the game long before Steam's refund policies were changed. Instead, I want to warn future potential buyers of the problems they may encounter.\n\nTake a look at the forum posts below:\n\nBug thread (13 pages so far): https://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959998013346908/\n\nSave games disappearing (this is my biggest issue at the moment, as you can see by my posts to the below threads):\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/594820656460543503/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540734168144496448/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/34095131971716840/\n\nLinux/Mac issues (there are too many of these threads to list them all):\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540736320066916724/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540732596570915707/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540734792154348290/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/540736780877897495/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959875998907603/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/233370/discussions/0/846959876007904035/\n\nEtc.\n\nMore examples can be found on the game's discussion page and I recommend reading through it. These issues have NOT been fixed, despite the game having been out for two years now.\n\nThis leaves the game unplayable for many people; whether you are going to be one of these people depends on your luck and on your operating system. Mac and Linux users seem to have the most issues. As the game is listed as being compatible on these operating systems, this is inexcusable.\n\nAs for the game itself (or the little I have been able to experience of it), the story is an obvious homage to Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot. The first chapter starts off slow, but quickly builds up suspense once the titular "Raven" makes an appearance. I have heard that the second and third chapters are a bit of a let down compared to the first chapter's conclusion. The puzzles are alright, but nothing memorable comes to mind. They mainly seem to revolve around using the right object in the right location. I didn't encounter any logic puzzles or truly creative solutions. There is some pixel hunting involved, which I found annoying in the initial train sequence (although it is possible to reveal hot spots in the game by using up "points", this locks certain achievements from being accomplished). The animation and movement in the game is frankly awful, but I was able to ignore it for the most part. It does not really compare well to contemporary medium-high budget games, and as such the standard asking price is a tad steep. I would write more about the game itself, but my save games were erased three times in a row and I have given up on making any progress beyond this chapter.\n\nBasically, if you play on Mac or Linux: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nIf you play on Windows... buy at your own risk. The first chapter seems decent enough; I can't personally comment on the final two chapters, but many reviews online seem to paint them in a rather mediocre light. Even if you do not encounter the technical issues that apply to Mac or Linux users, the game is still rife with random bugs which can impede your progress. I'd wait for a sale, or hope that the developers finally take notice of these issues and release a patch.\n\n\n\n\n","June 16, 2015","false","17.6"," 91 of 109 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","91","109","4","0"

The game has a lot of atmosphere for a very good story that is not transparent. I enjoyed the game very much, the graphics were well done and fit the time of the story very well. It's a pretty simple point and click adventure game, although sometimes it can be difficult to figure out how to advance in the game. Some thinking is required.  The voice acting was done very well in my opinion and the music through out the game was also very well done. Most of the schievements are pretty easy to get, one is difficult and you may need to find some help to get it done as it is a tricky one to get for most. I have over 20 hours in the game but 3-4 hrs of it were AFK time.  It is an enjoyable game without being to stressful so it's fun to just sit down and play it and see what you can figure out and enjoy the story. The only minus I can really give the game is some times the UI can be a bit clunky and getting your character to walk where you want them to can sometime be frustrating but not to the point it wrecks the game.  7/10","June 18, 2015","true","25.2"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

He eventually manages to get mixed up in an investigation against the Raven: master thief who plans to steal two Egyptian jewels.\nFrom this point on, we are treated to both a classic English style whodunit murder mystery on-board a cruise ship (a smaller homage to ‘Death on the Nile’), and a heist thriller where many people are not who they seem, and several well-crafted plans are at work at the same time, directly opposing each other. This is also the point where the story introduces the other protagonists, a young burglar couple.\nNot only the plot is great, but the characters as well. All of them have detailed, often tragic backstories, just like the best Christie novels. And they are played by talented English actors.\n\nSince the story tries to imitate Ms. Christie’s work, the puzzles are also straightforward and realistic, aided by a simple interface. Don’t expect an easy game though, because progress usually requires carefully examining every possibility before the game lets the player choose the correct one. The characters cannot run and many tasks are divided into dozens of small steps, yet the pacing is so good that the game never feels boring, and the 12-15 hours of play time just flies by pretty fast.","December 26, 2015","true","16.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","4"

As someone who's read and loved Agatha Christie, the constant references to her books, character and herself are simply adorable.\n\nThings I liked about it:\nThe plot felt like a tribute to Agatha Christie's mystery novels, even in certain apparently far-fetched plot twists. There are also nods to what became the "classic" plot in mystery novels. I loved it when one of the characters said something like "what do you think, we're going to come up with new surprise characters?" or similar. Even the cheesy romance that flourishes in the midst of adversity sounds like a nod to Christie's novels.\nThe music is very nice and goes well with the game.\nNO PIXEL HUNTING. No extremely absurd combinations of inventory items, like "oh, let me glue cat hair to a baby rattle to make a crossbow".\nThe voice acting is not outstanding, but it's good enough to keep you in the atmosphere.\nThings I didn't like about it:\nThere are several bugs. You get stuck walking but not moving, characters disappear in the middle of dialog, you disappear, objects disappear from your inventory, then they magically reappear. Sometimes you just have to restart from a previous save.\nThe graphics looked unfinished. Sometimes I could see the eyeball through the angle of the eyelid, details like that.\nThe movements were very awkward. Sometimes you arrive somewhere and have to examine an item, and for that, the character stops, turns left, stops again, turns a little more, stops again, then you have the animation of the character examining. Then, a pause, then the character's comment about it, then a pause, and then you can continue. It's not too bad, but it gets annoying after a few hours.\nThere aren't enough puzzles, though it's probably fair to say that I don't count as puzzle using a key to open a door, even though sometimes these things can be considered puzzles by others. The very few puzzles are generally too obvious, especially with all the help you get. Sometimes you examine an item, and the character comments something like "Oh, that would be useful to do this or that...".\nIn general, it's fairly entertaining and I enjoyed it, probably because the continuous references to Agatha Christie kept bringing a silly smile to my face. If I had to grade it, I guess it would be 7/10, though I'm not sure I'd grade it like this if I hadn't been a Christie fan.","September 12, 2014","true","15.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

Achievments for perfect scores are broken which annoyed me as I wanted to do a clean hintless run but it takes nothing from the game. Considering this was made during some downtime from The brilliant Book of Written tales you have to give it credit.

The puzzles are not that hard that you won't fallout of the story plot. The ending actually surprised me. I really didn't expect it. The Raven is your usual point and click game but instead of just clicking items and picking them, The Raven focuses more on investigating every detail. It means that you have to examine each item in the game many times until you exhaust all that could be examined.\n\nYou start as Anton Jakob Zellner, a Swiss Police officer, assigned to assist and accompany the famous inspector Legrand as you guard and protect the two jewel eyes that are to be exhibited in a museum in Cairo, Egypt. Your role is mostly what detectives (well, police officers) do in every crime scenes, INVESTIGATE and ANALYZE each situation along with the items available at the moment. The game offers some hints but if you want to be a master detective, you don't need to rely on those things. The game is divided into 3 chapters with each can be played independently from one another.\n\nSome Negatives:The only negative I could find is that the game sometimes have some bugs. Some click point areas are positioned ways off from the actual item and the game has a bit of bugs when you try to move your character through a narrow room. There are also times that your character can get stuck.\n\nThe game is quite pricey but I bought mine on a 75% sale and it was totally worth it.\n\nMy Personal Rating:Gameplay: 7.0/10\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9.0/10","January 23, 2015","true","14.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","4"

It's playable but you will encounter many critical bugs, such as being unable to transition between places because the KB+M control scheme doesn't work properly. You can end up stuck in one scene if you go back an area, unable to return. Animations are very jerky, with many characters looking like ugly puppets when they talk. Movement is slow, tedious and your character sometimes gets stuck into movement or going the other way around than the direction where you clicked. I had to swap to a gamepad control scheme a few times to transition between some areas and then go back to KB+M, because it's even worse than KB+M. For some reason, my game stopped adding new saves after 7 pages of it, which meant I had to manually erase old saves. Naturally, the game doesn't inform you of this upper limit, you get to find out the hard way it stopped recording your saves. And Alt+Tab can crash your game or leave it in a state where the only thing you can see is a dark screen.\n\nNext are some gameplay annoyances, some of which are unforgivable for a mystery adventure game. Your character has to walk to switch areas, instead of the standard double click for an instant area switch. When you click something, you can't cancel your movement midway. And since your character moves like a slowpoke, it's pretty irritating. Want to highlight what objects you can click? That'll cost you points, which you can accumulate by solving mysteries and advancing the story.  Oh, and it only highlights for like 1-2 seconds. So you better have eagle eyes and a good visual memory because otherwise, you just wasted those points for nothing.\n\nFinally, the only somewhat redeeming element of this game is its story. Sadly, while it starts strong, with your main character being a constable that seems to be based on Poirot. The quality of the story goes down the drain in the second and third chapters, as you switch to new characters, which are considerably worse and then you have to go back through the same story, except with a different POV. It felt like a chore. If I wasn't a perfectionist, I would have given up on this game during chapter 2. Also, it breaks a huge mystery rule, but I'll refrain from saying which because it would spoil the disappointing twist they had at the end.\n\nRecap: Don't waste your money on this, there are much better options out there when it comes to mystery adventure games.","November 22, 2015","false","12.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

So when I stumble across a gem like 'The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief' I wonder why on earth I haven't heard of it before now.\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\nI have no technical experience in making computer games.  I am purely a game player - the consumer.\n\nI am playing this game on a pretty powerful rig with a 29" Widescreen Monitor.\n\nThis is a review of the Steam Version of the game.\n\n\nHere's what I think:\n\nStory\n\nThe story is written in the style of an Agatha Christie novel with the obligatory twists and turns that just draw you further and further in.  In fact, it pays homage to probably her most famous work, 'Death on the Nile' with a touch of 'Murder on the Orient Express'.  Personally, I've never been good at whodunnits whether in book form or in the movies so no surprise then that I was guessing all the way to the end.  On the other hand I think this just goes to show the strength of writing.\n\nThe characters were well imagined and fleshed out.  They were likeable and made you care abut what happened to them.  The villains were over the top which reminded you that although you were in the middle of an intense confrontation it was just a game.  The tone of the game was well balanced.  Whilst being, in essence, a crime adventure there were lots of lighter moments and the characters were not without humour.\n\nGraphics\n\nWith the opening animated sequence and intro you just know that this game was a labour of love and not just a money spinner.  I think, as with any media format, that the first 3-5 minutes either hook you or sink it.  Well, this definitely left me wanting more.\n\nThe game's makers got the period spot on visually.  It was like wandering back into the 1950's.  The scenes are beautifully hand drawn and are rich in colour and detail.  The characters' costumes were well designed.  The only issue I had with the visual side were the characters' teeth.  This may have been a limitation of the software they were using as they looked far from natural.  Check out Lady Westmacott's companion.  Her teeth were scary looking!\n\nThere were some issues with continuity.  For example, one puzzle involves removing a bulb to use in another room.  Five minutes later the bulb has mysteriously returned.  Also, when you enter the treasure chamber in Cairo there is a video camera above the exit.  When Adil abseils down into that same room later in the game the camera has disappeared.\n\nI also had a few instances of graphical artfacts appeaing in certain scenes.  This suggests some kind of compatibility issue with my graphics card but as I've had no issue with other games the jury is out on this one.  Either way, it didn't affect the game in any serious way or my enjoyment.\n\nScore\n\nThe score was orchestral and would give any hollywood blockbuster a run for it's money.  It was evocative, upping the tempo when playing an action sequence whilst dropping the tone when someone was relating some sad event.\n\nSadly, for some inexplicable reason, there is no music playing when the credits roll.  I can only assume that this is a pretty big oversight as who would commission an orchestra to score their game and then leave it out completely when the credits roll?!\n\nVoice Acting\n\nAs I've said in other reviews, poor voice acting can turn a great game into a very average game if not worse.  It's 50% of your connection to the story, assuming that the visuals make up the other half.  Well, in this game they nailed it.  The voices were so natural that I barely had reason to even notice them in the same way as if you were watching a movie.  The voices matched the characters that were speaking, accents and all.  The warmth of Constable Zellner would be hard to beat.  I'm so pleased that the makers went for quality here.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis element let the game down significantly.  Although the interactive items within a scene were limited, the number of pixels that allows a user to activate the 'Item Label' was so small that finding some items was next to impossible and led to the much derised 'pixel hunting'.\n\nMoving from one scene to another or one room to another was just horrible.  This is a fundamental part of any game.  If a player can't progress to the next scene then it defeats the object of being a game.  In my mind, this was probably the most unforgiveable flaw.  How this got past all the beta testing beats me.  To move from one scene to the next involves some 'pixel hunting' and some patience.  The flaw wasn't consistent throughout the game as the flaw was more pronounced in some areas than it was in others.\n\nIt's a shame that Chapter 3 sees you controlling 2 additional characters.  After controlling Constable Zellner, the main protagonist, for 2 chapters it takes the game in an unusual direction.  The reason for doing this, amongst other reasons, is to avoid the typical 'Last Scene' in most Agatha Christie novels (at least in all the TV adaptations I've ever watched) of one long boring speech on how the crime was committed and then exposing the villain.  As I said, it's a shame that you have to switch characters but the makers made an interesting choice here and I think it works well.\n\nAn additional plus point was the balance between dialogue and puzzles, not too much of either.  Also, the puzzles were logical and of the right level of difficulty.\n\nThis Steam version generously offers some bonus features on completion of the game.  However, the most appealing feature for me, the soundtrack (not the score), didn't work.  You can highlight the track you want to hear but nothing happens.  So much for bonus features.  In my opinion it's really simple.......... don't offer what you can't deliver!\n\nFrom about the mid way point of the game I encountered some serious bugs which caused the game to crash.  These involved the controlled character disappearing or getting stuck in a spinning cycle.\n\nFrom my initial contact with them, the development team do seem interested in logging these bugs and have offered some basic support.\n\nPros\n\n*Classic Whodunnit Story\n*Great Depth\n*Interesting Characters\n*Logical Puzzles\n*Natural Voice Acting\n*Orchestral Score\n\nCons\n\n*Poor Gameplay Mechanics\n*Navigating Rooms\n*Bonus Material\n\nSummary\n\nDespite having some issues with the gameplay, I really enjoyed my time playing with these characters in the rich environments of the 1950's.  The story is engrossing and like any good novel will have you playing it again to pick up on the details you missed the first time round.  It very much depends on how much the gameplay issues impact on your first play through.\n\nIf you're an adventure gamer I can happily recommend this title but patience is definitely a requirement.  Patience is well rewarded with this game so go ahead and and give it a try.","September 20, 2015","true","15.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

A game so bad it could have been a possible cult favourite but it was created in an era of video games when point and click adventure games are outdated and no longer popular. The game took me 12 hours over the course of two days to play to full completion - including achievements. This, however, does not mean I was pleased by the experience; I was very happy for it to be over when it was.\n\nThe game starts off with an extraordinarily primitive display of CGI, rendered at no more than 15 FPS, and it wasn't my computer, because MSI Afterburner told me very clearly that my FPS was a stable 60. Considering how ugly it is there really is no excuse for the FPS to be so low. The cutscene drops a generic foreshadowing onto the story - something has been stolen from a museum in London, a treasure they may as well have called McGuffin's Family Jewels instead of the 'Eyes of the Sphinx'.\n\nYou start the game, which plays out in three chapters, in a train as constable Anton Jakob Zellner, a Swiss policeman. Your mission; finding the gentlemanly thief 'The Raven'. Generic? Yes. Motivating? I guess.\nThis really is as interesting as the story gets, unless you find un-elaborated shock reveals captivating for some reason. One person is working with or against one or the other person, in a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ of drama. Does it work as a story? Of course it ♥♥♥♥ing doesn't, it would require actually good writing to be pulled off and the studio hardly had the budget for that considering the CGI in the cutscenes. Not only that, but it's blatantly obvious that the English voice acting isn't quite well done and that the game's original language of German is ***maybe*** a better option. I don't know about that since I haven't played the game in German and most definitely have no intention to.\n\nThe puzzles aren't anything worth raving about either (hue), even if they are easily the strongest point of the game. They generally take place in confined environments and there are too many 'LeChuck's Rube Goldberg Machine'-esq puzzles where you are restricted to a chair and have to escape by causing a chain of 4-5 small events to occur in order to perform a miraculous escape. The game is extremely buggy and sometimes leaving rooms is a real pain and the character in control keeps standing still looking like he's about to soil himself. Actions sometimes take more than a minute to execute and characters on the screen keep going invisible or warping about on the scene.\n\nWhat's special about this game is that you play the same game twice, from the perspective of the Swiss constable and the thief with his accomplices. The ending is stupid and has no foreshadowing supporting it at all but yet another ridiculous twist where people were working with and against eachother all along.\n\nAll in all, The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a horrendous title, especially for its very unnecessarily high asking price. If you want a well executed detective point and click adventure game, try the Sherlock Holmes franchise from Frogwares.\n\n3.5/10, definitely not up to modern standards.","January 9, 2014","false","11.9"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","1"

The first episode and a half you follow Anton Zellner, an aging Swiss Police Officer trying to impress the Super Detective Legrand by helping him catch the Master Thief Raven. Zellner is a very pleasant character to follow (a welcome deviation from the usual 20 something point and click character), the voice acting is well-done, the music and settings very nice (some odd glitches here and there, but nothing major).\nThe puzzles are very simplistic, but mostly make sense. Since the storyline and the characters were interesting, I did not really care that the puzzles were so easy. An easy going game with a nice story I thought.\n\nIn the middle of the second episode you switch character and from there onwards the game loses steam. You play the same story, but from a different perspective. Unfortunately, this new perspective brings very little flavour to the story, and the simple puzzles suddenly seemed very tedious without any real story progression. Throw in a few “use the item two times for it to work even though the character gives no indication that would be the case” just to add to the frustration.\n\nBy the end I was bored by the game... but I persevered because I did want to know how the story ended. Rarely have I been so disappointed. The ending is just… so bad… so so bad. I really don’t think they could have managed to come up with a worse one without involving dinosaurs or robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nSo in conclusion; I really enjoyed the first one and a half episodes of The Raven and that’s why I’m still recommending it (if you can get it in a sale). But frankly, if you start getting bored after starting on the other half of the game, just quit. It doesn’t get better and the end is not worth playing the rest. Personally it makes me wary of episodic games in general. It really felt like they put most of the effort into the first part of the game and the other half was more of an afterthought where they wanted to reuse the same settings to keep costs down. It’s a real shame because they could have made some really great new IP here.","February 12, 2014","true","10.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Another really cool detail edition is, what you pick up is what you see, so your not "pocketing" huge items that somehow go into some magic bag that is held in suspension like a star trek transporter, its nice to see the person wearing major objects that wouldn't fit in a picket, eg you expect a wallet to be in the pocket but why a AXE or a something you wear...\n\nstory reminds me of Agetha Christie games mixed with secret files siberia and lost horizons, and actually provides stimulating situations without feeling overley static. The notebook updates as you go along, so even if it doesn't tell you to check, talking with NPCS about other NPCS will update the details on the other person so you can check out.\n\nGame help comes at a cost of point lost, which tells you how your score is, showing you interactions in classic mode deducts points, the same way asking for hint in objectives book does as well, at a higher cost.\n\nDowners, sadly I do have something negitive to report, the design of the game left out the ability to change scenes  or move scenes via mouse click, most adventure games allow you to change or move along  a scene location via edge of the monitor , sadly in this game doesn't do that, it changes scenes as you walk to the endge of the screen, which leads to frustration if you play in claassic mode, you can select to play with a gamepad that solves this issues as your stick controls the main figure, so you wont be stuck in area transitions, but that comes at a cost of showing you all the interactive parts of the screen, which takes the fun out of hunting for objects, I know they did this because it was released on consoles, but they should have made the right stick the free curser instead of just a object selector, takes the fun out of it, its the same reason i still play it and sherlock homes with the mouse, because i dont want to be told where all the objects are, so thus you either retry to move to areas or you accept being told what to do.\n\na game you should play, be prepared for a few furstrating click frustrations that are bound to get one or two people stuck thinking there is no further map to progress to when the main lead wont move to the  next area, but the story is decent and the game is entertaining.","January 26, 2014","true","20.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The plot is in no way complicated but it is above what we usually see in videogames. The characters are all likeable and the strings it pulls are darker than I expected for a mystery story with a thief main antagonist.\n\nThe weakest point of the game is the gameplay, which doesn't bring anything new to the genre and is buggy at times. It is hard to navigate comfortably through the environment, and I had to use a guide after being stuck for a while only to discover that I had encountered a bug instead of a puzzle.\n\nSadly, the character animation and modelling isn't as good as it could've been, and detracts a lot from the enjoyment of the game.

Patience is king here, but I guarantee you this will happen if you use an XBox 360 controller as I do.\n2)	On two separate occasions (once in Chapter 1 and once in Chapter 2) - the game glitches and you will have to restart a long sequence of actions, repeating steps that lead up to the freeze.\n\nOn item #2 above - this is extremely tedious and nearly boring.

For the most part, the player is never in any real danger. That said, it felt really natural playing as Constable Zellner, a sort of wannabe detective who gets involved in a jewel heist case.\n\nThe voice acting is quite good in the game, though there's not a huge cast. Across the game’s three chapters, you'll be running into a lot of the same characters and unravelling their personal stories. It was nice hearing varied accents from different characters for a transcontinental trip and while I may not be the best judge of European accents, I felt that the actor portrayals of the characters were some of the best I've heard in recent gameplay. Each actor's performance felt believable and appropriate. Zellner, the rich girl, and the Austrian violinist really stood out to me.\n\nAnother positive I can say about the game’s dialogue is that despite the dialogue choices themselves being mostly scripted, I never felt left out of the loop as the player. Any follow up questions I thought up based on something in a conversation, were available to talk about further. I never really had a moment where I was screaming at Zellner for not asking an obvious question.\n\nPuzzle-wise, the game is pretty solid as well. Most of the puzzles involve standard point and click mechanics such as find this, use that, combine this, etc. What sets the puzzles in The Raven apart from other similar games was that they felt very logical and satisfying. Analyzing crime scenes and overcoming obstacles played out in a creative, but sensible way: Need to open a locked car door? Find a wire and jimmy the lock.\n\nI did hit road blocks in a few puzzles for what seemed like unfair reasons. In one instance, I probably spent close to an hour trying to progress because I hadn't click something three times, revealing that I might want to use a specific item. Another time, I got stuck because of a translation issue for one of the puzzle items. Thankfully, these issues were not a huge issue and may have been avoided if I wasn’t playing past midnight.\n\nThe puzzles felt best in the game when they required a complex multi-step solution or when the puzzles used a mini-game style solution. I would really like to seen King Art focus on these kinds of puzzles in the future as they were highly memorable.\n\nOn the negative end, the game's presentation can feel rushed at times, with pathfinding completely failing at certain points in the game, requiring a restart of the program. Thankfully, there is a decent autosave feature so I never lost much progress, and I only ran into the issue a handful of times.\n\nAs far as plot goes, the game was a slight disappointment but still very enjoyable. The first chapter is fairly lengthy and really well done. The second chapter has some strange pacing and cuts away at a dramatic point to restart the game from the thief perspective. The third chapter is almost as good as the first, but felt a little rushed in terms of length and plot twists. The ending to chapter three was enjoyable, but felt a little thrown together, but I honestly feel that way about a lot of crime shows and books as well. Some things simply need to be explained away, rather than making sense I suppose. Overall though, the characters were really well done and it was a fun making the journey with them.\n\nJourneying with Constable Zellner was very amusing and made me feel like I was caught up in an old detective story such as Tintin and the like.\n\nThe Raven may not be for everybody, but those who are able to overlook some presentation issues and a slow pace, will find a great story and enjoyable puzzles and dialogue.","January 30, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Player plays as constable Anton Jakob Zellner and follows him on the adventure to reveal the identity of "The Raven", the notorious burglar who successfully stole the ancient "Eyes of the Sphinx". The story isn't so special, but the game managed to tell it through three characters' perspective which is a little bit different and unique. It does have some funny moments and the voice acting is excellent. Some characters are likeable, like Zellner, Patricia, the old lady or the kid; some are designed just to make you want to punch them in the face, like Legrand (uuuugh, I hate that ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) or the piano artist. IMO the story keeps getting better as the game progresses because of plot twist and unexpected moments. It's not so violent or mind-♥♥♥♥ed, but The Raven has its own unique and memorable story (the final twist is illogical, but I can live with it).\n\nI have a love/hate passion with The Raven's gameplay. First, it has old-school point-n-click style with puzzles and some minigames, puzzles are not too hard, but they're enjoyable, minigames keep the game from being repetitive with some fun challenges like lockpicking or playing shuffleboard (Matt is a MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HAX0R, he's OP as ♥♥♥♥, you'll owe him A LOT of ice creams). However, the game suffers from many technical issues, sometimes the game doesn't allow you to move your character out of a room because it's not shown on the screen, you have to lower the resolution to see it. Camera system is another problem, it only stands still in many angles and rarely follows your character as they move around, environments in the game are sometimes limited, so you will have a hard time moving your character because you'll have no idea where they're heading to.\nGraphics are not so impressive, but it isn't bad either, but there are 2 things that irritate me a lot, first, we have the WORST FACIAL EXPRESSION EVER in a video game, I honestly can't tell if Legrand is smiling while subtitle's showing "ha ha ha", female characters don't look good except Patricia. Second, I expected to see more beautiful landscapes and locations, because the story takes place in Paris, I love Paris, I want to see the Eiffel Tower, the Seine river, the Pont des Arts bridge, the Tuileries Garden and the Place Charles de Gaulle,... Do they appear in the game ? Nope. Instead you'll only see a cruise ship, a train and a museum, yay, I'd rather watch "A Monster in Paris" again... Good thing is the soundtrack is great, I'd recommend paying $2 more for the digital deluxe edition, the soundtrack alone is worth it.\n\nThe Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a good adventure game, recommended for anyone who's looking for a different kind of adventure rather than Daedalic and Telltale's games. For $7.5 it's a steal. 7/10.","January 24, 2014","true","19.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

This game has proven my assumption wrong.  The Raven presents a very interesting story and provided many twists and turns along the way.  I admit, I do have a bit of a penchant for crime/detective stories.\n\nOne critical comment I must make is that the controls can sometimes be a bit clumsy, sometimes requiring one to walk towards a "door" and then back away a bit or even occasionally take a second pass at it.  This might just be a side effect of my own lack of experience with this style of gameplay, however.\n\nI will be watching the developers, KING Art, for new additions to their catalog.","March 2, 2014","true","30.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The last two don't continue the story as per se, but rather retell parts of it.  I much rather would've had three separate stories.

There are also some achievements you might not get first round, as there are a few 'event triggering' actions which might make you miss doing something else (not essential for story).\n\nI'd recommend, but probably on special as I'm not sure it's worth full price with the pathing issues.","April 7, 2015","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is an extraordinarily well written old school point & click adventure game that plays just like a good crime novel would read. It has you guessing and second guessing up until the end as to the true identity of the Raven (and no, I didn't guess correctly). All the characters are extremely well written with some superb voice acting with a multitude of different European, American and English accents. Everyone has their own backstory and reason for being there - even the ones that don't seem significant at first.\n\nOver the three episodes you play through the events in the story twice from different perspectives. Things that seem unimportant or glossed over the first time round become clear when played again from a different perspective later. This isn't the first time KING Art has done something like this - The Book of Unwritten Tales had something similar towards the end of the game - saying any more would spoil it, but it was absolutely brilliant then, and it is absolutely brilliant now as well.\n\nThe only criticisms I have for this game are that there are a number of glitches in the game engine (which is also true of KING Art's previous games) - some are fairly minor graphical, audio and pathing glitches, and you can tell that the game has actually been programmed to work around many of them - if a character gets stuck for a few seconds they will teleport to where they are supposed to be. I did find that I often had some difficulty getting my character to move to the next screen, though that usually worked after a few attempts, however, on one occasion my character started turning around in a circle endlessly forcing me to quit the game - thankfully it had autosaved about ten seconds beforehand.\n\nDon't let these glitches put you off though - the game is so well written that these issues can easily be forgiven.

But not paying for a game doesn't mean playing said game is free. You invest more than 10 hours of your life into this. Which means that if the game is not good enough, even "free" can be expensive. Was it this time? Let's find out.\n\nWo bist du?\nYou play the role of a Swiss policeman in the hope that your final act before retirement would be to catch The Raven. The burglar who was responsible for stealing expensive jewelries earlier. So you find yourself in a point and click adventure game walking around and clicking on things. Later you also get control of other characters to be able to see the full picture and get to the end of the riddle.\n\nWe are the player\nWas it a good idea? Is it a good mechanics to reveal the picture by controlling multiple characters? From the immersion perspective, it isn't. I felt disconnected when I first realized that from now on I get to control someone else. However, from the story perspective, it is a good decision. Seems to be the most logical choice of storytelling once you know the whole picture. Which you don't until the last scene.\n\nWalk Like an Egyptian\nSo what do we have here?\n\nWe have a great music in this game, also we have a nice story and a great storytelling. And while I did not really like how the characters look like, I do like how the environment looks like. Not the most impressive looking thing ever, but still decent and it has its own charm.\n\nThen why did I put a "not recommended" seal to this game, you might ask. Unfortunately because of every other aspect of the game:\n\nYou make no decisions at all and what you do in one chapter of the game doesn't affect the happenings in the other chapters at all. You can't even play the game continously. Once you finished Chapter 1, the credits roll then you simply click "New Game" and you select Chapter 2 from there.\nYou can save. But don't be fooled. The save feature doesn't really saves your current progress instead it saves from an arbitrary checkpoint. And that checkpoint might had happened to be just a moment before your save or 15 minutes earlier. You never know until you reload your save and you realise you have no idea which point of the game you are at. And you also have to redo a lot of things.\nI found most riddles dumb. At a point you have a mirror. You want to look around somewhere using that mirror. So you take a radio antenna and stick the mirror to the radio antenna by using a candy you chewed to make it stick. I'm serious. And it holds for like 30 minutes or more. And there are more of these.\nThe movement around is horrible and makes your head ache. You are lucky if the character you control goes where you clicked. Otherwise they love teleporting, moonwalking, ice skating on the floor without having ice or a pair of skates, or just standing in one place and doing full rotations like a radar.\nThe animations are poorly done and the faces look like made of plasticine. If you wish to avoid nightmares, just follow this sanity-saving tip: whenever you think Mrs. Miller is going to smile, close your eyes.\nTL;DR\nGreat story with nice music. But for full price it doesn't worth the pain trying to get the characters go where you want them to go. Because they won't. I'm not entirely sure that even playing it for free worth it. Can't honestly tell you any scenario where you should be buying this game for real-life money. And that's really sad because the Poirot-mood is nicely catched.","May 15","false","11.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The story has a nice build-up with classic British mystery elements, however it all falls flat in the final chapter with a very anti-climatic conclusion. It felt like a cop-out to go that route. Other videogames have done this and it just does not sit well with me. It ruined the otherwise decent experience. As far as puzzles go it has some nice moments. Some frustration when you can't find an item you need to progress, but that's just part of the genre. The characters have nice personalities and voice-work. The game does control very clunkily, sometimes it's confusing to find out where to click to change screens etc.\n\nOverall it's a decent adventure game, but since this is a mystery game I had high hopes for the story. Unfortunately, this disappointed me so much that it left a bad taste in my mouth and leads to my negative recommendation.","August 19, 2014","false","8.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

Movement can be a bit sluggish and I really would not recommend playing it with a controller even though it has that option as examining the environment and selecting specific items, which is essential to the game, is extremely cumbersome with one in my view. It works perfectly fine with a mouse as you'd expect for a game of this type.\n\nThis is a really charming, old-school adventure that seems to offers a decent amount of gameplay.

Along with hints and hotspot locations this makes the game a fairly easy ride so you can enjoy the story.\n\nI've had a couple of times the game got stuck, but nothing a reload and 30 sec replay couldn't fix.\n\nMost of all I enjoy the twists and turns in the storyline, lots of fun surprises.","May 18, 2015","true","27.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game started out a little slow, but the characters are well developed throughout the story, unravelling mysteries beyond "Who is the Raven?" and "Wait, what? So who is the Raven really?" and "SERIOUSLY, WHAT? WHO?!"\n\nThe great storyline, the well acted characters with loads of personality, and the cinematic score make it a memorable--and--very replayable experience. This ain't no "hit it and quit it (at least for 2 years until you forget the plot)." As you progress through the chapters, you step in the shoes of the other characters--which really enriches the game. Going back and playing it a second time you'll pick up on a lot that you'd missed before, and that's actually part of the excellence of it. Something I also found nice was that you aren't required to complete everything possible before you move on; you can skip some things but still continue the story. Naturally, the completeness of the story will diminish, but that's why you play it again!\n\nThe only downsides are that the graphics are somewhat dated, even on the highest quality, and the cut scenes are lower quality than the in-game graphics. Which doesn't make any sense. The controls can be a little frustrating at times; I found it difficult to move about from room to room in the train especially, but you figure it out eventually. Fortunately there aren't any glitches that make it entirely impossible to move, forcing you to restart from your last save. That's a plus. Other than that, I only wish there were a couple more puzzles throughout the game. The first chapter is really heavy on the story-telling, which you can still opt to skip through if you're not much of a story person.. but why are you playing an adventure game if you don't like a good story, anyway? Crazy.\n\nTo suffice, it's a great adventure game with a well thought out plot that'll keep you interested, and everytime you think you know who the Raven REALLY is... well... you're wrong.","December 15, 2013","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbotijo/recommended/233370/","elbotijo","El Botijo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbotijo/","400 products in account","The short answer is that I liked the game. The long answer follows.\n\nIt is a point a click adventure that is divided on three chapters. You get to play different characters along the whole game, although I liked the first one the best: Constable Zellner. He reminds me of Detective Culombo. He keeps talking to all suspects, and at the end he gets to know who the guilty is. Although there is no bad decission on the game to make, the player is asked to give out the answers to various crimes. That keeps the game afresh in that you know you might give the wrong answer, even if that does not change the overall story a bit.\n\nThe game is slow paced, as with many other point and click games. Even in situations where the player character should be stressed, you can take all the time you want. There is the odd puzzle here and there, and some of the interface might have been done better. At some stage there is a door with washed out glyphs and no clear indication where the right position should be. There is no logical puzzle, like a sliding puzzle. Some people have complained about a single room where it was not obvious how to get outside.\n\nThere was one conversation puzzle I did not like, and that is because how far fetched it was. You are given four hints to four artists that should be related to four animals. If somebody asks you about A. Dürer, you probably would then link him to hares. However, the logical explanation given by the game is that Dürer draw some self-portraits, and that one of the most important ones is hanged in Madrid. Madrid then has in the city coat of arms a bear, so it is a bear then. A similar treatment is given to Picasso and Michelangelo. Thankfully, this puzzle is relatively short.\n\nChapter 3 has showed me some strange artifacts related to the technical side of the game. Pathfinding was not working all the times but the game recovered by moving the character to his or her final destination. Audio effects were also applied wrong and there was this scene where a character was not on the place she should be (player character walks over she!). However, I did not find any serious bug.\n\nThere are some things that could have been done better. Let me start with the hint system. You are given thousand adventure points at given plot points. You can then spend hundred points for a hint, many times for things you already did. You can also spend ten points in order to locate all objects you can interact in the room. The problem is that they are made only obvious by a magnifying glass. This hint would not be a problem if the magnifying glass would be more visible and did not disappear so fast. Other games have a more noticeable icon, or at least a bright color that is easy to spot.\n\nThe other thing that would need to have been reviewed is the game save system. Both autosave and your manual saves can send you to one or two actions on the past. It is usually not a problem, but it is not expected. I had no corrupted game save or anything like that.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I liked the story far way more than the interface or some of the puzzles.","January 28, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some light puzzles, none of which I found very complicated (old hands at these types of games will have no trouble breezing through it), and a bit of mid-game twisty-turny stuff that I wasn't expecting, but otherwise there aren't a great deal of surprises here. Still, the story is what counts in an adventure game, and this one -- mostly a tribute to the works of Agatha Christie -- is pretty decent. I'm fairly gullible, so the few twists that popped up genuinely surprised me, which was nice, as was the ending.

As a person who likes the idea of adventure games, mainly the emphasis on storytelling, I'll be honest and say I am by no means a pro of the genre. Often I find point-and-clicks exhausting and puzzles too farfetched to get any kind of enjoyment out of finding the solution. You won't really have those sorts of problems with this game. The puzzles are not at all challenging, often times with characters flat out telling you what to do with what just by inspecting an item, and many of the solutions can be arrived at by exhausting all your dialogue options. For me, the lack of difficulty was somewhat disappointing, but I appreciate that I was able to keep the plot moving without getting stuck every couple of puzzles or so.\n\nThe story itself is entertaining for a majority of the game, a burglary mystery with some murder thrown in, and I enjoyed the fact that you were able to see the sequence of events from multiple character perspectives. The playable characters were likable enough and you are also joined by a cast of quirky side characters who, for the most part, stay with you throughout the playthrough. Sadly, several are rather underutilized. Probably left in just to keep you guessing 'whodunit?' however unlikely their culpability seems. Worst of all, the ending was utterly disappointing for me, so the conclusion may leave you with a sour taste in your mouth.\n\nI really enjoyed most of the game as it has a lot going for it: a charming art style, good music, superb voice acting, and interesting characters but all that gets dragged down by a plot that falls a bit flat in the end. The gameplay itself can be a bit buggy with awkward character animations, but I only had to reload one time, so I hardly noticed. I wouldn't steer anyone away from this game, just don't expect anything too remarkable. Perhaps wait for it to go on sale.\n","January 25, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the other one-and-a-half episodes and you get to play it all again from another perspective, with a proper resolution to it all. The resulting problem is that essentially there are only three different environments in the game, which all are rather small and wear out quickly, especially with that kind of recycling.\n\nWell the heist story itself is nice and consistent, but not so special. What makes it interesting is to see it all from the perspective of side characters. You play neither the mastermind nor the star detective.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a usual point-and-click adventure. There is not much to say about it, except that you often have to click items multiple times to perform necessary actions or get essential information, this can be quite irritating. Also it can sometimes be troubling to switch the camera position so that you can walk across the room.\n\nThe Raven seems to suffer from the episodic release model. The first episode is done relatively well, but the ohter episodes seem to be rushed out. The character animations are often awful and a couple of simplifications were made, which in result make these episodes also appear to be shorter than the first one.\n\nHowever, the game is rather atmospheric, it looks quite pretty (except for a third of the character animations) and the voice actors do a great job.\n\nConclusive, I would not pay 25€ for the game since it lacks quality, but if you are looking for a nice heist story told in an interesting way and you can overlook some major flaws, then give it a shot.","March 11, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a result the second chapter of such games is released on a relaxed note and not as good as the first one. Here flow of money generally almost stops which leads to devil-may-care attitude of developers to the remained chapters. And this is what we see in this game exactly.

The plot has its ups and downs, mostly ups as it kept me interested. But once you stop playing as Constable Zellner, the game flashbacks and the plot plays out as another protagonist, Adil.\n\nThe Raven is about the aging Constable Anton Jakob Zellner, of the Swiss police, a respectable and courteous man trying to do the right thing, but also ambitious and over-eager. He takes on the job of overseeing transportation of a jewel from Zurich to Venice, via Orient Express. Along the way, he meets Inspector Legrand, a French Interpol agent, the man who caught The Raven, shooting him dead, years earlier. He also meets several other characters whom he helps out while helping guard the jewel. One of the specific characters is worth mentioning, Lady Westmacott, who is, what I assume, partially based on Agatha Christie, and for good reason. The mysterious plot, characters, and dialog read out like an Agatha Christie novel, where Zellner resembles her most famous character Poirot.\n\nBut the great writing and plot development are only there for the Chapter 1, and half of Chapter 2. Througout Chapter 1 and half of Chapter 2, you control Zellner as you travel from Zurich to Venice. From Venice, you board a ship that takes you to Cairo. And in Cairo, you explore a museum and hunt the Raven for a final showdown.\n\nIf I had to sum up the plot while only following the events of Zellner, who is easily the most likable character that also has the best voice actor (some of the other voice actors are atrocious, specifically Adil.) But on the train, without giving too much away, you help characters go about their day and you also end up being the hero of the day when a bomb goes off within the train. On the ship, you solve a murder. And then at the museum, you have your big finale.\n\nThroughout the game though, you'll run into Legrand and Constable Oliver, from London, who try to sway you away from trying to catch the Raven. I felt that Legrand found you incompetent.\n\nThe other protagonists are Adil, whom is suspected as being the Raven's aid, and is later proven to be when he knock's Zellner out on the ship. His story revolves around him being instructed what to do in his attempt to get the jewel. You control him for half of Chapter 2 and most of Chapter 3. The other protagonist is Praticia, a blonde British woman. I won't give anyting away about her.\n\nAbout the game itself, gameplay and whatnot, the first Chapter has flawless sound, pretty good animation, and very few gameplay bugs. It's clear that the developers spent the most time there as nothing strange really happened.\n\nIn Chapter 2, there are a few bugs and once you take control of Adil, you can tell where they rushed texturing as the background mountains while on the train are clearly unfinished paintings.\n\nChapter 3 had a ton of bugs that were pretty funny. And the walk cycle animations were kind of horrid.\n\nI will say that some of the faces on the characters are ugly, specifically the kid Matt, and his mother. A lot of the other prop models and textures were pretty nice though. One thing I also noticed was the lip syncing; while timed well, the o and u vowels, when spoken, didn't shape like o and u, just a and e, made it look very unbelievable for a 2013 game.\n\nSo, I loved the plot, most of the gameplay, (point and click detective style and puzzle solving) and the locations and some of the characters were interesting.\n\n8.8/10","March 15, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was looking for a good storytelling and a brilliant plot. Unfortunately none of those could be found in the game, and the reasons are multifold.\n\nTo have a good gaming experience the game mechanics should not stay on our way. Unfortunately - it does.

It's a nice, Agatha Christie style story of a thief and a capturer where player plays both sides and gains both perspectives. I can tell I enjoyed it a lot, there were, however, some aspects typical for most of the point & click genre that can throw off a casual player. I'd give it 8 out of 10 points if it wasn't that damn long - you can feel the story was stretched in a very artificial manner to split it into several episodes; could easily be squished in one.

Has the Raven returned from the dead, or is this just the work of a copycat?  And why has his modus operandi changed to include violence, something which he avoided previously?\n\nInspector LeGrand, feted for his part in the apparent termination of the Raven previously, is put in charge of both the case and also of guarding the other Eye Of The Sphinx during its long and perilous trip from London to Cairo, where it is to be displayed, via The Orient Express and luxury ocean liner.  However, you do not play as Inspector LeGrand, or even his eager sidekick from Scotland Yard.  No, instead you are Constable Anton Jakob Zellner - an elderly, balding overweight Swiss policeman whose presence on board the Orient Express is the bare minumum of assistance that the Swiss government could provide and who hitherto has never done anything more exciting than walk the same beat every day of his working life - an extremely unlikely hero at first glance and which does make for a bit of a slow start to the game, with plenty of talking and very little action.\nIt is not until about 20 minutes in that you come across a character called Lady Westmacott, the expy of a certain other real life massively successful classic British crime author and you begin to  understand that you find yourself in a lovingly constructed homage to the works of Agatha Christie.  Constable Zellner is a huge fan of her work and it soon becomes apparent that he shares several traits with that of her most famous fictional detective "Monsieur Partout".  He has a logical mind and a keen eye for human behaviour, and it is this that helps him get under the skins of his fellow passengers, one or more of whom may be a great deal more than they appear.\n\nIn contrast with the obsessed Inspector LeGrand, he is convinced that this Raven is nothing more than a copycat and in his own quiet way is just as determined to bring him to justice.  He is also aware that this adventure may be his last chance to accomplish something worthwhile in his life, as retirement is looming and he is in poor health anyway.  "If I don't do anything exciting I might have a few more years to live?" he asks, before dropping his heart tablets in the ocean while preparing to disobey orders and sneak onboard the SS Lydia to search for a stowaway.  His adventures will end up taking him all the way to the catacombs of Cairo, while along the way he will save a young boy from a runaway train, survive being bombed, chloroformed, drugged and concussed (not necessarily in that order), solve the locked room murder of a Baroness on the high seas - which enabled me to live out my dream of gathering a group of suspects together before outlining my deductions - before finally unmasking the Raven.\n\nHowever the game then abruptly switches narrative, changing its viewpoint to that of not one, but two different characters whose plots run parallel to that of the good Constables, overlapping with it at crucial junctures.  The trouble was that by then I was really enjoying my time spent in the comfortable and soothing presence of Constable Zellner that this change of viewpoint was initially disappointing and, although it did explain more fully several key events, the game did lose some of its idiosynchratic charm in the process.  One thing it did do well though is to shed new light on some of the games wide and varied cast.  For example a character that is pretty much a one dimensional comic relief type in Zellner's playthrough is revealed as being old, tired and unwell and very much aware that his presence onboard ship is neither needed or particularly wanted by the crew he is supposedly in charge of, and another unsympathetic character confesses that they realise just how hollow their life is, that they are estranged from their family and that they keep their father's pistol on hand for when they want to end it all.  All the separate plot strands then meet together for the climax leading to a twist ending that, while containing at least one giant plothole and relying a little too much on coincidence, was for me perfectly satisfying.\n\nAs for the gameplay, one thing I did like was the puzzles.  While some of them may be a little obscure and it is worth mentioning that some of them require you clicking on an object twice as your protagonist may miss details the first time, they are for the most part logical and usually involve common objects that you would expect to find in the immediate surroundings.  So while there is nothing here as brain melting as something you might find in the Sam And Max series for example, this can have the side effect of making proceedings a little too simple, there will be very few instances where you will be genuinely stuck.  The score, provided by the Brandenburg State Orchestra is wonderfully filmic and, while the visuals can be workmanlike, the vocals are absolutely spot on, with the characters sounding exactly how you would imagine them to.\n\nNow to the bugs.  A quick scan of both the forums and other reviews of this game can soon unearth some real horror stories and to be fair all the glitches should have been sorted out months ago.  I don't know if I was lucky or if the patches have done their job, but apart from difficulty moving from one screen to another in various spots and one instance where I clicked to perform an action and was then stuck in a loop of a character wandering round in circles until I force closed the game down I managed to get through ok.  It is still worth saving regularly though, just to be on the safe side!\nIn conclusion then, a game with a few rough edges, but the strength of the writing and of the characters make it well worth your time.  If it was an Agatha Christie novel, it wouldn't be a blockbuster like Murder On The Orient Express, but one of her lesser known yet solid efforts like A Mysterious Affair At Styles, perfect for a rainy afternoon's escapist fun.","June 20, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I haven't had much practice with the lateral thinking so this game took me longer because I would get stuck on certain puzzles. While challenging, I did enjoy the puzzles though only having the ability to select relevant items is almost like cheating since you know they must somehow interact together. For a summary of the pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n-There are some bugs with the character's movements. Especially when trying to transition between rooms. This can quickly become infuriating because you spend your time staring at the courser while slowly scanning the game screen to find an area that will let you say "Move to other room". It's really bad in Chapter 1 but be aware and push through it.\n-One of the scenes in the other chapters are from a birds eye, which is great for an overview of the room but it's significantly harder to know where you should click to interact with people or items.\n-There is one case with your inventory where you pick up an item and you must click it in your hand rather than access it from your inventory in order to use said item. While this only happens once, it is rather frustrating.\n-There is not a smooth transition to the next chapter. You have select "New Game" and choose the next chapter. So if you haven't saved your progress in a different place so you can get OCD completion, it's a little irritating. And you don't really feel like you can play the whole story through.\n\n\nBut those are mostly my nitpicks. Now to the pros.\n\nPros:\n-The voices become really strong as you progress and they stay true to the character throughout the story.\n-A lot of story with really strong character development available and if you just want to skip through the words, just keep clicking the left mouse button.\n-The first two chapters end with really strong cliffhangers so I had to power through the early mornings and finish the game. Totally worth it and I loved the story.\n-You can use what you learned from the previous investigations to tell the story of what happened. You get an achievement and it feels fun rubbing it in Legrand's face.\n-There are pretty awesome twists to the story. I did not see most of them coming and it was really a nice, detailed and heart warming story.\n-This is a slight spoiler but I won't share all the details. You do change what character you follow during the story. You don't control the change, the story does. This does give you a really nice opportunity to hear other people's views and you learn the full story with better details.\n\n\nIn summary; a really nice mystery game that is worth getting. Replay is kind of low but the story is really good and taking the time to figure out the puzzles on your own is worth it. If there was a continuation of any kind, I would definitely buy it.\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The plot of the game is fairly well written, the puzzles mostly make sense, and the voice acting is usually not the bad.\n\nHowever, it falls short repeatedly when looked at from a technical viewpoint, which surprising as a point and click shouldnt have a lot of technical failures. First off: all camera angles are fixed, and they quite often -refuse- to change to match your character's location. I'll find myself clicking to an area off to the left, for example, and the character wil just walk against an invisible wall and never make any progress in that direction. I eventually found that, to make the camera shift to the left, I had to move my character to the RIGHT which made no sense. Furthermore, there are moments where the game will essentially freeze up or deny progress. Upon examining an object of the scenery, my character walked up to it, bent over to look at it, and vanished, forcing me to reload a save, and at one point my character just got stuck walking in place. To this I'd usually say 'well, just save the game a lot' but even that isn't a reliable counter measure as the game has, in one istance, just straight up deleted all save from the last 3 hours of gameplay. Its very frustrating, especially since I DID want to beat the game. And even though the game is not very graphically intensive even at the higher resolutions, I had to put it at the lowest setting possible just to make it function smoothly, and my laptip gets REALLY heated up when running this, even though my latop can play more graphically intensive games just fine.\n\nOverall, while the story and setting are interesting, the developers very much lacked the technical skill to properly put together a videogame. I think The Raven would just have been better off as a movie or something, because its too frustrating to navigate as a videogame. I liked the things that worked well, but I wouldn't recommend it to other players.","April 13, 2014","false","11.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Chapter 1 was excellent and that would be a 9/10. You started to learn aboout the characters and a real mystery was being developed. It was one of the funnest adventure games I've ever played, until about the middle of Chapter 2. I don't want to spoil it, but there is a massive cliffhanger that completely stops the story's progression and makes you play everything again from the villain's perspective for the rest of the chapter. This isn't such a bad thing, in fact it was pretty interesting, but playing as Constable Zellner for 1.5 out of 3 chapters so far and then playing as some other character for the next half of the chapter severed me from the game's flow. Also, the story didn't go any further because of the sudden stop when being Constable Zellner. As this new character I had to explore the same areas that I already did with Zellner, which was a little boring. In addition to the character swap, Chapter 2 was pretty short compared to Chapter 1. Furthermore, the devolpment of the 3rd party characters was completely halted. Then, in Chapter 3, you continue playing as yet another character in addition to the second character for the rest of the game. It was very dissapointing that I could no longer be the character I started with. I was just re-exploring areas I already explored, which was quite boring. The 3rd party characters develop a liitle more, but some of them never finish developing. That cliffhanger from the middle of chapter 2 that seemed like it was the middle of the story, nothing ever progressed past that point. Once the point was got to, there was a horrible ending that completely contradicts a lot of the things that you've done before and a lot of the conversations you had. I am not going to spoil it, but the ending ruined the game.\n\nAlthough their are some major story errors, this game still keeps your interest and at least Chapter 1 is completely amazing.\nIf you are a fan of point and click adventures and don't care to much about the story, this game should be good for you. It is challenging and despite the story errors it is still fairly fun and worth playing to the end anyways. This is a pretty mixed game, with good and bad features. But if you are looking for a really great point and click adventure game, I'd recommend Monkey Island or Deponia.","February 8, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

All three chapters are now available, but when it first went on sale, only the first chapter was available.\n\nThe first chapter was a delight, Right from the start, the music set a wonderful tone for a classic mystery. The puzzles were generally fairly logical, and the game gave you tools to reduce the amount of find-the-pixel required to find objects to interact with. The characters were voiced a little over-the-top, but the dialog was well written and charming. It was a little buggy, but not game breaking. All-in-all, the first chapter set a marvelous mood and made a promising start for this mystery.\n\nThe second chapter maintained a lot of the good qualities of the first, but it started to feel rushed. The quality of the dialog seemed to slip just a little, and the bugginess showed a little more. Most of all, it felt short. In spite of the brevity of the adventure, I still found myself cursing at the slow pace that our hero would waddle from screen to screen. I could double-click to skip some of the walking sequences, but not all of them. It felt like an artificial method to lengthen the short chapter. However since all three chapters were included in one price, I was willing to withhold judgement of the brief second chapter so long as there was a good conclusion.\n\nMy hopes for a decent final chapter were dashed. The third chapter was by far the worst of the lot. The main character would frequently get stuck moving between two objects required to solve a puzzle, and start turning around in circles. Once this happened, the only way I found to stop him/her was to reload the game. The assets were largely reused from the previous games. It was short, the dialog was unconvincing, and the puzzles had lost any semblance of cleverness, originality, or logic. The plot twist at the end was predictable in the way where you think to yourself, "I really hope it doesn't end this way, because it is the worst of tropes, and ruins the earlier parts of the game," but end that way it does.\n\nIt seems like the developers put their best effort forward for the first chapter to get the positive reviews for an incomplete game. Then effort and funding dropped off for the remainder of the game. I do not recommend this game, and will not be purchasing any more games by King Art that are released in serial.","March 28, 2014","false","13.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Just not good enough to warrant its price, and likely that you can find many better games in the genre.\nAside from a never-ending supply of technical bugs (there are apparently *less* now than there used to be and it's still kind of a trainwreck) the story of the game fails majorly in one regard, and I'll get to that first. The main issue is that halfway through the game (and the second chapter) you basically know everything that's going to happen in the plot save the last 5 minutes of chapter 3. Because the entire second half of the game is one long flashback. Basically showing how the villain's plan was pulled off in what we see in the first half of the game. A lot of this is tedious and uninteresting; the developers would have been better off having the villain explain how the plan succeeded or at least picked up the pace of this section. I don't need to see/perform every single action slowly removing the mystery of the plot. The point where the flashback occurs also leaves a massive cliffhanger, which is, again, not resolved until 5 minutes before the game ends. I just feel the story could be much better organized than it ended up, which is a big fault in a game that's 50% story.\nTechnical bugs in this game include stiff animations, characters magically jumping from one point to another, getting stuck on objects, a room or two that's hard to find your way out of, an instance of dialogue sound levels being near-mute, and many, many more, but just these off the top of my head. It's mostly in the animation, yeah, but I was once in a scenario where the only solution was to save and reload because an item didn't properly appear in my inventory when it should have (which thankfully it does after you save and reload but it's a bit worrisome regardless.)\nSo. The gameplay fails on a technical level. The story fails on a written level. All in all... the game still manages to be decent fun in spite of this. The puzzles are never too obscure and there's an in-game hint system if you get stuck. The characters for the most part are well-written and there's some great dialogue between them. The mystery of the plot is well-presented (at least in the first half of the game) and the identity of the Raven is well-obscured without being entirely impossible to work out (I didn't, but playing through the second time I spotted some of the tells, which is a sign of a well-written mystery). One thing that irks me still is the game's insistence on what a true mystery novel should be (as spoken by a character who writes mystery novels). It's a tad preachy and it fails in its own regards at being a good story in some aspects making it hypocritical. That aside though, the story is good ignoring the horrible decision to make half of it redundant.\nI can't recommend this game though because it's fairly pricy (the same as Telltale's recent offerings!) and there's just much better in the genre.","April 4, 2014","false","15.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The characters are interesting, from the Hercule Poirot-like main character to the various passengers you'll interact with, including a genre-savvy mystery novelist who may as well be Agatha Christie (it's easy to tell where their inspirations came from), and the mystery and intrigue that the first episode builds up seems like it's going to be a great time. But then episode 2 strolls along, and the story ends about halfway through it - the entire rest of the game, including all of episode 3, is essentially a recap detailing the events from the perspective of two other characters. Everything after the middle of chapter 2 is just a downward spiral, both in the storytelling and in the actual game stability, with episode 3 being a rollercoaster of moments where you can get stuck in a walk cycle and have to force the game to close. The reveal of the villain isn't just uninteresting, it's practically insulting; at one point in the game, while talking to the mystery novelist, the main character is discussing her thoughts about the culprit and she replies "This isn't one of those cliche mystery novels where the culprit is someone who isn't introduced until the end - it's likely someone you already know well!", and yet that is exactly what happens. The game has little side-puzzles and optional things you can do throughout it, but none of them matter because despite being episodic the game doesn't actually link the episodes like most do; you have to start a new game and choose a new episode for each one. The Raven showed a lot of promise initially, but underneath its mask there wasn't a master thief, just disappointment and regret.","January 15","false","10.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

This is terrible because there's no way to interrupt a long monologue once it has started, and you can click one pixel off and trigger the same whole discussion again with no way to stop.\n\nFinally, the main character is annoying. I didn't want to be that guy. Many of the choices presented were ones where I didn't want to do any of those things, and you can't abort a conversation early.

I don't want to give away too much, it comes down to things like the personalities of the characters, the excitement of the story, and the cleverness of the puzzles.\n\nThe Raven is a fun Mystery/Puzzle game so far. I would recommend this game if you like Mystery or Puzzles.","January 5, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I found the first one to be the worst of all, it was so damn small that it made moving the character around real tedious. Something all locations had in common was that often when you directed your character to look at something s/he would walk around in a circle first and still end up with their back to the object and instead turn only their head around.

The voice acting is passable at least but for the choice for Adil.

I was waiting for exciting build up but when it came time to reveal it, it felt almost cheap. The puzzles were straight forward, not too hard not too easy. Episodes two and three had a lot of bugs and at one point was game crippling. The achievements didn't work correctly which annoyed me because I should have had max score, and I don't think I want to try again to get them.

The storyline is one of its strong points, with enough loose ends and red herrings to keep you playing just to find out what is going on. In terms of the challenge, the majority of the puzzles are of the point and click variety (Broken Sword) instead of the mini-games vaeriety (7th Guest). The backgrounds and settings are gorgeous- it is obvious that a lot of effort and research has been done for the game, and it shows.\n\nI particularly appreciate that the solutions to the puzzles are logical and make sense, instead of being ludicrously far-fetched so as to increase the difficulty level.\n\nCons wise- The character animations I feel do not do justice to the excellent voice acting. It can be particularly jarring when, for example, you have to sit through several minutes of conversation with Mrs Miller whose jaw appears to be dislocated. And some of the male characters appear to sidle across the floor in an effeminate manner. Other have mentioned bugs in the game but I personally did not come across any.\n\nPlay this game if you want to relax with a good mystery story, lush settings and logical puzzles. A good way to spend a quiet evening.\n\n10/10 would play again","December 19, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you're role playing a character, it's annoying to then suddenly lose all control of who that character is and what he's doing. I felt like I had control of the characters and could choose who they were - at least to some extent - and the ending felt more than a little forced. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the game. The voice acting was really good for the most part, and the story was entertaining. It also had the unique quality that you felt like it could actually happen, almost. Most games like this rely on fantastical magical boxes that couldn't ever actually work.

It is an absolute must for any adventure gamer. I'm halfway through episode one and the game I have played so far is what other developers are selling as complete titles. And I still have many, many hours to go. Very clever game, makes you think, great music, makes you feel like you are inside a captivating mystery novel. (A.C. - Which the game pays respects to, constantly)\nHOWEVER\nIt has very frustrating technical problems. Aside from the difficulty of moving around, the game literally gets stuck at certain screens and since there are no autosaves, you lose a lot of time that you have invested in the game. The first time it happened to me, the screen completely froze and I had not saved it so I quit and did not return to the game for months. Now that I have returned and progressed more, I am once again stuck in a screen that I cannot get out of.

Very colorful and vibrant. Love mystery adventures and this one seems like its right up my alley. Has the flavor of most of the The Adventure Company games. This one just seems more polished and well done.  Load times between scenes are a tad long but liveable.  Typical adventure game mechanics, point to walk to a point, investigate everything around you, speak to everyone. Very heavy in dialogue but thats not a bad thing, it does keep your attention as its not particularly wordy, just  a lot of back and forth discussions.

It is an absolute must for any adventure gamer. I'm halfway through episode one and the game I have played so far is what other developers are selling as complete titles. And I still have many, many hours to go. Very clever game, makes you think, great music, makes you feel like you are inside a captivating mystery novel. (A.C. - Which the game pays respects to, constantly)\nHOWEVER\nIt has very frustrating technical problems. Aside from the difficulty of moving around, the game literally gets stuck at certain screens and since there are no autosaves, you lose a lot of time that you have invested in the game. The first time it happened to me, the screen completely froze and I had not saved it so I quit and did not return to the game for months. Now that I have returned and progressed more, I am once again stuck in a screen that I cannot get out of.

A fairly uncomplicated, unfussy point-and-click adventure that is relatively short and not hugely challenging (compared to some absolutely evil puzzles that can be found elsewhere in this genre) but nonetheless, the story is interesting and fun to try to solve as you go along, the voice acting and scripting is really good and the soundtrack is great too. There's an occasional glitch here and there when the characters are walking around and get temporarily stuck on their surroundings which gets a little tiresome, plus the controls aren't the most intuitive, but since the game is so charming overall, I put it down to being a quirk.\n\nI'd recommend sticking this on your wishlist and getting it when it appears on sale - my opinion is that, despite really enjoying The Raven, I think £25 is a little steep for what is a casual, lightweight point and click adventure. I picked it up when it was 75% off and I think I got a bargain.","October 1, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you're role playing a character, it's annoying to then suddenly lose all control of who that character is and what he's doing. I felt like I had control of the characters and could choose who they were - at least to some extent - and the ending felt more than a little forced. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the game. The voice acting was really good for the most part, and the story was entertaining. It also had the unique quality that you felt like it could actually happen, almost. Most games like this rely on fantastical magical boxes that couldn't ever actually work.

The puzzles are logical (for the most part) and make sense in the game world, but somehow often felt mechanical and uninteresting.

It's clearly an homage to Agatha Christie and made by people who genuinely are fans of that style of mystery. It will seem a bit dull at first, but there's a brilliant twist about half way through the game that will make you reexamine everything you think you've seen up to that point. There's a second twist at the very end that is much less brilliant and, while clearly intended from the beginning, is much less clever than the designers seem to think.

If you haven't managed to get past the first chapter, I highly suggest you try and push through it. The story is fantastic, with some extremely memorable characters and a wonderful intervweaving of complicated events.\n\nHowever, there is one major problem you should be aware of: the controls are terrible. If you're not the sort who has patience for battling through difficult controls, you won't be able to appreciate this game. You also may not be able to play it without a controller. At all.\n\nThere are several scenes where clicking to go go the next screen simply does not work. It absolutely will not work. The only way I've managed to make it work is by plugging in a controller and using that to move the character. And that only works... intermittently. It's only a few specific screens that have this problem, but they recur often enough to be incredibly annoying. Plus, you can't even simply play with a controller the whole time, because there are other screens in which you can't select certain items without using the mouse. So I basically had to play the whole game switching back and forth from the mouse and controller. Moving with a controller is also very awkward and often just doesn't work.\n\nI have a lot of patience, so this wasn't enough to ruin the game for me. I'm all about story and character, so if that's what you love about these sorts of games, I highly reccommend it to you. But if you are easily frustrated by bad controls or put more weight into gameplay than character and story, then I'd suggest you pass.","October 25, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMajin/recommended/233370/","TheMajin","The Majin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMajin/","673 products in account","The Raven - Legacy of A Master Thief is an adventure game from King Art, the makers of "The Book of Unwritten Tales". I feel the biggest strength of the game rests in the narrative. If you enjoy mysteries or detective work, or just point and click adventures you may enjoy this game. The narrative starts strong with well developed characters and strongly written dialogue, and continues to be strong throught chapters one and two. Unfortunately, I feel the last half of the final chapter is handled clumsily from combined narrative and gameplay standpoint and as a result the ending is underwhelming. I have no problems with with the story itself, but rather the way all player agency was removed in the final portion of the game.\n\nStill this is about 5 minutes of a game I spent many hours on, so in the overall perspective the rest of the hours were spent with good logical puzzles, conversations, voicework, and narrative.\n\nThe only real draw back I had to the game I discovered was with navigation between scenes, especially in the first chapter on train and one particular screen on the ship. It was not a problem in the other two chapters. However in either the end of chapter 2 or beginning of chapter 3 I had issues with the character walking in place for several seconds before completing and action. This happened several times. The screen navigation issue can be frustrating at times so be aware that it takes some getting the hang of but does improve. The second did not influence my opinion and may have been a unique bug.\n\nI own the digital deluxe edition. The value in the that will depend on wethere or not you want the soundtrack. The making of book is good for a read, King Art clearly puts time and love into their adventure games as seen with both this and the series of "The Book of Unwritten Tales" games. There is not much to the story books, and nothing that is not revealed in game in one form or another.","February 4, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly, the games biggest con was a pro for me, the puzzles are very easy and there are very few of them. Rather than puzzles the gameplay is all about talking to people, finding items, and figuring out where and how to use said items. The animation is also somewhat janky sometimes and the characters move pretty slowly.\nWith the cons out of the way, the majority of the voice acting is wonderful and the story is really intertesting, in my opinion. It's a pretty lighthearted story, overall, but it has enough twists to keep you guessing. Especially around the last chapter, I had plenty of moments that made me go, "Whaaaat?" I also really liked how you played the story as different characters and experienced the plot from different angles.\n\nIf difficult puzzles are why you play adventure games, I'd say skip this one. but if you enjoy the stories and characters of adventure games, this is very worth picking up. Completely worth the $25 price tag but a must buy, as far as I'm concerned, if you find it on one of the Steam seasonal sales","April 15, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are logical (for the most part) and make sense in the game world, but somehow often felt mechanical and uninteresting. It rarely felt rewarding to figure anything out.\n\nThe story is where the game shines though. It's clearly an homage to Agatha Christie and made by people who genuinely are fans of that style of mystery. It will seem a bit dull at first, but there's a brilliant twist about half way through the game that will make you reexamine everything you think you've seen up to that point. There's a second twist at the very end that is much less brilliant and, while clearly intended from the beginning, is much less clever than the designers seem to think. Still, it wasn't enough to ruin it for me.\n\nUltimately, if you like adventure games this is worth your time.","January 4, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommended.\n\nI had to shorten this review to fit Steam's character limit. So if sentences seem wonky...\n\n+ Beautiful graphics, sceneries\n+ Feel-good atmosphere\n+ Very good voice acting\n+ Some nice quirkyness, e.g. "I am the god of fire."\n+ Some very subtle hints as to story development\n+ Dialogue has fast-forwarding\n+ King Art Games hood ornament\n\n0 Inconsistent fast-travel\n0 Somewhat odd chapter partition\n0 Anachronisms, e.g. Early Edition newspaper\n0 Language for graphics assets and everything else differ for me\n0 Adventure point system used for evaluating chapter performance, reduced by hints\n\n- The game crashed a few times\n- No map-travel\n- Graphic glitches, e.g. Axe-hand and pole-hand, wonky walking animations + popping, 270° turns\n- Character being profiled "The Arab"\n- Inconsistent iconography and methodology for exits/view changes\n- Inventory drop away\n- Continuity error when brute-forcing specific puzzle\n- Dialogue makes the game menu inaccessible\n- Inconsitent naming for Captain DiConti\n- Some odd hitboxes\n\nThe Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a beautiful point-and-click adventure narrat much like a crime novel. I like that bit of meta narration as the chase of the Raven is compared to a crime novel by characters in the game - without actually breaking the 4th wall.\nThe game is divided into three chapters each concluded with a mayor revelation and introducing another playable character. By my estimate the first chapter is the longest and subjectively most likeable, though I still enjoyed the other two as well.\nThe first chapter started with a tranquility rare to adventures and generally provided a feel-good atmosphere by transporting the joy of a luxurious train ride with careful lighting and well voice-acted, immediately believable characters only gradually giving tasks to the player to fullfil and progress.\nWe start to control the older, not elderly, Constable Anton Jakob Zellner, overseeing the train that also carries Inspector Legrande famous for ending the Raven's previous career. Legrande doesn't want our help, so we have to convince him of our usefulness and the story starts to unravel.\nAs said before, the voice acting is very good and characters believable. Oddities make sense after time and characters exhibit a few nice quirks. I particularly like "I am the god of fire." & Zellner's reaction to getting the pills back.\nThe narrative has some subtle hints as to the story development, e.g. attitude towards Ms. Mayers, Ms. Mayers calling Zellner a constable, Zellner having the Swiss Army knife around when bound.\nAfter each chapter you are evaluated. You collect points by progressing in the game or finding secrets and lose points for calling on hints.\n\nThere are good things and a few problems with game mechanics and their and other inconsistencies.\n\nThe game crashed a few times when I alt-tabbed out of the game menu and didn't alt-tabbed back in right away.\nThe game offers fast-forwarding for dialogue, i.e. each left-click skips the part of dialogue currently spoken to the extent of the current subtitle. That way you can adjust communication speed to your reading speed if you want to. And subtitles are almost always spot-on. There must have been some mayor confusions about how to write Captain DiConti's name.\nCommunication and physiological interaction among characters is well separated, avoiding bugging out while still keeping very good flow.\nOne problem I found with dialogue is, you cannot access the game menu, as you would otherwise, via the ESC key or the icon on the top right of the screen.\n\nThe game seems to differentiate between views, like camera angles, of a single room (a room being a collection of views rather than strictly interior) and views of different rooms, i.e. transition between the former is seamless while the latter require loading. In case loading is required the mouse cursor transforms into a door handle. But transition between views of a single room are not hinted. You have to "go there" to see if another camera angle is available.\nMachine age bias: My machine makes loading a task no shorter than 15 seconds - in case the room wasn't loaded for a while easily twice that. This meant travelling between rooms far apart was somewhat unnerving for me and I actually started doing other stuff while loading. This also led to me letting the game run when I got distracted by whatever other thing I started. Now I have to guess the actual length of the game since it is too long to simply play through again - which I surely will do in time. So I'd guess the game takes between 15 and 25 hours.\n\nApropos transition, there is a single puzzle (door to the museum's attic) in the game which is missing any door-handle icon area. You may only leave the puzzle screen by solving it or pressing escape - a strange decision for an otherwise completely mouse-driven game.\nThat puzzle may also introduce a continuity error. You're supposed to get a translation for an inscription in order to solve the puzzle. If you brute-force the mere 512 combinations the game assumes you got the translation and evidences as much in the your journal.\nWhen switching rooms the game mostly offers fast-travel, i.e. clicking again will skip the walking animation and directly trigger loading. This, however, doesn't work with all transistion. Usually I'd suspect in-scene triggers but I don't remember any here.\nWhenever a game doesn't employ seamless loading but opts for loading times instead I'd want to have a map available to skip artificially necessary loading times of intermediate rooms. There is no game area map and no map-travel in this game, pity.\n\nSometimes the game cannot figure out how to walk a character from A to B, it then chooses any available walking animation and finalizes it by popping the character to where it needs to go. Walking to non-objects may result in the character endlessly walking into a wall. Interaction with an object close-by but not in direct line of sight may result in 270° turns.\nThe first chapter features what I'd call axe-hand and pole-hand named after two items the character is supposed to hold. Any subsequent interaction not including the axe or pole makes axe or pole merge with your hand or wrist perpendicular to your lower arm. Fortunately, this is only a glitch and the items may still be used.\n\nI don't like the inventory dropping away right after selecting an item. It makes checking for item combination a hassle.\n\nAnachronisms:\nFor some reason the game is mainly English for me but some assets and textures are German like a newspaper you collect. This newspaper is peculiar in two ways. It has as running text, instead of lorem ipsum, lines from the beginning of Kafka's Metamorposis. It also seems to an Early Edition, i.e. as a July 1963 newspaper it features articles concerning 1964 events like Cleopatra's Oscar award and Surtee being a Formula 1 world champion. English version has Oct 1964 MLK Nobel peace price.\nThe guard room in the museum has two calendars from 1962. Possible but odd for a museum that hasn't "spared any expenses".\nThe Arab: It doesn't sit well with me that the stowaway is labeled "The Arab" even after he has given his name. This is presumptuous and no more descriptive than "Young Man" would have been.\nAchievement hint: Those achievements not connected to narrative progress are usually obtained by "fully playing out a scene" and they may require preparation. To the best of my knowledge, they do not require right-clicks, as was stated elsewhere.\nSoundtrack hint: In the extras, it takes some time for a song to start. Red means it is about to be played.\nEaster egg(?): There is a not quite hidden King Art Games hood ornament.","January 5, 2015","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline is one of its strong points, with enough loose ends and red herrings to keep you playing just to find out what is going on. In terms of the challenge, the majority of the puzzles are of the point and click variety (Broken Sword) instead of the mini-games vaeriety (7th Guest). The backgrounds and settings are gorgeous- it is obvious that a lot of effort and research has been done for the game, and it shows.\n\nI particularly appreciate that the solutions to the puzzles are logical and make sense, instead of being ludicrously far-fetched so as to increase the difficulty level.\n\nCons wise- The character animations I feel do not do justice to the excellent voice acting. It can be particularly jarring when, for example, you have to sit through several minutes of conversation with Mrs Miller whose jaw appears to be dislocated. And some of the male characters appear to sidle across the floor in an effeminate manner.

The music is nice and fits the setting quite well. The Raven is about 12–15 hours long, each chapter taking you around 4-5 hours to complete.\n\nUnfortunately, the game can be a bit boring. The Raven is quite slow paced and you will experience a lot of talking. Your character moves around slowly and it can be very frustrating to have to wait for him to move from one point to another.\n\nAs for the difficulty, it was sort of in the middle. Most of the puzzles were easy to solve, though I needed walkthroughs for some parts, but that's probably because I suck at solving puzzles.\n\nThe art style was quite nice – It wasn’t too cartoonish or too realistic. Close up, however, some characters, such as this one, looked ugly and somewhat creepy.\n\nThe animations can be very awkward. For example, to pour a cup of coffee, my character had to walk two steps away from the table, walk back towards the table, and turn 360 degrees before managing to merge with the table and finally pour a cup of coffee.\n\nThe Raven is littered with bugs: There were times where a scene would not transition to the next, times where characters would suddenly stop talking, leaving you unable to do anything, and clipping issues such as this. There isn't a setting to change the brightness, making it almost impossible to see what is going on in dark rooms.\n\nDespite all of the issues above, I really enjoyed playing The Raven. However, I don't think it's worth the full $24.99. If you are a fan of Point-and-Click Adventure games, this game is definitely worth checking out. 8/10","March 25, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly, the games biggest con was a pro for me, the puzzles are very easy and there are very few of them. Rather than puzzles the gameplay is all about talking to people, finding items, and figuring out where and how to use said items. The animation is also somewhat janky sometimes and the characters move pretty slowly.\nWith the cons out of the way, the majority of the voice acting is wonderful and the story is really intertesting, in my opinion. It's a pretty lighthearted story, overall, but it has enough twists to keep you guessing. Especially around the last chapter, I had plenty of moments that made me go, "Whaaaat?" I also really liked how you played the story as different characters and experienced the plot from different angles.\n\nIf difficult puzzles are why you play adventure games, I'd say skip this one. but if you enjoy the stories and characters of adventure games, this is very worth picking up. Completely worth the $25 price tag but a must buy, as far as I'm concerned, if you find it on one of the Steam seasonal sales","April 15, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game fails regularily, to extents only old saves can solve. If you are not the type to save often, in numerous slots, or if you can't stand the character teleporting, turning on himself three times before deciding to walk, or any thing of the sort, you will absolutely hate this game. Avoid it like the plague.\n\nThe game is also slightly tedious. Numerous loading screens and the pace of our character make for an intense experience of slow back-and-forth-tracking. It can be frustrating. If you have no patience, avoid like smallpox.\n\nHowever, the scenario and storytelling were way above average, in my opinion. I like old school. It was very old-police-novel-school. You will play from several points of view, gather information and meet people differently. You will not truly understand what happened until the end, which is ridiculously unrealistic, as was all the plot. If you like the "perfect crime" novel, with incredibly complex plots, and twists everywhere, at the price of realism, you will like this. A lot.\n\nThe characters are interesting, and you get to like them. Or hate them. Then change your mind.\n\nThe puzzles almost never seemed to be absurd. I rarily was stuck wanting to do something only to realize the game wanted me to do something weird and convoluted instead. I never laughed at the solution proposed by the game. It was always consistent and logical. Some adventure games are known to take more... liberties. It was not the case here. Some puzzles were not mandatory. I believe this to be a good idea.\n\nLenght-wise, it was a bit short. I'd expect the veterans of point'n'click to finish all three episodes in under ten hours, not accounting for game crashes. The beginners that insist on finishing without the built-in help (That allow the player to show every clickable in a scene, or get "hints" -I haven't tried them, no clue how revealing they are-) might take as long as fifteen. The game is divided in three episodes. From my experience, the first one is by far the longest, as well as the best in my opinion.\n\nOverall, the game had big pros and big cons. It is hard to recommend it to someone without knowing what matters to them. As I have to choose, I'll simply state that I do not regret buying the game and that I had a good experience overall. But I am a patient fellow who loves whodunits and who doesn't get his immersion killed by graphical bugs. If you're at the opposite end of the spectrum, I would not recommend.

There is a built-in hint system and there is a button that highlights the clickable objects in the scene, although you can still breeze through the game without using them. There was some degree of pixel-hunting, but it was rarely excessively annoying.\n\nThe most frustrating aspects were the camera angles, since sometimes it was not clear where was I supposed to click to go to a neighbouring scene. Moreover, the character animations were far from smooth and there were lots of "jumps" in the animation. I got the impression that, near the end of the game, it got even worse, with a character being able to pass through another and characters getting stuck in front of objects only to jump instaneously to another location. I also thought the characters walked a bit too slowly for my taste. I don't know if these issues happened only for the Linux version (I am using a notebook with Ubuntu 14.04). Either way, it shows it either a lack of polish or a lack of care for Linux users.\n\nStill, if point-and-click is your cup of tea and you favor story over puzzles, there is plenty to enjoy here.","January 8","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't managed to get past the first chapter, I highly suggest you try and push through it. The story is fantastic, with some extremely memorable characters and a wonderful intervweaving of complicated events.\n\nHowever, there is one major problem you should be aware of: the controls are terrible. If you're not the sort who has patience for battling through difficult controls, you won't be able to appreciate this game. You also may not be able to play it without a controller. At all.\n\nThere are several scenes where clicking to go go the next screen simply does not work. It absolutely will not work. The only way I've managed to make it work is by plugging in a controller and using that to move the character. And that only works... intermittently. It's only a few specific screens that have this problem, but they recur often enough to be incredibly annoying. Plus, you can't even simply play with a controller the whole time, because there are other screens in which you can't select certain items without using the mouse. So I basically had to play the whole game switching back and forth from the mouse and controller. Moving with a controller is also very awkward and often just doesn't work.\n\nI have a lot of patience, so this wasn't enough to ruin the game for me. I'm all about story and character, so if that's what you love about these sorts of games, I highly reccommend it to you. But if you are easily frustrated by bad controls or put more weight into gameplay than character and story, then I'd suggest you pass.","October 25, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At one point I had to abort a game and return to a saved point because there's no way of moving forward with the investigation (when the Dr, doesn't give the bullet).\nNow with that in mind the ending and the good mystery pushed me to do a positive review. The story and the set-up of playing different roles were interesting. In life events are affected by the actions of all participants not one (regardless of the end and its great reveal). The characters are interesting and I came to like constable Zellner a lot. When you start you don’t expect you’ll be playing him: old and unaccomplished policeman who wants a breakthrough. The mystery writer whom the more I learned about the more I felt I Am in an Agatha Christie novel! it feels like the whole story (and not just Lady Westmacott) is a tribute to her :)  The mystery itself is intriguing, as you play you begin to question everyone and try to speculate and guess who’s the culprit, who’s the killer, who’s the Raven. By the end I kinda guessed who the Raven is but didn’t at all expect the last twist. It will keep you interested.\nOne last thing to mention and has to be said is the soundtrack. When I first heard it I thought of Love Story I mean peak part is definitely inspired from it. Regardless, the pieces are still beautiful and very immersing.\n\nOverall, a nice game once you overcome the technical issues, be sure to save constantly just in case. Enjoy the mystery and music.\n","July 5, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing by mouse and keyboard is a painful experience, and it is nearly impossible to get the character to do what you want.  Playing with the controller is overall much more enjoyable, but it has the flaw that you literally cannot complete the game that way---there are three (I think?  At least two.) points in the game where you cannot complete the puzzle without switching to mouse and keyboard.
