We talked for a bit about the game and what could be done to help, it, it's future and such. Let me state, the developer is a very kind guy, and this game is a very good game, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't intrigued me on first sight. The fact that he reached out to me personally should show he really does care about this game. The only reason I didn't like the game was because the controls felt a small bit slippery to me personally, but I've gotten word that that has been fixed, and I will definetely be rebuying it asap. If you enjoy games that are well made and made passionately (Or just good 3D platformers, like me) Then you should buy this, especially with the astronomically cheap price tag. Support this developer, he's one of the good ones.\n\nEDIT:\nMy old review got some heavy downvotes, I'm guessing it's because the community really loves the game, so take that into account.","November 1, 2015","true","8.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","34","40","3","0"

The calming atmosphere really makes it satisfying to play, even when you keep restarting that level to win.

I don't really play that often, even if I love the art of video games. Some would call me a "casual player", and still this is one of those few games that I really enjoy playing, from time to time.\nYou can either play half an hour a day or for three hours straight, you can choose how much time you spend here.\n\nMaybe you're scared of that "Early Access" thing, but I guarantee you the developper actually listens to feedbacks and is always looking for improvements.

Surf? If so this games mechanics will feel Instantly similar too you. This game gives you such a rush jumping around at these amazing speeds. I cant really explain it, its the kind of thing you just need to experience. With multiple diffrent ways to finish each course it gives the game a competitive feel. You'll be trying to shave off those extra seconds to try and reach the top of the leaderboards on your favorite course.\n\nVisualy this game is stunning while the graphics are very minimalistic it is one of few examples of minimalism done very well in a game. The meticulous design of the levels leads to a mechanical and visual masterpiece. Not only will your eyes love this game but your ears will as well, the music is absolutely magnificent, even while failing a course over and over the music will keep you calm and mellow.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of Early Access but the game is so cheap and the devs seem to be very nice so far so I'm glad to support it in such a early state. If you have a few dollars sitting in your steam account I fully recommend getting this game.","October 26, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

I struggled on this and often found myself falling down over and over again. The game has the "just one more go" effect which keeps me trying over and over. I enjoyed the level design and colour schemes of the levels. One addition I would love and which would keep me playing the game would be addition of controller support.\n\nPositives:\n+ Low price\n+ Colours and levels are quite fun.\n+ Leaderboards for competitive speed running play\n+ Early Access, so there will be much more to improve on\n+ Dedicated developer\n\nNegatives:\n- No controller support which would really be beneficial to us non keyboard wielding people\n- Slight delay or it feels like to me in the jumps.\n- Frustrating when falling over and over\n\nI would recommend this to people who are looking for a fun speed running platformer game. If you enjoy being a ninja this is definitely a game for you. For people who are not used to using the keyboard this may be the game to wait on for controller support if ever added, as mashing my keyboard and failing is not favourable. For the price, I find it's real hard to skip though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bl1ght/recommended/324470/","Bl1ght","Blindlight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bl1ght/","84 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA really stylish, pared-down bunnyhopping/parkour game. SinaRun reduces the complex mechanics of bhopping/surf mods to the bare essentials without sacrificing the sense of speed and difficulty. This one is more focused on intense, high speed runs with multiple lines than technical parkour obstacle courses. Although your speed is easily maxed out with the benefit of a sprint key, the game uses a unique timed-jump mechanic (length of press controls jump height/distance... kinda like a 3D flappy bird game on speed :P ). This leaves enough fine control to experiment with different lines and keep the skill-cap high enough so you can improve on your records. For this type of game, this is a brilliant compromise because it doesn't sacrifice the speed/flow for the sake of simplicity, and manages to scratch close to the same itch as notorious mods like Quake Defrag and CS surfing without the huge learning curve barrier. Still needs some tuning, bug fixes and more maps but for <3$ it's well worth checking out.","October 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Let's start with presentation. There are typos everywhere, the music is all insufferably saddening with a certain track having literal tapping every few seconds just to anger you, the colors in some levels are awful with an example being a level with bright orange on top of even brighter orange so you can't see anything, and the levels all very much look the same. It is possible to do a minimalist style without looking super similar every stage.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty bad too. Lets see, it's a first person platformer where you can't see your feet, so you can't judge how to land, you slide really far when you land, the controls are extremely touchy, speed is inconsistent, and there are often tiny gaps that you will fall between that you can't see because of the art style. Fantastic.\n\nI have no idea why this game has glowing reviews. It's incredibly poorly designed on all fronts. The thing is, it can be fixed with a few simple patches. Unfortunately, there's no way to see that without playing it.

This game as a LOT of pentential. It could be one of my favorite games...\n\nBut sadly, the level design is way to hard. I played Mirror's edge to death getting every achievement for it (on Xbox), I SpeedRun DeadCore all the time, I even got in the top 10 fastest runs on the game, but this game...\n\nWhen you try to do a level fast, there's only one path you can take and there's only one way to take it. Everything from the speed at wich you get there, the number of milliseconds you pressed spacebar, to the orientation of your cursor has to be perfect to do the jump. The levels aren't open enough and the platforms are way to tiny. I don't mind dying a thousand time over a level, but I want to feel that I genuinly made a mistake and not that the game is punishing me for no reasons.\n\nThere's an achievement about beating dev times on the levels... These dev times are not Mario Kart dev times or DeadCore dev times in the style of "Our best time was 12.345 seconds... Let's make a 15 seconds dev time, so that way people have a chance to beat it." Nope! I mean they could put their real time in I wouldn't mind, if the levels were open ended. Exemple: if a dev made the best run possible on road A and uploaded his time, that's good and pretty much unbeatable, but if you jump between road A, B and C to create road D, you can do it in 9.843 seconds! That's good design.\n\nMy point is: So far, the game has an incredible core, but lacks polish. Keep the mechanics the same, but build better levels. Keep the insanity levels you have there, but build some more accecible levels too. That way, people won't finish tutorial saying: The control scheme looks kinda hard to get, but with the first level the game should let me experim- oh my god what the hell is this.\n\nMaybe after a couple of updates this review will change for a thumbs up. I can only hope for the best.","January 2","false","5.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarpulser/recommended/324470/","solarpulser","solarPULSER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarpulser/","1101 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSinaRun is the game ive wanted since I bought Boson X on a whim. Everything I loved about Boson X's minimalist design and fast speed, thrilling platform running is included in this game with a more expounded concept. Its a free runner and you arent tethered to the whims of the level, you will practice going one way on a course just to realize its better to start at another area, relentlessly shaving seconds off your time, and of course falling to your death many many times.\n\nPart of the beauty of this game is that most of the levels are relatively short. At first this surprised me, and I had a thought that they were trying to pack less content in the game by making it ruthlessly hard - but you aren't annoyed when you die in this game because you don't ever have a large amount of time invested in a singular run. This lowers the frustration factor of Boson X a very large degree, with the goal being to simply finish as opposed to gathering energy to pass a level.\n\nThis game could definitely use alot more levels, a level editor, and competitive online play and races. A level editor would be amazing.\n\nI think that music is a huge factor in games like these, you cant have the level music get boring after listening to it for a few minutes. The music in this game is top notch, very atmospheric tracks that aren't repetitive, annoying, or ill-fitting. They give you a sense of peace. This is a game where they simply have to release the soundtrack as DLC.\n\nI would also like to see more area's represented, and I feel this game is BEGGING for a forest level. I wouldn't mind seeing a few more mechanics like maybe a wallrun, it could also use a button to instantly reset to the beginning as you can get stuck on lower platforms and end up having to kill yourself after thinking that you might be able to find a way back up.\n\nAll in all, this game has the potential to be the shining star in the minimalist free-runner genre. At the moment it needs work but is an extremely good buy for the current price. You can tell a developer is smart when they know where to price their game.\n\n9/10","October 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The whole game is basically a time trial that is so relentless that if you make a mistake - and trust me, you will make several hundred before completing each level - you'll have to start from the beginning of the level. No checkpoints, no excuses.\n\nThe game currently has 17 levels including the tutorial, with the dev's best score displayed for you to try to beat and a leaderboard for your best score to be displayed publicly too. 17 levels may not seem like much for a game, but when you add the time between your fails and the amount of fails you have accrued, it quickly adds up, especially when you are trying to beat everyone's best times!\n\nYou will gain some very useful skills whilst playing SinaRun, such as the natural instinct to swiftly reach for the 'R' key if you get stopped or slowed down when missing a jump, or the ability to get used to the control of your character which can be somewhat awkward to get used to, seeming slippery in a sense. This can have a big impact on your experience, but once you get comfortable with it it becomes second nature.\n\nDespite the game's visual theme being minimalism, it has a high level of beauty with the different map colours and particle effects flying fast towards you as you attempt to make it to the end. This, accompanied by the relaxing music that tries to keep you calm every time you fail, creates a very unique atmosphere (in a good way.)\n\nAll things considered, the game is a great play if you would like something to play every now and then and don't mind failing a few hundred times and in all fairness, for $3, it's a bargain!\n\nI rate SinaRun 8/10 extremely quick wombats.","May 14","true","1.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Having speedrun Portal 2 for almost 1,000hrs as well as lightly speedrunning Skyrim and Mirror's Edge I thought I’d love this game, but I was very disappointed.\nYou barely have any control over your character and the turning is almost non-existent. I thought you would be able to strafe using a and d but sadly once you get going you are pretty much committed to going forwards. Trying to control the speed of your character is pretty tough and you get no feel of when you’re landing on platforms which makes timing the next jump difficult, not to mention how quickly to slide off of platforms once you hit them. I tried to fix this issue by attempting to rebind jump to mouse wheel but the game won't let you.\nOverall the game is more annoying then fun to be honest, I only managed to complete the tutorial and one main level which I died on around 50 times before finishing. Very disappointing as you need to be able to control your character precisely in order to complete levels effectively and you just don't get that level of character control.\n","May 18","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazzerone/recommended/324470/","hazzerone","Hazzerone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazzerone/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbsolutely loving this game and even have it running as I type out this review.\n\nIf any of you reading this have a love for Quake jumping or surfing/bhopping in CS then you will feel right at home with this game, and I would consider this to be the main demographic of the buyers, but would also serve as a great introduction to this sub-genre for first-timers.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is absolutely fantastic. It soothes your soul as you approach the 200 deaths mark and allows you to keep on going trying to beat that time!\n\nAnother great thing about this game is that you can see the dev's time for each of the levels, which shows you that the dev cares about this game and is pretty damn good at their own game! I can assure you as a new player it will be taking you quite a while before you can beat the dev's time let alone the #1 spot time!\n\nA couple of suggestions I would like to address to the dev:\n\nThe game likes to switch from fullscreen back to windowed (an easy way to replicate this is to have it and then press "Escape" to bring up the options menu which will put it into a windowed state).\n\nSome keybinding options are not possible for instance binding "Jump" to "Mouse 2". I would love this due to all of the time I've put into KZ in CS where I either long jump with right click or regular jump with scroll down (I appreciate that jump cannot really be bound to scroll down as jumping in this game has a "height on hold" mechanic - although it would be an interesting addition if you did allow jump to be bound to Space/Mouse 2 and also have the possibility for scroll up/down to also be bound for minimum height jumps! Just an idea!)\n\nI've noticed that "crosshair" is a toggleable option in this game. I think it would be fantastic if it is possible to customise this crosshair. Resize/re-shape etc similar to the sort of crosshair customisation you can find in CS:GO.\n\nAnother thing I would like to see added is the option for jumping sounds (probably footstep/landing sounds also) and I'm sure any Quake or CS player would also love this to be added. I understand if you wouldn't want to add this to the minimalistic theme of the game, however jumping sounds is just so iconic to these games it would be difficult to not suggest.\n\nNow for something you absolutely should NOT add - a replay/ghost replay mechanic of the top times on the leaderboard. It would absolutely destroy the magic of this game, figuring out for yourself the most efficient way to set the fastest times with what you have at your disposal.\n\nI would also like to thank Princesseuh for making a serious product and not making this one of those cheap "rage games" that you find a lot of famous YouTubers playing just to overreact and scream at in order to attract views. Thanks for keeping this classy.\n\nNow with all that said and done it's time to try and beat my 13.214 record on Wandered Hideout (watchout Princesseuh I'm coming for you!)\n\nUpdate: 12.201 record now :) Princesseuh you got some catching up to do :)\n\nP.S.

I like writing funny and random reviews, but this is gonna be a serious one. I just feel like I gotta get this out. I'm gonna start with the pro's and the cons.\n\nPro's:\nThe levels are beautiful.\nThe music fits in really well with the game.\nit's addicting.\nIt's calming?\n\ncons:\nThis is the slipperiest game I have ever played.\nit's a f*cking rage fest.\nit f*cks with you're audio.\nYou feel like you don't have any control over you're character.\n\nokay, let's start. first off, this game NEEDS an update. The audio needs to be fixed and the character should be '' a little bit less'' slippery. I know the game wants you to go as fast as possible, but this is insane. you can't stop. Even in the levels where you ARE supposed to go slow. YOU CAN'T STOP. IT'S TO DAMN SLIPPERY. All of the cons just screw the game for me. Am I the only one who has f*cked up audio when I play the game?\nAnd about the pro's: a beautiful world doesn't make a game good. I am trying so hard to like this game, but I just can't. You can buy this game if you want. It's not my money. And it's not a BAD game. Somethings just have to be fixed.\n\n\n\n\n","December 12, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","5"

If you like the kind of game where you :\n\n1. Play it\n2. Get Better\n3. Be the best\n4. Keep improving\n5. Stay the best\n\nThen SinaRun is for you! You can either try to be the best among your friends or try to be the best in the world. In that way, it really makes me think of Trackmania because I feel the same satisfaction you get from beating your friend's time by that hundredth of a second. And that's just one of the best things in life! Also, there's always room for improvement, so it really is a never ending game.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of Early Access games. But in SinaRun's case, all that is needed for you to have fun is already in the game, so it's not like you're buying it now in the hope that it'll be playable in 4 years. And for the price it's at right now, it's just non-sense to not get it.\n\nI mean, come on. 3$ ?

It is a weird idea and, though very hard and rage-worthy can be extremely relaxing and occupying. If you found this game just by chance and felt interested in it buy it; if you stumbled across this down to a steam sale or a friend playing it buy it. It is weird but strangely enticing I guess just buy it.","December 1, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement was hard to get used to at first, but you soon get used to it. I like the fact that most levels are relatively easy to complete but to get fast times on them takes time and practice. The soundtrack is amazing and is perfect for calming you down after falling off at the last platform. Also the developer joined my friend and I's lobby and talked to us about the game and our opinions. The developer is nice and seems to want to keep updating the game and making it better. So overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys slightly rage inducing, platforming games and is definitely worth the price.","November 27, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The diffrence between this and gravilon is that this game fixes all the faults gravilon had and added a few more featured that couldn't have worked there. The controls remind me of when I used to surf in source engine games as the controls are lofty and the platforms are Icy.

For example I have only played it for a short amount of time, but cannot feel true control over the movement and find it quite difficult to then manoeuvre. I am not sure if this would appeal to other players or if it just me, but I seem to find that the visual quality is not there.

I like how this game made it easy to learn how to jump and get through levels, since the training mode lets you go through any selected level and let's you set restore points in case you're not very good at/not used to the game. I also like how if you're the competitive type, you can always try to get in the top of the leaderbaords, and if you succeed in doing so, maybe actually feel good for something you've done in your life for once.\n\nIn short, here are the things I liked most:\nAmazing soundtrack\nEfficient training mode\nPass levels at your own pace\nMaximum overdrive while holding shift Overall, I give this game 9/10. The only reason that I rated it as I did is that I can't seem to ever find a multiplayer server, or it may be that I just can't get it to work.\n\nI recommend this if you like going fast or if you simply like jumping a lot.

You can play multiplayer. Just recommend adding strafe so the jumps are easier. New levels will come as long as they keep on developing the game. And sure as hell would be cool if jumping was just a matter of holdin the space bar. These are the two concerns I have 1) TURNING (that can be solved by adding the ability to strafe just like in cs 1.6) 2. JUMPING (could use automatic jumping or just some sort of a bunny hop script because pressing SPACE BAR gets annoying after while). Other then these I think the game is tottaly worth the price and should be supperted by purchase and maybe even a little donation.","May 19","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I understand what it's supposed to be: a speedrunning first person platformer, but something about it is just...off.  I think the best way to describe is that it feels like your character has no weight.  It takes a long time to get used to if/when you land on a platform because there's no audio or visual cue that you've landed.  This leads to a lot of frustration as it's hard to learn to gauge jumping and landing,  This wouldn't be a problem if the entire game wasn't centered around jumping onto small platforms at breakneck speed.\n\n4/10","May 31","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
