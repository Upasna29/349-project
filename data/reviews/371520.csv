I must say, I'm very impressed so far.\n\nYou're given a nice storyline to begin with and continue from there.  The tutorial will get you familiar with the basic aspect of the game, but from there you're on your own and I like it.  This game is definitely challenging right off the bat and that is something I was looking for.\n\nIf you enjoy simulations and having to plan out almost every move from the very beginning, you should give this a try.  It looks quite promising for the future assuming the devs can keep providing updates.\n\nSome personal thoughts/experiences:\n- I feel as though the combat is almost too difficult at the start.  I found myself struggling even on the first couple of tracks out of the first town.  After a few tries I was able to figure out what needed to be done, but it was very challenging.\n- I don't think you are given enough money to begin with and/or aren't rewarded enough for completing missions.  I was struggling for cash to even afford the licenses needed to get to the first few cities.\n- Hardcore mode is turned on by default; I think it should be turned off\n- Dialog windows could use some work, maybe separate chat boxes instead?\n- After you select a target and give it a command, you need to reselect the target.  I think if you select a target it should stay selected until you escape out and/or select somewhere in the field\n- Reload times are way too long\n- The Perks are an interesting aspect to the game, though I think some of the power-ups need better descriptions (i.e. What does Willpower do?)\n\nI will be playing this game again and look forward to what the devs have in store for the future.  For now, I think maybe turning DOWN the diffuculty of the battles would be a good idea in order to explore more of the game and allow for a bit more income in the early game.","August 25, 2015","true","15.5"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","53","64","0","0"

I've had a blast so far! The one-liner here could read "FTL on Rails" which would fit to various degrees. Take control of your train and chart your own course! I always thought it would be cool to have your own train and take it anywhere you wanted whenever you wanted, and this essentially is that... only back in time... and not for real... Anyway, I've enjoyed it so far!\n\nHere's a video in which I take a quick look at the various features of the game!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHVBF5QRdZs","August 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","4"

In the months since then, the game's developers have worked hard to improve it, with occasional but comprehensive updates happening every few months. The devs were very responsive to feedback and addressed the issues that players had been bringing up. The game has really gone up in quality since it was released, and I'd highly recommend it.","May 24","true","56.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lb122/recommended/371520/","lb122","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lb122/","216 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBounty Train is pretty much a spiritual successor of 1993s game "Transartica". The idea of a "base on rails", which you can upgrade and customise is still a novel an interesting idea. The narrative is interesting enough to keep you hooked, but most people will (or will not) enjoy it due to its gameplay. As a European, not very interested in American history, I find this part the most unappealing. However, the game keeps a realistic, non-comical, tone, which makes it easier to take in.\n\nThe announced features are mostly there and working. However, beware that the difficulty in the first hours is still brutal, and the tutorial is insufficient. Additionally, the interface lacks descriptions for many core concepts. Therefore, the learning curve is pretty steep and the game requires a lot of exploration by trial and error at the time of writing. The game is functional and looks polished, but is not very accessible at the moment (not as bad as "Towns" in case you ever played that)\n\nHowever, if you like trains and "rouge likes" (ergo some challenge), you'll enjoy this game.","August 26, 2015","true","15.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Can be perfectible and can become a must have if suffisent content is added, and I hope it will.\n\nPros:\n- Complete : perfect mix between trading, adventure (main and secundary quests), action, which reminds greatest & lost 90' game\n- Well balanced\n- Good ergonomy, simple but enjoyable graphics\n- Nice storyline, faithful to american history\n\nCons:\n- Expensive. Such indie game is rather 10€ worth, not 25\n- Some few bugs remaining. Some hitboxes/ergonomy to be improved during fights\n- Ridiculously too short ! please add far far more content after the early access...\n- Lack of competition. There is no other way to lose except exceeding time limit to complete main quest. Economy is not a serious threat as you always can get profit. A competition mode or something with some others IA players is lacking.\n\n\nLooking forward the finished game with more content and fixed bug. I also hope it will not rely on multiple DLC.

I finished the campaign in a little over 8 hours and while it is hard it is not hard in a challenging way. Bad guys get more numerous, are much more expensive to pay off and start throwing grenades like they are going out of fashion. Grenades will set your cargo on fire even if they hit the outside of your armored carriage and this just makes the game tedious in the late game.\n\nReputation just dosn't seem to work properly, I had a run through where I payed off as many people as possible and got my standings with pretty much everyone north of Philadelphia high enough that they would allow me to pass consistently however this seemed to randomly degrade to everyone hating me in no time at all and this strategy leaves you so poor that you have no hope of completing the game in the allotted time frame.\n\nThere is no way to avoid fights you know you can't win, creating a game over before the game is over. The only way to "wait" in a city is to repair a broken part of you train, if your train is full health you can't idle in a town until those bandits pass you have no option but to be confronted by them, lose a bunch of money or fight them. The game would benefit hugely from being able to wait in towns, even for a fee. Twice I got forced into a fight where I knew I would lose and had to restart.\n\nTrading (outside of quests) is pretty much worthless since theres no multiplier for trading distance so you're almost always only trading between stations one stop from each other and the margins are pretty much non existant, anything with a margin above 5 gold weighs so much you can't even consider trading in it until you have an end game locomotive.\n\nEnough negatives because I can't stress enough in text how much I enjoyed Bounty Train I picked it up on a whim and didn't put it down untill I finished it. You can see the incredible potential of this game just from playing it for 30mins. I am already eagerly awaiting updates and am very excited to see Bounty Train as a finished product.","January 15","true","10.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

When I played FTL I actually thought "this would be cool on a train."  Now here it is!!  That being said the this game has a long and I mean long way to go.\n\nIt has a ton of bugs, there is no balance...so you make a trip from new york to washington to sell something you make maybe $100 profit well in between new york and washington are bandits or indians who want $400 every trip...or you can fight them which in the early stages of the game is just not gonna happen and if you manage to win your train gets damaged and costs $500 - $700 to repair.  plus it costs money to unlock each new city which isnt a bad idea its just way too high.  Now on to the trains...ugh for some reason the 10k train doesnt do as well as the 1k train I cant seem to haul 2 cars with a load of anything and then there is the cars, no car hold more than one person and the cargo cars hold lets say 16 cargo but you can never haul more than 8 of anything except booze which blows up every time you get into a fight wich is everytime you leave a city.\n\nThe characters are pretty well done.  you get exp and level up and at every level up you get to choose between 3 perks, there is currently a nice little bug once you hit level 16ish you can just choose the 10-25% exp boost and you will level up to 80(cap) in a few seconds.  Also there is a glickman or some name like that who takes you on a wild goose chase for a treasure you will eventually find it after burning thru about $1500 or more and several fights costing you money to repair, visit 5 cities far and away from each other, your reward,,,,,6 barrels of booze but good news there to is a bug everytime you exit to world map and back to the city he will give you 6 more I made 20k in about 5 min doing this.\n\nI have purchased several early access games I love the whole idea and I am well aware that the concept is to take an unfinished game and release it a bit at a time based on community feed back.  Im not really seeing alot of that here and this game is no where near ready for even early access its pretty ruff.\n\nBut after all that I will recommend this game, If the devs keep going engage the community more and update regularly this has a lot of potential to be an amazing game!","November 30, 2015","true","26.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

You start off with a quest to find your siblings.  During this time, you must trade and earn money, upgrade your train and cargo hold, and fight off bandits and the others who are after your goods.  There are a few things that I do beleive need to be worked on:\n- there are too many attempts to take my poor little train down.  The only way to avoid this is to pay - and at the start of the game I do not have money or supplie to pay.  I'm unsure if things get better, if for example, I always pay the Indians and they like me.\n- Would like everyone to (always) auto attack or a way to pause to assign areas that need protecting/killing.\n- Would like the train to move quicker after a battle.

The reason you are trying to win shareholders is to stop the opposition from winning and building a train track over Indian Territory. Your father was also against this but mysteriously got killed. Whilst trying to win the shareholders over you are faced with daunting tasks such as being ambushed by bandits, having quests, finding family and carrying passengers from town to town whilst managing the funds you have.\n\nPositives:\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Quests are enjoyable\n+ Customisable train with many workers to hire\n+ City hubs are well displayed\n\nNegatives:\n- High price\n- No achievements\n- Not as much control over the train as I would’ve liked\n\nI would recommend this to most people who enjoy strategy and simulation games, however if you’re looking for a more locomotive game where you fully control the locomotive I would choose a different game.

But you get the option to restart a fight if everything goes down south, which is still buggy sometimes as restarting a fight sometimes does not reset your crew and train health or quest status.\nHarcore is as harcore says and you have no option to restart at all.\nUnless you choose Sandbox mode with no storyline related quests at all you'll probably stick to the necessary routes to complete your story and you'll never visit places far south as of now you always start way up north in Portland.\n\nStoryline:\nPlaced in the onset of the American Civil War your goal is to fulfill your fathers' legacy: a transcontinetal railroad. Your inheritance: an old train and some cash. So you start out on January 1st, 1861 and have to be finished until July 1st, 1862 or all you and your father worked so hard for is lost.\nHowever, this is the only storyline so far and it is contrary to the games' description linear, totally. Nevertheless placed in a historical setting with restrospective romantic flair it's quite compelling, as it contains elements of Pirates! (find your familiy and get rich in 10 years) and is still difficult to achieve, but tends to get repetitive even if it weren't for those damned linearity memory effects.\n\nTrade:\nThe most important feature for earning cash. But free trade does not work so well, as regular trade routes are scarce and difficult to come by, so you'll be mostly stuck to trade missions, offered in towns you are allied with, to earn serious cash.\nAs a result the game looses the kind of freedom that Pirates! offered as mission bound as you are, while trying to master the logistical challanges of picking up weapon crates in New York, delivering them to St.Louis, probably picking up a passenger in Philadelphia and dropping him off in Knoxville, after you earned enough cash from your weapons delivery to pay the fee for unlocking the route to Knoxville, as you have to go there as part of your storyline.\n\nPassenger Transportation:\nConsider it more as a bonus. Where do you want to go? Oh, that's (almost) my direction. Hop along, squeeze yourself in between those crates, don't stand in the way and as long as you're here, you can help put out those nasty fires during an ambush and don't expect me to pay for your injuries on drop off.\nSeriously passenger transportation works better if regarded as temporarily stocking up your crew with auxillaries with random skills who can assist you during ambushes.\n\nCoal & Train Weight:\nSteam engines need coal, that's a kind of well known fact, so here's an interessting concept/limitation to enhace the challenges of the early game. The further you go and the heavier your train the slower you travel and the more coal you need.\nBut what starts out interessting tends to get repetitive micromangement in the middle and end game, as coal is very cheap and the cost to fully load your coal tender are neglectable. Additionally it is still (a bit) bugged and you can only travel long distance routes with high end locomotives almost regardless of the amount of carriages und cargo you carry.\n\nTrains & Composition:\nNow this is a feature we all do enjoy. Earn cash, buy better locomotives and carriages to improve your performance and earn more cash. In addition to coal consumption and pullable cargo weight this offers some serious thoughts on how to configure your train. There is a big variety of locomotives and carriages in the game for the player to choose from to configure the train to your needs. But there is also a trade off to what really is usefull concerning afore mentioned limitations and you'll probably never buy certain vehicles.\n\nFactions:\nThere are four factions in the game. Union, Confederacy, Indians and Bandits. Improving your factions standing with the Union lowers yours with the Confederacy. Bribing Bandits or paying off Indians improves your standing with them respectively. Failing to fullfill a contract your standing drops. You get the general idea....\nIn principle it works fine, in reality not. Fending off bandits somehow improved my faction standing with them, leaving me unable to attack them when needed to fulfill my quest. Also my standing with Indians and Bandits seemed to change spontaneously over time. As a matter of fact paying your ambushers is the last and least option you'll ever choose as off now you'll get no reliable long term benfits to count on. But it's good that this options exits as it can save your ♥♥♥.\nFruthermore as you always start out in the north you'll probably always get allied to the Union as a result of the story.\n\nFight:\nThis is the FTL/Commandos part of the game but instead of a space ship and nazi soldiers you'll be shooting bandits, indians, KKK members or Confederacy soldiers out of a train. You will get ambushed a lot, really. Ambushing trains must have been some kind of popular sport back in the day. Don't get me wrong as fending off ambushers is great fun and really well done and offers a great feeling of the wild west. Really well done and loads of fun.\nBut somehow the attackers get carried away and always try to kill you or destroy your train. They never just rob you. Also there are still some minor bugs when attackers don't close in on your train and you have to wait until them timer runs out to continue your journey as it is not possible to reverse your train or exit it. Now those would be two features to really improve the game!\n\nCrew:\nYou can hire certain characters to help you defending your train and they have lots of different skills and stats in which they can be leveled. Crew composition is great fun as it can give you the certain edge you need in certain situations. Leveling them however is a random choice between three random perks and you don't fully have control on how to level them. Furthermore crew size is limited to five members, which is enough but some skills need rebalancing as they significantly are more difficult to train and you'll get stuck with low level characters. It's easier to hire certain mid to high level characters, as they don't cost you weekly/monthly wages and are always waiting for you at the same location, once you know where to find them.\n\nConclusion:\nBounty Train runs really well and has only minor issues with stability, bugs or game fluidity which is a big pro. When playing you will come upon certain planed but not yet integrated features like different equipment for your crew members. I can only hope that in the future there will be more scenarios, game modes or additional content to choose from and that the variability of this game will be improved. I would even go so far to claim that I am willing to pay for additional DLCs to come as this game offers a unique and well done integration of different and enjoyable game concepts. And I would really regret to see its' potential wasted as in e.g. Cosmonautica. This game truely has a lot of potential, if improved in matters of content, balancing and variabilty as it hold some key elements to become a game that may even set standards. In its' current state it is really fun to play for about 30 hours play time, after that the replay factor declines rapidly. As off now it's not worth 25 bucks. However, you'll have to choose if you like games like this, if you want to support the developers or wait until completion or for a steam sale.","January 12","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Right now train turrets feel like aliens in the game.\nAs an idea, perhaps you need to manually carry an ammo box inside the train to the turret, to get it going. And then manually do the reloading of a full turret ammo restock, during battle.\nWould also be great if the ammo box can blow up, if its not a well armored carriage.\nBut thats just my 50 cents...\n\nMy fav sim/trading game currently, next to City Skylines.\n\nTrain battles feel real and are really cool.\nThe train escape scenes are always exciting :-)","June 4","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the 6 hours I played (4 hours and 2 hours consecutively), the game never crashed or froze. I did find a few oddities in the market screen but there were not any other bugs.\n\nThe gameplay itself is relatively straightforward, and the combat can be quite tough. After getting enough crew, I didn't have trouble defeating anything I came across but I could take significant damage. Trading is easy, but don't over do it. After picking up a second large cargo car, the tooltips began to be inaccurate as I would change the local economy if I used the same trade route a few times. But it is easy to go to a different station and start a different route.\n\nThere were some oddities with handling people in combat. Some of my crew  can crouch behind cover, others can't. I couldn't find anything in the character screen for why some could and some couldn't. The reloading is an odd mechanic and crew can't reload while walking. All in all, the combat was easy and toward the end I just started paying everyone off and getting invites to join their camps because the combat became too repetitive.\n\nPros:\n- Stable\n- Small learning curve\n- Pretty\n- Good tutorial (didn't finish it all, but very well done)\n- Decent economy\n- Okay crew AI\n- Short (beat the campaign in 6 hours)\n\nCons:\n- Crew can be a bit clunky\n- Unintuitive station interface for moving crew/passengers off trains (didn't realize I could do this until I did it on accident)\n- Needs keyboard bindings for dialogue (and some places, shouldn't have to wait for a response: looking at you City Hall)\n\nTl;dr Fun casual Sunday afternoon game that is currently stable and I will recommend to friends. 8/10","August 30, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A newspaper costs as much as whole crates of some goods - and you must have a newspaper to get goods pricing in other towns (small issue, easily remedied).\n\nThe big issue (and the main reason I gave up after an hour) is that even IF you shell out the cash to get pricing info, do the market research and buy the goods - you STILL lose money (at least I did).  For example, if "food" is selling in Boston for $10/unit and being bought in Portland (Maine, not Oregon - I'm not NEARLY that far yet, lol) for $15/unit - you should gross $5/unit. Not when I try it. Fill my cargo with food, arrive in Portland, click "sell" and it informs me that I will be selling for a loss.\n\nI know prices fluctuate - however, Portland is one town away from Boston on the map. I am also aware that some goods (like food) spoil. However, Portland is only a few days' journey and "food" in the game supposedly takes a week to spoil.  I have yet to make any money (even simply gross profits, forget about net after deducting my expenses) buying and selling any goods.\n\nPortland and Boston are the only towns I have unlocked thus far, because my capital just keeps decreasing.\n\nOf course, if the economic mechanics change to something slightly less punishing (and less decepetive) I'll return and revise my review.  But I'm putting this frustration simulator aside until the next update.","March 10","false","1.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

At short, some pros and contras for the game:\n\n+\n1. Interesting story, that gives great background for the family's story.\n2. Good trains, routes and events on routes, but game is showing where and which one event will be presented on the route.\n3. Good missions for deliveries, great missions to find and help the family to unite.\n4. Quite good development system - you have a choise of skills each character's level, and frequently used skill can gain extra point.\n\n-\n1. No possibilities right now to improve trains and cabins, e.g. make additional armour, install turrels, etc\n2. Strange balance between cabins and crew members - each new cabin allows you to hire only one extra-crew\n3. No savegames at all - you can replay one fight, but cannot save progress on a timely basis, e.g. every game month.\n4, Short story, and a lot of closed cities right now - I suppose that map will be expanded and family story will be much longer.\n5. Price - quite high for a short playable time.\n\nRight now I suggest to wait and see, how game will be developed.

For right now it is still not worth its asking price of 25 bucks. Since it first came out about a month ago, we have seen multiple versions, and the newest one is getting there. The money system got f***ked up again, The campaign is not worth going into detail about, the trading is the same, ETC... The combat however, IMPROVED DRASTICALLY!!!!! I mean they have patched the s**tty perks, and added a working Evasion perk, which is essentially the ability to dodge sometimes, kinda like Final Fantasy or Pokemon. also the SNADBOX mode is quite dissapointing, its more of a Free Roam thing, instead of a legit Sandbox. The rest can be explained in the video, which you can find in the Steam Videos for Bounty Train. SO Yeah, this game is so far a good 6/10, for its lack of content, and very low replayability. But still enjoyable nontheless.

A train management game set in the Wild West. A deceptively easy game where you have to manage your train as it travels across the union and confederate states around the time of the civil war. You get attacked by bandits and Indians. You get to haul freight and passengers but more importantly you need to find your siblings so you can inherit a big bunch of cash and move back to England.\n\nAll in all, this deceptively simple game is a lot harder than it looks.

Makes you feel as though your actaully operating a train! (Sorta) I also like how the combat is all in real time, at fist I was a bit skeptical as to if it should be turn based if things get out of control. The cover system and they position to fire from make it very manageble. The fact that its an open sand box on what some one would think to be a linear game just blew my mind. The random encounters are also pretty cray. One last feature that I really appreciate in this game is the Four factions, You have Indians/Aboriginals Confederacy, Union and Bandits. Depending on your actions of supplying/missions for whichever you choose be it one or a few you can gain allies and boons and also enemies. (makes me want to have a Rebellion Train for the Confeds, and a Union Train for Freedom!) All in all a very competent game an Early Access title worthy of early entry!\n\n30 Minutes or Less, I adore the UI in this game!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwrebjA999M\n\nThanks so much for reading my review, hope it helps.

Makes you feel as though your actaully operating a train! (Sorta) I also like how the combat is all in real time, at fist I was a bit skeptical as to if it should be turn based if things get out of control. The cover system and they position to fire from make it very manageble. The fact that its an open sand box on what some one would think to be a linear game just blew my mind. The random encounters are also pretty cray. One last feature that I really appreciate in this game is the Four factions, You have Indians/Aboriginals Confederacy, Union and Bandits. Depending on your actions of supplying/missions for whichever you choose be it one or a few you can gain allies and boons and also enemies. (makes me want to have a Rebellion Train for the Confeds, and a Union Train for Freedom!) All in all a very competent game an Early Access title worthy of early entry!\n\n30 Minutes or Less, I adore the UI in this game!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwrebjA999M\n\nThanks so much for reading my review, hope it helps. I am curious to if they eventaully add the mid-west/ west which would be great! What would also be awesome sauce if they bring it up to the year 1911 which is essentially the end of the wild west.","September 7, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely needs some more types of combat and missions and the current campaign only takes a couple hours to beat. I'd really love to seem them continue the story, with the railroad expanding out west and such.\n\nWhile the game is "set" in the time of the American civil war, outside of different flags being over different cities I feel like there's hardly much actual effect on the game. However the mechanics of trading simulator mixed with an FTL style combat system is really smooth. Hoping they keep adding and the game becomes truly awesome.","September 8, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialogue involving the characters are long and boring. I hope the developers improve those and make them more interactive. More carriage types and engine variation as well as the special weapon system will be appreciated. But it is very frustrating to see the slow development process.","September 1, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the concept.\nNot perfect, but you can forgive some things on a beta.\nWill need to step it up mid-late game, interoduce new/different gameplay or it will get repeatative.\nAbout 10hrs in, once Ive upgraded my train a few timnes, unlocked some cities, and hired a decent crew, I dont think there will be much to motivate me to go on & keep playing, Perhaps if my train was one among several I could own and set to work in an expanding business empire? That might be fun. Heck, maybe it is and I just havent got to that yet? But I doubt it.\nSometimes I take a mission and my train just isnt fast enough to get there, would be nice to know that in advace. Almost never engage in 'normal' trade as its not very profitable.\nFighting is fun but happens way too often now, I feel like every trip im in a 10 minute battle which is draining and gets repeatative. The factions seem like reskins of each other, what's the difference between bandits and indians? nothing. No unique personality or chance to side with one or the other. May they could think of other challenges or obsticals between cities.\nIt might sound like I'm bagging out this game, I'm not, I love the game, but I want it to reach its potential. Ats it stands, around 10 hours in I'm looking for something else to keeep me interested.\nAlso the auto game saving system without letting the player save/load is so damn frustrating.\nLooking forward to the finished version!","December 28, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there has not been an update in over 2 months and the game gets rather repetitive. I also found situations where I was hunting down bandits and they disappear from the map altogether, meaning I was unable to finish the quest.\n\nIf this is your type of game, feel free to get it. It is not anywhere near as polished as FTL but it's definitely a title worth keeping an eye on.\n\n6/10 at the moment.","November 22, 2015","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually played through until I ran out of time to complete the campaign.  I was pretty strategic about progressing but I doubt more than 5% could win the main campaign.\n\nIssues:\n1) Still too expensive to purchase new routes.\n2) Steel slows down the trains soooo much that it takes numerous trips just to build up the steel you need in Memphis.  While the mechanics make sense of weight/distance, the idea that there aren't refuel stations nearly everywhere is crazy.  Either increase the tenders sizes, increase the number of cities, or allow midpoint refueling locations.\n3) The duration before the stockholder meeting is extremely agressive.  The current duration could work if you increased the value of town hall missions by about 50% or decreased the cost of new routes by 50%.\n\nA couple more revisions and I would consider recommending this game to others.","December 13, 2015","false","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"
