Motorbike contains 100 stock levels but gives you access to several thousand downloadable tracks and a reasonably intuitive level editor. Includes a bunch of different riders, outfits and bikes but none seemed to have alternate stats, just graphics. Supports both local and online co-op but I've not tried my luck yet.\n\nSimple controls with a decent physics system overall but one that use some improvements. eg, Reverse gear seemed to be in overdrive, which made some of the earlier levels more difficult then they should have been. Graphics are simple by nature and much closer to the older trials games but still perfectly adequate. Music did the job and never did it feel too repetitive, just don't go expecting name artists.\n\nConsidering the $5 price tag, great bang for your buck and recommended.\n\nThings that could use tweaking.\n360 wired pad worked but required clicking with the mouse to change levels and such.\nRestart speed of runs could be quicker, want to get back into the action asap.\nAchievements would be a huge plus. :)","January 20, 2015","true","1.1"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","28","41","0","3"

It’s so good I bought it twice. Once on the dying/dead OUYA system, and then later on the computer.\n\nThe overall premise of the game is very simple. You get spawned at a starting zone on the left of the map and have to make your way to the right of the map to win the level. While it may seem like an easy game, it can be VERY difficult with the tracks. Some maps are so difficult that they put checkpoints part way through the level. You have many obstacles between you and the end zone ranging from loop-de-loops, mines, and cars. The premise is so simple that it is kind of hard to write a review for it.\n\nWith the game comes around 100 built in levels, but thanks to an included map editor, there are several thousand maps created by online users. The editor is hard to use at first…unless you actually bother to read the help section on it like I had too :P.\n\nFor $4.99, you will get the most of your money from playing this game because it is fun as heck. The game is SUPER easy to pick up and play when you don’t have much time to play games.\n\nI rate this game a 8.5\10\n\nFor more game reviews, check out my review blog here: www.gonemadgaming.com\nPS. My online level I made is number 4679.\n\n~rhillfake\n\n3DS Friend Code: 2595-3048-4554 || Steam\Origin\Other: rhillfake || Xbox Live: WasBottlehead99","December 16, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But bear with me, because there's a lot to like, too.\nThe game feels quite dated, - it would keep good company with games from around 2008.  That's not an issue for me, because I still play games from the early 80s.  The graphics are far from optimised, and running this game heats up my rig a lot more than much prettier games do.  I can't find how to make it fullscreen, so I'm stuck with a title bar and start bar.  It frequently hiccups, which pauses gameplay for up to a second which, due to the technical and precise nature of play, often means death.\nThere's also an annoying delay while the view pans from your deathpoint back to the start of the track, - annoying because the track resets at the beginning of the pan, rather than when you can actually start riding again.  If you were a long way from the start, then that's 4 or 5 seconds of panning, during which swings swing, barrels drop and other props are set in motion, and you're already too late to catch a falling swing.  It's easy enough to work around, - just tap R to restart again with no pan delay, - but its unnecessary, and needs to be addressed.\nIf you're after something like the Trials series, don't get this.  It's not Trials.  Get Trials.\nBut...\nIf you remember Elastomania, and you liked it, then you'll love this.  It's all about timing moves perfectly, and it's very satisfying.  The camera angles are good, and together with a zoom feature, allowing you to see more of what's coming on the monitor,  makes for a very intuitive and playable experience.  Apart from the above glitches, and lack of optimisation, the game looks great on screen, and the physics are fluid, realistic (enough), and believeable.\nAnd a special mention goes to the soundtrack.  Instrumental rock-guitar driven, and very nicely laid down.  Is the soundtrack available? ;-)\nI have not tried the editor, but the stock levels are nicely put together, challenging, and very satisfying to complete.\nSo... Not very pretty, but heaps of fun, super-easy to learn, great for a quick casual thrash (loads straight to play in seconds), and don't be surprised when, like Lemmings of old, it's 3am and you realise that you've been telling yourself "just one more quick try" for the last 6 hours.  Maybe that's why fullscreen isn't enabled, - so you can always see the system clock...","January 25","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
