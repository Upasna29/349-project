Invade countries more of course! This gripping tale of post-9/11 insanity and antagonists that are almost exclusively middle-eastern will tug at the heartstrings of any American with less than half a brain.\n\nExperience the wondrous world of Splinter Cell: Blacklist, where you get to engage in everything from needless torture, to unauthorized drone strikes, to the overhyped death of one or two Americans that surely outweighs the hundreds of filthy Arabs you just slaughtered because you're too much of a noob to use non-lethal weapons!\n\nIt's only unfortunate that my European brain is far too oppressed by vile Soviet communism to fully understand the true value of the storyline.\n\nIt's a fun game though, would sure as hell recommend for the sake of gameplay!\n\n\nEDIT: Lots of people from the US taking this as a personal attack on their country it seems.\n\nAlso, sorry about the apocalypse. Here's some free popcorn.\n\nEDIT 2: Given further thought, and to be more serious, i can't for the life of me figure out the direction in which this game is trying to go. It manages to be both pro-USA and anti-USA at the same time.\n\nThe plot is driven by both real-life, and in-game American atrocities, which is not something usually seen in a Tom Clancy game. However, towards the end it still manages to bring on the generic "Yay we defeated the evil terrorist" ending, which is more in line with Tom Clancy games.\n\nWhat irks me is not the "F-yeah America" jingoism itself (let's face it, it's a Tom Clancy game), but the fact that it has the nerve to STILL be that jingoistic after all it's pulled you through. "Oh hey, it's America's fault these bad guys exist" -> "Oh yay, we defeated the bad guys, good job, American hero!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefyrewire/recommended/235600/","thefyrewire","thefyrewire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefyrewire/","106 products in account","OK... given my playtime now, I think it's finally time for my review. No plot spoilers. A proper review would take a look at all aspects, but I don't have much time so I'll be brief.\n\nThe Good - Singleplayer The game itself is surprisingly good. Of course... it's no Chaos Theory, but regardless, the game is actually fun. By playing on perfectionist, the game's hardest difficulty, you'll find yourself hiding and waiting a lot; examining the guards' patrol routes (which by the way change every few deaths to keep you on your toes). Also you won't be able to use your vision through walls, giving (albeit briefly) you that similar experience in Chaos Theory when you find yourself constantly wondering what's around the corner.\n\nSo what else is there? A diverse array of gadgets, guns and accompanying upgrades for starters. I loved being able to use the money earned from missions to upgrades and improve my loadouts. There was a chain of progression, and I could feel my character becoming a 'stronger' spy, equipped with more stuff as the game continued.\n\nThe environments are pretty damn awesome. Exploration is the key to achieving your preferred playstyle. There are neat cinematic scenes and unique parts of the story which require you to play out these almost 'mini-game'-like bits; but they're so well integrated into the story and allows you to take a break from all the running, jumping and stabbing.\n\nThe Good - Multiplayer - Coop/SvMNow let's switch over to the multiplayer. There's not much to say about coop. It's essentially singleplayer but with a partner. There is a fairly wide variety of missions to choose from. Each of the main characters have varying game modes depending on what you're up for. Nearly all of them can be played solo if you don't have anyone to trust your life with.\n\nGrab a mic, join your friend, and off you go. That's right. A mic. Whilst not completely essential- it will drastically reduce the number of times you die because of silly mistakes. Bouncing information between you and your partner will really help. But... if you're with a random person you might not be able to do that. In which case, you'll just have to grit your teeth and go with the flow.\n\nSpies. Versus. Mercs. It's fun. Believe it or not, it's actually fun. With friends. By yourself... yeah, I'll admit, you can have some pretty decent matches. But seriously, for some laughs and a better chance at winning- play with friends you can talk to. Skype, TeamSpeak- it's all about information exchange. You can better anticipate that ambush if your buddy just saw a spy heading your way. You can let your friends know where the hacker is by utilising the merc cameras whilst your dead.\n\nThe SVM loadouts are different to the singleplayer loadouts, so be prepared to start paying up the big bucks again. This time you'll also need SVM tokens, which allow you to purchase weapons and stuff. You only get a few when you start levelling up and then one token each level after that, so spend wisely. There should be enough to unlock everything, but it's the order you choose that matters. I'll be writing or recording an updated SVM tutorial sometime in the future, to help the new players with how everything works. You'll have fun creating custom loadouts with a combination of gadgets, gear and weapons to your liking and playstyle. The torso abilities are pretty cool. Each side (mercs, spies) get three choices of abilities to aid your plight. Used wisely, you can be a valuable asset to your team.\n\nSince Blacklist is 4 vs 4, it's the perfect number. Every player counts, and when your team mates goes down, you best be prepared for what happens next.\n\nOn the face of it though, SVM is fun to dive into for a quick match (I say quick match, it's about 25 - 30 minutes per match). You can just join and start playing straight away. It's fast paced and will require some level of awareness and reflex reactions in order for you to survive. Playing smart is a key skill. Anticipating enemies, knowing your way around the map, always paying attention to the little things that might give away the position of a spy. Classic, Blacklist and Team Deathmatch are probably the only active game modes at the moment. The others could do with a reboot, as they're fun to play... when there's enough players.\n\nThe Bad - Singleplayer I honestly can't really fault the singleplayer. There is one thing though. It can be very easy to speedrun. Grab one of the sniper rifles and just headshoot everyone. Job done. Of course, some armored enemies require a little melee time, but with two or three shots you can drop them just as easily. It can ruin the fun, but it's completely feasible.\n\nOh, there's also the whole Michael Ironside thing. Yes, Fisher does appear younger. No, it won't stop you from enjoying the game. You'll get used to it. Or perhaps not. It's really up to you.\n\nMy negative points reside mostly with the game launcher rather the game itself. Ubisoft only had to go and slap Uplay on its products AGAIN. Why even bother releasing this on Steam if it was going to need Uplay anyway?! For example. I load Uplay (ugh, I know) and click 'Play' on Blacklist. It then says... 'loading Steam. Please wait for your game to load from there'. Like... wut. Then Steam launches Blacklist, then it goes BACK to Uplay and Blacklist opens up. ???\n\nNot only the Uplay interface a pain to reach on a laptop (since it's Shift + F2 and laptop users have to press FN as well...) but it's slow as hell and actually caused me to crash Blacklist once.\n\nUgh.\n\nThe Bad - SVM Here we go. I'm leaving coop out of this by the way.\n\nSpies vs. Mercs feels like another company developed it and just slapped it onto the main game. Seriously. The sonar vision is completely different to the sonar vision in singleplayer, the way the stun crossbow works is different, there's no crouch sprint... the list goes on. When I first started playing, I got bugs. I mean... BUGS. One particularly game breaking bug was the fact that every time I went into cover and left it, I'd stand up and start sprinting around. It was hella annoying. Ubisoft put out THREE patches and none of them fixed it. It was only after I'd posted a couple ideas and experiments of the forums that someone else picked it up and fixed it. A fix, from the community ._.\n\nIf you're buying Blacklist for the SVM, wait for a deal. SVM, in its current state, is just not worth it. Overrun with hackers and the likes, SVM has become a tense community, filled with paranoid players who don't trust each other. And why should they? With Ubisoft turning their back on the game, with no dedicated servers (Host changed. Migrating match.) and no anti-cheat system, you have no idea who could be hacking, or who's just damn lucky. Tired of the hackers? Want to quit the match? Tough. Ubisoft removed the Quit Match button to 'reduce the number of unfair rage quitters'. Uhm, wut.\n\nSeriously, all the more reason to team up with people you trust and can communicate with. You can still beat hackers, because they're dumb. They can whiz around and kill you with one bullet, but they're idiots who can still be killed with Death From Above and unexpected melees. Even hackers bleed.\n\nThe Conclusion Conviction was fun, but Blacklist brings more to the table. With new ways to play, and new gadgets to play with, the singeplayer and coop are definitely a must. Just watch out for the SVM, it might not be what you were completely expecting.\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is a 9 / 10 .","September 25, 2014","true","936.9"," 150 of 157 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","150","157","6","15"

A package that deserved more attention, because even though Splinter Cell is still popular, it didn't manage to sell enough copies.\n\nAnyway, Blacklist lets you play as Sam Fisher (who else ?), but with an all-new voice actor this time. Michael Ironside will be sorely missed, but I have to admit the new voice of Sam did a very decent job.\n\nThe game has plenty of content, including single-player missions, co-op missions, multiplayer and even a metagame. The single-player portion can be completed in roughly 10 hours. I didn't have a chance to try the other modes just yet. The single-player missions can be played with a stealthy approach, as an action hero killing everyone you see or a mix of those two. Since this is Splinter Cell I'm thinking most of us will play this game in stealth mode and use a more action oriented approach if they're ever discovered.\n\nThe graphics look extremely well and the game is a blast to play. It also runs at a solid 60FPS, something I personally adore.\n\nBlacklist looks like a compilation of all previous games and as a result it's, in my opinion, the best game yet, or the more complete one anyway.\n\n[Rating: 93/100]","November 21, 2013","true","10.3"," 204 of 238 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","204","238","0","6"

Oh, and the usual "Uplay isn't something anyone wants" crap, but that's a given with a Ubisoft game.\nAlso it's buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and the netcode needs work, but oftentimes the results are more hilarious than gamebreaking.\nIf you want a challenge, be it loud, lethal, or silent, this game (Splinter Call: BlackopsList, or GI JOE SNEAK SQUAD) actually does a damn fine job of it.

Our beloved hero, Sam Fisher, is its commander.\nA terrorist group called the "Engineers" are terrorizing America by announcing 5 attacks on major parts of the United States. It's up to Sam and the help of 4th Echelon to stop them. The story is fresh and exciting at first but then takes a huge turn for the worse, only to become a very predictable story. There are also a couple of story inconsistencies such as Sam's mid-20s look and moves? Also, why did the writers make Sam such a d!ck?\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Stealth perfection. Every action you make grants you points in one of the following paths:\n1- Ghost (classical SC: hardcore stealth, no kills, and no detections)\n2- Panther (SC Conviction style: modern stealth, fast fluid stealthy kills, and no detections)\n3- Assualt (CoD playstyle)\nThe developers made sure that every style feels different and fun to play, I was a Ghost myself, and it was such fun. Each playstyle grants you points that you spend upgrading Sam's gear and his airship, The Paladin.\nI had a problem with the unlockables, though. They are very easy to obtain. I maxed out everything almost halfway through the campaign. One thing I liked was that the points you get are shared between the singleplayer and multiplayer unlocks, thus giving a sense of interconnectivity between the modes.\n\nGRAPHICS:  Varied environments, fluid animations, lovely color palette. Night time missions look much better than the daylight missions, but in the end, the graphics are good enough, and (mostly) nothing special.\n\nAUDIO:  Good soundtrack, but nothing memorable. Cheesy dialogue, bad writing, and forgettable voices.\n***** IMPORTANT NOTE ***** The infamous new voice of Sam Fisher, Eric Johnson, isn't bad, he just isn't as good as Michael Ironside, and the poor cheesy dialogue doesn't help.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:  Spies vs. Mercs returns, the 2v2 (or 4v4) multiplayer with its various modes is a breath of fresh air from all those heavy action shooters and FPSs. It is slow, stealthy and balanced. When the action rises, you feel the adrenaline pumping in your veins. It seriously is a blast. The co-op is good fun if you have the right friend to play with since the game demands good teamwork and communication.\n\nOverall, I think that SC Blacklist is a great game, the designers had something really special, but sadly the writers took a dump over all that. Conviction was the perfect finale for Sam. Had the writers started out fresh with a new, young protagonist and made Sam a mentor, I think it would've been so much better than the mess of a story Blacklist has.\n\n9/10","February 23, 2014","true","65.9"," 146 of 178 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","146","178","0","0"

I've played Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist for well over 30 hours, and it's a stealth experience unlike any other.\n\nThe Pros:\n· Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a perfect combination between Conviction and Pandora Tomorrow.\n· Choose your playstyle. Whether you're new to the series or a die hard Splinter Cell fan like myself, you'll definately find your cup of tea here no matter what. There are three different playstyles: Ghost, panther and assault. Ghost will have you completing a level without anyone ever noticing you've even been there. Use your gadgets and avoid getting close to hostiles but take them out in a silent, non-lethal manner when you must. Panther allows you to play a more brutal but still silent approach. Mark three targets, crouch-dash to a nearby fourth hostile, take him out with a stab to the throat and shoot the other three with a silent headshot by simple pressing the button. Assault lets you go in guns blazing, not caring about detection what so ever, as long as it gets you through the level. Unsilenced weapons, grenades, taking hostiles as human shield and bashing their heads against the wall when all the bullets that needed soaking have been soaked. All this can change in the blink of an eye. Situations will rarely feel the same depending on your playstyle. I played hundreds of hours of Conviction, so the Panther style allows me to build upon the experience I've gained through playing Conviction.\n· A strong cast of characters. Sam Fisher himself, his daughter Sarah Fisher, Anna Grímsdottír, Andriy Kobin, the new isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole and many others all have a certain chemistry with each other due to events in the previous Splinter Cell titles, which makes the story a lot more dynamic.\n· Where Pandora Tomorrow allowed you to choose your loadout at the beginning of a mission, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist lets you create your own custom loadouts, complete with primary and secondary weapons and gadgets, but also upgradable goggles, vests, gloves, pants and boots that can be purchased with money you earn for completing missions. This allows you to mold Sam's equipment to your playstyle even further, as your outfit can either be heavily armored or extremely light and stealthy.\n· Many cool moves make Sam fast and agile. There are countless animations when you're taking down an enemy which is extended upon by the choice of lethal and non-lethal takedowns, you can swiftly climb along wall, pipes, ropes, ledges and what not, and the "sprint" allows you to move faster and vault over obstacles instantly.\n\nThe Cons:\n· The shadows often don't look dark enough to be believable. You can, in theory, stand a few meters in front of an enemy and they won't notice the bright lights on your armor. These same lights will indicate when you are visible or not though, so it's generally clear to know when you can be spotted and when you're safe in the shadows.\n· If you're not playing with a controller, the controls might sometimes be a bit frustrating. I started playing with a keyboard and mouse and it felt like it didn't offer the precision I needed in terms of movement. If you have an Xbox controller, I recommend using it. Sam's movements feel a lot smoother and the gameplay is overal more controllable when you have a full 360° rotation with a joystick.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· Superb. Amazing camera positions durning cutscenes, great lighting effects, detailed and varying levels, gorgeous textures. It's everything you'd expect from a Ubisoft game.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is hard to hate because it offers playstyles for almost anyone, from die-hard Splinter Cell veterans to newcomers to the stealth genre. 9.5/10","May 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 124 of 148 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","124","148","0","11"

But being a fan of a series owned by Ubisoft is like having your lover fart in your mouth. Yo that is foul as ♥♥♥♥. After the mediocre Splinter Cell: Conviction, Ubisoft Montreal decided to stop being like the stuff I find in the back of my box, and actually try and make a Splinter Cell game. The problem with this is, they still need to meet publisher quotas, or atleast that's what I've been told.\n\nYou once again play as Sam Fisher, but now he sounds like he could be my big brother instead of my actual dad. The game revolves around a terrorist cell known as the Blacklist who commit to attacks every week the United States doesn't pull it's troops out of every country in the world and send them back to America. We, of course, cannot have this, so instead the president lady has Fourth Echelon (That's one more than Third Echelon) go on a mission across the world to hunt down Blacklist and it's leaders and be home in time for apple pie.\n\nThe gameplay works, it's like they wanted to make Chaos Theory again but had to use Conviction elements. Now you can go in non-lethally like the older games pre-Conviction, and you aren't put into set-piece like arenas where you have to end the lives of everyone who came into work that day. The game's levels, while not as open and expertly crafted as prior games, give you enough freedom so that you aren't bogged down by memorizing enemy patrol patterns to get past them unnoticed. It cuts down on the frustration and stop me from resorting to abusive alcoholism.\n\nYou get money after each mission that you can use to buy new stuff, such as suits, or guns, or gadgets, or a girlfriend. And if you're lacking money for that new hug pillow with Rise-Chan on it, you can always go on sidequests that you can bring that one friend you actually have along with you. Which is neat so when I eventually do mess up, I can blame on them instead. Good job, Mark.  Although these missions have less of a variety as the story missions, they still manage to be open and free enough that you can go about it your own way instead of having to follow a beaten path, which means you have time to get that wedgie out of your crack because your OP suit is riding up like it's asking you to prom.\n\nIf you're returning to the series, you'll notice some noticable differences in the characterization. Sam is nowhere near as snarky or as comedic as he was in previous installments and since Lambert died in Double Agent  most of the charm of hearing two friends screw around has really hurt both the tone and the likability of the lore and the story. Michael Ironside is gone and replaced with a guy who I didn't bother to remember, who makes Sam sound like he's a fresh young member of the agency rather than a grizzled old veteran. The change in tone from Conviction onward has honestly hurt the series, further proving that Conviction is like that other guy that lives beside your box but insists on spooning with you because "We have to stick together."\n\nIf having feel-good fun time with your friends doesn't tickle your pickle gay, you can always go online in the Spies vs Mercs mode. In this game mode you play as either Paul Blart mall cop in first person or Frankie Muniz from those Agent Cody Banks movies in third person.\nSo what you have are Mercs in defense, where you move around and ♥♥♥♥ your pants because a spy could be around any corner ready to steal the colonel's secret recipe from you. Or you play as a spy while you move around and ♥♥♥♥ your pants because a merc can come around any corner and fill you without enough holes that it's both a war crime and a sex crime. Dirty.\nWhile not being as pulse pounding as Chaos theory's or Pandora's Tomorrow's multiplayer, it's still a rather fun diversion and may keep you around if you enjoy both competitive and stealth gameplay. Don't expect anything revolutionary, though. They're video game developers, not miracle workers.\n\nBut should you play Splinter Cell: Bar Bouncer front gate?\nIt's fun. Not 30 Canadian Funbux fun, but you'll get some enjoyment out of it. It's certainly better than the fifth game in the series, but nowhere near as good as the second or third.\nSplinter Cell:White chart gets seven Oscar Mike's out of a possible ten Tango Downs.\n\nMegamouth sharks are so rare that there have only been 63 sightings in record history.\n\nThe curator has reached 101 members. I'd like to thank my publisher, my manager, and the cafe owner across the street I've repeatedly  called "mom".\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\n\noh yeah, and this game uses Uplay.

I always thought that the point of a secret agent was that his existence remained as much a secret as possible. In SC:B, it's quite the contrary.\n\nThe SC fans will likely opt for the Ghost approach. In SC:B, being a Ghost means you can be seen by the enemy as long as you knock him out within a second. You can knock out as many people as you want, shoot out light bulbs, destroy cameras, you name it. The next morning, nobody will remember a thing and will probably blame the destroyed light bulbs and cameras on a power surge or something.\n\nYou'll go on this mission where you must hack some computers, and where, if you're "detected", the enemy will wipe out the data and the mission will be a failure. But apparently, if you knock out the entire base before hacking the servers, it's not suspicious at all and they won't wipe out the data, because, bleh.\n\nAnd if you remain completely invisible without leaving as much as a drop of sweat, the game rewards you with a lame 11000 points and a few thousand dollars. If you opt for wiping out the whole base, you'll get 20000+ points and even more money. Even shooting light bulbs rewards you with money.\n\nEverything that was challenging in the previous games is now gone.\n\nIt's a somewhat fun game, but it's pretty far from what made Splinter Cell "redefine the stealth action" genre.

Blacklist came out 2013, and I have to say that it still looks brilliant. It was a blast to play since the game is very nice optimized. SLI supported so I played it on ultra at 1440p, 144 fps. This most have been one of the best looking games of 2013, because it's still impressive.\n\nPersonally I would really like to play this in first person. There's 2 missions where you can play first person, but the rest is in third person. I looked around for a camera option, but I found that there is none. It's only in the missions that they selected. Too bad about that, because I though that was a lot more fun.\n\nThe strong part of this game is in my opinion the story. A terror group called the engineers is threatening USA with attacks if they don't pull back their troups out of other countries. Sam Fisher and his team is trying to find the people behind it, and the cutscenes add a lot to the story. Voice-acting and lip-sync is good and help the story out. What kept me playing to the end was absolutely to see how the story ended, and I liked it.\n\nThere's a pretty cool upgrade system. You get points based on what you playstyle is. Combat, panther or ghost. Now I tried to sneak a little, but most of the time I went for combat. Since I chose the combat/panther path I upgraded my gear for that. More powerful weapons, and gear with better armor. If you wanna sneak better you can upgrade to more sneaky gear and gadgets. I really like that I got the choice and wasn't forced to play in any perticular way. Some missions are unfortunately sneak only, but it's limited. Those missions frustrated me a little, but I can look past it.\n\nI didn't feel like the guns had that powerful feeling and the gunplay was a little dull in my opinion. Melee takedowns was cool though. I though the gunplay was much better in the few first person missions. I just wish I could choose to play that way in every mission. But that's really the only downside that I personally felt.\n\nAll in all, this is a good AAA-game that you can play in your own way. Blacklist has a nice story, that is pretty lenghty and definitely replayable, with maps that have multiple paths and bonus objectives. I rushed through it and it still took me about 10 hours, but if you want you can spend a lot more time then that. I'm personally done with blacklist after one  playthrough and have no desire to go back, but im still glad I played it. I simply have a lot of other games I wanna play too, but if you are that person that like to play a game many times over, this is probably a game for you.\n\nThere is a lack of stealth games on the market, and this is one of the better ones. It runs super well, sounds good and the gameplay is fun. Sure I have some criticism on it, but it's minor things that most people won't care about. I would recommend it to everyone that like sneak games, third person shooters and games with a good story. I'm happy I played it, even though it wasn't what I expected before going in. I think people should give it a shot, on sale or even at full price. Gunplay was no more then decent in my opinion, but story, stealth, graphics and optimization made up for it.","May 23","true","10.7"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","62","68","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/235600/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Is this game better than Chaos Theory or Double Agent? Not quite, but it does give the splinter cell series another variance, or at least a build off of Conviction.\n\nThe first probable thing the player will note is that Michael Ironside, the original voice of Sam Fisher is no longer in the game. This is brutally apparent as the new voice actor is simply way too soft and cannot be taken seriously. What is sort of nice though, instead of walking around in a warehouse like in double agent, Sam is now on a giant airplane which is his new mobile air base. This essentially is the RPG element to the game. You may update everything from your inventory, to your suit, even to the airplane adding special GPS features or infirmary upgrades. The main map table the player is able to approach allows the player to choose single player, co-op, or multiplayer game modes.\n\nThe story revolves around terrorists in which every few days they activate a new doomsday type of scenario (poisoning water, remote explosive, etc...). The pitch here is that Sam is to prevent the doomsday before occurring. Old faces prod up such as Anna Grimsdottir and new characters also join the team. At one point in the game, you switch from Sam's 3rd person view to his partners, Isaac Briggs first person view (there is also first person view in multiplayer spies vs mercs). The story is interesting and does provide good plot points, but I can't help feel it's a little corny at times.\n\nThe game play seems like a cross breed of Conviction and Double Agent. I like the game, but it seems like sometimes you can simply rush through and shoot anyone. Not certainly a bad thing as Sam Fisher is quick to shoot, but it went from a fear of being spotted, to now simply bouncing from cover to cover. The cover system is neat and let's you plant yourself where you want to be with a simple look (using the right thumb stick) and pressing A to initiate the action. Blind fire like Gears of War is available and outlines of where enemies think you are, show up when you move to another spot. Technical aspects such as these exist in the game with the complement of Sam's gadgets such as sticky cameras or grenades. The game play it alright, and feels sort of boxy and restricting at times unlike the other Splinter Cells. Lethal and non-lethal take down options are available and hiding the bodies (or throwing them for that matter) sometimes becomes fun and easy. Throughout the game, Sam receives cold hard cash depending on his performance on the mission. This money can be used to unlock further gear, guns, or gadgets that suit you. Sam's movements are smooth, but I feel Double Agent just feels a little better than this one. I like the three combat system score they have in game. Panther (silent kills), combat, and stealth all make up your unique performance. At times, you will feel Sam can take on an entire army. Then there are times where taking on a guy with armor suddenly becomes tricky. Stealth is still here, but it isn't as authentic as it was in Chaos Theory or the first.\n\nThe sounds and graphics are good. You will hear Sam make his usual remarks throughout levels. Side commentary relevant to the game, especially when Sam's calling out there's dogs up ahead, is certainly helpful. The menu music to background music is good. When you get caught though, it isn't as suspenseful as the first SC. They tried nailing every little last piece of sweat on everyone's face. Sounds are appropriate as multiple gun types are available. It's nice to hear a silencer do it's job or an AK go off and alert everyone in the vicinity.\n\nThe only way they could have made this game better (from the rating I'm about to give it) was to add a LOCAL co-op feature. I'm not sure why everyone thinks no one plays video games together anymore, but adding that would have been an astounding addition to the game. That, and getting Michael Ironside back. He literally made Sam Fisher who he is today.\n\nRating : 7.8/10.\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B+	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B+	Overall 	B+\nWould recommend a buy on sale, it's a good game with a lot to do, but I feel previous Splinter Cells had much more ingenuity put into them. This feels like Conviction 2.0 + DLC. It does provide, however, a lot of replay-ability. Multiplayer, co-op, and singler player should keep you occupied just enough. It would have easily hit a 8+ with local co-op.\n\n***I should add, indeed you need uPlay, but if you take a second and set it up properly, you can run this game through steam without a problem. Again, yes, it's uPlay... but this is definitely a game worth setting it up for!\n\nScreenShots :\nThey changed the detection system to make it more simple. I find Chaos did a better job\n\nExecution feature of the game is still present\n\nThis is the RPG element I spoke of in the review\n\nThe game is discreet in showing what actions you can do, and where you can do them\n\nSomething to do aboard the Paladin\n\nNew face of Sam Fisher\n\nScreenShots : Co-op\nCo-op screenshot, distracting the guard holding me hostage as he shoots him\n\nSome areas you cannot proceed until both of you are there\n\nCommunication is pretty vital, so wearing a headset really helps\n\nEven your partners ghost is viewable by you","May 24, 2015","true","9.1"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","63","70","5","4"

Why does the game only reward you for sticking to one of the three pure styles? The game is tedious to play 100% ghost, but playing 100% panther makes it really difficult to immerse yourself as a covert military operative. I tried to do a combination of both styles (trying to stay hidden but using weapons when necessary), but the game seemed to punish me for my decision when scores were tallied at the end of each level. I guess you can ignore the scores and the game telling you that you failed to reach the designated goals as a ghost or as a panther, but for me it felt unfair to be punished for trying to play pragmatically in synch with the story.","November 13, 2014","true","9.4"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","60","67","4","0"

The story is alright in single player, nothing to write home about. Love all the weapons/gadgets you can unlock by playing, with the need to earn virtual money to buy each one, I spent a lot of time re-doing missions/co-op to earn more money for all the items. Re-doing missions with different loadouts or going different playstyles is a lot of fun.\n\nThe co-op missions are even better online, and a lot of fun. Just wish they had built in VOIP as it's sometimes hard to tell your teammate not to do something stupid.\n\nThe PVP multiplayer is kind of meh. Yes they brought back spy vs mercs but it just feels very unbalanced and unfair at times. It really comes down to being a spy, hiding in a shadow, run up to merc, press x, boom merc is dead, rinse repeat. Gets old.\n\nOTHER than that, the CO-OP is fun, the single player is fun, and it's a lot of fun unlocking everything and re-doing missions. Well worth it for less than $30.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/re-pick/recommended/235600/","re-pick","Roo2T","http://steamcommunity.com/id/re-pick/","888 products in account","I do recommend to purchase this game but only when it is on big sale and I will explain why in details.\n\nFirst of all, I have to be honest - I am SC fan and I was playing the series right from the first title. And yes, I do not care about graphics - more about overall atmosphere. Though I do care about how devs supporting their product.\n\nPROs:\n\nThe game has very good single player and if you play it right it feels like that old SC's that I loved so much - you can do the things silently or even without touching anyone (there are some counter-examples though). I have to mention "train break-in" and believe me you won't be happy with this situation if you are fully stealth player. Overall, single player is a good way to entertain yourself for another day or two but that's all. If you are the "loud guy" you can also re-play everything as panther or assault. The only question remains is why those awesome night infiltrations have gone? You encounter only several in this installment.\n\nCO-OP. Well, it took the best features of SC Conviction co-op and executed them just perfectly - it is another great game to play with a good friend of yours for some time. The only thing I don't love is that it is way too short (I am also extremely dissapointed with that Briggs'  missions never-ending bug, but let's keep it aside as it might get fixed). It's an outstanding co-op if you play it right - you have all the tools you need but if you fail to deliver you are the only one to blame.\n\nHowever, the thing I was so excited about is SvM (Spies vs Mercs). This was initially introduced in Pandora Tomorrow and in next installment, Chaos Theory, it keep many gamers entertained for years. Double Agent also presented us with SvM but it was not so popular. With no SvM in Conviction I though that the series is getting worse (like many others on the market, sadly) but SvM got its place back in Blacklist. It is so much fun that you can play it for hours and hours, again and again. It is almost perfectly balanced, and, aside for some bugs, you can equally good play as a merc and spy and there is no loosy side really. You might think that one side is better than the other one at first, but as soon as you start to use your equipment properly and your skill increases - you will see that SvM is balanced nicely. I was in worldwide top 15 at the moment of writing so I do know what I am talking about. What about modes - I was so hooked by SvM Blacklist that I abolished that SvM Classic mode, which many claim not to be classic (and I agree with them). They re-introduced Deathmatch as well, which still looks weird for me, even though my beloved Chaos Theory also had one. For newcomers I recommend to try out SvM Blacklist and SvM Extraction.\n\nPoints are - if you are looking for Chaos Theory Redefined - Blacklist is a good choice as it is Chaos Theory ideas blended with some Conviction mechanics. If you are looking for exact copy of Chaos Theory or Pandora Tomorrow - you better look for an unsold copy of CT or PT at your local store - Blacklist has different focus - it is more action-driven than Chaos Theory (single-player and co-op) and  more diverse in terms of SvM. Yet it has many bugs in each of the modes of game so you have to live with it. However, as I have been playing CT for years I glad I now have something else to play.\n\nCONs:\n\nMajor technical issues - Ubisoft failed everywhere it can. Let's start:\nGeneral. You have reinstalled your game?  Congratulations, your saves, DLCs and friends on the list are now messed up. Everybody complains about it since the release and nothing was done here. You have high-end PC? Well, that's good for you but still you will witness FPS drops, launch failures and whatever the game can possibly present you with. Even on Official Gameplay reveal day the game crashed. ANd again, Ubisoft fails to make it work.\n\nSingle-player. There are moments when you are forced to use your weapons or whatever you don't want to as a ghost. Many missions are just not from Splinter Cell world and you have to deal with it. Ending? Well, you have to wait for someone to think of something else. After some patches Sam are likely to bash all doors he can see. Definitely an improvement.\n\nCo-op. Short. And by this I mean extremely short. Random picture distortions, FPS drops in some locations. You can spend 2 hours passing the last Briggs' mission in ghost style just to face the never-ending bug. And what Ubisoft has done about it? They say, start over. That's all. Additionaly, you might be unable to play with your friend - you can play with randoms but not with your beloved friend who also bought this game.\n\nMultiplayer (SvM). Ubisoft completely failed technical part here. You can see half of animation of you killing a person and then you drop dead and that person is near death. You can see Merc's reloading animation yet he completes reloading in the middle of animation and shoots you. Many complaints - nothing was done here. You will kill (and be killed) your enemies while they are already behind cover just because you started shooting early. You can sometimes see spies through cover when they stick to it. Some pieces of spy gear (takedown gloves) has absolutely no real effect - even support cannot say what it does exactly. And there are many, many more issues in SvM. Oh, one more thing..Cheating? It is allowed so you can't really distinct between really good players and cheaters unless their cheating effect is obvious.\n\nOverall, 7.0/10. If not some major issues - the game might be perfect one. Though Ubisoft managed to fail another good title.","September 21, 2013","true","550.5"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","0"

Splinter Cell!\n(tldr is the overall impression on the bottom)\n\nI've been a huge Splinter Cell fan since the first part and so played every single one of the franchise.\nSo I felt like Chaos Theory was the last )  real  (and best!) Splinter Cell in terms of gameplay and stealthiness. The 2 following games,  Double Agent  and  Conviction  felt quite disappointing and not like good 'ol Splinter Cell to me.\nThat being said, I was unsure if I really should give  Blacklist  a chance, as I also was warned that it might disappoint me aswell.\n\nWhen the game was offered for around 10 bucks, I decided to give it a try.\nAnd honestly I was quite surprised!\n\nThe positive :\n\n+ the game offers you to choose your own playstyle. You're able to choose between 3 different approaches each mission: Ghost (remain unseen and no kills!), Panther (no alarms and stealthy kills) and Assault (just shoot at everything in your sight). If you want to have that original Splinter Cell feel, you definitely should go for Ghost, as it is the most fun (Panther too, but it feels too easy) and I think also most rewarding gamestyle.\n\n+ you can do a lot of sidemissions and you're still able to do a lot of stuff after the quite short main campaign (around 8-10 hours, depending on how your playstyle is)\n\n+ a lot of different weapons and gadgets.\n\n+ the story is quite alright, although nothing really extraordinary. But it does keep up the tension (although you might already know how it ends anyway)\n\n+ the maps/levels are quite cool, also because not everything is during night.\n\nThe neutral :\n\n~ it has a coop mode! (Note: I didn't really play it, so I won't judge it as positive or negative. But there are still people who play it, so go ahead!)\n\n~ Uplay. While I'm actually not bothered by it, some people may see this as  negative. I just wanted to mention it, but it doesn't really bother me. A negative point would be that your achievments can only be seen in Uplay, but that's it for me.\n\n~ The soundtrack is alright, but nothing outstanding. Does fit to the game.\n\n~ Graphics are decent, too. The game is around 2-3 years old, so it should run on most computers. Nothing special, though.\n\nThe negative :\n\n- I'll start with the biggest one: the last bossfight.\nOh god, it's so awful. I don't what their aim was for that one, but it is boring, annoying and you don't really know what to do. I think I needed to do it 5-6 times, not because it was difficult but because it's so confusing. As it is the only boss fight, it's forgiveable, but it will be my alltime favorite for worst boss fight of all time. ( I don't want to spoil your *fun*, so that's everything I'll say about it)\n\n- cheesy characters and dialogues.\nThe hacker dude really has some cringe-worthy moments and lines (tells a bad joke, nobody laughs, he says "What?". Oh god.)  and is such a stereotypical character. Also some dialogues are just too action cliché like. It isn't that bad, but I can't just overlook it .\n\n- The main story is quite short, but I think the additional side missions somehow make up for it.\n\n\nOverall impression :\n\nI generally recommend this game, as it feels like old splinter cell again (if you're choosing to play ghost!).\nI wouldn't say that it is a must have because of some minor to major flaws but if you're a fan of the Splinter Cell series and a fan of stealth games, I definitely would say that you should pick it up! Also because it isn't that expensive right now and most importantly it's fun!\n\nGets 80/100.","November 6, 2015","true","14.0"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","54","62","6","0"

You start in a windowed mode and get thrown straight into the game, you can't change your controls, video settings until the intro for the tutorial mission plays out and you're in the level. No main menu is given to you to load or adjust settings initially.\n\nI've played one sitting and then quit. When I returned to the game, MY PROGRESS WAS NOT SAVED!! I had to restart from the beginning again! There's no load game option... I can't resume to where I left off! WTF!\n\n--------------------------------------\nOn the game itself - I've played almost every Splinter Cell game (SC1, Pandora, Chaos Theory, Double Agent, Conviction) obsessively since the franchise began.\n\nI was one that hated (ok, disliked) Metal Gear and loved SC's methodical and open approach to stealth, and would play the games over and over, and did Ghosts runs/No disturbing enemies and no alerts.\n\nI rented and finished Conviction in 1 day and actually enjoyed it as brainless fun even though it was the least favourite of the series.\n\nI had hoped that Blacklist would be the return to SC's former glory.\n\n-------------------------------\nUnfortunately, while Blacklists incorporates stealth elements back into the game... it feels very restricted. The levels are on rails and the enemies perform the same routines over and over.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be variation in AI pathing and behaviour, everything is scripted in a very linear manner.\n\nIf you follow specific timings you can automatically get through stealth sections as a routine. It almost feels like a bot could be programmed to run through the levels because of how little randomness there is.\n\nThe KB + Mouse controls are very awkward and more than once Sam climbed over a car instead of shifting to an adjacent side. This is one of those games where you need a controller, and that's understandable given SC's console origin.\n\nAll in all - I recommend RENTING this game if you're playing SP. I haven't tried the MP yet so I can't comment on it. If you have a console, go down and rent this from the shop, it's not worth buying IMO.","December 1, 2013","false","16.0"," 124 of 183 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","124","183","0","5"

To cut it short: It's an excellent game. It was the first game I played (upon release) that had the enter/exit cover option, and in the beginning I wasn't sure if I liked it, but it definitely grew on me. It allows for superior tactical planning.\n\nYou definitely have a choice here how you want to handle a mission, and you can tailor your load-out to match. I find that I usually prefer a good medium between stealth (ghost) and silent takedowns (panther). The third option, assault, ultimately turns into chaos and that is not really how a Splinter Cell (by definition an operative who is a silent infiltrator that has the freedom to choose on how to proceed) works. I find that a non-lethal takedown usually works quite well, but there are situations in which pacifying a room permanently, is definitely a good plan (e.g. hostage situations) if safe to do so and if the mission parameters allow for it. There are definitely some targets tht need to be captured alive!\n\nDuring the game you will have the option to upgrade your gear which will also provide you with much better intel while you're deployed, and will give you better abilities to protect yourself. Spending available Uplay points on available suit options is also definitely helpful, if you're pondering that. They're both worth it.\n\nSome have complained that the "execution" system (you gain up to three points for silent takedowns which you can then use to automatically execute marked targets with a headshot) is making things too easy, but ultimately the truth is that you have to work for that option to become available and it is not an automatic "recharge". You will, however, find several weapons crates during a mission that will allow you to restock on ammo and gadgets.\n\nIf you liked any of the previous Splinter Cell games (and if you like tactical/stealth/military games I can't see why you wouldn't), then this is definitely a recommendation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venesect/recommended/235600/","Venesect","Venesect","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venesect/","597 products in account","Splinter Cell has been a series I can remember starting. I played the very first one on the original Xbox with my step sister and have then played every continuing title. Of course this brings me to the newest one, Splinter Cell Blacklist. Blacklist is a spy, thriller, and action game all in one. One of the most iconic things about the series is the protagonist himself, Sam Fisher. Fisher has one of the most recognized voices in gaming, however in this iteration they used a different voice actor (I'm not entirely sure why). Though, I think the new voice actor portrays Fisher very well. He still embodies Fisher in character and spirit.\n\nThe premise of the game isn't anything new, the generic "Terrorists are attacking us, we need to figure out why and stop them." However, I think this story arc is an interesting one as it takes place in a variety of locations that all have a unique feel to them. Gameplay wise, it feels just like Splinter Cell has always felt. You've got your stealth mechanics that require patience, skill, and wits. While stealth has always been the preferred method, they've included ways that allow you to be a ruthless killer in the shadows along with going on an all out assault. There are a ton of weapons you can use and that are customizable with scopes, attachments, and ammo types. Gadgets play a big role, maybe even bigger than the previous games it feels. There are several that are also customizable. Sticky cams, noise makers, and tricopters let you take different approaches to a level. Want to scope out ahead and mark or even neutralize the enemies? Fly that tricopter in and use the sticky shock shooter it has attached. Need to lure a few guards away to make a quick escape? Throw a noise maker in the opposite direction. The ways you can utilize these gadgets is endless. Though, the problem that stems with this is that sometimes it makes the levels feel too easy. Once you unlock the sonar goggles (I think there are a few more levels past that but I didn't bother), you pretty much have it easy from there on. Being able to see the enemies through walls allows you to anticipate them easier, there's even one that tracks footsteps I believe.\n\nBack to the level design, I'd say it's fairly well done. For the most part the levels are pretty straight forward (not linear per se). You go from point A to point B to complete your objective. There are different paths you can take inbetween that allows you to mix things up and still not feel too linear. When you explore and find that one spot, you'll usually come out with an advantage. These paths can make things easier when you're aiming for a no kill approach to the game, which frankly makes the game way harder than it needs to be (there is a professional mode as well, will go through on a second playthrough to do that). The game takes a good while to go through, my play through was about 15 hours and then I did a few of the side missions. I also ended up taking my time, making sure I could memorize the enemy patterns and when my best oppurtunity was. I think the pacing is pretty good. I wouldn't complain that it's too short because I wanted to keep playing so it was nice when I wasn't able to anticipate when it would end right away.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer where it's Spy vs. Merc, but I haven't played that, I wasn't too interested. I believe all of the missions allow a co-op option which sounds like a lot of fun. Some paths are geared towards having another teammate like an extra high ledge you'd only be able to reach with one. If you have a friend, I'd say give it a go and play through it coop, it'd be a lot of fun.\n\nSo all in all, I would recommend this to anyone who has played and enjoyed the previous Splinter Cell games and anyone who enjoys stealth and being a spy. I wouldn't say it's the best in the series, (Chaos Theory holds that spot) but it's one of the better ones. It's graphically amazing, gameplay stays true to the series, and a fairly decent story.","October 4, 2014","true","17.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","3"

It's an even-numbered Splinter Cell game that doesn't suck - is that not amazing enough?\n\nFeaturring the redefined stealth/action mechanics in Conviction (mark & execute, faster movement, better interaction with objects to hide behind), and the tried and tested mechanics from Chaos Theory (the knife - cut through tents again, interrogation, optional slow pace and the return of the "flaring" equipment to signal zero visibility), this new entry adds a system of evaluating your performance under the usual alarms and detections, but refines this by scoring how you approach these detections (or how good you are if you're not detected at all).\n\nThe Ghost score (stealth, no fatality) rewards the player for knockouts, non-lethal takedowns, or no detection at all  - a must for the purists. The Panther style (stealth, no alarms, lethal - can be detected, but no alarms raised) rewards those who like to kill and disappear, or who kill upon detection before an alarm is triggered, even counting bodies found. The Assault (alarms, detections, kills while in high alert) rewards those who prefer the Desert Eagle over the silenced pistol, and prefer to use stealthy approaches such as shotguns, grenades and explosions. Of course, points are given, rewards appear based on this (such as armour or tools), and allow you to level up to the ultimate agent in your own style.\n\nEach level features multiple paths and approaches to tailor the game to the player's chosen style, and allows for exploration without feeling too linear (it's a stealth game with plot-based directives, we can't all worship phantom pain and expect open-world) or constricted.\n\nThe storyline continues the plot from Conviction (in a way), and pales in comparison, but keeps the player entertained enough to want to achieve goals.\n\nVisually, this game is amazing, the assets shine bright and loud, but don't cost like some games - the people in this team truly achieved some amazing work under the optimisation stage (Conviction stutters at 720 on my machine on medium, this runs just under ultra at 1080).\n\nOverall, a very well-oiled machine, with plenty of levels, plenty of routes and goals to keep the player re-trying again and again to reach perfection. One quibble though - The quadcopter was a complete waste of time. Far too gadget-loving, and cripples the difficulty in some places; avoid for true fun except where mandatory.\n\nGreat fun, and welcome to most SC fans, if a little underwhelming and possibly preachy with story.\n","November 25, 2015","true","26.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","22","24","5","0"

An interesting take on a 3rd person stealth-action game which should please both Splinter cell newcomers and veterans.\n\ntoo long part:\nGENERAL GAMEPLAY - 8/10\nAs a SC veteran, I gotta say things changed a huge deal since Chaos Theory but I really enjoyed basically everything this title has to offer gameplay-wise. Controls feel pretty smooth and natural after a short while and the infamous Assassins Creeds "press this button to either live or jump off a cliff" syndrome is not showing its presence as much.\nAI difficulty settings offer an adequate challenge for everyone, while the games arcade side keeps you fairly rewarded for everything you're trying to achieve. No matter which mode you are playing, every little step forward feels good.\nSome people find the economy of unlocking stuff rather questionable but it's definitely not a reason to make you stop playing the game.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER - 7/10\nIf you've never played a Splinter Cell game before, it's not a problem - there are no essential references to earlier games which allows anyone to embark on this Jack Bauer's "24-style" storyline with decent actors and moderately catchy story (pro-american as hell but you can't avoid that these days it seems). The game attempts to go rather back to its roots while still trying to maintain the action-hungry audience and does a very decent job at that. You can play the game the way you want and that is awesome.\n\nCOOP - 7.5/10\nAs far as the coop campaign goes, unless you have a friend to play with, the odds of matchmaing giving you a guy on the same note as you are pretty slim. There is also a nice horde mode which is good for farming money and practicing your abilities. Both modes are a lot of fun and youll most likely play each map and mission more than once. Important note is that your cash is shared in both COOP and MULTIPLAYER which is awesome and it lets new players get into the game more easily.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - 6/10\nBasic matchup is 1st person heavy armed mercs VS 3rd person agile spies. Modes with mixed teams and lot of variation are available. Some maps seem imba one way or another but since its not competitive, nobody really cares.\nLatency is a ♥♥♥♥♥ here. Due to the hand-to-hand combat system which requires a really fast response rate youll be suffering more than in most other action games.\nSkill and time invested really pays off here as your ♥♥♥ is gonna be kicked hard by higher level players, which leads me to another good point - NO LOGICAL TEAMBALANCE. The game is gonna stack the highest level players in one team and dump the rest in the other. You might as well leave before the match starts.\nThere is NO LEGIT OPTION TO QUIT while your match is in progress which is incredibly F'n stupid.","November 11, 2014","true","58.9"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","2"

So it's something new for me^^ And this something new suprised me alot. Game really good from stealthable part. Alot of ways to complete mission by stealth. Really interesting, you can just avoid all guards or use some equipments  to kill them in really different ways. Really alot equipments in this game so i wasn't boring with them :) Or you can just quietly run and kill or beat enemies with your butt of the rifle  from behind. In this game exist 3th and 1th field of view but main field of view it's of cource 3th to be honest i didn't play alot multiplayer but i know that exist kind of competition where some guy playing as spy he is a hacker(3th person) and another guy who must to protect pc's merc he is an enforcer(1th person). So if you are real fan of 1th person shooters  this game must interested you too a bit :3 But anyway it's more related for 3th person. I remember in one mission you must play from Briggs and this part in mission only from 1th person. And i can say that from 1th person  more harder than from 3th person especially stealth. Story in this game really cool.It's just all about secret agents epic story , explosions, attacks which you of cource must stop, etcetera. Not alot of jokes in Blacklist but i really like when not alot of jokes in game but alot of them shows up in right  time and right place at least it's better than not funny jokes every  min. In Co-op really great to spend time with friends....it's just something awesome :3 There are missions which you can complete alone in co-op and with friend. You can plan your actions do something interesting together :) I think  this all what i wanted to say.Of cource i recommend this game!

Blacklist is a horrible amalgamation between Conviction's enjoyable-but-misplaced action gameplay, and Chaos Theory's truly inspired stealth.\n\nWhat you get are rather linear levels that have two or three multiple paths (with all of the logical stealthy ways locked out for co-op only), AI with x-ray vision who discover hidden bodies in bins and through walls, enemies who know your exact location after just one shot, and truly terrible gunplay with bullet deviation (not recoil) and questionable hit boxes. I have had a fully upgraded pistol with a laser sight aimed right on an enemies head in "zoomed in/accuracy" mode from a few metres away, and had the bullet embed itself in the wall above him, causing him to be instantly aware of exactly where I am. I've had bullets pass straight through the head of a well lined up headshot, again from close range. Ubisoft have also decided to limit the range on weapons to incredibly short distances, with pistol being effective at distances up to around 5-10 metres, and rifles up to around 20-30. This is incredibly jarring and removes any possibility of picking off enemies quietly from the distance. There is a sniper rifle in game, but I could not bear the game long enough to buy and try it. They also limit some missions to co-op only. This should be an appealing and tempting option to experience the game, not a way of punishing solo players or those (like me) who have picked it up on sale a few months after release.\n\nI am unsure if this is simply a poor port, which is possible with Ubisoft, but the game feels clunky with incredibly poor gunplay. Fundamentally there is the basis of a good game with lots of gear and weapon customisation, replayable levels, a wave-survival mode, and in-game challenges. However this is ruined by very poor gunplay (on a level of Alpha Protocol terrible), hit and miss AI who inexplicably see bodies through walls and are able to pinpoint your exact location after a misplaced shot, which is more often than not caused by the terrible gun mechanics. I really want to enjoy this game as I loved the SC games of old, but this is just a slapdash game that tries to please both the stealth and action fans, failing miserably on both fronts, whilst alienating those who play solo by cutting off a lot of map routes.\n\n4/10 - not even worth a sale buy. Pick up Chaos Theory and enjoy SC the way it is meant to be played.","February 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 97 of 158 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","97","158","0","3"

The execution system returns, but, unlike in Conviction, pure stealth remains a viable option throughout the game. The game makes concessions to modernity with two unwelcome additions: grinding money to buy equipment (although this can be considered an improvement on Conviction, as you no longer have to grind unrealistic PEC challenges to upgrade your gear) and easy-mode DLC, which gives you access to unique medium-tier gear from the start. Thankfully, the portable EMP does not return in Blacklist, which means you can no longer rely on it to instantly stun everyone around you whenever you get detected. Despite these problems, Blacklist features fun, thoughtful gameplay and a large variety of missions, as well as the ability to seamlessly replay any mission you choose from the game's hub. The ability to team up with friends for side-missions, which are playable in single-player, helps bridge the gap between solo campaign and co-op; although there is a dedicated co-op mini-campaign. which features elements that simply would not be possible with missions designed to be playable alone or with a partner. The game feels and controls like it was developed for PC rather than being lazily ported, which is fantastic.\n\nIf you've been burned by Conviction, Splinter Cell: Blacklist will restore your faith in the series.","June 14, 2014","true","148.4"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkystring/recommended/235600/","inkystring","Inky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkystring/","981 products in account","The latest in the Splinter Cell series, where you play the perennial NSA ninja, Sam Fisher.\nThis is the first time in the series that the voice is not provided by Michael Ironside, which is s shame, but doesn't detract from the game overall.\nAlso,Sam Fisher seems to have grown younger by a  decade, and also now looks like Doplh Lundgren.\n\nOne of the new game mechanics is a broadening of play styles, allowing CoD type players to run and gun, whilst allowing the ninja gamers to sneak through a mission. It's a good idea, and opens up the variety of approaches for redoing missions.\nHowever, let's be clear here, this is less hardcore Splinter Cell source gameplay and more CoD with sneaking, and I suspect this is to cater for the ADHD twitch gamers, who do not have the patience to watch an enemy patrol pattern for five minutes.\n\nSingle Player\nThe campaign sets a scenario where a rogue MI6 agent is conducting a major offensive against US assests. Your goal is to foil these attacks before each event counts down.\nThe campaign missions, in true geo-political style, aspan across the globe, and in true Splinter Cell style, almost every high security facility in the world is run by demon accountants, who demand the greatest savings in lighting, giving plenty of shadows to hide in.\nNaturally, if they modelled them on real life facilities, the entire area would be bathed in incandescent lighting, and Sam Fisher would be shot dead before he reached the first climable ledge. However, moving on..\nSpoiler alert\nOne thing that was never clarified was Sadiqs motivation for wanting to kill the US presidency and Congress, and to be honest, he could have achieved the same aim much easier than the menu of demands provided over a week. He just was presented as eponymous bad guy, with no strong motivation for his actions\n\nSide Missions\nThis time you have a team under your command. These team members are essentially quest givers, with different play styles.\nGrim is strictly Ghost style. Any alerts and the missions is over.\nKobin is Panther/Ghost. Kill/subdue all enemies on the map. Reinforcements get called in if you are spotted.\nCharlie is wave based. Kill/subdue all enemies in each wave. Can extract after wave 5 for completion. 20 waves total.\nBriggs is co-op story missions. These side missions, along with the main missions will net you money, and can be farmed to get more money, as well as to perfect a play style.\nWhy do you need money ? Well, you can upgrade both your plane, gear and weapons, all of which is highly recommended.\nIn additon to the side missions, there are daily and weekly challenges  and Gone Dark missions which are lightweight investigation missions.\n\nMutiplayer\nThe game was released in mid 2013, and as a result the gaming herd has mostly moved onto other games.\nThere is still a lot of fun to be had in completing coop missions, and if you want to explore that side of the game fully, I'd recommend getting some of your mates to buy the game as well.\nMost of the players appear to be US  based, so there is some lag and time differences to take into account, and that brings me onto the lobby system.\nIt is very much in the CoD interface style of 'hide everything from the player'. Seach for players, and if no one is around, you are given the opportunity to start a lobby for players.\nOther than that, the lobby is very basic, so no setting max ping or region based gaming. Furthermore, there is no way to text chat in the lobby - has to be via microphone.\nIn game, you can both voice and text chat, but there is no history view, often is obscured by a game alert banner and when you are incapacitated, it is removed all together, which completely bemuses me.\n\nThe games' origin from a console is obvious, especially when you are trying to complete an action - many of the action triggers use the same button, so you will have situations where you want to open a window, and he flicks off the light switch.\nJust for fun, many of the actions are closely grouped together, so when you are trying to move quickly, you get a Benny Hill scenario where Sam Fisher will leap over a fence, leap back, jump up onto a ledge, jump through the unopened window - shattering the glass.\nAll you want to do was switch off the bloody light.\nIn one co-op game, my partner was downed, and I had to race to him to resusitate him, leaping over obstacles and dashing forth with courage and valour, under fire.\nWell, that was the intention.\nClosely grouped actions, panicked button pressing and lag all conspired against me, so rather than a heroic rescue, it appeared my character had suddenly decided now was a perfect opportunity to demonstrate a bracing set of gymnastics, all whilst my partner rapidly bled to death.\nUnimpressed, he disconnected shortly after.\n\nAdding to the action hilarity, is that fact the developers have bound some contextual actions to key combinations - but then failed to document them anywhere.\nFor instance, you are running up to a door, pressing (Shift + W). Once you arrive at the door, rather than stopping to allow you peek under it, Sam will instead kick it in, despite the action for Door Bash is bound to (F).\nOf course, kicking the door in alerts every ♥♥♥♥ing guard in the area, and may well terminate your mission.\nThe average PC keyboard has 104 keys, and yet Ubisoft have only utilised 2 for action keys. ♥♥♥♥ poor effort.\n\nThere is a lot to like about this game, but there are so many bugs in this game, I could fill several reviews with the bugs found in gameplay. Most of these issues stem from Ubisofts general disdain for PC gamers, catering to the console market first, and as this is a business policy, highly likely we are going to see the same style of issues in other PC games.\n\nThere are also some questionable design decisions (such as, you can't press Esc to skip through the logo loading screen, but once it has loaded, Esc dumps you out of the game with no confirmation; evidently a very clear decision from Ubisoft to say ♥♥♥♥ You)\n\nIn summary, it is a good game, and a lot of fun to play.\nGiven it's age, it can be picked up cheap from a number of outlets, along with the DLC. so, if you can see past the game bugs, it will provide you with a lot of entertainment (and frustration) and is a blast in Co-op.","June 28, 2015","true","82.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

If you're looking for a review of the _game,_ keep looking.)))\n\nThanks to Ubisoft, my ten dollars is gone forever.\n\nI bought the game this weekend, during the sale, thinking it was going to be a pick-up and play experience. Upon launching the game, it politely informed me that I needed to launch the game through Uplay, and that I needed to create a Uplay account to play it. I complied with their requests, signed into my account, entered my activation code, and launched the game(let's ignore the irony of playing a game through _two_ launchers).\n\nThe game crashed immediately. I tried restarting the game, it crashed again. Didn't even get to the loading screen. I figured "Hey, benefit of the doubt, maybe Uplay is a bit buggy. I'll try restarting it." So I exited out of Uplay and relaunched it through steam.\n\nUpon relaunch, it informed me that I needed to sign in again, despite clicking on the "remember me" box upon my initial sign-in. I tried signing in again, but it told me that my password was incorrect. Let me interject here and tell you that by this point, I had been trying to play this game for only about 5 minutes, there's no way I forgot my password in that time.\n\nNevertheless, I decided to restart my password. This didn't go over well, because the Captcha system they use is broken and will only let me use it if I use the audio version, which I only learned after a few minutes of frustratingly retyping the numbers on screen several times.\n\nWhen I finally got it to work, it informed me that there wasn't an account associated with that email. That's garbage, because I was looking at the inbox of said email address, and viewing the email they sent me upon creating the account. I even made sure the email in the box was the same as the email I was looking at, double checked the spelling, everything.\n\nThe best part is, since I activated the code, I can't use that if I tried making another account. Quite frankly, that code is GONE FOREVER, activated on an account that flickered in and out of existence within a few minutes.\n\nSo thanks for stealing my money, Ubisoft. Don't expect me to buy any more of your games from here on out, hope you use my ten dollars to buy yourself something reeeeally special. Like another Assasins Creed sequel that nobody wants.\n\nAvoid this game on this platform like the plague.","June 16, 2014","false","0.1"," 391 of 704 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","391","704","0","38"

That means that, I can get all the way through one of it's mission sections and nearly be completed, then wind up having to start that whole section over again if I get caught or killed before completeing the last faze of the mission! That really pisses me off!\n\nThen, on top of that. if a mission has two parts to it, and I'm nearly through with both parts, with just a few ment left or one more objective to complete and for some reason, I have to leave the game completely, I wind up having to redo BOTH parts of the mission! Again, that really pisses me off!\nI've had to play one (two part) mission over 3 times because because each part of the mission is so long that I've been unable to complete it within a reasonalble time frame before getting tired hand having to step away from the computer. Then, I wind up having to shut down the computer for the night because it's too late to continue by the time I can get back to it. So, when I do finally get back to it and relaunch the game, I have to start that mission from the very beginning! It won't even let me pick up at the last completed part of the mission!\n\nI personally might not have perchased it if I had known about this agrivating restriction!\n\nFor those that aren't anoyed by this irritating console saving restriction, you will most likely really enjoy this game.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nThis is a further review that my friend Aliona did in english for us.\n\nA Reviewi of Splinter Cell Blacklist\nWritten by my friend Aliona\n(English translation by Aliona)\n\n\n„Waiting for a light that never comes... “Linkin Park  (Nice music video)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCozbnCjUxg%5bi\n\nIn a few words: Splinter Cell Blacklist is a game I was looking forward to in fear that Ubisoft produces the second version of SC Conviction (there were many predictions). However, fortunately, that disappointment has passed me.\n\nMore details:\nNice graphic, stealth possibilities in all missions, various play-options, co-op, multiplayer – the biggest Splinter Cell yet.\nI found successful the mixture of attributes of the previous Splinter Cell parts.\nThe main mission of the game is linear but many additional tasks, which you can complete optionally, already give you an impression of "open world".\nUbisoft has not spared on locations: they are various and interesting.\nI also have to note that this is the first SC game, which you could play through without killing, of course, getting some extra points.\nI liked the map quizzes “Gone Dark” and the gear menu, although I had to explore it properly for a while.\n\nI also found the soundtrack interesting. I cannot imagine anybody would enjoy it outside the game (not to compare with the brilliant achievement of Michael McCann in “Double Agent”) but the music fits good in the situations increasing a little bit adrenaline in blood.\nReal perfectionists will surely like a new possibility to improve constantly their achievements in every completed task without finishing campaign mission. They will get more and more money for those walkthroughs but more points only in case of breaking their own record.\nIn SC Blacklist you will get the points not only for successfully finished missions and achievements but for SPEED too.\n\nAnyway, I should warn player who will try to get achievements in the game: there is simply no logic in getting such of them as “ghost” and “undetected” in some missions. Sometimes you will have to invest a lot of time in your own experience or use spoilers.\nHere are my video-examples: Sam was detected right at the beginning of the Airstrip mission. The “undetected” achievement missed but in the mission results, you could see „ghost” nonetheless:\nAirstrip\nhttp://steam://openurl/http:/steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=283968305\n\nOther way in the “Hacker’s Den” mission: I got “undetected” and “non-lethal” achievements but no „ghost”.\nHacker’s Den\nhttp://steam://openurl/http:/steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=283595939\nNow about some other shortcomings:\nFirst, I found the saving options extremely irritating. SC fans surely remember that the saving menu was available last time in “Double Agent”. SC Conviction already disappointed with its auto saves. At least, they were reliable.\n\nAuto saves are working in the current game too but in some missions although in-between saves were fixed they disappear when you interrupt the game at that point, and you have to return to the beginning of the mission after the next boot.\nIt concerns all Kobin’s missions: they consist of two parts with in-between saves. When you fail to complete them in “one sitting”, you have to start the missions from the beginning next time.\nThere are also some temporary saves in Charlie’s missions too but you get the first “fixed” save only survived after 10 attack waves.\n\nThe invaluable advice “do not switch off the power when this icon (saving) is displayed” sounds more sneeringly.\nAnyway, I recommend copying of saves after every session because Uplay could meanly remove them all during its next “synchronization”: that problem is still relevant. You could also deactivate synchronization in Uplay options.\nGame controls came mainly from SC Conviction, but some extensions were not finalized and unfortunately, the last patch could not really help. For example, the replacement of the "E" key on the “space” in some places has not solved the problem, and readdressed it elsewhere. I just mean that to fix on the same “space” key three functions (Use / Jump / Climb) is not a good idea.\n\nI found the hackneyed story about "terrorist threat" not particularly real and inventive. I think we have to attribute this to the lack of imagination of old and seriously ill Tom Clancy (R.I.P.)\nIn general, I can only recommend this game to all fans of Splinter Cell, stealth and action.

As a stealth experience the game is sorely lacking when held up against "The Trilogy" (Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, Chaos Theory) Everything has been dumbed down; the game plays more like a trial-and-error kind of experience - Try a section, fail, try something else, fail, try again, fail, rinse, repeat.\n\nThe old games rewarded patience, and planning, the new ones feel like they were made by someone that doesn't understand the genre.\n\nSam no longer acts, sounds, or feels like sam anymore.\n\nAs a long time fan this series this game has angered me more than it has disappointed me.\n\nAvoid!\n\n0/10","January 26, 2015","false","8.0"," 81 of 140 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","81","140","6","1"

So based on my experience I won't suggest you obtain this game unless it's on sale or you can play the cracked version because the multiplayer is  BROKEN. Yes, it's all in caps like I'm very serious. The only part that is broken, is the anti-cheats. When the game was out, it was hot and popular, but the competitive multiplayer mode was a sheyt-hole. So many hackers that I spotted that I can literally say everyone was probably hacking (me 2 ;] cuz everyone was hacking). This phenomenon totally destroyed the PvP experience. Wall hacking, super-speed, there were even hacks that I don't even know what it is, like I was a redneck in a apple store and my mind blown. Enough notions for that, since a PvP without anti-cheat sound horribly enough.\n\nBUT.The co-op mode was one of the best experience I've ever had. Since TCSC series have always been a thrilling spy-action title, playing with your friend is awesome that will make you tities hard as rocks. I'm just implying the intense moments the game will give you. The story is absolutely amazing, I have never read the original Tom Clancy's novels but playing something like "Mission Impossible" or "Bourne Series", special agents, spy, fancy gadgets & equipments, never gets old. Even sometimes my brain can't really catch up with the "intellectual" conversations sine English is not my first language, but all it matters is the momentum. Not to mention Sam Fisher looks perfect for a agent even his face changed a LOT, I remember I was questioning if they changed the main character when I saw him in Blacklist for the first time.\n\nAbove all, I always love the spy titles, and TCSC has always been nice stealth games. Despite the bad efforts on PvP maintenance, this game is good to play with a best friend (yes two players only in co-op) through the whole campaign. I might just play it again, just for fun.\n\nPost edit:\n\nI mentioned PvP was not satisfying,  but the PvP design is unique and amazing (subjective), I wouldn't  say it is well balanced since they never updated any PvP content or a major fixes. (may contain spoilers) Playing in two factions as Merc or spy sounds awesome and looks amazing. Mercs literally looks like badasses and beefy and limited with first person view, Spies look very slickly in terms of the armor design and the weapon specifics, stealthy black-shadow with high-end gears attached and with third person view only. Spies can instantly kill a Mercs just like you would do in the single player mode, if you handle the kill with good timing because with proper responds and/or cooperations Mercs can counterattack in the close range combat. Only dropping from a higher ground or ledge kill cannot be reversed. Different weapons and modifications make the PvP mode even more interesting, both Mercs and Spies have a special view, different types of radars (thermal, motion-tacking, sound detecting, etc.) supporting Mercs on spotting or locating Spies, different goggles (electronic, sonar, thermal) are provided to Spies as well. PvP mode is sure, very competitive and intense, for me it was all about my skills and techniques, and how slippery or sharpen you brain react. It is very easy to get paranoid while playing as Mercs since your vision is limited, and you can get cocky and shot in the back because of taking too much advantages while playing as Spies. Even though the game is old, the server is still activating, you can still find a lobby with bunch of hardcore fans still playing. I would say that is a conscientious move of Ubisoft, even you will still get rekt by hackers. lel..","May 17, 2015","true","131.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Very enjoyeable for anyone who likes that type of gameplay.\n\nPlayers start off by choosing a mission they want to do. Once that is underway, the game rates players according to their playstyle. There are 3 categories an action can fall into: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. Each action is then tallied up at the end of each mission and a score is given accordingly. A stealthier approach will earn better rewards. Those who want to go in guns blazing can do that too on most missions. However, there are times when stealth is the only acceptable approach.\n\nThere is an excellent multiplayer component as well. Playing "Spies Vs. Mercs" is extremely fun and I'm glad Ubisoft decided to bring it back. I actually bought the game primarily to play it after watching some footage on youtube. My only complaint is the co-op portion, which never seems to work. I'm guessing this is probably due to the game being a few years old now and not enough players being available online. And I did not try to play it with a friend, so I can't speak in regards to that. Thus far, I haven't been able to play any of Brigg's missions during the single player campaign as they are all co-op only. But they are not required to finish the story, so it's not a big deal.\n\nThe story was just... ok. It's not bad, but nothing spectacular either. It took me a little over 30 hours to finish the game on "normal" mode, including all side missions that weren't co-op only. They also apparently brought in a new actor to play Sam Fisher. He seemed a bit stiff and boring for my taste, but I've seen worse.\n\nEverything ran smooth on my PC for the most part, but the game did freeze a few times. I had it on Ultra high settings the whole time. My current rig has an i7 4790K CPU, a Geforce GTX 960 GPU, and 12 GB of DDR3 RAM.\n\nAnd yes, there is Uplay. So if you're one of those people who hates it, you've been warned.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game and I had a lot of fun playing it.","September 4, 2015","true","46.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

What does that mean?, it means that the game will not connect online, making coop and multiplayer useless, as well as any DLC that you might have bought, although it says it does, the game will crash exactly every 30 or so minutes (google it) due to several errors that are related to DX11, which is not true, since if you switch to using DX9, it still does the same thing. There are some fixes around that work here and there, and they are aware of the problem (supposedly) but do nothing about it. The achievements you get do not count as actions and are not cosidered through Uplay points. If you try to play the game offline, due to the beauty of Uplay, it won't save, so once you leave, you will have to restart everything again. Oh, and also their tech support is very dissapointing. My reply to the problem, was that because I use a laptop graphics card (NVS 5200M), it is not supported so tough luck, ticket closed.

Whether you like to play Full on 4th Echelon stealth mode, The Panther stealth/combat mix, or full on "Screw all of you in the ♥♥♥♥" combat mode, it's still a rewarding expeiriece.\n\nNow onto the multiplayer.\n\nBlacklist has an immersive, quick paced, and all around well balanced multiplayer mode called, "Spies versus Mercanaries". There are several game modes, and the cash you earn in multiplayer and in singleplayer intertwines, so if you want to level up Sam Fisher a bit, you can use any cash you earn from playing SVM.\n\nMercs team: Whilst playing on the Mercanaries team, your camera will be set in the first person, giving you little vision compared to the spies, which I will describe later. However, the Mercanaries have MUCH more powerful weaponry. Having loud and powerful assault riflles, pistols, shotguns, and Submachine Guns limits the little amount of stealth you can have, for the spies can use utilities such as sonar goggles to see a theremal image of you through walls. You start out the game with one class unlocked for each team, similar to Call of Duty.\n\nSpies team: The spies team is much more stealth based, and they have much less lethal weaponry. However, as an advantage over the Mercanaries, the spies have a third person camera angle, and just as much manuverability as Sam Fisher in the single player campaign. They can climb walls, preform stealth kills, climb through ventilation systems, and much more.\n\nAs you progress through the multiplayer ranks, you will eventually have enough money to buy the ability to create your own customized class. Although it is pricy to unock this feature, it is still very much so worth it.\n\nFor the singleplayer/co-op experiece, however, I have played a good 3-4 hours of, and it has an impressive, and immersive storyline about a group of terrorists called "The Blacklist". The voice acting is outstanding and Eric Johnson makes a great new Sam Fisher, with the same old Rustic voice.\n\nOverall, Ubisoft and the late Tom Clancy did an amazing job with devoloping a game far more impressive than the previous title, "Conviction" R.I.P.

It will be updated if I am able to play the coop/multiplayer portions.\n\nSplinter Cell: Blacklist is the game the series has always wanted to be.\n\nIt acts as a culmination of every cool idea the series has ever had, finally finding that middle ground between the hardcore stealth that used to define the series, and the faster, more approachable and dynamic gameplay introduced in Conviction. It still isn’t perfect, as Ubisoft has stubbornly held onto a few of the less severe problems of the franchise, but for all intents and purposes Blacklist is far and away the best entry the series has ever had, which coming from someone who has enjoyed every Splinter Cell game ought to mean something.\n\nThe biggest problem of past Splinter Cell games up to Conviction was their strict adherence to set paths through levels, which were often difficult to discern and as a result required trial and error to get through. They presented you with a huge assortment of gadgets and tactical moves but rarely allowed you to use them unless they explicitly planned for you to, essentially removing any player choice with how you tackle a mission.\n\nConviction in contrary was the series rebirth, removing many of the extraneous stealth options but introducing levels that were far more open, and allowed a greater amount of freeform play. It transformed the series from one in which you were constantly vulnerable to having you be that danger, hunting down enemies and making your way through areas like a hi-tech ninja.\n\nBlacklist as I said before takes the best aspects of both these fairly different experiences and rolls them into a gloriously dynamic bundle of options and an endless supply of ways to make use of them. For once you are no longer punished for playing however you want to play, be it sneaking through levels leaving no trace you were ever there or rolling in guns blazing and allowing no witnesses, and paths and opportunities for every playstyle have been designed into each level, never locking you into one particular way of playing but giving you the choice the take on encounters any way you see fit.\n\nExpanded climbing options offer a level of verticality to levels that further extends your tactical abilities, often allowing access to secret paths or surprise takedowns. It made me conscious of the environment and how I could best make use of it, and nearly without fail anytime I looked for a solution it was there waiting for me.\n\nI always felt in control playing Blacklist, whether I was hiding from hostiles or taking shots at them, and this freedom makes for an experience that’s extremely empowering and encourages you to try out different approaches. I’ve never replayed a Splinter Cell game, but Blacklist gave me reason to revisit levels and see what I might have missed the first time around and a scoring system that rewarded exploiting every tool in my arsenal. Being able to customize said arsenal further allowed me to tailor my playstyle how I wanted, ranging from which guns and gadgets I used straight down to the color of the LEDs in my goggles. These choices all mattered and I was able to see my abilities increase as I progressed and gained better gear, giving me yet another reason to go back to older missions and see how much I had improved.\n\nUnfortunately, much of this doesn’t factor into the 4th Echalon side missions (which also act as the coop mode, though most can be played solo if you want). These smaller supplementary missions tended to lock me into a particular playstyle and in many cases harshly punished me if I attempted to deviate from it as I had been able to the entire campaign. It’s not that these missions aren’t still enjoyable or are particularly poorly designed, but they represent a step back to some of Splinter Cell’s most archaic design principles in a game that takes so many strides to finally distance itself from them. There are a few moments in the campaign when this happens as well,, but thankfully they are generally brief and at least contextually make sense.\n\nContext is more important this time around, as Blacklist continues Conviction’s trend of finally giving me a story that I could be bothered to follow. The plot is a fairly standard Clancy terror conspiracy with an outcome of World War 3 proportions, but it’s told in a way that removes the dry, technobabel of past narratives with one that’s far easier to follow and allows for substantially more characterization. Your team at 4th Echalon is comprised of characters with actual personality, with little exchanges you can take part in between missions adding to the subplot of the personal dynamics between such a small, tightly knit team. It has a lot of ground to make up still, but the fact that I wasn’t skipping cutscenes because I actually cared and was interested in what happened is a marked improvement and hopefully will continual to improve as the series goes on.\n\nThere are still a handful of stubborn rough edges clinging to Blacklist from Splinter Cell’s past, but the overwhelming improvements and intelligent design present kept them from ever being more than a minor nuisance. I’ve loved Splinter Cell since its exception, but this is the first time that I feel almost everything has come together as planned, with smarter level designs, an excellent sense of progression, and the allowance for so many different playstyles that could likely all make up their own games. It’s everything I’ve wanted the series to be and then some, and I'm almost giggy thinking about where it could go now it's gotten to this point.","December 12, 2014","true","22.6"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","3"

In fact, it's as best a start the studio could get, as this game is a shining example of supporting player choice, enabling player freedom, and making each level look and feel like a huge sandbox, from start to finish, where your actions may have consequences, but ultimately, YOU are the Splinter Cell, you take control and handle the mess you create.\n\nPossibly one of the most exciting multiplayer experiences to date, SvM makes a return in Blacklist, pitting spies against mercs in the most satisfying way since Chaos Theory made the mode popular. A series of different game modes, some even with non-asymetrical teams, makes for endlessly exciting and fun multiplayer match ups, where quick thinking and team work throughout each game will make each victory earned, and you'll just keep coming back for more!\n\nYes, this game isn't Chaos Theory in any respect, but in many ways, I see this as a technological reboot for the franchise, showing us as gamers what we can expect from the stealth genre, at least within the SC franchise, and giving us an opportunity to just ponder over how much the excellent gameplay can evolve even more, to top Blacklist's, and form possibly the best stealth experience ever found in gaming, but within the SC franchise in the future! :)\n\nSplinter Cell: Blacklist deserves a 9.2/10!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/235600/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","Splinter Cell Blacklist is the best Splinter Cell effort since Chaos Theory, and one of the best pure stealth games I've played in years.\n\nTraversal is a dream. Sam moves fluidly and intuitively. You feel like a cat prowling around these levels, stalking enemies, and darting quickly to and fro outside their paths of patrol. Sam Fisher's hand to hand takedowns are superbly satisfying, particularly the deadly variants with his karambit knife. The choreography there is spectacular, and unlike some stealth games such as Human Revolution, the takedowns never get old. The game is also designed in a way that rewards you for your playstyle, no matter how decide to play. Want to play ghostly, never touching enemies, and never leaving a trace? Me, too! You get a lot points for that, which you can use to unlock better gear and weapons. Want to take down every single enemy you come across, alternating between fighting, popping off a couple of shots, then throwing down a smoke grenade and disappearing into the shadows? They give you quite a few points for that, too. Want to just go balls out and play the game like you're John Rambo, throwing incendiary grenades and fire an unsilenced heavy gun? Totally viable way to play the game, and, yup: They give you a boatload of points for that, too. This game has succeeded in allowing the player to drift between full stealth and action shooting in a way that many stealth games have tried over the past couple of decades, but few have succeeded in doing. It does exceptionally well at allowing you to play the game the way you want, and seamlessly transitioning between different styles. I's an amazing accomplishment, and it's the biggest reason why this is such a good game.\n\nThe replayability I touched on is another asset of the game. Sam Fisher is so customizable that this game could also be described as having RPG features. You can customize all of his gear and weapons to help him better perform either at stealth or combat. You receive money for accomplishing things like takedowns or disappearing after alerting enemies, and then use the money to purchase pants, better goggles, better guns, and more. It does more to allow you to play the game the way you like, and that's something I can always get behind, especially from a company as typically reprehensible to consumers as Ubisoft generally is. It also creates a ton of replayability and does a lot to keep you coming around. Just look at my stats: I've put 60+ hours into this game and have replayed it several times. That's more than I've put into any Splinter Cell game since Chaos Theory.\n\nA big part of the success here is how bad ♥♥♥ you feel while playing the game. I mentioned how strong the hand-to-hand takedowns are, which is a big part of it. Another is the mark and execute feature that's been carried over from Conviction, which I absolutely adore. It functions in this game as an excellent "Oh, ♥♥♥♥" tool to use if you're about to be spotted by an enemy. Check out the surroundings, mark the enemies, and commence sneaking. Take a wrong turn and get spotted? Hit the button and Sam instantly takes out anybody within range that you've marked, bailing your dumb ♥♥♥ out and giving you another shot to keep sneaking. It's a great way to incorporate a kind of undo button into a genre as unforgiving as stealth. I'm not sure whether the developers purposely intended for the feature to be used in this fashion, but it works great, especially considering that you can now use mark and execute at extremely long range when equipped with sniper rifles, which is a neat feature.\n\nI've played several Ubisoft games the past few years, and none have run very well aside from the Far Cry series. This game, happily, runs like a dream. It looks great, too. Textures are excellent, and motion capture for the actors is terrific. I do think the game loses quite a bit without Michael Ironside, though, and I question why Ubi even deigned to put Sam Fisher in the game to begin with. The justification was that they needed a younger actor to do the motion capture, which is understandable. But Sam has to be in his late 50s by this point. Why not just reboot with another character altogether, and relegate Sam to the Lambert role of the older games? Ironside is an excellent voice actor, and the series is worse off without him.\n\nAnybody who has read my reviews in the past knows that I have a big problem with checkpointing in stealth games. There's nothing more frustrating than sneaking through nine tenths of an area, getting caught at the very end, and dying, only to be put right back where you started and having to follow everything you just accomplished again. It's unbelievably frustrating, and it has no place in modern video games that could easily provide a free save feature. If you don't like save scumming, then don't do it. I don't. But not having free saves is a terrible design choice and it harms people who play the game on the hardest difficulty, which I frequently choose when playing stealth games. This game, sadly, does feature checkpointing, which is one of my few complaints about the game. However, the checkpoints are frequently very manageable, which does some mitigating to the repetitiveness caused by their presence. They are still annoying, though, and I have no idea why game designers continue to use them.\n\nThe story is another weak point with this game. It's your typical Call of Duty-esque American military story, with the gruff hero saving the world from the sneering villain. I thought Conviction actually had a really great story, but unfortunately this game doesn't continue what they shot for with that one. Gone is pretty much all of the Tom Clancy flavor out of the series that was present in the first three games. This is all Hollywood action movie, which is disappointing, but doesn't matter much in the long run since the game plays so fantastically.\n\nI also found the music wanting. Chaos Theory had what I consider to be the best soundtrack in any video game, ever, and this game lacks Amon Tobin's stunningly beautiful score that that game featured. Tobin did such a great job with Conviction, despite having only two songs present in the game, that I would linger on that game's menu just to listen to the excellent menu track that he composed. The fabulous sound design in Conviction does not return, either, but it's manageable here. Seriously, Ubisoft, Amon Tobin is a god. Bring him back, please. We miss him.\n\nAnother complaint I've got are the stupid first person shooting segments of the game. I can see the value of using them to break up the pacing and add something different, but come on, people who buy Splinter Cell games buy them for stealth gameplay. If I wanted a shooter, I'd play Battlefield. I'd rather Splinter Cell sticks with its strengths.\n\nThe multiplayer and co-op features in this game are some of the strongest since Chaos Theory as well, and I'd be doing a disservice to the game if I didn't mention them. I don't play much competitively, but I had a blast with the co-operative segment of the game. I only wish it were a bit more meaty -- It's easy to blow through all of the co-operative levels in just a few hours.\n\nOverall, you could do way worse than Splinter Cell Blacklist. If you're looking for a pure stealth experience, this is your game. It looks great, it runs great, and it plays great. It's got great replayability. The minor nitpicks I have with it do nothing to really damage the experience. This is a great game, and it's a promising return to form for the Splinter Cell franchise. If you're a fan of the stealth genre, you'll adore it. If you're not, it's still worth playing, as it's a solid game even when played just as a third person shooter with some stealth features.","December 21, 2014","true","60.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

The game has a wide variety of techniques to use against enemies and upgrades.\n\nYou can even have scores depending on if you evaded all the enemies the entire mission or if you decide to go rambo or if you decide to go stealth knockouts all game.\n\nI recommend this game to those who love stealth games such as Hitman Absolution.

I plan on playing the previous games when I have time.\n\nThank you :)","January 3, 2014","true","20.6"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","4"

Albeit the initial doubts and suscpicion I harbored for the title, I purchased it shortly after release and was pleased to be welcomed with the same generally solid SC: Conviction framework, in addition to sporting missions and levels more akin to the well received SC: Chaos Theory, which focused more on conventional stealth and leaving enemies unharmed rather than hunting enemies from the shadows. Aside from one or two missions which are story oriented ( such as the introduction mission which can be skipped) the levels can be completed entirely on ones own terms. Due to the nature of Splinter cell being a stealth game, the favored approach of most players would be to kill as few enemies as possible without alerting others or raising suspicion from cameras, but akin to others in the series, Blacklist allows for no-kill completion by using the tazer and non lethal hand to hand combat, which offers a generally more intense challenge due to the range limitation and need of disposing unconcious enemies. In terms of story, the game does not offer anything particularly interesting which is slightly disappointing, but the game does feature some great locales and mission sandboxes, so that's a plus. All of the aforementioned details pretty much sum up the gameplay experience in my own words, although in terms of visual aesthetics; the game performs exceptionally well for a Ubisoft PC port, and the level design and texturing is quality work, even for being an Unreal engine game, it manages some remarkable ligh and shadow work in addition to convincing animations.\n\nUltimately, the game suceeds in most aspecrts regarding what formulates into a enjoyable and elaborate stealth game, although it stumbles in the story department, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a worthy entry to the series and a must have for those who were  slightly off-put by the fast paced nature of Conviction, as it approaches mission design with a more open, sandbox framework.","November 10, 2014","true","24.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

I bought a large set of UBI games over this recent (2015) summer sale (of which this was the most recent) and finally decided to return them all. Anything that was later than 2010 had issues configuring the controller or registering with UPlay.\n\nYou need to understand, when you buy an UBI game for the PC, you don't actually own it. You cannot, for example, install it on a PC and let your family use it. All UBI games are explicitly removed from being able to be shared with family members on other machines and dues to UPlay, EVEN ON THE SAME MACHINE if you have EITHER different Stream accounts OR different UPlay accounts (you cannot link 2 different UPlay accounts to the same Steam account).\n\nThe following is my last message to them on the ticket I openned:\n\n---------------------------------------\nDon't worry about this. I decided to return all of the UBI games I bought over the last few days.\n\nMost of the newer ones didn't work without a lot of reconfiguration and effort. And, UPlay is one of the worst apps/control moves I've ever seen in the industry and I refuse to give any more money to UBI. I will be buying ALL UBI games used, and for the console, to ensure UBI Soft realizes no direct monetary gain from my purchase.\n\nI truly hope you go out of business and the talented people there (the story writers and game developers, minus QA) find a home in a better company. After all, there's a pretty low bar.\n\nGood luck.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n","June 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","10"

The level design in the first place is what sells this game, it's not as good as the excellent "Chaos Theory" but is nevertheless outstanding, the missions are not one sigle big open map that you can explore and exploit as in ct, the missions in blacklists consists in segments, you have to go from point a to point b, then from b to c, and when you reach b you cannot go back to a, now this may sound bad but every single segment is so well designed that you will actually apreciate it, also it makes for a more cinematic experience, with its pros and cons.\nThe game rewards every type of gameplay, from action to total stealth but it always feels it encourages a more stealth killing way of playing that pure stealth.\nThe coop missions are also a great part of the game they have the same quality of the single player's.","September 13, 2015","true","23.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Then I got it....\n\nSplinter Cell Blacklist is an amazing game but i suffers from what many ubisoft pc ports have since time immemorial. I got the game at 1 in the morning and stayed up to play it for 6 hours after that on a school night. The single player was fun so was the coop but that is not why i bought the game. I bought it for the Multiplayer (Spies vs Merc). Now this is the holy grail for me but I realised the longer i played it the duller it became. Now i am a fan but I dont know how but they managed to mess it up not from a gameplay point of view but technical. I guarentee you play about 3 matches of this and if you dont live in the US or any country which heaps of people play the game you will scream at your monitor and curse because of hideous lag and  poor net code, overpowered weapons and the Merc Melee "Dun Dun Dunnnn"\n\nThe net code for starters is horrible. The game constantly kicks you in the ♥♥♥♥ as you are always being shot from behind cover, melee'd through walls and being shot at in unbelievable situations. Like for example you see a spy camping behind cover, you constantly aim at him and start walking towards him and he kills you without taking a scratch. Half time your the spy the same situation and when you try you get blown up in the face.\n\nNow the overpowered weapons, In this game you can tell if your versing n00bs or pros. Pros usually have ak-47s or some assault rifle, its a balanced gun and not too cheaty. And then there is shotguns, These things are way to op most of the time insta kills to enemy (or friendly) spies and you don't want to go near anyone carrying these things cause if they see you first you die there is no way you are getting them which is a bit ♥♥♥♥ because the only way spies can effectively kill mercs is with melee.\n\nFinally the Merc Melee "Dun Dun DUNNNNNN".This is probably the most unbalanced thing because most people(including my self) just rock up there in adrenaline suit and sprinter boots which automatically makes them fast at spies and almost win every melee encounter. Did the devs not see this in testing. If your stuck with a match full of pros and your a low level i am almost certain they will pull out their pistols and rush you trying to melee. And you know how i was mentioning lag before, one time i had so bad lag i managed to melee a merc as a spy and then after the animation had finished he had got back up then melee'd me then dropped over from bad luck(battelfield reference).\n\nAnyway i've done enough fanboy raging final thoughs the single player was fun but nothing to come back to the coop was alright but Ubi really let me down with this one and they didnt even bother to put ded servers or better stability. Ubi thinks all they have to do is change the controls around and give the game better graphics and put a PC sticker on it to make a good port. Well the game was a real let down and a bad pc port giving it 5/10\n\nThe end.","December 12, 2013","false","741.4"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","4"

It has a great story, good visuals, and realistic sound effects. There are tons of things to do in this game. There is a great campaign, a fun Spies Vs. Mercs mode, tons of challenging co op missions, and you can level up your plane and gear. The stealth mechanics are near flawless, the weapons/ gadgets are well thought out, the voice acting is pretty good, and the AI isn't super dumb like most stealth games. Splinter Cell Blacklist can be challenging at times, but it is very rewarding. I don’t have any major complaints about this game. I have a few small complaints though. One mission made you play the game as a clunky FPS with no stealth mechanics whatsoever. This bugged me a little, but it was just one mission. I think some of the character models are crappy and its difficult to play co op because most people are total idiots. With the few small flaws aside, Splinter Cell Blacklist is a remarkable game and a must have for fans of stealth games. I give SC Blacklist a 9.5/10.\n","February 2, 2014","true","38.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I really went in to this expecting it to be pretty good, but not  great, and it really surprised me. The story was well written and acted, and it was very engaging. The characters are well done, and overall it's all very top notch.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also great. Great level design and game design choices lend themselves to a variety of options and playstyles to suit how you want to play. Full stealth with no kills, full combat killing everyone, stealth combat, etc. The way the missions are set up allow for easy replaying to try and get better scores, all the 'collectables (dead drops, persons of interest, etc)', and try different play styles. Lots of gadgets means lots of different, fun ways to play through the levels. You can also unlock quite a few different weapons, suits, gadgets, etc.\n\nThe campaign and all of the side missions (apart from the coop-only missions) took me about 18 hours to beat. Good length. On top of that, all of the missions in the game can be replayed (as mentioned above), and everything except for the main story missions can be played coop.\n\nI haven't tried the Spies vs Mercs MP, but I've heard good things.\n\nThe DLC from the deluxe edition was seamlessly tied in to the main game, and I didn't even notice which missions were DLC and which were base game.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Conviction for what it was it but it wasn't really a Splinter Cell game.  The game really felt like you had to go out of your way to avoid killing anyone at all. Thankfully Blacklist is all about freedom of choice. Levels in this game are laboratories in which you can conduct all means and manners of special ops methods that you like. How you play the game is mostly entirely up to you. The only constraints the game forces on you during the experience are remaining undetected and non lethal. Often times both are independent of one another - you can still kill if you wish as long as you remain undetected. That said, Splinter Cell is best enjoyed as that game where you spend several minutes doing safe recon, scouting out an area with your gadgets, noting guard patrols patterns and sneaking past them untouched while throwing dogs off the trail. Do this on "perfectionist" mode difficulty and feel the adrenaline flow. Or not, the choice is yours. Either way, the adrenaline will probably still flow. The only negative is that the game has some ridiculous 'on rails' sequences where you control drones and the like. While they do provide a mix-up from the stealth pacing, they're just not that much fun. In fact, I have to say I found some of them to be rather boring. A shame really because the rest of the game is bucket loads of fun.\n\nWelcome back Sam Fisher!","September 17, 2015","true","34.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Another crappy Splinter Cell game like Conviction, as if we needed another one of the same tired, dead franchise that's not been good since Chaos Theory'' but after maybe 3 hours of playing and generally trying to enjoy the game, I'm genuinely happy with the game. I actually was enjoying myself. I didn't play the general ghost way like I do in most stealth games, I enjoyed my time and I played my own way and didn't care too much about being detected and going  FULL  ghost mode and refusing to kill/get caught. I just played by being a mass murdering ghost. The game doesn't punish you for playing your way unlike other Stealth Games where they give less XP/bonuses (Deus Ex HR gave you less XP for just going guns blazing, MGS4 gave you less Drebin Points if you got alerted or killed/ Dishonored gave you a worse ending if you killed a lot) and I enjoyed that a lot since murdering pixel-people didn't make me seem like a monster because ''TURRISM''.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe best way to describe this game in my opinion is to imagine if Splinter Cell got a true mechanical sequel with some mechanics like throwing bottles removed and better graphics. The movement in Splinter Cell Blacklist feels right in my opinion. The best way to describe detection is just Far Cry 3. It's literally just Far Cry 3's method of giving you a meter pointing towards the enemy that sees you.\nYou can easily use this moment to look and mark then execute with a special execution move that can take up to three people down with whichever weapon you have equipped instantly.\nUseful if stuck in a sticky mess but other than that, it's really gamebreaking and should be (in my opinion) used as a last resort.\nPersonally, the stealth works and that's what matters for a player who's gonna be playing stealth (either ghost or panther)\n\nThe gameplay can be devided into three methods of play:\nGhost:\n-Non-lethal, always hidden and relies on knockout tactics and gadgets like sleeping gas and tri-rotor.\nPanther:\n-Letal, always hidden, doesn't mind getting hands dirty, Gets caught at times and evades predator\nCombatant:\n-Lethal/Non-lethal, never hidden, gets caught often and doesn't care, eliminates all enemies\nPretty easy\n\nStory\nSomething about a list with CIA operatives, really didn't matter to me, I just wanted to play the game.\nThis seems unprofessional but if you want a good story, I can't honestly tell you if this one is good or not.\n\nVerdict\n\nThis is just Chaos Theory with different landscapes but a bit more linear and smaller than before, definitely a bunch of fun.\nDefinitely worth purchasing on sale, might be not-so-worth it at full price.\n\nTo the guy who keeps downvoting all my reviews, and I mean all of them, even old ones nobody noticed, I love you <3","July 30, 2014","true","36.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

QTE at their worst what a pathetic way to end a game.\n\nLittle unsure which way to rate this, but I do enjoy the game despite its flaws.\n\n+ RPG elements; You can customize your loadout to your playstyle. Nice mix of gadgets.\n+ Different playstyles; stealthy, aggressive or a mix. All are rewarding and helps with replayability.\n+ Assymetrical multiplayer; haven't played much but it is good fun and a nice change from other games.\n\n+/- Gameplay is good overall, but it can be a little clunky leading to some frustrating deaths especially early on.\n\n- Uplay *shudders* I could write an essay on this abomination. It now opens up an advertisement when you exit the game.... why ubisoft? why?\n- Too much focus on coop, even in singleplayer missions; closed off routes such as doors and high ledges.\n- Some annoying little quirks; acog sight aiming into your cover instead of over it. Weapon accuracy (especially over distance) is a little random. Object interaction aim can be dodgy too, looking at a light swich but jumping out the window 2m away is the highlighted action.","November 3, 2015","false","32.4"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","26","47","4","0"

And god, after the enormous changes the previous game (Splinter Cell: Conviction) made, I was hoping this sequel to come back in a slightly more classic way.\nAnd here it is! Blacklist is the perfect balance, in my opinion, between the Splinter Cell "older" gamers know (from the first to Double Agent) and the changes made in Conviction. The result: a stealth-action game with fluid gameplay, badass movements and giving you a certain degree of freedom in your approaches. You can sure as hell go all gun blazing, but this is not the recommended way to go: being sneaky is still the best approach.\n\nThe only (maybe) downside to this game? Well, I guess that is the main character, Sam Fisher, who looks like in his 30-40's, when he is supposed to be approx. 60 years old according to the story. I'm playing with french voices, so the change of voice actor does not affect me.\n\nI really hope to see a sequel to the series, or a prequel; but in the first case I think this would be better to make Sam Fisher a secondary character (example: he would be the new playable character's instructor).\n\nConclusion: Splinter Cell Blacklist is an amazing game, who made the good move to head back to its roots without doing a complete 180°. The only thing I'd like to see is some consistency in the universe, but that's about it.\n\n8.5/10 - Obligatory game.","February 4, 2015","true","11.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

As it stands the gameplay is great however, despite Merc vs Spies being fun there are noticeable development flaws ranging from the matchmaking system seemingly being made from a developer that bashes rocks together with his freetime, most of the playerbase play Blacklist mode which you won't be able to play until level five, so you will sit in matchmaking for 2+ hours trying to find a game.\n\nThey remove the ability to leave a game which causes people to idle or Alt Tab and manually close their game anyway. Merc vs Spies also lets you monitor who is alive on the other team, so if the Spies are wiped out the Mercs run to the Spy spawn and melee kill them the moment they appear causing two or more minutes of you and your team being spawn killed.\n\nHackers run rampant and will ruin a game easily, phasing through the floor and shooting up at you among other crazy things.\n\nTL:DR\n\nGameplay is good, Matchmaking is terrible, Multiplayer is great but poorly designed, Story is decent, Playerbase sucks.\n\n8/10; Recommended when on sale only...","December 24, 2013","false","28.9"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","2"

I only have a few issues with it.\n\nWhile it is far more reliable (crash speaking) than any other splinter cell game that I've played, I ran into some glaring balance issues while working my way through the campaign.  I realize that I'm not the sharpest gamer in the world, but the fact that completing Normal difficulty was neigh on impossible, with more "checkpoint" reloads than I care to admit to, I will likely not be making an effort to complete the game on any higher setting.\n\nOn the note of checkpoint reloads, have developers forgotten that we're on a PC platform, and have access to an exponentially higher capacity hard disk than exists on consoles?  Checkpoint saves are mind numbing, especially when the checkpoint is spaced so far behind where you are, and you've accomplished very difficult objectives and then you happen to run into a bad guy with heavy armor and a shotgun and when he finishes redecorating the room with your brain matter you have to work through laser traps, patrols, and god knows what else you may have already dealt with.\n\nThat brings me to another issue, goggles have always been a big part of the splinter cell game series.  The ability to see in the dark, see magnetic resonance, thermals, even footprint vision.  Cool stuff right?  This game introduces a foe called the "drone operator" which jams your goggles, somewhat arbitralially I might add.. as no other electronic gear you carry is affected by their presence.  They don't just do this after you've been detected mind you, but constantly.  And the drones they send after you, while easy to dispatch with a single shot from your pistol, if you do happen to be detected nothing is more annoying than some dog biting your arm forcing you through the "Mash the "E" key sequence" while drones roll up to you and explode over and over again.  Especially on the missions where you have to survive waves of enemies, horde style, necessitating yet more endless reloads in a vain effort to work through the missions.  On these horde missions, the drone operators were consistenly the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥ of all other enemy types, even the juggernaught types which I'm pretty sure are supposed to be the apex foes.  I'd rather deal with superman in body armor (the jugs) than deal with a single drone operator, largely because he could be ANYWHERE and regardless of his positioning will constantly send those irritating drones out whilst simultaneously rendering your goggles inert.\n\nThat rant down, I don't typically attack a game for being hard, but if it's supposed to be a stealth action game than why do I constantly feel like the game wants me to kill everyone?  There really isn't anyway to argue against that the easiest way to complete a given mission is to go heavy armor with your nastiest guns and shoot your way through.  Stealth is possible, but invariably ends up with you killing everyone anyway...  and the routes in various level which REQUIRE a co-op team mate?  I get it, we need to encouarge people to play these games, and fill out the various co-op campaigns, but the truth of the matter is that nobody is ever on for it.  Even the multiplayer games are an endless stream of watching people join "Oh this guy is only level 1, screw that!" and leaving the game lobby.  It's impossible to get it done unless you have some cadre of friends which love games that seem designed to give them a headache.\n\nAt any rate, I finished this game through on normal difficulty, despite the fact that very VERY few games make me actually rage while I play them.  This game did it.  I was going "Seriously?" to my computer, followed by "Is this for freaking real?"  And finally, "I'd rather go play... basically anything else."  I love splinter cell, the storyline has always been excellent, and I finished it to see how the story would play out. But again, I wouldn't try to push this on anyone after the headache that NORMAL difficulty provided.\n\nAs a complete footnote to everything else, replacing Michael Ironside with some twenty something kid to 'jazz up' the franchise probably had the exact opposite effect.  You lost your 30-40's cold war demographic, who could relate to the "old man" that was the gravely voiced, dry humored, Sam Fisher.

Bugged my friend to gift it to me, got it eventually and now am in love. Every single time i fly down 15-20 metres to bury a karambit in an enemies neck, it feels good (well that was sadistic). The singleplayer is immersive and free, allowing you to play 3 different ways: ghost is leaving enemies or non-lethally subduing them, panther is stealthy taking down and killing enemies, and assault is going in, getting noticed and then causing a whole load of clips to be emptied. Now the multi-player. The multi-player here is much different to anything else. Yes there is FPS shooting, but this is merc only. In the main mode, the spies (third person stealthy kinda guys) have to hack terminals and not get killed while inside the area, while mercs have to find the spies and kill them. Spies use shadows and cover to melee insta-kill the mercs, while the opposite side have the advantage of heavy firepower. So you might look at it and say the spies have advantage, but trust me, they do not. Being dropped from long range in 2 seconds is not an advantage.\nSo all together, I love this game, and I would recommend it to anyone else who likes stealthy third person games (can't even think of another one).

It combines the stealth moments of earlier games and the controls and action of Conviction. The gameplay is more stealth based and tactical than the previous games, but there are some moments that force more aggressive gameplay. The characters are uninteresting in this game, Sam and Briggs being the worse offenders, Cole not really developing as a character, Sadiq having a decent backstory but not doing anything at the end. The better character in the game is Kobin (from Conviction). He actually has some personality and can be funny at times. The story is entertaining but can overstay its welcome. Coop is in this game but it's just playing single player with a friend. This can help make the game easier but I would have preferred having original level design.

It was my second entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, the first one that I have ever beaten and I really enjoyed it. I played it on realistic and it was a great challenge where I have died many times, sometimes to many on the Iran level >,>\n\nWhat caught me off-guard was how good the story was. It was immersive, interesting and the characters were believable. They had emotions, moral and personality. Even your random crew members. Especially when Sam Fisher (main character) was talking to is daughter over the phone, he felt… human. Like a real person not just some other mass video game murderer like most games has.\n\nThe game has a diverse amount of environments and gameplay which kept me hooked for all 12 hours of it story. Its side missions were more plain and basic but the multiplayer, oh the multiplayer. I did not come in expecting this game even to have a competitive multiplayer but oh my, it was fun. It was different with the spies (3rd person shooter) vs mercs (1st person shooter) and the option to play as either in the team deathmatch that I really loved it.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game!

It combines the stealth moments of earlier games and the controls and action of Conviction. The gameplay is more stealth based and tactical than the previous games, but there are some moments that force more aggressive gameplay. The characters are uninteresting in this game, Sam and Briggs being the worse offenders, Cole not really developing as a character, Sadiq having a decent backstory but not doing anything at the end. The better character in the game is Kobin (from Conviction). He actually has some personality and can be funny at times. The story is entertaining but can overstay its welcome. Coop is in this game but it's just playing single player with a friend. This can help make the game easier but I would have preferred having original level design. Spys vs Mercs makes a return and it is better than ever. Full customization for each character and interesting abilities makes this a blast. There is classic SvM but the Blacklist version of the game is much better than the other mode.\n\nI didn't have much hope for this game since announcement, but it is incredibly good. It's one of the best in the series and should be recommended for Splinter Cell fans and others.","February 12, 2014","true","45.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I must have sunk a good 100 hours into it - not a ridiculous amount of time but enough to consider myself a big fan of it. Like Hitman: Absolution, it gets a lot of stick from longtime fans for not staying true to the original formula and, as a longtime fan of both myself, I was afraid I wasn't going to like them.\n\nThankfully (and surprisingly), I was mistaken in both instances. However, on further reflection, I began to think that perhaps change wasn't necessarily a bad thing in this case. It's not like the Splinter Cell formula was infallible after all - there were some definite issues present in the other games. It wasn't like Blacklist came along and tried to screw with perfection; it came along and tried to do things a little differently in a series that probably could have done with a little revitalisation anyway. To that end, I think it did a bang-up job of refreshing the series.\n\nThere are a lot of great features in this game. The fact that it rewards you for approaching each mission differently is a nice touch. For once, I didn't feel like a stealth game was guilt tripping me for going the "Screw stealth - let's go nuts" approach. Going in guns blazing is now a viable option  - even if it's not what Sam Fisher would conventionally do. Actually, plenty of the equipment on offer is directed at precisely the type of people who prefer that distinct lack of subtlety. The little mini-missions given out by your team members are also a good way of breaking up the main missions. They also help you to unlock better equipment for Sam to use in the main missions, so they're well worth doing.\n\nLong story short - it's not a conventional Splinter Cell game, but don't let that put you off. Convention is overrated anyway. There's plenty of things to like in Blacklist as long as you don't get hung up on how different it plays to previous games. Enjoy it for what it is and you'll walk away happy with your purchase.","February 7","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Detailed, in dpeth and much harder than previous titles. Blacklist picks up sometime after Conviction and has a great plot that, of course, is left open ended for the next title. The new voice of Sam Fisher was cast well and does the charecter justice, no complaints at all.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, there are several challenging side and co-op missions to be played that tie into the main plot, as well as a metagame. New gadgets and scoring make play enjoyable with the introduction of a scoring system designed to add to and challenge different styles of game play. Your efforts are rewarded with challenges and virtual dollars provided to upgrade and customize Sams weaponry, gadgets and gear.\n\nPersonally I love this franchise and hope Ubisoft can continue to deliver new titles in the future. However, even with the addition of side missions, and a solid plot, I felt the main campaign was still a few missions short. Also, more emphasis was put into the online multiplayer which still leaves a little to be desired.\n\nOverall a solid game and would highly suggest buying, even at full price if it cannot be had on sale.","December 23, 2013","true","73.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This means you don't get ghost "Points" for killing, only for Knocking Out the enemy targets, Panther points are for killing stealthy, and Assault is just for gunning down everyone who gets in the way on alert.\n\nUpgrade gear, and the plane: You can buy and upgrade Sam's gear as you go with money you get from missions, which was really cool that you could actually pick the gear you wanted, although most of the gear isn't very useful when it comes to stealth, you'll end up getting a few pieces of clothing for stealth and then you will pretty much have everything you need.  You can also upgrade the plane to give you more things in the field, like health, items show up on the map, etc.\n\nSeveral missions from old characters: With Sam, Grimmsdottr, and others, even that guy from Conviction that was supposed to kill Sam's daughter you end up capturing him and get missions from him, which is weird but honestly, that guy is pretty cool minus the fact he tried to kill my Daughter.  You get money from the missions they give, which means upgradeable stuff.\n\nBetter gear: You get some useful gear, like a crossbow that shoots knock out gas, very useful for Ghost style play I must say, I pretty much used this thing the entire game, I only used the guns for lights and that was it actually, I only killed if it was seriously necessary, and even then I tried to knock out a person.\n\nMore points for not killing: If you go through a area without killing/knocking out someone or a group of people you get more points for leaving them alive, which is nice for the ghost side because I honestly try to keep as many people alive as I can, it just seems better that way.\n\nCONS:\n\nStill acts like Conviction: Conviction was one of my most uninteresting games because it went from stealth to basically pure assault with stealth mixed in, and it kind of killed off the series for me, and they still implemented it in the game, why couldn't they have tried to be more like Chaos Theory or Double Agent, you know, when the stealth was actually stealthy.\n\nNo sound/Shadow Meter: This was a huge dissapointment to me, I heard they went back to stealth and I was like "Oh they are finally going back to their roots!" Then I played it and that went down the toilet, the only way to tell you are in the dark is the lights on your suit light up, that's it, I can't tell if i'm completely hidden regardless of how dark it is or if i'm just slightly hidden and still obvious, not to mention not having a sound meter f$%ks up most of the game, basically there isn't a way to walk slower or faster when crouched, you just walk and that's it, and you get noticed half the time because of that fact, you basically just have to mash the melee button when you are near a guy because he will end up turning around and seeing you.\n\nBrutes: F*%k these guys, if they notice you and turn to the side you can't knock them out cause you can only do it from behind or above, and when they are in the open you are basically going to have to get behind them or try to go around, but since you can't really tell how much sound you are making you are basically going to end up running past them or "Attempting" to knock them out, and the knock out gas doesn't work cause they have masks on, I ended up hating these guys the entire game.\n\nNo killing missions: I'm all for not killing enemies in missions, but that one Cuban camp was just rediculous, I was RIGHT near the end and there was a dog, I figured, I would just kill it cause I ran out of ammo for my crossbows Knock Out gas, I shot it, I lost, because it counted as a "Soldier" are the people at Ubisoft Imbred or something? Dogs are easier to replace than the actual soldiers are for gods sake.\n\nNot much interesting gear: You end up finding the few pieces of gear that do the best in a tactical way (Ghost, Panther, Assault.) and then never try anything else, that's it, you find the things that do well and the other stuff can go f$#k itself because you know that it won't do as well as the stuff you have already.\n\nNever used sticky cameras: I used to use these all the time in other games, I never touched them once, I think it's because once I got the upgraded goggles to see through walls everything involving a camera was useless to me, I never touched the cameras or anything else, which is kind of sad since I used them all the time in the other games.\n\nCharacters: Most of the characters I sadly didn't care about, I cared about a few like Briggs and Koban, but the rest I didn't realy care for.  Not even Grimm who's been in the game since the very beginning, that's kind of sad that I end up caring about the guy that tried to kill my daughter and my partner more than the person who's been in the game from the beginning.\n\nWHAT I THINK: After playing through the whole game I didn't think of it like a good stealth game, it was fun and had stealth in it, but I didn't like it as much as I had with the other games, before, probably because I was expecting them to go back to the way they had originally but I was kind of dissapointed with the fact they went with Conviction more. Then again this is Ubisoft we are talking about, they can't do much right honestly, did you SEE Watch_Dogs?  Score? Eh...i'm stuck between a 6-7/10 it was fun, but I didn't get as much feeling as I had with other games, it still acted like Convcition too much than it had with it's predecessors, I say get it on a sale.","June 18, 2014","true","22.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So i will start with just that.\n\nBlacklist gives a whole new aspect to the steath genre by incorparating many of the amazing things the previous games brought to the plate, for example: SC chaos theory's differant ways to complete missions, a free roam aspect but without as much hand holding as there was in Conviction. It still contains convictions assualt attitude but you can choose whether to be "Ghost"(Super stealthy, no killing) "Panther" (Still very stealthy, but with gunplay) and of course, "Assault" (All guns no stealth).\n\nYou earn more points in differant areas for the behaviors, but over all you earn more skill points for having a "ghost" style.\n\nA lot of people think Chaos theory was the pinnacle of the series, I agree, but with all the experience Ubisoft have gained over the years of making Splinter Cell, they have really changed my opinion on the "best game" of the series. This is a serious contender in my opinion.\n\n\nThe multiplayer.\n\nI never really got to play the multiplayer in the first games as by the time i had got round to playing them the multiplayer was abandoned.\n\nThis game heavily incorporates multiplayer. But its done well.\n\nAmazing Spies vs mercs, i just can't describe how it just works so well. The teams are nearly always balanced,\n(I was worried about this as many online games have this issue and also, Ghost recon phantoms, a F2P title is sliping into a game i don't like, with the unfair teams and lagswitching.) and the way the game is layed out it just plain works.\n\nThere is just one thing i am worried about, the fact that in a year from now the multiplayer will probably be deserted and the game will lose a huge chunk of it mechanics in the doing so.\n\nGreat for the steath fans, brutal takedowns and a true contender to the top spot of the series.\n\n9/10 Would Sam fisher again","February 10, 2015","true","35.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It did a great job of implementing all play styles (panther style for me), the maps were good in size and had multiple areas of attack, graphics (maxed settings) were great as was the sound. I was able to fully customize all controls the way I want without 3rd party software. No FOV slider but the default was just fine and I only had one crash. Total game time says 19 hours but I'm pretty sure I left Uplay running after I quit the game a few times and Steam still detects this as a "running game" so its probably more like 13-14 hours. Ending was crap though felt very rushed with nothing answered, bummer. Also not having Michael Ironside as the voice of Sam Fisher should be considered a felony punishable by slow death. The new voice was not too bad but it was NOT Sam Fisher, also why the ♥♥♥♥ did they change the way he looks? His face looks nothing like the old Sam, dumbass decision. It really feels like you are playing a totally different main character based in the same world, really sucks\n\nIf you are a fan of the Splinter Cell games this is a must play.

The game puts more of an emphasis on movie style action than on the stealth game on which it was based, and worse still is the fact that this game doesn't do it nearly as well as Conviction did.  Instead, this game is trying to a hybrid of earlier games with the cinematic style of conviction, and it fails to live up to either expectation.\n\nOther things that are bothersome include the voice acting (none of the original voice actors apparently returned for this entry) and the changing of characters.  Somehow, Sam Fischer is becoming younger all the time.  When I first started playing, I didn't even realize that we were playing as Sam and friends, until they beat you over the head with his name a few times.  Using a mouse and keyboard to play this feels like a no-no.  Blacklist was definitely created with consoles in mind, so you'd want to pick up a PC-controller in order to really play this.\n\nOverall, I'm unhappy with this game.  It's not unplayable, but it lives far from my expectations set by previous installments in the series.  I must even commend Double Agent for its ability to be a better game than this one, and it was previously the worst in the series.  This one has fitted its way into that lowest slot now, leaving me waxing nostalgic about the previous adventures of Stealthy Sam instead of this Keifer Sutherland in 24 wannabe.\n\nDo not recommend.","January 4, 2014","false","3.3"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","30","56","0","1"

As usual, the game place a huge emphasis on stealth. Fans of games such as Hitman: Absolution will find Blacklist similar in many ways. However, it has to be noted that since Splinter Cell isn't just about an assassination game, it's core gameplay lies in the use of the gadgets given, as you play as a covert op by the name of Sam Fisher. Although running and gunning may prove to be a success in some stages, most of the gameplay require careful use of the various techs given to the protaganist Sam Fisher. Along the way, players can also upgrade their utitlities and weapon array via the in game "SMI" (something like a customization and launching of mission menu)\n\nSince I have been a long standing fan of Ubisoft Games and Tom Clancy titles, I would like to point out that Blacklist is a game that should not be missed. As much as the emphasis and primary objective of the game is the utilization of stealth tactics and gadgets, enough freedom is actually given to do whatever you want to fit your style of play.\n\nIn conclusion, I would give the game itself a solid 9/10 (-1 just because if you are a perfectionist like me you would be spamming the restart button constantly after making a mistake, other than that, it is perfect). Get the game, strap yourselves in and prepare for a hell of a ride.","March 16, 2014","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game features an excellent story, great coop, and exciting multiplayer.  It even features a type of intelligence minigame that rewards you with score multiplayers in SP and MP.  There are tons of customization options for your gadgets and weapons.  You can: be a heavily armored door breacher that flashbangs then shotguns everything in sight,  be a ghost who uses stealth and gadgets to distract and complete the mission without ever being seen, be a sniper who lays proximity mines for would be flankers, also be an assault rifle weilding/grenade sniping nightmare.  The AI is one of the best out there (but still can be exploited) where the enemy that spots you will run to cover, summon reinforcements, and then they will either: surround you, stack up and rush you, or spread on a line and toss grenades at you.  Increasing the difficulty to perfectionalist will challenge.  The graphics are still great compared to current games.  The combat animations are superb, done with heavy emphasis in krav maga.  The single player dialogue amongst the characters make sense.  It's like jumping into a Clancy novel.  Multiplayer is smaller, sometimes only 2vs2, and you may have to wait a couple minutes for a fourth player to join in off hours (the game doesn't appeal to the COD crowd).  You play as either a stealthy spy, or an armored merc in an objective based game.  You don't get spawn killed in this game, don't have kill streak paladins raining death on you, there's no running around two minutes just to get killed by a guy camping out either.  The learning curve for the spy can be stiff until you understand the maps and how to misdirect and lead mercs into traps.","June 15, 2015","true","46.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abcstudios/recommended/235600/","abcstudios","ABC Studios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abcstudios/","422 products in account","One of the most fantastic games I have ever experienced in my life. The voice-acting is very well done. The story is very intriguing. I put over 24 hours in this game alone through the campaign and 4E side missions. (4E is what they call them). The game play is very fluid. Moving from cover to cover is very nice and well-thought-out. It took a moment to get used to, but once you do it is incredible.\n\nMost games these days put you through an 8-10 hour campaign and that's it. But this one is incredible. The side missions are very unique and complicated. The game is linear, but there is a ton of routes you can take throughout each stage. You can go through the whole game without kill a single person if wanted. You have the choice to knockout enemies or kill them.\n\nThe weapons are very well made. You also have a choice in loud-n-proud or stealth with weapons. Some weapons don't have silencers, some automatically have one built on. There is a TON of choices in weapons.\n\nI give this game a 9/10. Most people who are in-love with stuff go 10/10. But, I will probably never give a game a 10/10. There were no problems with it, big or small. The only hate I have is you use Steam to launch it, which launes uPlay, then you can play the game. Little annoying but it's no problem.\n\nI played this game through on the Steam Machine (I am a beta participant) and it ran like a hot-knife slicing through butter. I did not use or try the Steam controller on it. But this game was great.\n\nIf you enjoyed Deus Ex: Human Revolution, then you will without-a-doubt love this game. To me it was 10x's better than Deus Ex and I really enjoy Deus Ex. I picked this game up for $20, it's a game worth $50.\n\nThe multiplayer is pretty fun too, unless you get levelled with high level players. I haven't played a TON of multiplayer, but with what I have played it is fun. It's Spies vs Mercs. Pretty much a tank vs a ninja. Tanks have limited mobility and ninjas move in the shadows and kill. The gam mode I played had 3 stations. There is a large room the 2 spies need to be in. Once they are in the room it starts to be "hacked". You only need 1 spy in there, but there is you and another player. It's 2v2. The 2 tanks search and try to kill you and keep you out before each room reaches 100% hacked. Pretty fun game.\n\nWorth the money, give it a try and check it out!\n\n(Sorry for any misspelled words or type-o's, the Steam Client doesn't have a function to show you any words that are misspelled and what not)","February 6, 2014","true","42.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've just had a slew of problems with this game, mostly attributed to uPlay.  I really enjoyed playing the single player campaign; the UI looked good and the gameplay was solid.  It provided a decent challenge, and always gave incentives for doing it the hard way.\n\nNow, on to the problems I had:\nSince this was on Uplay and not steam, there were plenty of foreseeable errors, but when speaking exclusively about the game and the problems in game due to uplay, they made me want a refund.  First and foremost, at some point in time, my internet bugged out and after closing the game and relaunching it later, I couldn't get past the loading screen.  I disabled online syncing and went offline on Uplay, and the game ran fine.  I ended up beating the game in this fashion and when I re-enabled online mode for Uplay, it continued to lock up at the load screen.  After talking with Ubisoft support, if the online cloud data gets corrupted, they can't sync it with your offline data.  Furthermore, after telling me this problem was "resolved" I ended up having a clean wipe.  All my save data was gone.  I think the cloud data overwrites the offline data, so I lost all my hours of gameplay.  I talked to Ubisoft a bit more and they said I was just ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n\nGame was good, 8/10\nUplay and dealing with all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, 0/10","December 23, 2013","false","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As someone who enjoyed the improved tactical options and fluidity of movement in 'Conviction', I can say this takes that even further. Options to complete missions completely undetected, or by taking out enemies quick and quietly are a blast. I understand why the 'assault' option of guns blazing is there, but it's really not that much fun for me. It doesn't feel like how an operative like Sam Fisher is meant to operate. My biggest complaint is that while this is the best splinter cell gamer mechanically, and is plenty of fun, it doesn't feel much like a 'sam fisher splinter cell game'. The character is not there. It's not too shallow to say, but  a new actor created dissonace I could never fully ignore. A new character, under the tutelage of Sam Fisher would have been more interesting, and understandable, especially considering how much younger Eric Johnson--Sam's actor--is. Lastly, the dissonace is a matter of the game's general tone, as well.  You can be stealthy, but it's to a backdrop that's still  too actiony, too Jack Bauer, and too bright.","October 11, 2013","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I've not reached the best part yet. Beyond single player lies the underrated, Spies VS Mercs multiplayer segment which pits a team of spies, played in third person perspective, against heavily armored mercs, played in first person mode a la CoD. There are several modes in SvM to choose from, ranging from classic to my recommended and favorite Blacklist mode.\n\nThough my complaints in MP come from regular lag issues due to the obvious absence of dedicated servers and several glitches and buggy moments, if you look beyond these flaws, this is a seriously unique and very, very fun experience, especially when playing in the same party as your friends. If you get sick of SvM, there is an alternative co-op mode which allows you to take on 4E missions as well as the DLC missions which are also a great deal of fun.\n\nAll in all, i'd give Splinter Cell Blacklist a solid 9 out of 10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to action game junkies or even FPS fans for those who want a solid and rewarding multiplayer experience. To my fellow countrymen, Singaporeans, for once, dump DOTA 2 or LoL and at least give this game a try. Plus this game is always on freaking sale most of the time.

The main missions vary in length depending on if you go guns blazing or stealth and have a great amount of variety when it comes to environments. Missions generally involved getting from Point A to Point B and stealth boils down to hiding around corners/chest high walls, or finding a secret path that circumvents traditional paths.\n\nPlaying on Perfectionst (Highest difficulty) from the start proved to be just right when playing stealthly. Hostiles are very alert and can catch wind of you if you are in sight in about 1-2 seconds. Lower difficulties will allow you to see through walls, mark and execute (from Conviction) and re-supply at checkpoints.\n\nI can only comment on the Co-op portion of the multiplayer as I have yet to try Spies vs Mercs. The side missions allow for a Co-op partner to play alongside you and the experience is quite enjoyable. There are some gimmick co-op style moves that can be done but it is mainly only for progression. The most satisfying experiences are when both teammates sync up and perform take outs fluidly. The actual servers and latency are generally fine but I have had too many issues with the game soft crashing in long On-line sessions.\n\nI can recommend Splinter Cell: Blacklist at its current $30 price range for anyone who is a fan of previous Splinter Cells (Especially Conviction) or stealth games in general.","August 22, 2014","true","44.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/235600/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Renowned stealth spy Sam Fisher is back with a different voice. Gone is the brusque voice played by actor Michael Ironside, in is Eric Johnson. Sam’s voice is still credible and is now smoother than it used to be, but not as great as in previous Splinter Cell iterations.\n\nAs Sam Fisher, you still work for the 4th Echelon, but this time you receive missions from a plane based in Greenland called The Paladin. The Paladin is the command center where you meet up with Anna Grimsdottir and the plot plays much like a political thriller. The story focuses on a group of terrorists trying to kill a series of targets in the United States. There’s quite a bit of tension in the plot and some of it is between Sam and his colleagues. Charlie Cole is an expert hacker who can annoy other employees in The Paladin. The story isn’t so much about Sam, but it is more about information warfare. In this game information is power.\n\nThe screens in the command center are all digital; there are campaign missions as well as side missions. There are several new gadgets in this game that are very interesting and very useful for both the campaign and side missions. You get to choose your gadgets on The Paladin before you embark on any campaign or side mission. The availability of the gadgets gives you a chance to experiment with them against the various hostiles you will encounter in various countries of the world. One of the most interesting gadgets is the Tri-Rotor, a drone that you can use to scope out a building you are trying to infiltrate. The drone can give you a fairly good idea where the hostiles are located so that you can stealthily get inside a building without being spotted.\n\nOld Splinter Cell gameplay mechanics have returned such as the cover system. You can take cover behind a wall, barricade, or box. You can knock out hostiles by sneaking up behind them like in previous iterations of the Splinter Cell franchise. A new mechanic that is introduced to this game called mark and execute. It is an ability to mark nearby hostiles, then automatically killing them with headshots in slow motion at the press of a button. It feels like an action hero move.\n\nThe missions take place in a variety of countries such as Iran, Paraguay, Mexico, United Kingdom, Guantanamo Bay, and Philadelphia, USA. The best mission designs consist of ventilation shafts, rooftops, and cubicles of offices. The A.I. of the guards is for the most part very realistic and increase suspense as they get closer to your hiding location. They will react realistically when they see an unconscious or dead colleague. Seeing an unconscious or dead colleague forces them to change their patrol patterns. A guard also will wonder why a door is now open when it was previously closed. If Sam is spotted by a hostile(s) a shadow is left in the last location where he was spotted.\n\nThe side missions are fun, although they turn into trial and error missions. There are no save points, so you will have to go through the mission from start to finish without making critical mistakes. These missions are assigned by Sam’s colleagues such as Grimsdottir, Cole, or Briggs. They can be played in single player or co-op. The side missions are structured so that you would need a co-op player alongside you in order to climb high walls or fences. Many of these missions require stealth, so being spotted means the end of a mission. Side missions may require you to hack into phones, computers, and other devices so that the 4th Echelon can secretly acquire intel from the terrorists. There is enough drama and suspense to justify playing side missions.\n\nSplinter Cell: Blacklist is a gripping thriller of a game that reminds of a political movie thriller centered on spying. The campaign missions are suspenseful and the side missions add replayability to the game if you can get by the frustrations of trial and error. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in spying, stealth, and drama.","March 22, 2015","true","60.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(for archievement)\n\nI'm having a blast with it so far with my friend.\n\nI won't go into details, but more on the thought. Here's my opinion;\n\n::: Game-Related :::\nThe game itself is great, one of the best stealth action I played so far. It is a little more fast-paced compared to older games in the same series. Gameplay is fast, well, if you are going for Perfectionist. (the hardest difficulty)\n\nThe game brings back execute system (with some improvement), where you tag enemies, and down all of the tagged within your reach using one button. It can be a very deadly aresenal together with the Sonar Vision (x-ray). It is a bit overpowered, but still, it is nice addition to have. However, playing on Perfectionist disabled both Tagged-Execution, and Sonar. This is where the fun is!\n\nYou have several equipments your disposal, which affect your playstyle. How you play, is up to you, but in the end, it will put you into 3 groups, Ghost (non-lethal, stealth), Panther (lethal, stealth), and Assault (go all loud). I found that each style balanced quite well, so it depends on your preference.\n\nAI is nice, although it not that smart, but it is challenging enough to keep the game in its pace. You cannot sit in the shadow, looking into enemy's eye at almost arm-length. You can be spot if you cross its LOS.\n\nI haven't go deep into story (at all), but it seems okay, simple plot, but interesting. I am into CO-OP more, which is very good actually. The CO-OP content may seems small, but there is more than it seems, I am still playing it after 18hrs :D\n\nSpies Vs Mercs multiplayer looks interesting too, however, there is no anti-hack, and you will find hackers in public match, a lot. I tried it for likes 3-4 different matches. All of them have at least 1 obvious hacker, well, you know, speed hack, and wall-clipping hack, which is quite nasty. There are several other hacks available too (from what I found when reading around forums), likes wallhack, god mode, and etc.\n\nApart from the (great) game itself, there is a critical flaw, Uplay.\n\n::: Uplay :::\nI have to say that Uplay has improved a lot compared to the time of its introduction. It looks really nice, comparing Uplay to Steam. However, Steam is more stable imo. Uplay has improved, and became more stable to let you enjoy your game, still, it acts weird on me several times, likes cannot login, cannot find server, logged in, but appeared offline in-game and etc. It is not really bad, but it is more of the annoyance in its current stage.\n\nThough, I can say that it is good when it is working. I like its UI more than Steam's :D\n\n::: Overall :::\nVery good game, grab a friend, get deluxe editions (for completed DLC package). Although, you will need some motivation to fiddle with Uplay along the way. I recommended this game for co-op experience! It is worth my purchase.","April 5, 2015","true","18.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Waiting for your enemies to make a mistake and strike? Or do you like to run and gun? In Splinter Cell Blacklist you can do both or a way between it.\n\nI admit that i didn't expect much of the game as i bought it. Somehow i played every Splinter Cell game till now, but it never really got me hooked. I always liked the sneaking tho. The same happened to me with this game. But hold on. This doesn't mean the game is mediocre.\n\nThe story is decent enough. Easy to follow, but not really impacting.\n\nThe characters are good. Some known characters like Grimsdottir are  on board as well as new ones like the CIA Agent Briggs. The first time you see Briggs you know that he was mostly included to offer a partner for co-op gameplay, which is part of the game as well. Nonetheless i liked Briggs at the end. He showed a lot of character and the development of not only him, but all characters is very well done.\n\nThe mission design is the usual Splinter Cell formula. Hack computer system, defuse bombs, rescue hostages, kill HVT's. Nothing really new, but still enough to never get boring. Aside from the Single Player missions there are also 20 side missions. 5 for infiltrating and hacking, 5 for assassination, 5 co op exclusive missions and 5 last stand missions where you have to hold of against an ever increasing number of enemies. The side missions are good enough. Offer a bit of plot even if not that much.\n\nThe game has really good mechanics. The sneaking feels great. The "stay in the shadows to not be spotted" is great and is really accurate. The game calculates the chance to be spotted very precise or so it feels at least :) The climbing is abit limited because of the amount of spots you can climb but still enough to create a lot of opportunities to sneak by your enemies or or engage them from different angles. The cover system is solid. You can take cober at basically everything. With a press of a button you can switch covers or leap over em. Pretty solid work in that regard.\n\nThe AI is good. On higher difficulties they spot a bit too fast and easy, but it was never really unfair to me. Most enemies have their patrol route and like in every splinter cell game. you have to be silent and study their routes. Especially if yo uwant to be as sneaky as possible.\n\nThe animations look okay for the most part. Only the sprinting looks a bit weird. Sam looks like he ♥♥♥♥ his pants. Other than that the movement animations look good. The facial animations not so much. SAm and all the other characters look like they are not allowed to open their mouths when speaking. Also the faces look like out of stone.\n\nThe graphics are decent. Nothing really astonishing, but they are good to look at.\n\nThe amount of gadgets and weapons are massive. Each weapon customizable with a lot of different attachments. Gadgets are a lot too. For every situation there are gadgets that feel good to use. Being more sneaky or more action oriented? Doesn't matter. You have either sleeping grenades or frag grenades.\nEach item has to be bought from ingame cash you gather during missions. You can achieve extra cash by doing some hacking inside each mission or capturing high value targets.\n\nSo that should be it. I really liked the game. I have not really much to complain about. The game is good. Bought it on sale for 5 bucks and i have to say it was worth it. The game is entertaining.\n","April 11, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Interviews with the devs highlighted a game that they promised would go back to some of Splinter Cell's roots while still moving the franchise forward, which is fine by me.\n\nThe execution of the game however still lingers like acid reflux that no amount of tums can put down.\n\nThe uncomfortable:\n\nLong gone is Splinter Cell alumni Michael Ironside, the voice of Sam Fisher for the 6 other (I think 6) entries in the franchise.  This is such an immersion breaker for me, and I suspect anyone else like me, that is a long time fan of the series, but not the direction it took in Conviction.\n\nMichael Ironside IS SAM FISHER, the choice to either not hire him on purpose or for whatever reason is such an alienating mistake for long time fans of the franchise.  But here's the thing, Ubisoft does not care about the old fans of this series, they care about getting new fans and competing with call of duty.\n\nThe EXTREME:\n\nThe game gets in your face, granted in a bit more subtle way than Conviction did, but there's this intense Monday night drama!!!!!! feel to the game as you're introduced to your new base, your team, and your goal to protect the world from the most extreme bad guys ever by going to the limit!\n\nPromises broken:\n\nI was interested in the 'ghost / phantom / whatever' game play mode, one that emphasized a pure stealth approach to the game, because that's what the old Splinter Cells were about, because Sam wasn't equipped for extended combat.  So the idea appealed to me, as well as the insistence that there were multiple ways to clear an obstacle...\n\nWhich there are, to a degree.  Movement is still totally linear, it would be nice to have this game take some lessons from Assassin's creed and give you a bit more of an open world to use in your approach to a target.  I understand a narrative needs to have some degree of linearity to move a story to a point, but the "alternate paths" feels like:\n\n"You approach the bad guy, do you want to close one eye, both eyes, or have both open?!"\n\nEverything leads to one point, and if you are trying to play a zero kill playthrough there are moments where they do their hardest to make that improbable.  You have to exploit the AI to make it work.\n\nThe missed opportunity:\n\nI'm done with this franchise, I'm done as long as they are going to use Sam Fisher and Anna Grimmsdottir.\n\nThe new guy playing Sam is just plain terrible at voice acting and has no shred of the gravitas that Michael Ironside brought to the character.  And why is Grimm suddenly this extreme beeyotch of a boss?  She was never like that in the original run, she was an operational advisor for Sam.  I could see her succeeding Lambert, but not in this way.\n\nHonestly, if they ditched the old characters but still called it Splinter Cell, I'd have less of a problem with it.  Give me new characters in a Splinter Cell world you want to redefine, my brain won't reject it as much.\n\nBecause I grew up playing Splinter Cell, I knew Splinter Cell, and this game is not Splinter Cell.\n\nConviction was a terrible turning point, they invalidated amazing character choices from Double Agent.  Sam's daughter is killed in a random accident and Sam hits rock bottom, taking on an absolute zero success chance suicide mission to infiltrate the JBA.\n\nHey, guess what, his daughter is alive, because feels!  It was a setup so bad guy number 7 could get to him and enact Independece Day Initiative!\n\nSam is so deep undercover, the only man who knew he was is dead, Sam's on the run as a wanted terrorist, he may have to straddle the line just to survive and clear his name!\n\nNope, never mind, let's throw him in some cliche plot where the world is in danger and he must auto murder people and explode helicopters to do it.\n\nBlacklist is more of that, it's more from people that just don't get what Splinter Cell was.  Which is fine, if you didn't grow up with Splinter Cell, or better if you stop trying to hang on to the old guard.\n\n"Hey, drink this."\n\n"What is it?"\n\n"It's coke"\n\n"Um, okay, wow this is gross what is it?"\n\n"Just brown water I found and put in a coke can."\n\n"That's gross, wtf?"\n\n"Here, let's put some real coke in there, now drink it!"\n\n"But it's just dirty water with coke!"\n\n"RARRARARARRGGGHHHH!"\n\n"Dude, wth?"\n\n"PUSH Y BUTTON TO DRINK COKE AND WIN GAME!"","February 5, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

What is suppose to be the best part about Splinter Cell is the worst. This game feels more like an action movie than an actual tension filled stealth game. There's even obvious moments in the campaign where they are forcing the action onto you. You feel like a one man army with all your mines and grenades. And with all the enemies, tight spaces, and bad level design, it feels like the game wants you to go all out rambo. These are the problems that make the game a straight forward action shooter. That's the complete opposite of what Splinter Cell is suppose to be. Where's the REAL tension that the older Tom Clancy games provided?\n\nAnd the plot, oh god, It's terrible... Cliched, unoriginal and generic. "Oh my god! Terrorists are attacking USA, WE MUST STOP THEM!!!" Simple and stupid. The characters all feel dull and generic, even Sam Fisher himself. Also, where's the dark humor that the other Splinter Cell games had?\n\nCo-op - 6/10\nNow this would be a wonderful co-op if it weren't for the several bugs it has. It's still very fun. There is a decent variety of missions and all of them are exciting and fun to play with a friend. Unfortunately, everytime I play the co-op I encounter several bugs. I always encounter another new bug sooner or later. Other than the annoying bugs, the co-op is solid.\n\nMultiplayer - 7/10\nThe best part of the whole game. Spies vs. Mercs is extremely fun, unique and surprisingly deep. I love it. You play as either the spies who have to hack 3 locations or mercs who are heavy gunners that have to stop the spies from doing so. Both teams have different abilities and gadgets. Whenever a spy activates the hack, the match fills with tension. The spy that activated the hack has to hide from the mercs. If the spy dies, the hack turns off. It's awesome when you see a merc go right by you unaware where you are. As a merc, you have to find this spy before the hack reaches 100%. You also have to watch your back as a spy can sneak up behind you and kill you. There's also a good amount of strategy involved and it makes for a very fun competitive game.\n\nThere are only 5 gamemodes, but SvM Blacklist is really the best one. The others are okay, but nobody really plays them unfortunately. Sometimes, the game doesn't balance out the teams very well. I've experienced matches with high levels vs very low levels. The turning radius in this game is also pretty wide for some reason. Other than those problems, the multiplayer is great.","September 3, 2014","true","52.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

You can once again hide your victims (though it often seems unncessary as patrols are much shorter); but you can also make use of the execute feature from Conviction.  Loadouts are highly customizable (suits that emphasize armor vs. stealth, full-on assualt rifles vs. silenced weaponry, etc.), allowing the player to optimize their kit for their preferred playstyle.\n- Co-op is fairly extensive; if you prefer a slower, yet stealthy playstyle you might be able to get 20-30 hrs. from it.\n- In-game currency (used to buy gear and upgrades) is relatively easy to come by, so there isn't too much of a grind.\n\nCons:\n\n- Requires Uplay.\n- Blacklist doesn't feature a real menu from which you can select gamemodes, options, etc. from; instead, you find yourself in a spy operations plane of some sort with different "stations" corresponding to functions you would expect from a main menu.  This is probably meant to make things more immersive, but it's really just cumbersome.\n\nI would recommend picking Blaclist up if you're a fan of the franchise (or giving it a second chance if you were let down by Conviction), especially if you intend to play co-op.","June 26, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It offers great gameplay choices and sneaking is heavily rewarded. On top of that the multiplayer is also confidently crafted. The one thing lacking is the banal story with flat characterization that hinders Splinter Cell Blacklist from reaching any narrative high points. Even though it lacks the subdued intelligence of Chaos Theory, there's still some cracking good sneaking to be had. If you liked any of the previous splinter cells you will enjoy this game, the voice change takes some getting used to but its a splinter cell with the stealth element back!","January 31, 2014","true","61.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When Conviction came out I played it only to be blown away at how everything that was great about Chaos Theory had been thrown away. While Double Agent (game prior to Conviction) was much more streamlined, it still contained many things from Chaos Theory that made it work. Conviction was such a mess that I didn't even make it halfway through the game before I dropped it and went back to CT. I had very low expectations for Blacklist, but for once I was glad I was wrong.\n\nFirst off, lets make it clear that Blacklist is NOT Chaos Theory. If you wanted Chaos Theory then you should play Chaos Theory; nevertheless Blacklist brings a game that encourages a kind of stealth that suits the more fast moving hard hitting gameplay, tons of gadgets, and good old coop and spies vs merc modes. As a game I got 16 hours out of just the single-player content in BL.\n\nWhile things like the mark and execute system from Conviction return, it acts as more of an option than a must use tactic like it was in conviction. In addition to this, non-lethal options are much more common place and maps are open to more tactical options (though still nowhere near CT's giant interconnected maps, nevertheless its still a far cry from Convictions linear design).\n\nThere are alot of things I wish Blacklist did but in the end I found myself charmed (to say the least) by the game's competence in what it did do. As long as you acknowledge that BL will not be CT you'll have a great time and hope that the next game, Ubisoft will bring back the detailed light and sound meter, along with Michael Ironside as Sam's Voice Actor.\n\nThe new guy has Sam's charm and grit, but not the tone.","June 25, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can once again hide your victims (though it often seems unncessary as patrols are much shorter); but you can also make use of the execute feature from Conviction.  Loadouts are highly customizable (suits that emphasize armor vs. stealth, full-on assualt rifles vs. silenced weaponry, etc.), allowing the player to optimize their kit for their preferred playstyle.\n- Co-op is fairly extensive; if you prefer a slower, yet stealthy playstyle you might be able to get 20-30 hrs. from it.\n- In-game currency (used to buy gear and upgrades) is relatively easy to come by, so there isn't too much of a grind.\n\nCons:\n\n- Requires Uplay.\n- Blacklist doesn't feature a real menu from which you can select gamemodes, options, etc. from; instead, you find yourself in a spy operations plane of some sort with different "stations" corresponding to functions you would expect from a main menu.  This is probably meant to make things more immersive, but it's really just cumbersome.\n\nI would recommend picking Blaclist up if you're a fan of the franchise (or giving it a second chance if you were let down by Conviction), especially if you intend to play co-op.","June 26, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vilemoon/recommended/235600/","Vilemoon","Vilemoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vilemoon/","879 products in account","Well, there is alot I could say about this game. It was a great, action packed stealth action game, with an -alright- story, but the real fun comes from something they had discarded from the series titles that preceded Blacklist. Actually letting people choose how to get to the objective, and how they wanted to go through a level- leading to a great campaign mode that as I said, the story was meh, but it felt VERY fun to just drop in and play. However, this does have a drawback- later in the campaign, half the mission you switch to an FPS mode, stealth shooter hybrid... something that just felt wrong the entire time I was playing it. However, they did test the waters a bit with it, and for that they get points. They do lose those points instantly for MAKING AN FPS SECTION IN A ♥♥♥♥ING STEALTH GAME. ♥♥♥♥in' ell.\n\nOh, also, this game should be bought anyway for one reason- SPIES VS MERCS MAKES ITS RETURN! Back in Chaos Theory, the new game mode was added and loved by many fans, but taken out of later games in the series. It returns, and makes a huge splash in my mind as a must have multiplayer game, just for the strategy and action that needs to be taken in each fight and map. The Spies use intellect and cunning to get data and other objectives completed, using the shadows and a small list of gadgets to help them stop the other team- The mercs. Mercs use firepower and teamwork to get the best of those pesky spies, and defend the objectives set out before them.\n\nInside the campaign mode there is co-op selectable and solo missions. Solo missions are campaign only missions, while the co-op takes the form of the lowly side mission, which has the same amount of set up and planning that the campaign missions have, just with a feeling of less impact upon the world in the game, besides a bar that slowly fills up. Campaign missions give you tons of cash to upgrade and acquire much needed gadgets and weapons that will effect not only the firefights, but your complete strategy as well. Money can also be used to buy upgrades to the "Paladin", your base of operations that takes the shape of a giant plane, fitted with the best technology the goverment can give.\n\nTo wrap it all up, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a great new addition to the series that needed a breath of new life, and with the integrated campaign mode that carries over into all other modes, along with Spies vs Mercs and lots of options for side missions to Co-op or handle alone. I can honestly give this game a very good recommendation with its content for solo play- and lots of stuff to do with other people. If you are thinking of picking this game up for full price- be wary. Some may not see this as a good 60$ game- the price tag it has without discount. Even though the game is great, I recommend waiting for at least a 50% off or so before nabbing this bad boy.","December 6, 2013","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the story suffers from an intensity and heavy-handedness I usually reserve for prime-time network dramas that insist on name-dropping enough stoic techno-jargon as if it was going out of style, to lend them credibility, this does not detract at all from the gameplay experience. A well-implemented cover system that neither overwhelms nor overpowers the player combined with PC-optimized elements combine to give a true sandbox feel when it comes to questioning how to approach a situation. A game that values highly 'out-of-the-box' style thinking is perhaps one of the best presentations of stealth gameplay I've seen. Though the game rewards true stealthlike gameplay, the game does allow a more stereotypical shooter-esque style of 'run'n'gun' which critics might point out is advised against by the game which awards less points for such play style. Given that the core of the game is as a CIA Operative and the fundamental element is stealth, I can forgive this and note that the system does encourage new approaches to situations. All in all a phenomenal title that made me go back and look at other entries in the Splinter Cell franchise.","December 11, 2013","true","128.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much of those gameplay features from the former make their way back into the newest installment of the Splinter Cell franchise.  While it doesn't make sense that Sam Fisher looks and acts like he's in his thirties (when he's actually in his sixties), along with the fact that Michael Ironside doesn't voice the gaming icon this time, the new Fisher makes espionage look bad ♥♥♥.\n\nNot only is there a campaign to weed through, but endless waves of a terrorist hunt type game-mode that is addictively fun.  Equally as entertaining are the stealth missions that must be accomplished without letting the enemy know that you are there.  Perhaps the most solid experience of this game comes from the multiplayer.  Chaos Theory's legendary Spies vs. Mercs does a comeback in this game.  Offering the ability to be a spy or a mercenary, you are free to choose your play style.  Want to go full-on Rambo on some stealthy saboteurs?  Be a mercenary!  You are equipped with the ultimate firepower and protection.  Feel like sinking a karambit into those lethargic brutes?  Take on the role as a spy!  Sneak your way across the map using the latest stealth technology to dispatch your enemies.\n\nThis offers a fresh take on competitive multiplayer and will leave you playing for hours on end.  Upgrade your gadgets and character as you rank up to take on the more veteran players.  This upgrading model is also present in the single-player side of the game... allowing you to become a more powerful Sam Fisher.  Something else worth mentioning... there is a cooperative portion of the game that I haven't yet tried.  It plays through some of the same levels as the single-player missions, only you can do it with a friend.  That's cool!\n\nThe game has plenty of features to keep you occupied for a good while.  I give this game a 9/10... it loses a point for getting rid of Michael Ironside, and making Sam so young to the point that he can scale cliffsides without difficulty.\n\nBesides that, you wouldn't be disappointed if you bought this game.","December 29, 2013","true","95.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Never play this series before and I have to say that it's a solid, well-made, overly American, and poor-plotted stealth game.\n\nTerrorist strike US soil (?) on Guantanamo. The Engineer declared that if the country doesn't pull back her troop from foriegn soil - They will strike again in a form of "Blacklist" - American consumption, etc, etc. Sam fisher and his team were called into action and formed the Fourth Echelon to stop the Engineer before the next strike. The plot isn't really well made. Major plot isn't that interesting since all you are going to do is gathering intel on the Engineer and prevent their next strike. Mix it with a bit of personal touch between Sam and his daughter and light comedy here and there. It's just clear that the plot wasn't developer's main interest. It's just overtly American patriotism.\n\nBlacklist allows player to play like a trigger-happy soldier (assault), silent killer (panther), or unseen shadow (ghost). I have been playing ghost on realistic for the entire game and I happily reported that stealth section is very well made. Most of the time the game encourage you to explore the map for additional route to avoid guards and other obstacles. Shadow and line of sight are bread and butter of this game but you can be detected if you're not careful or the guard got suspicious and start looking for you.\n\nOne of the major headache is door. Door in Blacklist has lots three functions - open/bash/peek under. Problem is open and peek use the same button and depend on position of your screen to determine which one will be performed. Also, heavy reliance on "A" for everything can be a bit too much. A situation like a door next to a ceiling pipe will trigger three action based on your position - jump to the pipe and hide, open the door, and peek under it. It requires a lot of practice and lots of reload to make sure you're doing the right thing.\n\nUpgrade can be purchased on the Paladin in form of weapons and various outfit that increase statistics like stealth, armor, weapon handling. In a way, the game progression system ties to your performane on previous missions since the more stealthy you are, more money you earn. The Paladin itself is like Normandy SR-2 form Mass Effect 2. You can purchase upgrade for it and expand the capability of the plane - better radar on your HUD, more weapons for sell, faster restoration if you got injured. If it has romance option between Sam and Brigg, it would be awesome! (That was a joke.)\n\nI have to say that the game deserve 7.5/10. I'm not impressed with the plot but the rest of the game is good.","December 15, 2013","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I was disappointed by Conviction and its amount of forced action, I was pleasantly surprised with Blacklist, it kind of felt like I was playing Chaos Theory again. I fancy games with upgrade systems and well shoot this game has one, weapons, weapon upgrades, fancy different colored lights, cool suits. You can play the game any way you want, run in and blast people, stealthily kill people, or even just completely avoid everyone maybe knocking some guys out on the way. Theres quite a few missions you can play cooperatively with a friend or so, as well as there being the reintroduction of the SvM game mode, where Spies have to hack terminals while Mercenaries have to take them out and defend them. Of course its not as glorious as Chaos Theory's was but this game has its own cool things about it. I still prefer the maps and the progression through said maps in Chaos Theory, where as each terminal would unlock the next area and the Spy team would win by hacking all of the terminals. The campaign in this game is actually fun to play through and very interesting, though I do miss Michael Ironside voicing Sam Fisher.

Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the new voice performers but I did miss Michael Ironside (Fisher) and  Claudia Besso (Grimsdottir). While the new game is the latest in Sam Fisher's adventures, the new voices, latest additions to the game and the smallest of references to the previous games do give Blacklist a sort of reboot feeling.

Actually, you don't need to know lots of information about this "stealth"- action game, just remember the main "D" words - DOGGIES, DRONES, DEATH and DUMB soldiers with shields.

If its on a sale, there is even more of a reason to buy it. Best stealth game atm in my opinion and it's just 30 (or less) Euros anyways.\n\nTL;DR: Excellent stealth game, more human-like enemies than 99.99% of the other games out there (sometimes a bit blind), three classes which you do not have to specialize in if you do not want to + you can play them all in one mission, you do not select a "class", but rather get rewarded with points for what type of kills and actions executed, you do not get screwed over by going Assault (loud) as the enemies are balanced for both loud and stealth, this goes the other way around as well, stealth is just as good as assault and if you get forced to go loud, you can still just sneak away and start doing ghost/predator stuff.\nRatings:\nVoice acting and character models: 9/10\nGraphics and Environment (if you are really into this, the game has an excellent shadow system and almost every light is breakable): 10/10\nEnemies: 10/10\nCO-OP: 9/10 (we should have gotten more of these...)\nMultiplayer: 8/10\nWeapon and customization: 10/10\n----------------------------\nGame = 10/10\n\n\nThis game is without doubt one of the most awesome stealth games you can get at the moment. It seems like no one designs good stealth games anymore, but Blacklist has definitly got it. As pleny of people have mentioned it has three possible playstyles, but it is NECESSARY to mention that you can mix them as well. You do not choose a class and roll with it but you can rather level them all in one mission. You get points based on what you do and the most dominant playstyle will be shown for the mission. There is also a little bonus ("gold medal") if you manage to stick mostly or completely to one playstyle. Your equipment contains a tooltip of what the creators recommend them to be used for (for example smoke is tagged as Ghost, Flashbangs are tagged as Panther and Grenades as Assault), still, you can use flashbangs while going ghost. Anyways, the game has:\n\n- Ghost, where you do stealth the old fashioned way. Do not get spotted and do not kill. YOU CAN STILL USE NON_LETHAL! Meaning you do not have to dodge every enemy if you so feel like it.\n\n- Panther, where you do stealth and you kill at the same time. You kill everyone, but also remember to hide both yourself and dead enemies in the shadows. You enjoy the use of guns and stealth at the same time. As long as you are not detected you will get panther points when using lethal takedowns. (this is the playstyle i enjoy the most, but ghost is also really fun for me).\n\n-Assault, for those who just like to go rambo on everything that moves. You basicly just stock up on grenades, explosive equipment and shotguns/assault rifles with attachments like sights, extended mags, modified barrels to increase damage and so on.\n\nI myself recommend to play every style to see which one suits yourself best.\n\nEnemies in this game are balanced and the only unit i find a little ridicilous is a guy that sends out RC-cars. When several of them come onto the map and there are fifty RC-cars that try to blow you up, it feels a little tiring (good thing they can't climb walls like you can!) If i recall correctly you will only meet many of these RC-guys on the Special missions (optional CO-OP missions) anyways, making them ok to deal with.  I would like to add that these are not the typical enemies of games today, as they are a bit smarter. They will try to flank you if you stay in one spot. This also goes for stealth, since if they see you while you move from one spot to another (if you give them enough time to spot you), they will come look for you and search the surrounding area. Also they are not enemies who can radio contact their friends just by looking at you, so if you get spottet you still have some time to react before they call up reinforcements/warn their buddies.\n\nAs for the game in general it handles all the classes perfectly. If you love to go assault, it will not screw you over by making it insanely hard. This also goes the other way around. If they "force" you to go loud/assault on a mission, you can still just escape and run behind enemy lines, while using the shadows.\n\nI love it and as others mention, uplay messes up your playtime with some games, and i do have over 100 hours in the game.\n\nIf its on a sale, there is even more of a reason to buy it. Best stealth game atm in my opinion and it's just 30 Euros anyways.\n","June 26, 2014","true","39.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your cash and upgrades are both tied into the singleplayer campaign and cooperative missions, so all cash and upgrades will be carried over to either.\n\nThere are plenty of coop missions to play with friends or strangers, and many ways to complete them (replayability).\n\nYou will be rewarded in three different categories depending on the way you play: Ghost (remaining undetected and only knocking enemies out), Panther (remaining undetected but killing enemies), and Assault (as you can probably guess, going guns blazing), it doesn't matter what you do, you're doing it right.\n\nThe multiplayer Spies Vs. Mercs is a whole other game in itself, can be played casually or competetively with ranking, and upgrading similar to SP and coop missions.\n\nThe objective for the Spies is to hack three terminals in the map, and the Mercs job is to put a stop to it.\n\nThe Spies play in third person perspective, they are nimble, able to scale walls and enter vents, have a selection of vision modes, and have a deadly melee attack (can also use guns but at short range).\n\nThe Mercs play in first person perspective, they are bulking, only able to vault obstacles, a selection of vision modes based on sound/sudden movement/electricity use, can use assault rifles and shotguns etc at long range (also have a deadly melee attack but can take a while to get used to).\n\nThe multiplayer is 2 aside, or 4 aside depending on the game mode. The servers aren't as popular as you'd hope but finding a match is not difficult at all.\n\nPeople have had issues with uPlay but try not to let that name put you off, I've personally not had any trouble with it myself (not trying to rub it in to the people that have).\n\nIf I recall correctly the game can be played with a controller, but I honestly don't see why you would want to as the game feels great to play with kb/m.\n\nPaying full price for this game, I'd say don't.\n\nPaying 50-75% off?

I'm a big fan of the Splinter Cell franchise so I'm a little biased. I really love how the game lets your choose the path you want to take. Go ghost and be undetected without disturbing enemies, silent and deadly or just all out run and gun. I like the variety. Game has plenty of content. Had almost 10 hours of gameplay before even starting the second mission. Plenty of side missions that help build up skill and money. However, the game has a fatal flaw. I'm no tech expert by any means so I'm not sure exactly how it happens but the game will delete your progress. That's right, it will randomly and without warning delete your hours of work. This is a known issue and has been happening since the games release in August of 2013 and I just bought this game a week or two ago so obviously Ubisoft has no interest in fixing the problem since its been over 6 months since the games release. There are work arounds but I can't get them to work for me. Truely depressing since it is a really great game. If your tech savy buy the game if you like the Splinter Cell franchise.

The PC port is stunningly good.\n\nFor the game itself, I would honestly say, it is VERY solid. It might not be old school Splinter Cell, but it does a way better job than Conviction ever did. The game plays well and the story is, to my surprise, actually pretty good.\n\nThe major downside to the game, in my opinion, is that it is very easy. Even on the highest difficulty. The game isn't very lenghty either.\n\nThe game also has a set pf coopertive missions, but don't expect them to be Chaos Theory good. They're fun at best.\n\nThe versus mode however, makes a glorious return. Spies VS Mercs plays out really well. But there is a downside. The multiplayer is peer to peer, wich means if the host lags, you lag. The other downside to the versus mode is that as mercenary you play in first person. Now this in itself isn't a negative thing, but the FOV is very narrow and can't be adjusted.\n\nThis said, the versus made is really fun.\n\nI'd say, purchase this game if you're a splinter cell fan or a general fan of stealth games. If this is not the case, you might still want to give it a try when it goes on sale.","June 24, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't a huge fan of conviction but blacklist in a way revives the beautiful stealth action Splinter Cell was known for. If that's not your thing, you'll probably enjoy slitting every throat you come across. The close quarters attacks are some of the best I've seen in any game, definitely the most predatorial and awesome (I say that having played Assassin's Creed.) Multiplayers isn't bad either, it brings back Chaos Theory style, nimble spies vs well armed mercs. Pretty well rounded as well. All in all a good title, certainly shouldn't pass it up if you're a fan of Uncle Sam.","February 7, 2014","true","689.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't a huge fan of conviction but blacklist in a way revives the beautiful stealth action Splinter Cell was known for. If that's not your thing, you'll probably enjoy slitting every throat you come across. The close quarters attacks are some of the best I've seen in any game, definitely the most predatorial and awesome (I say that having played Assassin's Creed.) Multiplayers isn't bad either, it brings back Chaos Theory style, nimble spies vs well armed mercs. Pretty well rounded as well. All in all a good title, certainly shouldn't pass it up if you're a fan of Uncle Sam.","February 7, 2014","true","689.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Below are the true reviews!\n\nPro:\n1. Good graphics\n2. The weapons, armor upgrades etc are something to look forward to and interesting.\n3. Gameplay so far (30 mins) are good!\n\nCon:\n1. Can only play for 23 mins before the game crashes. Game will crash precisely on 23 mins for me. Searched the forum, some will crashed at 25 mins, some 50 mins. But the timing is precise, only different timing for different users. And no, my PC spec is way higher to support this game.\n2. User cannot save the game manually, all depends on auto-save. Meaning if you get caught in a stealth mission, most of the time you need to go ALL the way back to the front and re-play everything again! And since there's no manual saves, I need to complete every mission within 23 mins (before it crashes), if not, I'll have to re-play the mission from the beginning.\n3. Cannot go online. Meaning cannot redeem those ULC that I've paid.\n4. Since cannot go online, meaning cannot join multiplayer game.\n\nStill waiting for Ubisoft to fix my problem. Until they're fixed, especially for crashes, I'll not recommend this game for everyone.\n\nUpdate on 10 March 2014:\nThe only fix for the above mentioned problem is to reformat the HDD, and re-install a clean windows. Everything works fine after that.\n\nNow onto the real gameplay, co-op mission is definitely fun. And I'm actually enjoy myself. Kudos for a good game from Ubisoft. Only drawback is.. well.. re-install windows is kinda tedious just to play the game don't you think?","February 23, 2014","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You also have the ability to just go balls to the wall guns blazing, but that's not very satisfying nor very challenging.\n\nYou get a meaty arsenal of weapons and gadgets, for whatever play style you should choose to adapt, you can mix and match as you see fit.\n\nThe campaign was pretty decent, it won't win any Oscars or anything, but i felt it was very focused and to the point. The antagonist is very menacing and the voice actor gives a really good performance. Which brings me to Sam Fisher, who is no longer voiced by Mr. Ironside, but as much as that pains me, his replacement is doing a very good job. One you get over the hump of Sam having a different voice, you start to tune it out.\n\nCo-Op missions are a bit harder than the ones found in the single player campaign, well at least if you do them solo, which i found to be the most fun, I really enjoyed that challenge.\n\nWorst part about the game is sometimes the controls are a bit too sticky in the places where you don't want them to be, and way too loose when you don't want them to be.\n\nOh and also why Ubisoft has made a game in 2013 with Unreal Engine 2.5 i will never know, the game looks dated, even with DX11 features and max settings cranked up. Still, it does the job and it doesn't ruin anything. But it would have been nice for it to look like a 2013 game.\n\nAny way if you enjoyed any of the other games, you should give it a go. And even if you havent played the others, you can still pick this up and dive right in. It doesn't really require you to have played the others.","September 10, 2013","true","39.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I was impressed with this game, most of the time you'll have games where you have the choice to go stealth or go crazy; But rarely are both options actually rewarded equally. Stealth usually tends to be the more benificial one, but not here. Blacklist is designed to reward three diffferent playstyles, assualt, stealth and assassin\n\nEach playstyle actually has their own point system and side missions that focus on each skill. It is an extremely well rounded game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nSo many cool gadgets, gadgets that can actually be gamechanging in ways that are not toi overpowering. Scout out an area with a drone, use a sticky camera to monitor an area or distract gaurds as you sneak past, its just so well designed and fun.

Below are the true reviews!\n\nPro:\n1. Good graphics\n2. The weapons, armor upgrades etc are something to look forward to and interesting.\n3. Gameplay so far (30 mins) are good!\n\nCon:\n1. Can only play for 23 mins before the game crashes. Game will crash precisely on 23 mins for me. Searched the forum, some will crashed at 25 mins, some 50 mins. But the timing is precise, only different timing for different users. And no, my PC spec is way higher to support this game.\n2. User cannot save the game manually, all depends on auto-save. Meaning if you get caught in a stealth mission, most of the time you need to go ALL the way back to the front and re-play everything again! And since there's no manual saves, I need to complete every mission within 23 mins (before it crashes), if not, I'll have to re-play the mission from the beginning.\n3. Cannot go online. Meaning cannot redeem those ULC that I've paid.\n4. Since cannot go online, meaning cannot join multiplayer game.\n\nStill waiting for Ubisoft to fix my problem. Until they're fixed, especially for crashes, I'll not recommend this game for everyone.\n\nUpdate on 10 March 2014:\nThe only fix for the above mentioned problem is to reformat the HDD, and re-install a clean windows. Everything works fine after that.\n\nNow onto the real gameplay, co-op mission is definitely fun. And I'm actually enjoy myself. Kudos for a good game from Ubisoft. Only drawback is.. well.. re-install windows is kinda tedious just to play the game don't you think?","February 23, 2014","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it's much closer to the series' roots than Conviction ever was. Darkness is back (shooting out lights protects your stealth), you have the capability to finish most missions without ever firing a shot (or even engaging anyone besides mission targets), and the weapons 4th Echelon gives you are all suppressed. You CAN pick up unsuppressed weapons, but if you want to preserve the true SC experience, don't do it!\n\nThere are linear sequences that feel way too much like Assassin's Creed, and the FPS sequences where you play as Briggs are definitely the low point. Difficulty is on the easy side (too much like AC again), with "death from above" kills and 100% predictable AI (they always spawn in the same spots).\n\nI did like the "Mass Effect" style inter-mission parts where you roam the plane, chat with your team, and upgrade your gear.\n\nCo-op missions (most of which can be played solo, but you can't access certain routes that way) are like Modern Warfare's coop or Halo's spartan assault, except with stealth and alarms. They are pretty fun and lack none of the lame parts seen in the solo campaign.\n\nOverall, I recommend picking this game up on sale. The E3 video previews made this look like a lame action game, but you're given the option (and encouraged to) play super stealthily. Can't say I wouldn't prefer a more Chaos Theory kind of game though!","February 1, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Regardless, when played "correctly" Blacklist is an excellent addition to the Splinter Cell franchise.\n\nThe multiplayer is rather enjoyable when you find a game without a speed hacking aimbot using troll.

I used tools such as sleeping gas and drones to knock out and shock my enemies, respectively. The campaign - unlike other games which claim to allow you to "play it your way" - truly gives challenges depending on what you want to do.\n\nSure, you could choose to do this unbelievably heavy non-stealth build where you shoot any guard who comes remotely close to you in the map, but on the missions where you're not allowed to kill guards you're going to have to adapt accordingly. You could choose to be a pacifist like me, but on the missions where the guards know exactly where you are, you're going to regret not having spent some points to have decent armour instead of your sticky shocker.\n\nThe game offers much more replayability compared to it's predacessor Splinter Cell Conviction, which took a stance of "here's a room of bad guys, kill them". You will constantly reflect on what you did right on the missions, and what you could improve.\n\nThe campaign is a decent length, and the co-op missions (though are attempted to be tacked with the campaign) do a pretty poor job of enphasizing co-op. Because most of them are able to be played solo anyway, most of the time playing with my friend I felt like I was dividing and conquering, instead of working as a team. Normally teammates only meant someone who would divert all fire and kill half the enemies while I was hiding on a roof with my sticky shocker picking one or two off.\n\nAll in all, the game itself is a pretty decent entry in the series, and the different ways to be able to play certainly help with the age-old problem of RPGs like this, being that they get boring due to repetition.\n\nMy rating: 9/10","July 29, 2015","true","88.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At least this one gives you the option of stealth.  Well for the most part.  Brigg's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sections where they literally turn the game into a first person shooter is just horrible but thats like 2 parts and its really easy to get through them.  This for the most part makes a good comprimise.  Stealth is still a very viable option in the majority of missions.  In fact its very fun trying to get ghost rating on most missions.  Going action isn't such a bad thing either.  Different game mods offer a lot of variety.  Pure stealth missions that can be played alone or coop.  Previously mentioned kill every enemy in an area where stealth is encouraged similar to the one I talked about in Conviction, small maps with waves of enemies to kill are actually really fun to.  There's a whole side story thats all coop missions and I love them.\n\nThis is the game that got me into the multiplayer too!  The spies vs mercs gamemode is awesome!  Trying to be stealthy against other players is a true challenge.  I just wish playing as mercs wasn't a first person shooter but I guess gotta give the spies some advantage.  Top it all off with a story that doesn't feel like a stupid excuse to kill people.  The main villian feels fresh in a series where you can barely remember who it is.  I've compared Conviction to 24 but this one feels like the closest thing to a good 24 game I'll get.","August 11, 2015","true","82.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell Conviction, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Didn't preorder, because I was cautious, but nonetheless excited. Note this however, I first experieced my first hours of this on console, and bought the Deluxe Edition recently on sale for $10. The Xbox version was fine, no bugs that were game-halting. It was fun. So here we are now for the PC version.\n\nSingleplayer: This is probably my favorite part of this game. The campaign missions have a good amount of replayability, whith the whole Ghost, Panther, and Assault deal. The campaign is fairly long and the story is interesting. They got a new voice actor for Sam Fisher, which disheartened me, but is not a major setback because the new one does well with keeping the same brisk, badass, get-to-the-point-or-I-will-kill-you tone we have all come to know and love. Overall, the singleplayer is fantastic.\n\nMultiplayer: Alright, any bugs that are in the multiplayer will be explained in the bugs section. The multiplayer for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is quite fun. The Spies VS. Mercs mode returns and it's better than ever. You can't help but feel a pang of fear when you hear the slice of a blade into your buddy behind you and you turn around to see nothing but your friend's dead body, or the satisfaction of sucessfully performing such an attack on the mercs. The mercs are locked in first person, and can't see into the dark as well, but make up for it in sheer muscle and lead. Spies are locked in third person, and can see very well between light settings. Spies can climb onto or into almost anything, and while mercs can do a little themselves, they mostly just hop over shest high walls or drop to the floor below. Coop is also quite satisfying. It's hard to get a feeling quite equal to you and your bud tearing down a fortress all in silence.. or in glorious charges into the breach. That's possible too. Overall, the gameplay is fun and diverse.\n\nBugs: Okay, here's the party pooper. This game, like most Ubisoft games, have crippling connectivity issues. The singleplayer has little to no problems in terms of bugging out, but the multiplayer is a breeding ground for them. First things first, some people can't connect to the servers. Period. Even after this entire time of being out, Poobisoft can't get the issue fixed, or probably even consider it. Secondly, It's damn near impossible to connect to friends. There was a thread on Steam where someone posted a fix they had, but it was long and complicated. Some people were able to use third party programs where they were able to connect, like Hamachi. This same bug applies to coop, so a fat lot of good that does for you. Some people have even reported issues where they have had UPlay register them running two instances of the game and will refuse to launch. Game crippling bugs like this have been unattended to, and some people have even tried to petition for their money back. Also, at least for my friend and I, ALT+TAB puts you into windowed mode every time you do it. I have also had several times where the game will say "Not Responding", then work moments later, then pop up again. This is usually during launch.\n\nCustomization: This is a bright spot for Splinter Cell: Blacklist. The customization features many new weapons, all having many smaller customizations that can be added to them, like match point triggers, or hollow point ammunition. I was very pleased with the customization.\n\nHello to those who want a simple, to-the-point review of Splinter Cell: Blacklist and hello to those who actually read the novel above. Well, down to the point. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is overall a decent game. The singleplayer is a good length with an interesting story, the multiplayer is incredibly buggy, and likely will never be fixed by Poobisoft, so don't expect easy playing and connection to your friends. Bugs are rampant in the multiplayer, but are mainly involving connectivity. Surprised? I'm not. The customization is very refreshing from earlier titles,  and is very well done. My score for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 6/10. It's fun, but the bugs are game halting and ruin its experience for me. BUY IT ON SALE. It's not worth the full price.","December 30, 2014","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I get it...two completely different experiences...yadda yadda yadda. When I want an awesome stealth actioner, I'll take Blacklist over anything. I've beaten this game on Perfectionist so many times. It's awesome every time. Taking different approaches in each level. Every takedown feels righteous. Everything has impact. Karambit stealth kills are spectacular every single time. They never, ever get old.\n\nAmong my favorite stealth games of all time. While the story isn't all...whatever...at least it's not a convoluted mess as in the case of whatever passes for a story in the MGS world these days.\n\nGet this game.

This one is mix of Conviction + Chaos Theory and multiplayer is extremly awesome the COOP story is the continued of Conviction COOP story, so i suggest you to finish Conviction COOP before jumping into this one. The Gone Dark missions are amazing althought you dont play any thing it is only a daily brain challenge. Spy vs Merc is awesome although i never was a fan of it but in blacklist i play it alot becuase it is different  than chaos theory and even better. IF you like CT SvsM in blacklist there is a Classic mode of SvsM which is HD version of CT. If you are looking for more features then there are other Spy vs Merc modes which are amazing such as Extraction and Blacklist mode and also Uplink control in which you can play as both spy and merc in same team. Graphics and voices are amazin, so far unlike other UBI products which had a flaw specially in multiplayer, this one is a complete game which may never die!\n\nAnd about the new voice actor for some reason i guess this guy fits better than michael ironside for blacklist sam fisher becuase his character has changed alot in this game so it fits him! however i liked ironside more but you have to try this before judging it!\n\nCons:\n\nMissions are WAY too short!\n\nSam is really OP with all those advanced gadgets and that lame crossbow\n\nCheaters online and no support from Ubisoft","January 27, 2014","true","125.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, I'm not talking about UPlay, no no, I'm talking about the hidden 'Gypsy Curse' DLC it comes packaged with.  This special DLC really brought the excitement to life.\n\nThink I'm making things up?  Ha, I wish.\n\nAfter running the gauntlet that was UPlay to get it installed and play it, I thought my trials were done, that I'd survived the worst the game had to offer.  What more could it do? I sat back and enjoyed being a badass black ops ♥♥♥-kicker.  Life was good.\n\nThen my computer started making a weird noise.  Well, these things happen, everything seemed to be working fine.  I loaded into a mission, a pretty tough mission, and I put in the work to succeed.  Just as I'm about to exfiltrate and claim my reward, the Curse strikes.  My computer powers off suddenly.  What?  What could have happened?  Just a power surge, just gotta turn it back on and pick up where I left off.\n\nNo, wait, the power supply completely blew.  Burnt right out.  Dead.  Kaput.  Executed, if you will.  For the first time in my computer owning life, a part of my computer actually kicked the bucket.\n\nNow I have to go out in the middle of the Chinese New Year and try to find a PSU.  Yeah, right.  Well, somehow I manage it, so the next day I'm out a hundred bucks and a day of holiday, but I can get back to playing. Alright!\n\nI load back into that mission, and ghost it like a boss.  I turn to head for exfiltration, and the game closes suddenly.  Is it the power supply again?  No, it's the Curse.  This time in the form of a forced Windows update.  No warning, no option to delay, just bam, restart.\n\nWhat could have been so important?  A security update for a version of Word I don't even use.\n\nDo I dare boot the game a third time?  Do I risk suffering the curse?  Can I afford to?  What might happen next?\n\n...literally as I was writing that last sentence my virus checker asked if it could restart the computer.\n\nPlay the game if you must, dear reader, but beware always...the Gypsy Curse! Also UPlay, which really sucks and added several hours to the set up of the game.","February 11","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

In Splinter Cell terms, that means crouched and in the darkness. Be advised though, if you see pets crouched and in the darkness, usually it's a sign they are about to deliver a smelly present in your living space. But that's not the point.\n\nSo, it was a good thing that I was actually pleasantly surprised by Blacklist. Blacklist have a more open approach to missions which is akin to what Phantom Pain did, namely giving you a hub/nexus from where you decide which mission to tackle next, and which you can upgrade as well as upgrade and purchase gear using money you gain by completing said missions.\n\nI kinda like that, and it helped the game controls were refined and actually more instinctive than in previous games. They aren't perfect, and prompts are still wonky, but it's getting there. Instead of forcing us into a more actionny gameplay that was in Conviction, Blacklist come back to the fundamentals of stealth, albeit with a more simple system than in Chaos Theory. It also leave room for people who want to play a more action type of gameplay, though it's not avaible for all missions, some having stealth requirements for scenario reason, and for people who don't want to go non lethal and avoid ennemies, but want to sneak around and cut throats and shoot people in the head. Each mission has you rated in thoses 3 categories(Ghost, Panther and Assault), and add replayability if you want to get the best score possible for each.\n\nSide missions are gimmick missions with special conditions, which offers challenges and story in equal measure, and can, best all, be played in coop, which is a pretty good thing. Coop is actually pretty fun and usually enjoyable, albeit it suffers from a chatting system not working for a lot of people. The problem is, your partners aren't always playing with a style similar to your, so trying to get ghost mastery when you have a guy near you who is going loud and lobbing incendiary grenades everywhere can be quite a nuisance.\n\nThe single player campaign is mostly well done and enjoyable(though it has a few missions that are pretty annoying and meaningless and which could have been served better with a very long cutscene instead). Characters are surprisingly pretty well done, and we get to see how Sam has changed due to the events he had to go through. It hits a more grey moral zone. The story still has big chunks of Tom Clancy in it, and you will find again the cliché of having antagonists who are pretty much against the US dominion and must try very hard to not say "capitalist pigs" every 5 seconds. The problem I have with that is it doesn't convey the real problems some of the third world countries, or war torn countries can have, or what their opinion really is. Honestly the US dominion did nothing in comparaison to the british colonialism in term of dammage, and the US have considerably reduced their involment in foreign affairs thoses last years, so the whole thing kinda falls flat. So for me, the motivation of the antagonists is misguided and overplayed with very little true motivation, which is a shame, because they could have done something better with their villain. Also it's difficult to not think of Kane from Command&Conquer every time you see the guy.\n\nThe missions are pretty well designed, offering multiple avenues of approach, and usually giving you tools to deal with what you have between you and your objective.\n\nWeapons are a bit disappointing in the sense most of them are pretty useless if you don't go loud, and among the others, some are simply way better than all the rest. Some balencing would have helped here. Especially because if you go ghost, you won't be using any or so little, because you will need non-lethal stuff.\n\nThe soundtrack though is extremely dispointing, often on the border of electronic stuff which is more of a pain than anything. The pause menu soundtract being the main offender.\n\nBe also aware that the game is buggy, especially in some places where you climb/chimey, and where you can get stuck if you try to do something like shooting or opening a window. This happens way more than it should, and it's a complete soft lock forcing you to restart at the last checkpoint. The game will also get into windowed mode for no reasons at time when you launch it, and all the times you alt-tab.\n\nOverall this is a pretty enjoyable experience, at least worth 20 euros to me, but which you will probably be able to get for less(you can get it for 5 during a sale, which is a pretty good deal). People are still playing the game at the moment of this review so finding a coop partner is easy, which is appreciable.\n\nAlso, if you are still crouched in the dark, at least I hope you dug a hole and plan to cover it before you leave...","June 1","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/recommended/235600/","CharlieLima79","CharlieLima79","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/","121 products in account","Without a doubt, 'Blacklist' is the best looking 'Splinter Cell' game to date. As a fan of the series' stealth gameplay in the first three games, I am quite pleased with its return in 'Blacklist'. The game plays like 'Chaos Theory', but with a dash of the quick action featured in 'Convction'. Still, as much as I like the Mark & Execute feature, I rarely used it in my playing. The game is best enjoyed if you play it in Ghost (stealth + non-lethal) or Panther (stealth + lethal) style.\n\nThe story in 'Blacklist' is your standard 'Splinter Cell' fare. It's formulaic, but enough to move the action along, and it seems to be the beginning of a bigger story arc. What really captured my attention in the game were Grim and Korbin's side missions -- because they remind me of what I love most about 'Chaos Theory' -- and the Gone Dark Intel Metagame. The latter plays like a modern version of 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?' and it's a welcomed distraction.\n\nThe monetary system, in which you HAVE to earn money to upgrade weapons and gadgets, is superfluous. (Is the U.S. government in the game so cash-strapped that I have to buy my equipment in small increments?!) Sad to say, Eric Johnson, who took over for Michael Ironside for the role of Sam Fisher, failed to impress me. His voice acting was uneven and lacked the gravitas that Ironside's had. Johnson sounded like he was just imitating Ironside in one moment, and like a young man in the next. Johnson's voice work was disappointing.\n\nOverall, 'Blacklist' is a worthy follow-up to 'Chaos Theory', a welcomed return-to-form after polarizing thematic departures in 'Double Agent' and 'Conviction'. and frankly what feels like a soft reboot to the franchise. Despite one or two (maybe three) glaring flaws that are hard to ignore, there are enough good points to 'Blacklist' that make it worth your time.","April 13, 2014","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sam has come back, not only to save the U.S. but possibly the world.  The gameplay was smooth and looks amazing on high in pc's.  Despite the fact that the gameplay is good, keyboard and mouse was too difficult for me so I recommend a controller b/c even changing the keys around still left it hard to handle.  My only other beef was that the voice actor for Sam Fischer wasn't the same as all the previous games.  A fun new addition to the Splinter Cell game was that there's a decent amount of side missions via the 4 other "main" characters that hold conversations with Sam, including Grim.  To be honest, I have not tried the online play for the story or the nice remake of Spies v. Mercs, but I've been told it holds itself up well and makes for good replay value.","June 28, 2014","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't fret though, this game also allows for missions to go loud, so you can go in guns blazing and rack up the bodies if that suits your style. The story was good, characters are great. Some of the interactions between them made me have a laugh.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with Blacklist are the co-op exclusive missions. Trying to find a teammate online is nearly impossible, and there are not many people on my friends list that own this game.

Playing as already well known agent of spy organization 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher - you are together with another spy, Briggs or with your friends completing missions to stop attacks of terroist organization called Blacklist. Really well created story, although Sam does not have the personality he used to have in previous Splinter Cell games. Easy to learn controls, high variety of gear, gadgets and other stuff. Lot of collectibles such as Dead Drops, High Value Targets ( also known as HVTs ), etc. You can purchase two DLCs, well fitting the game. I would buy them on sale personally, but they are cheap anways ( containing bonus weapons and aesthetic customizations + 2 extra maps ). Interesting multiplayer ( Spies vs Mercs - Mercenaries, also known as simply SvM ) with nice concept and high replayability. The game has cooperative mode, but is missing offline lan multiplayer from previous games. If you like stealth, this - is the choice for you. Also, rest in piece, Tom Clancy.","December 18, 2014","true","111.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The AI notices when a teammate goes missing more often and they also remember when doors were suppose to be opened or closed. Movement has improved mostly for the realism side of things, you can't just crouch up to enemies anymore or else they'll be easily alerted.  Quite a few weapons have been added from Conviction and there are plenty of new guns aswell. Not to mention each gun has about 20 different attachments. With that I move onto customization which to be honest reminds me of ATV Offroad Fury or MX vs ATV Customization mostly because you can choose each piece of your stealth suit you wanna wear which can either increase or decrease Armor or Stealth. Graphics quality is on the level of Battlefield 3 in my opinion, mostly because of the Shadows and the High-Res Textures that Conviction lacked. Lastly, this game is FAR more optimized than conviction. Playing maxed out with No AA @ 1440x900 gives me anywhere from 50-80 FPS. Conviction never got higher than 55 FPS when I played it last.\n\nA few things I forgot to mention is that you can now either take out enemies lethally or non-lethally. You can also move bodies to different locations. Enemies now have new toys such as Tank Drones, which will drive up and self destruct on you if you get spotted by one. They also have Heavy Suits and basically it makes your enemies about as tough as a juggernaut in other games.\n\nAlright, I've listed all the pros I can think of. Now it's time to list the cons.\nOkay, here I go...*Inhales Deeply*\n......\nUplay...It's garbage. Why does this even exist? Sorry, I can't list anything else bad about this game.\n\nSo...is it worth it to drop 60 bucks on this game? Which by the way has an 8 hour (approx.) campaign, coop, and a 4vs4 multiplayer gamemode that is absolutely the most unique gamemode I have seen in a very long time. Well, that's for you to decide, and hopefully I've eased your decision making process a bit.","February 5, 2014","true","37.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As far as single-player goes this is by far the best stealth-game I've played. Multiplayer (especially co-op missions) has the potential to make it one of the all-time greats, but that's where Ubisoft just didn't pull through for whatever reason. It's full of bugs that make prolonged game-sessions prone to all kinds of glitches that rarely turn out in your favor, mostly they screw you and potential hour-long efforts over for good.\n\nOf course as it is with most Ubisoft games it is pretty much abandoned now update-wise so as much as I hate Ubisoft for their ways of doing business I have to admit that the game and its mechanics are pretty much as good as it gets as long as the god of multiplayer-bugs has mercy on you.\n\nBottom line: This game is too much fun for me not to play it but I would prefer it if Ubisoft at least delivered a finished product, be it on launch-day or through updates at a later time.","November 11, 2014","true","227.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Fantastic maps, modes and community is also pretty great :) This is a definetly must-buy for almost any gamer!

Now let me elaborate on that statement. Splinter Cell: Blacklist has taken Splinter Cell back to much needed stealth, back to its roots you could say. However, even by doing this they make it a new, refreshing feel to it, not just some reskin of Chaos Theory. With the games new 3 way level design 1.(kill all, be loud) 2.(Kill all, remain silent) and 3.(knock out, remain silent) 3 being my personal favorite. With this new system each and every level has so many different and unique design and ways of turning out, which makes for amazing adventure. This game is good, but it has its flaws here and there.\nA few things in this game don`t really add up when you start to think of them. One thing is that going by the games official wiki and information found in the previous games, "Sam Fisher was born on 17th April, 1957" and assuming that Blacklist takes place in 2013-2014 Sam would be around 56 years old. Now don`t get me wrong, grandpas can kick ♥♥♥, just look at Metal Gear, but thats a story for another day. The reason I brought this up is because in Blacklist Ubisoft replaced Sam Fisher`s actor from Michael Ironside who had played Sam in all previous games, to Eric Johnson, claiming it was for "peformance capture". Well Ironside`s Fisher sounded like a man who could be in his 50`s, Johnson`s Fisher on the other hand sounds like an angry 20 year old. Seeing how they used Johnson for Capture this Sam also looks much like Johnson himself. which looks like Sam might have looked like...in his 20 - 30`s. All of this is really just more of a personal complaint and this may not effect your gameplay experiance at all however. Since I am talking about negatives I must say how certain weapons/tools can be almost overpowering at times, for example you can come across a crossbow which if aimed correctly can fire to the near end of a map and on hit the arrow releases a sleeping gas which can take out almost any guard in range of it, one time when I alerted them the guards crowded up in a big bunch, there were at least 5 - 7 of them and ONE shot with a gas arrow and they are ALL down. This as well is just a minor complaint on what I think is still a VERY good game and if on sale you should buy for sure!\n8.5/10 ign","January 2, 2015","true","26.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And they failed. This game is buggy, and stupid in many ways. Rooms with moving lasers like some terrible movie and forced shoot outs this game is nothing like the old ones. However. If you like me love the old splinter cell and just want something that resembles just a little, this might be for you. I spent a long time swearing over this game. Changing the difficulty to easy during each long forced shoot out, only wishing they wouldve given me a "skip" option. But occasionally, I actually felt like the old Sam Fischer (whenever he would STFU). Some levels you can pass completely without interfering with anyone at all, which made quite happy, and made me feel I got my moneys worth. This game is for the people who want to sneak but wont freak out when they suddenly gets stuck in first person mode and MUST kill everyone on the whole level. Get it on sale. Its a ♥♥♥♥ game like almost all other games nowadays. But maybe half of it wasnt TOO bad. Id say its like a mix of the worst missions on Pandora Tomorrow (which is the worst of the first three and only  real Splinter Cells) and of some new Call of Duty XX third COD of the year.

Do to Steam's "Ubisoft Weekend" I was able to get the Delux Edition for only $9.99.  I cannot in good conscience recommend it due to the fact that it is barely worth that amount of money and the price will go back up on Monday, March 16th 10 a.m. PST.  But I lucked out and I don't think it's a total waste of ten bucks, but it would be a waste of eleven.  Let's do this\n\nPROS\n-Good action and combat gameplay\n-Very good graphics, though they could be a tiny bit better (will re-explore in CONS)\n-Acting is performed admirably\n-Stealth gameplay is good, though this too could be better (and less goofy, will re-explore in CONS)\n-Story line itself is very good, lots of kudos on creativity to the writers\n-Ability to choose equipment became ALOT better, though could use improvement (will re-explore in CONS)\n-Gadgets are really freakin cool\n-An over all PRO is the fact that Splinter Cell always sates our appitite for esionage, even though it fails in many ways to be a good game over all, we're left with few other options as far as spy games\n\nCONS\n-First off our options are limited in how we get a job done, you'll see alot of places you should be able to climb, jump, and drop to and be disappointed when the option to do so is not there.  ESPCIALLY in a coastal environment.  Really Ubisoft???  Sam Fisher can't swim or drop into the water???  HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN EX-NAVY SEAL FOR CHRIST SAKE!!!!\n-Ahem....moving on.  Collision detection should have had more focus than it did as far as graphics.  When I climbed out of the back of a truck, the rifle on my back passed through the back door all ghostly like.  In real life that would have made alot of noise and resulted in my demise.  Stuff to think about\n-While acting is good, and I understand Michael Ironside's inability to do this latest project, you picked the WRONG replacement.  Eric Johnson is a good actor, but he is NOT a Sam Fisher.  He doesn't have the gravely voiced battle-hardened saracasm, or worse yet, the age of Sam.  Sam's old.  Mid 50's old.  You can't just take any guy in his mid 30's and slap on some grey hair and call it good.  Stupid move.\n-While stealth gameplay has considerably few drawbacks, as well as alot of realism....the LIGHTS!!!!....on your kit showing you are HIDDEN!!!...in the SHADOWS!!!!  WHAT THE HELL!?!?!?  Have you people at Ubisoft just stopped trying???  You've had everything from HUD indicators to transitioning to black and white to show that the player is hidden and you threw that ALL out for something THIS STUPID!!!!\n-I digress....anyway, your equipment options.  Dangling items in front of our faces to get us to register on your website is stupis.  It's low.  And personally, I find it to be an INSULT TO MY INTELLIGENCE.  We will not stop hating Uplay, or the rest of your software.  GIVE IT UP GOD DAMNIT!!!!\n-Composure, composure.....sorry.  Last but not least while starting every mission from the same location was a kind of clever idea, it being an enormous plane Fourth Echelon uses as it's HQ, it makes the game less adventurous.  But of course you probably did it FOR that reason, because you're lazy.\n\nIn closing, what makes this game so bad?  Ubisoft, of course.  I love Tom Clancy.  The games, the novel adaptations, the film adaptations (apart from Ben Afleck) ALL of Tom Clancy's material is good stuff.  I really hope someone eventually takes away Ubisoft's rights to wipe their ♥♥♥ with his material one day.  I can hope...  I can dream....  At any rate, don't pay any more than ten bucks for it.  But if you see it for ten or less, that's a decent price given the quality.

I had read about how the playstyles were categorised as ghost, panther and assault.\n\nI soon found out that the ghost playstyle is often either absolutely forced, or basically the only viable option. I hate playing ghost.\n\nMoreover this game doesn't have quicksaves, and sometimes the checkpoints are imo way too far in between, so sometimes I had to put the game away simply because I had enough of playing the first 80% of a checkpoint for the 10th time.\n\nSome side missions don't have checkpoints at all!\n\nThe AI is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and your opponents have infinite gadgets (e.g. drones and grenades).\n\nThe damage model is also incredibly unrealistic. A bullet into the unprotected face of someone wearing a bowl helmet just makes a *PLING* sound and the helmet comes flying off. You can also put 3-4 bullets into the leg of someone with no apparent leg armor, and he just runs away. Oh and the heavies can step on a proximity mine without getting handicapped. Etc. etc...\n\nThe presentation is excellent on all accounts though. Well, the textures were a little lowres if I had to mention something.\n\nIf you love playing ghost style you'll probably like this game (although there is actually some forced FPS action in it too, not that I'm complaining).\n\nHuge disappointment for me though: 55%","March 27, 2014","false","15.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

The graphics are good - and the gameplay is similar to most SC games.  No suprises there.  However, one only has to read the forums to realise why I'm not recommending this game.  Like so many UbiSoft games - the "play online with friends" part of the game NEVER works.  I can join in with a stranger to play co-op but I can't add any of my friends.  UbiSoft sends out a help sheet which basically tells you to change your firewall settings and your port settings - which is completely unnecessary.  It doesn't work even after all that is done.  It is a common problem with UbiSoft Games and they never seem to fix the problem correctly.  If they do not fix it soon, I will be asking for a refund as it is not even half a game and they should never have released it without it working properly.  If you want a good FPS (or third-person, as the case may be) then this game may be okay for you.  But if you're looking for a game to play with your friends, avoid SC: Blacklist as it will just leave you frustrated and annoyed that you wasted so much money.","February 18, 2014","false","4.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/recommended/235600/","cucumbericepepsi","telos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/","669 products in account","My good friend bought this game for me to enjoy fresh co-op life but unfortunately there is no fresh co-op to be found. I've never played this franchise before and this really wasn't a very good impression of it for me. I generally liked what I saw conceptually but the execution reeks heavily of consolization. Coming in I'd heard this series was about stealth but this game really does not feel like it is. It feels like a third-person shooter 'with stealth elements' as the game industry likes to use for things that actually aren't like the real genre. It's a stealthlike!\n\nSeriously, once you get past a certain point it seems like every mission is a firefight or the game forces you to kill everyone. In one of them you're actually racing around to defuse bombs and you can sneak to the bomb to defuse it but if you try it tells you "You cannot defuse while under fire" even if you haven't been detected. Regardless of whether you can remain completely undetected or not, I do not really feel that objectives like that are appropriate for stealth games. right on the game page, right under "About This Game" it says "Own Your Playstyle" and goes into all these lies about how you can choose how to play, however you are guided on rails to do things one way consistently throughout the game. You instantly fail on several of the side missions and some sections of the main one if you are detected in stealth (which is fine by me, I'm just trying to point out how the marketing claim is bogus), and you're forced to disable everyone or are automatically detected on others (which is not fine to me).\n\nThe co-op tag is also AS USUAL a gross misrepresentation for grabbing cash. There is no campaign coop, therefore "the lines" are not "blurred" between them. The core levels are single player, and there are single player/coop missions to go along with them. All of these are little more than maps with the same objectives. Grimm's missions you go to six objectives/can't be detected or you instantly fail, Kobin you kill a bunch of dudes quietly or the game erupts with 20 heavy armor guys, Charlie you defend against waves of bad guys (really?), and Briggs seems meant to showcase co-op. Regardless of the mode, ALL the co-op levels are significantly shorter and of inferior quality compared to the main campaign.\n\nThe game had its moments I admit like the when you sneak into Iran, but a lot of the time it unfortunately just turned into a shootfest. I have no doubt in my mind that this series was stealth focused at one time but this game most certainly is not. When it comes to shooting there's absolutely nothing special to the game... It just feels like another generic cover shooter...","March 22, 2015","false","17.0"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","14","27","2","0"

Conviction, its predecessor, was absolutely amazing and I therefore had very high hopes for Blacklist.  Where Conviction had a complete single-player campaign along with a variety of co-op missions that could be played solo, Blacklist has a whole bunch of co-op stuff mixed into the solo campaign;  I despise being unable to complete missions, unlock gear, etc in the solo campaign without doing online stuff.  The levels inside the campaign also feature a lot of co-op only stuff - doors, passages, and more that can't be done in a solo game.  Worse still, some of the unlocks require playing an iPhone/Android game and synching it with your Uplay account.  Honestly, doesn't UBI already have enough of my information without resorting to installing spyware on my phone?\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, the game again suffers compared with its predecessor.  Nearly every enemy on every map in every difficulty is wearing a magic helmet that can somehow prevent all damage from a supersonic 7.62.  Seriously, you pop them in the head and they just turn around to see how shot them.  It absolutely ruins the mark & execute mechanic (armored targets don't die to the execution), and takes a huge amount of fun out of the game for me.  It simply should not be safer to enter melee combat with an enemy than to cap his head with a firearm.  I suspect the developers were trying to appease the crowd that whined about Conviction being too easy and ended up producing something that appeals to neither camp.\n\nI'll possibly continue playing long enough to finish the game, especially if I find a co-op partner, but I'm really disappointed in the game and the direction of the franchise in general.","February 15, 2014","false","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also I think that they borrowed a little from the assassin's creed series by making it possible to scale all sorts of buildings. I was however disappointed with the use of drones/RC cars. They felt like a really  easy way to scout, and kill, your enemies. However where this game truly shines is its multiplayer. The classic version of spy vs mercenary returns, but this time with a few changes. You can completely customize your spy/merc for the situation at hand. Say you want to use a heavy weapon like a LMG, or a AK47, or if you want your own flying drone of death you can do that. But you leave yourself open. It reminds me much of the chaos theory's spy VS mercenary mode but with a newer more balanced action side added.

And if you just imagine it is a prequel to Conviction, occuring 10 years before Splinter Cell Conviction, the story line (Sam Fisher´s age) actually makes sense too :)\nI definitely recommend the game, if you like a good old SC stealth game.

I'll get my first niggle out of the way first: no Quicksave function. Die, get detected, anything that compromises the mission and you're back to the beginning in most cases. I can't overstate the sheer frustration this causes for me. I like perfect, stealthy run throughs - I derive my enjoyment from seeing how a situation went wrong and going back to a 'just prior' save to try a different tactic. I don't want to be bumped right back to the beginning, to hear the same conversations, to trudge through the same hallways just to get to where I was. It's limiting and non-sensical to ditch a quicksave function in a stealth game.\n\nNext up, the controls. No longer can you control the speed at which Sam moves with the mousewheel. Keyboard controls (although admittedly they can be mapped), do not feel intuitive. Sam feels clunky, a little on rails. The contextual actions he performs are jarring, sometimes unwelcome; mean to open that door instead of head into cover? It's 50/50 what will happen. I wanted to leapfrog a railing by a door, and instead booted it open in front of a small army all curious as to who this suicidal maniac was. It feels clumsy, and in a Splinter Cell game clumsy is something that will deal break everything.\n\nSo what about combat? Admittedly, I'm a stealth nut, I avoid it. But even I get bummed out when, after not being seen across the map in perfect shadow, the body I drag back to the same (seemingly hidden) location is located as if it had flashing neon lights on it. In fact, I *do* have flashing neon lights on me and I wasn't spotted in the same location....but the body was. It's that kind of lazy gameplay that kills this for me.\n\nI love Splinter Cell. Adore it even. But something has been removed here and what's left doesn't feel like a Splinter Cell game. It doesn't have the same polish, the same sleekness or the same atmosphere.....hell, it doesn't have the same soul. I can see what Ubisoft have tried to do, and for the life of me I can't work out why it hasn't worked, but it hasn't. I can't figure out how this game got good reviews from fans of the genre, so the possibility exists that this is just my problem and not the game. But somehow I trust my gut and this game simply has not gripped me yet. I hope it does.","February 1, 2014","false","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The singleplayer is a nice storyline with a nice extra added feature to upgrade your plane, upgrading this said plane will give you advantages on the battlefield, from better radar to better goggles.\n\nConsidering i have played every Splinter cell series ever released on PC i think i know what i'm talking about by saying this is probably the best Splinter Cell they have released since Chaos Theory.\n\nWhen it comes to Multiplayer they worked hard to try and get that old feeling back that Chaos Theory used to have, unfortunately i still feels a bit chunky sometimes however i have over 100+ hours in on Multiplayer, i have to say tho, i played it without a proper team, if you have friends that want to play it aswell i can easily imagine you hit the 200+ hours.\n\nThe Coop is pretty good aswell, although i suggest playing that with a friend aswell on LAN or Teamspeak, it makes the experience so much better!\n\nAll in all this game surpasses Double Agent and Conviction by far, they really got the old Splinter Cell feeling back and i for one can not wait until they start working/releasing the next one!\n\nGood things about Splinter cell Blacklist\n\n- A nice new feature to upgrade your plane to make things a bit easyer in Campaign Mode\n- They smoothened out the upgrading/buying of new gear\n- Good gameplay, after 5/10 minutes of playing i got the feeling back and it felt like i never left\n- Versus/Multiplayer is a HUGE step forward and getting close to what Chaos Theory used to be\n- No significant gamebreaking bugs\n\nBad\n\n- The launch was a bit bad with Multiplayer not really working although all issues are resolved for me\n- At the start of Versus you feel overwhelmed by not knowing all the controls\n- I understand some things change, but i don't like the new voice of Sam Fisher :'( nor that he looks younger!\n- I hope they release some patches with new maps somethimes ( NOT DLC the game on itself is expensive enough )\n\nAll in all Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is a nice addition to the Splinter Cell franshise, if you liked Chaos Theory i suggest you buy this one as well.\n\n-Please note this review is written on the base of my oppinion.","November 30, 2013","true","173.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Think "Uncharted" or "The Last of Us", except all the exploration, environmental puzzle solving, and character development is stripped out, leaving only the combat.\n\nThe single-player experience is a series of combat arenas littered with waist-high walls. Each zone punctuated with a resupply cache at every checkpoint. It feels like a compilation of maps meant for the co-op mode of Conviction and it shows. Aside from the story missions, there are several game modes for the missions (no detection, clear the room, and clear the room for X waves).\n\nIt's arguable that replayability is built in to the maps due to the score attack mechanism which grades you on your performance in non-lethal (Batman), silent lethal (Solid Snake), and noisy (Michael Bay) playstyles. Why a secret agent -- with a history in covert wetwork -- would be rewarded or even commended for kicking down doors and emptying an auto-shotty into a warehouse full of armored goons is beyond me.\n\nOnce again, the concept of darkness is binary, as it was since Double Agent (PC/360). Due to the large number of enemies with night vision goggles and flashlights or the environments which are lit with dozens of light sources per square foot (many of which are ambient or otherwise indestructable), using shadows -- the original hallmark of the Splinter Cell series -- is pretty much useless, anyway.\n\nStealth is no longer about stalking your prey, waiting for the perfect time to strike from the shadows. Instead, "stealth" has devolved to camping at a corner, dangling from an overhead ledge, or just sprinting up behind an enemy (provided you've specced your equipment for maximum stealth) and mashing the kill button. Speaking of overhead ledges, senior citizen Sam Fisher is more nimble and spry than ever before, able to scale the 10-foot high walls of an office building with the ease of a young assassin Ezio Auditore.\n\nHaven't bothered with the competitive multiplayer mode, so I can't comment on it.\n\nMuch like Conviction, this is Splinter Cell in name only. If you must buy, wait for a deep discount. Better yet, just buy an Assassin's Creed title as that's pretty much the direction that this franchise is headed.","February 12, 2014","false","43.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justjim89/recommended/235600/","justjim89","JustJim89","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justjim89/","401 products in account","Rather than stripping out quality stealth content for the sake of including action sequences or big set pieces, this game simply puts the icing on top of the cake, as it should be. There is a lot of game to be had here. A satisfyingly lengthy campaign, a breadth of side missions that encourage different styles of play, and rather robust multiplayer options, both competitive in the form of the beloved Spies vs. Mercs and cooperative versions of every side mission. The campaign itself and the story it tells is something between a summer blockbuster and an engaging espionage thriller. And this dichotomy overall strains the story and spreads it rather thin. At times, there are even attempts at commentary on the state of the United States role in international conflict and the moral justification of our trial-less imprisonment of those in Guantanamo Bay. But this is juxtaposed right next to cringe inducing Hollywood hacking and a rather tired and cliche cast of characters. Charlie is the embodiment of all the stereotypical hacker tropes, messy clothes, awkward jokes, and all. Briggs is the up-and-comer eager to prove himself, torn between his former career in the CIA and his new, rather above—the-law position in Sam’s Crew. Grimm is a ball-busting, hard-nosed provider of intel who shares a rather strange amoutn of sexual tension with Sam considering she spent the last game lying, betraying, and shooting him. She’s also been made to look much less homely than before. But I guess that’s the creative license afforded by the rather confusing gulf between sequel and reboot which this game occupies.\n\nSam himself is what really makes this game feel like a reboot. There’s acknowledgement of past events of earlier games, and his daughter Sarah continues to grow, but Sam looks and sounds much younger than before. The closest comparison I can think of is when they replace James Bond. The history is there, the cast is there, some of the same players are there, but the tone and the central character is dramatically different. But I assure you I am not comparing this new Sam to Daniel Craig’s invigorating take on 007. Fischer is frankly a rather shallow character this time around. Full of youth and vigor and almost none of the cynicism or dry humor of his previous incarnations. I can understand why this is game where Michael Ironsides finally gave up on the series. Whereas he once described Fischer’s character as “a tool that had been used one too many times,” this interpretation of Fischer is a tool that is very much in working order and gung-ho ready to go do whatever is necessary for the Stars and Stripes. There is occasional friction between him and the crew around him, and even some with the higher ups in the government, but Sam’s attitude and “been there, done that” sort of look on life from earlier entries is altogether gone. And it’s certainly missed.\n\nBut playing action games for quality storytelling and compelling characterization is like watching wrestling for storytelling and characterization. You’ll occasionally be thrown a bone, but you’re missing the point. Splinter Cell is at it’s best between the cutscenes and that stays true here. And, largely, this is a very old-school feeling stealth game. while there is still the mark and execute “press Y to kill everyone” feature introduced in Conviction, it seemed much harder to reliably use in my Realistic difficulty playthrough. Many enemies wear helmets and a single shot to the head will do little more than ♥♥♥♥ them off and make your presence known. So hand-to-hand takedowns or Sam’s plethora of gadgets are generally better options than gunfire. And that’s if you choose to engage them at all.\n\nFor the first time outside of a Hitman game that I can recall, the game actively rewards the player for leaving enemies alone altogether. For every checkpoint you reach, you’ll be rewarded with points for every enemy you left entirely undisturbed. And it really motivates stealthy players to do their best to get by undetected and unnoticed. I found myself feeling guilty if I couldn’t find a  way to ghost through a section. This active rewarding of a ghostly play style is a lesson and a tactic that absolutely needs to be adopted by more stealth games (I’m looking at you, Thief 2014.)\n\nBut whether you choose to avoid, attack from the shadows, or altogether mow down those that oppose you, the game does a good job of  giving you feedback on your performance. Everything you do in a level feeds into one of three gameplay categories: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. At the end of every level you’ll be given a cash total for your performance in all three categories. And if you max out a certain category, you’ll be given even greater rewards for it. So while realistically speaking you’ll have a mixture of all three at the end of every mission, you’ll want to try and really focus on one playstyle in order to maximize your monetary gains. And those gains are used to upgrade your guns, your stealth suit, or your various support functions your crew offers from the plane.\n\nThis game really just gets it right where it matters. There are indeed a few minor annoyances I had which could be a major thorn in the side of other players, though. There is a whole section where you play as Briggs, the other operative on the plane, that plays out as a first person shooter. You can still ghost your way through, but the game really encourages you in this section to play it like Call of Duty. It really stuck out to me. There are also a few other sections where the non-combat routes are decidedly less emphasized than the direct approach.","January 8, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead it was an action-heavy guns a-blazin' approach, with just enough stealth elements as an attempt to hold on to its core followers.  'Blacklist' has made up for that minor failure and then some, offering up some of the best gameplay, AI and combat mechanics the franchise has seen to date.  Further, the storyline is genuinely engaging and the voice acting is top shelf material, though sadly the voice acting services of the legendary Michael Ironside is missing for the first time in the franchise, strangely replaced by the capable but much younger Eric Johnson.\n\nSam Fisher, as usual, plies his counter-terrorist trade, this time against The Engineers, sending him around the globe.  Sam's base of operations is an airborne military jetliner, from which the player can upgrade his gear, accept side missions from the Echelon 4 team, or pursue the main storyline.  Between all the options, there is plenty of of gameplay to be had from a single player standpoint, with additional multiplayer co-op and merc vs. spy possibilities.\n\nThough a bit linear in scope and lacking in memorable villianous character, 'Blacklist' is a welcome return to the Splinter Cell I've known and loved for over a decade.  If you are new to the franchise, pay the older titles a visit; the original 'Splinter Cell' still holds up very well.  I look forward to 'Splinter Cell 7,' slated for a 2015 release.  Or 2016.

Conviction, its predecessor, was absolutely amazing and I therefore had very high hopes for Blacklist.  Where Conviction had a complete single-player campaign along with a variety of co-op missions that could be played solo, Blacklist has a whole bunch of co-op stuff mixed into the solo campaign;  I despise being unable to complete missions, unlock gear, etc in the solo campaign without doing online stuff.  The levels inside the campaign also feature a lot of co-op only stuff - doors, passages, and more that can't be done in a solo game.  Worse still, some of the unlocks require playing an iPhone/Android game and synching it with your Uplay account.  Honestly, doesn't UBI already have enough of my information without resorting to installing spyware on my phone?\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, the game again suffers compared with its predecessor.  Nearly every enemy on every map in every difficulty is wearing a magic helmet that can somehow prevent all damage from a supersonic 7.62.  Seriously, you pop them in the head and they just turn around to see how shot them.  It absolutely ruins the mark & execute mechanic (armored targets don't die to the execution), and takes a huge amount of fun out of the game for me.  It simply should not be safer to enter melee combat with an enemy than to cap his head with a firearm.  I suspect the developers were trying to appease the crowd that whined about Conviction being too easy and ended up producing something that appeals to neither camp.\n\nI'll possibly continue playing long enough to finish the game, especially if I find a co-op partner, but I'm really disappointed in the game and the direction of the franchise in general.","February 15, 2014","false","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sam looks, acts and sounds 10 years younger in this game than he ever did and the new voice acting makes sure you can never escape that, plus he just looks angry all the time.\n\nAs a side note, on top of everything else there are so many recycled features in this game, that by the time I had been playing for a couple hours it actually felt like I was playing Assassins Creed 3 with a Splinter Cell reskin. I ended up uninstalling this game, feeling like I wasted my money and that one of my favorite series' has finally admitted it will never return to it's roots.","February 23, 2014","false","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The 64 byte graphics and Ge-force physics along with the Nvidia Shield game engine puts this 2nd person shooter game way ahead of current standards. And can amazingly be play accross all platforms including Windows 93 (and Windows Phone),  Mac OS X 12, ios8.8, Android Jelly Kat Pie, and of course the very popular PalmOS. This game is truely remarkable with next generation consoles even lets you input your commands with Commander Mode similar to Command Prompt on Cortana. All of this integration leads to a seamless gameplay that makes great use of your Facebook Inc.'s Ocular Rift Beta VR headset. The game characters are brought to life by great voice actors such as Steve Ballmer, Snoop Dogg, and Siri. Overall a great page-turner that keeps you excited until the end, when it finishes.

Cool skin-tight latex body suits that demonstrate the effectiveness of P90X.  However, the lack of Michael Ironside's voice and performance prevents Blacklist from reaching maxmium coolness. A weathered man, a father, a war vet, I imagine Sam Fisher is pushing 55, yet in this rendtion of the Splinter Cell series, he is voiced by a pubescent child who is prone to lashing out at his inner party. It's as if they're making some lackadaisical attempt to turn Sam Fisher into a young and hip action icon that is possessed by teen angst, opposed to the sardonically dark humour that we've grown accustomed to over the years. I don't mind if they're trying to reinvent the protagonist of Splinter Cell in order to appeal to a younger generation, but if that's the case, put Sam Fisher to rest and don't sully his image more than you already have. Introduce a new Splinter Cell--this reverse aging thing is just too weird for me.\n\nAlso, Fisher, arguably one of the most skillful agents of espionage of all time, lacks the ability to take cover in a standing position, which I found odd.","August 31, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also I think that they borrowed a little from the assassin's creed series by making it possible to scale all sorts of buildings. I was however disappointed with the use of drones/RC cars. They felt like a really  easy way to scout, and kill, your enemies. However where this game truly shines is its multiplayer. The classic version of spy vs mercenary returns, but this time with a few changes. You can completely customize your spy/merc for the situation at hand. Say you want to use a heavy weapon like a LMG, or a AK47, or if you want your own flying drone of death you can do that. But you leave yourself open. It reminds me much of the chaos theory's spy VS mercenary mode but with a newer more balanced action side added. Overall I would highly reccomend this game to anyone, especially  those who loved the original splinter cell series.","October 17, 2014","true","80.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I didn't really like about the others (cept for conviction), was the restrictions, I mean, what IF I wanted to be a gung ho kind of spy? You know, like that orc assasin in oblivion xD\nAll the other splinter cell games force you to be stealthy (nothing wrong with that, it's the game genre after all), but blacklist allows you to choose what you want (conviction too, a little bit). IMO in reality a spy would rather drop somebody before even giving that somebody a chance to even think about spotting him xD, so killing in a stealth game isn't really something out of character.\n\nThe thing is you aren't FORCED to play any particular way in blacklist (like chaos theory). To be honest, blacklist, if played full stealth (no knockouts) is EVEN MORE stealth based than chaos theory (standing in shadows 1m away from somebody and they not noticing you isn't really stealth).\nWhen you can get by an army of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in broad daylight on perfectionist and not even be spotted once, I think that says a whole lot more about stealth than chaos theory where you just stick (mostly) to shadows... Don't get me wrong, I freaking love chaos theory xD\n\nAs I said, blacklist doesn't force you to be stealthy, if you just wanna see Fisher in badass action, let him kill everybody, I mean, I sometimes like to go around sneaking on people and then all of a sudden SHOTGUN TO THE FACE!!! xD\n\nBlacklist is also harder for pure stealth, I mean, I did 100% in chaos theory on hardest difficulty without saving and loading, couldn't do it in blacklist though... (well tbh the train bug can be excused xD).\n\nThe pistol thingy in chaos theory and double agent (forgot it's name lol) made you OP in artificially illuminated areas, IMO. No such thing in blacklist.\n\nOverall if you're REALLY unbiased while criticising, you'll get that the stealth in this one FAR outclasses any other splinter cell game, if you're going for stealth, that is ;)\n\nGraphics whise, I really can't tell, I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, I usually run most of my games on the lowest to get as much FPS out of them as I can, even if I can run them at max xD\n\nSounds are amazing, but I REALLY MISS IRONSIDE!!!

Можно играть около 50-100 часов, call of duty отдыхает, ибо на стороне наёмников имеется вид от 1 лица, и после 2-3 раундов мне показалось, что играю в call of duty.

Имеется взамосвязь между напарниками, которая, к сожалению, в Conviction проявляется только в конце игры.\nГРафОН просто сногшибателен. Музыка, как не крути, МОЩНАЯ.

And if you just imagine it is a prequel to Conviction, occuring 10 years before Splinter Cell Conviction, the story line (Sam Fisher´s age) actually makes sense too :)\nI definitely recommend the game, if you like a good old SC stealth game.

I recommend lots of tom clancy games such as the splinter cell, ghost recon and rainbow six series if you like tactical/stealth shooters. Of corse each series is much different from the other but each has suspensful gameplay. I have not yet tested co op but will soon and so far solo missions have been great fun. You have 3 options on how to play the game, either going "ghost" and never use lethal force (which i prefer and is also the hardest), "panther" which is keeping all your kills silent and never being seen, or "assault" which is go loud, breach n clear, shoot em up style gameplay. Graphics are great as well as sound, missions arent dragged out and theres a lot of missions.

I'll get my first niggle out of the way first: no Quicksave function. Die, get detected, anything that compromises the mission and you're back to the beginning in most cases. I can't overstate the sheer frustration this causes for me. I like perfect, stealthy run throughs - I derive my enjoyment from seeing how a situation went wrong and going back to a 'just prior' save to try a different tactic. I don't want to be bumped right back to the beginning, to hear the same conversations, to trudge through the same hallways just to get to where I was. It's limiting and non-sensical to ditch a quicksave function in a stealth game.\n\nNext up, the controls. No longer can you control the speed at which Sam moves with the mousewheel. Keyboard controls (although admittedly they can be mapped), do not feel intuitive. Sam feels clunky, a little on rails. The contextual actions he performs are jarring, sometimes unwelcome; mean to open that door instead of head into cover? It's 50/50 what will happen. I wanted to leapfrog a railing by a door, and instead booted it open in front of a small army all curious as to who this suicidal maniac was. It feels clumsy, and in a Splinter Cell game clumsy is something that will deal break everything.\n\nSo what about combat? Admittedly, I'm a stealth nut, I avoid it. But even I get bummed out when, after not being seen across the map in perfect shadow, the body I drag back to the same (seemingly hidden) location is located as if it had flashing neon lights on it. In fact, I *do* have flashing neon lights on me and I wasn't spotted in the same location....but the body was. It's that kind of lazy gameplay that kills this for me.\n\nI love Splinter Cell. Adore it even. But something has been removed here and what's left doesn't feel like a Splinter Cell game. It doesn't have the same polish, the same sleekness or the same atmosphere.....hell, it doesn't have the same soul. I can see what Ubisoft have tried to do, and for the life of me I can't work out why it hasn't worked, but it hasn't. I can't figure out how this game got good reviews from fans of the genre, so the possibility exists that this is just my problem and not the game. But somehow I trust my gut and this game simply has not gripped me yet. I hope it does.","February 1, 2014","false","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game starts with an attack on the USA and you are Sam Fisher, the greatest patriotic spy the game industry has to offer and your goal is to rescue 'MURICA. Sam's black sidekick follows him around and helps him out whereever he can and yet Sam doesn't like him. Remember Sam's daughter whom you had to safe in S.C. Conviction? Well now you communicate with her trough your phone on your so called Paladin, a big ♥♥♥ Plane full of  	unnecessary scripted actions you have to make every few seconds.\n\nThe game offers you a huge amount of useless gadgets. The only time I used a little RC helicopter was when the game forced me to do it. You also get a variety of grenades and other nonsense, even a rifle and yet the only thing you need is your pistol.

Stealth is well done and Coop is a blast. Online is what you would expect (i.e. players who are so amazing you can never win & your run of the mill noobs). Only really bad part about online is that you can't leave the match without quitting the game. I like this feature because it discourages rage-quitting but rage-quitting can have its reasons. Overall, I wouldn't buy this game at $40.00 (includes DLC in Deluxe Edition), but I was able to scoop it up for $10 during the Ubisoft sale. Don't buy it if the Deluxe Edition is over $30 unless you really are a hardcore fan. Wait for it to go on sale.\n\n(As a sidenote) People keep b*tching about Uplay and how much it sucks and while they're not wrong, it hasn't had any effect on my gameplay (crashing, not starting, etc).

V/\/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaiseYourDongerz/","746 products in account","I absolutely love this game. While my time played may be low here, I played it by other means and have beat it many times over. The Uplay version was broken for me, and that was the version I had before I decided to buy it again on Steam where the multiplayer and online functionality actually worked and it didn't crash on me at all. (I have no idea why Uplay wouldn't let me play multiplayer, or even connect, the game would also crash every 30 minutes on the dot, and Ubisoft's support didn't help in any way). Regardless of all the trouble I went through with it, I still recommend it to anyone who loves stealth games.\n\nThe story while kind of unoriginal and bland, still held up, and was done quite well. Some characters make their return from previous Splinter Cell games as well.\n\nThe game is visually stunning, and looks really good when it is cranked all the way up to Ultra settings. It is also optimized quite well, as I can play the game at a decent framerate on an old HD 7850.\n\nThe sound and voice acting are quite good as well. While I wish they kept the old voice actor from the previous Splinter Cells, the new one actually did quite well and grew on me in the end.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot like any other Splinter Cell except for in this one, they have 3 different kinds of playstyles that they reward you for. They are Assault, Panther, and Ghost. Assault being gun's blazing kill everyone, and you basically play the game as a 3rd person shooter. While playing it this way isn't exactly my cup of tea, the game does allow you to if you choose to. Ghost is basically the exact opposite of the spectrum, and I actually recommend playing it this way. Trying to figure out guard's routes, and all the different secret nooks and crannies you can hide in or around without being seen is one of most fun ways to play. You are also awarded with more points if you go completely undetected, and  can sneak your way past guards without touching any of them. Lastly, Panther is a combination of both Assault and Ghost where you use stealth, but also kill whoever crosses your path. They did decide to leave in the Mark and Execute from Conviction which is a little annoying, and I think makes parts of the game entirely too easy, but just I chose not to use it throughout my playthrough.\n\nThe level design is quite good, and even though I wish it was a little more open, there are still multiple ways to complete missions. Most areas have different paths you can take to get around undetected.\n\nOverall, I put Blacklist in a close second to Chaos Theory. Everything is done really well, and this game was my favorite game of 2013 when it came out. If you are a fan of stealth games, I think it is a must have. I recommend cranking the difficulty all the way up to Perfectionist, and trying to go through completely unseen. It can be frustratingly difficult this way, but it's not impossible, and in my opinion the most satisfying way to play the game. Definitely recommend to anyone that is a fan of the genre.","June 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can also mix playstyles together if your not into stealth combat like going guns blazing and using gadgets. The  games story feels more like a splinter cell game than conviction did and there is also plenty to do after you beat the game with a good amount of side missions to keep the action going. Multiplayer is pretty addictive with 2 vs 2  spies vs mercs and 4 vs 4 mixed teams deathmatch.

This game runs solidly stable when running at 60 fps which can be hard to find.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justjim89/recommended/235600/","justjim89","JustJim89","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justjim89/","401 products in account","Rather than stripping out quality stealth content for the sake of including action sequences or big set pieces, this game simply puts the icing on top of the cake, as it should be. There is a lot of game to be had here. A satisfyingly lengthy campaign, a breadth of side missions that encourage different styles of play, and rather robust multiplayer options, both competitive in the form of the beloved Spies vs. Mercs and cooperative versions of every side mission. The campaign itself and the story it tells is something between a summer blockbuster and an engaging espionage thriller. And this dichotomy overall strains the story and spreads it rather thin. At times, there are even attempts at commentary on the state of the United States role in international conflict and the moral justification of our trial-less imprisonment of those in Guantanamo Bay. But this is juxtaposed right next to cringe inducing Hollywood hacking and a rather tired and cliche cast of characters. Charlie is the embodiment of all the stereotypical hacker tropes, messy clothes, awkward jokes, and all. Briggs is the up-and-comer eager to prove himself, torn between his former career in the CIA and his new, rather above—the-law position in Sam’s Crew. Grimm is a ball-busting, hard-nosed provider of intel who shares a rather strange amoutn of sexual tension with Sam considering she spent the last game lying, betraying, and shooting him. She’s also been made to look much less homely than before. But I guess that’s the creative license afforded by the rather confusing gulf between sequel and reboot which this game occupies.\n\nSam himself is what really makes this game feel like a reboot. There’s acknowledgement of past events of earlier games, and his daughter Sarah continues to grow, but Sam looks and sounds much younger than before. The closest comparison I can think of is when they replace James Bond. The history is there, the cast is there, some of the same players are there, but the tone and the central character is dramatically different. But I assure you I am not comparing this new Sam to Daniel Craig’s invigorating take on 007. Fischer is frankly a rather shallow character this time around. Full of youth and vigor and almost none of the cynicism or dry humor of his previous incarnations. I can understand why this is game where Michael Ironsides finally gave up on the series. Whereas he once described Fischer’s character as “a tool that had been used one too many times,” this interpretation of Fischer is a tool that is very much in working order and gung-ho ready to go do whatever is necessary for the Stars and Stripes. There is occasional friction between him and the crew around him, and even some with the higher ups in the government, but Sam’s attitude and “been there, done that” sort of look on life from earlier entries is altogether gone. And it’s certainly missed.\n\nBut playing action games for quality storytelling and compelling characterization is like watching wrestling for storytelling and characterization. You’ll occasionally be thrown a bone, but you’re missing the point. Splinter Cell is at it’s best between the cutscenes and that stays true here. And, largely, this is a very old-school feeling stealth game. while there is still the mark and execute “press Y to kill everyone” feature introduced in Conviction, it seemed much harder to reliably use in my Realistic difficulty playthrough. Many enemies wear helmets and a single shot to the head will do little more than ♥♥♥♥ them off and make your presence known. So hand-to-hand takedowns or Sam’s plethora of gadgets are generally better options than gunfire. And that’s if you choose to engage them at all.\n\nFor the first time outside of a Hitman game that I can recall, the game actively rewards the player for leaving enemies alone altogether. For every checkpoint you reach, you’ll be rewarded with points for every enemy you left entirely undisturbed. And it really motivates stealthy players to do their best to get by undetected and unnoticed. I found myself feeling guilty if I couldn’t find a  way to ghost through a section. This active rewarding of a ghostly play style is a lesson and a tactic that absolutely needs to be adopted by more stealth games (I’m looking at you, Thief 2014.)\n\nBut whether you choose to avoid, attack from the shadows, or altogether mow down those that oppose you, the game does a good job of  giving you feedback on your performance. Everything you do in a level feeds into one of three gameplay categories: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. At the end of every level you’ll be given a cash total for your performance in all three categories. And if you max out a certain category, you’ll be given even greater rewards for it. So while realistically speaking you’ll have a mixture of all three at the end of every mission, you’ll want to try and really focus on one playstyle in order to maximize your monetary gains. And those gains are used to upgrade your guns, your stealth suit, or your various support functions your crew offers from the plane.\n\nThis game really just gets it right where it matters. There are indeed a few minor annoyances I had which could be a major thorn in the side of other players, though. There is a whole section where you play as Briggs, the other operative on the plane, that plays out as a first person shooter. You can still ghost your way through, but the game really encourages you in this section to play it like Call of Duty. It really stuck out to me. There are also a few other sections where the non-combat routes are decidedly less emphasized than the direct approach.","January 8, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead it was an action-heavy guns a-blazin' approach, with just enough stealth elements as an attempt to hold on to its core followers.  'Blacklist' has made up for that minor failure and then some, offering up some of the best gameplay, AI and combat mechanics the franchise has seen to date.  Further, the storyline is genuinely engaging and the voice acting is top shelf material, though sadly the voice acting services of the legendary Michael Ironside is missing for the first time in the franchise, strangely replaced by the capable but much younger Eric Johnson.\n\nSam Fisher, as usual, plies his counter-terrorist trade, this time against The Engineers, sending him around the globe.  Sam's base of operations is an airborne military jetliner, from which the player can upgrade his gear, accept side missions from the Echelon 4 team, or pursue the main storyline.  Between all the options, there is plenty of of gameplay to be had from a single player standpoint, with additional multiplayer co-op and merc vs. spy possibilities.\n\nThough a bit linear in scope and lacking in memorable villianous character, 'Blacklist' is a welcome return to the Splinter Cell I've known and loved for over a decade.  If you are new to the franchise, pay the older titles a visit; the original 'Splinter Cell' still holds up very well.  I look forward to 'Splinter Cell 7,' slated for a 2015 release.  Or 2016.  Or 2017.","January 7, 2014","true","131.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All of that with the multiplayer Spies Vs Mercs mode that debuted in Pandora Tomorrow. In campaign, you will do all of your prep aboard the Palidin, a large plane that serves as your headquarters and where you access missions and upgrades. You can upgrade weapons, your suit, gadgets, goggles, and even the plane itself with currency you earn by playing the game. Players that hated how conviction focused more on combat than stealth will rejoice that, much like in the early games, you can complete most missions without killing, or even interacting with enemies at all. In fact, the game has a scoring system that values stealth above combat. Also, the night vision goggles are back, with the sonar mode available as an upgrade (I hated using the Sonar in coviction, but I think it works much better here, especially after a few upgrades). Also, the game handles being in shadows (which caused you to play most of Conviction in black and white) in a simple and elegant way. The lights on your suit simply flare up, telling you that you are more hidden. If you liked Coviction, you will like this one too. If you are a hardcore fan of the gameplay in Chaos theory, I would say you should seriously consider blacklist. In my opinion, it is one of the best stealth-action games I've played.","June 18, 2014","true","26.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As an old Splinter Cell veteran I'm really happy that Blacklist is the way it is, because Conviction was good, but it pretty much made you go loud all the time and stealth was missing (Remember the Choas Theory times, when stealth was perfect) and it made the game fully action type video game, and as much as I'm aware of- only thing you could in full stealth were Hunter missions (CO-OP) and everything has changed in Blacklist! This game has three types of gameplay:\na) Ghost- Don't get seen, knock out people and do everything really silently while searching for next cover you should go to\nb) Panther- Be silent, but deadly: use silenced weapons to kill enemies and when in close combat- use your knife.

However as a Splinter Cell fan since day one I felt let down. The voice actor change probably left the biggest dissapointment for me, especially knowing Michael Ironside supposedly coached the new actor. Somehow every game as Sam gets older, he gets buffer and more agile. I wished at this point they did a batman beyond thing and just had a new splinter cell be the main character, like briggs. As with conviction, parts of the story are impossible to do 100% stealth although I tried very much on perfectionist to hand to hand kill only without getting detected. The story itself isn't bad but doesn't leave a sense of urgency for what's actually happening. Most of that is done through calling your daughter which feels weird considering both actors sound to be the same age. They nicely took from Conviction though and improved upon its faults gameplay wise and took on a more Double Agent (next gen version) style of knowing if you are hidden or not, basically no more color desaturation.\n\nCo-op itself was very fun for the most part. The briggs missions started and ended fun but some missions seemed near impossible to stealth or literally were impossible to stealth, especially with the highly annoying re-addition of dogs since I believe Pandorra Tomorrow. The briggs missions also were the only story based co-op missions. The 3 others were very much like deniable ops from conviction. Charlie missions are wave based and after doing one for the full 20 rounds with loud weapons, my friend and me decided we did not enjoy them whatsoever. Kobin missions did give the more classic splinter cell vibe and can be compared to hunter missions in conviction. Grimm missions were also quite fun as they were similar to infiltration from conviction with a mix of added objectives.\n\nMultiplayer is back in its true form. I've not actaully touched on mutiplayer in the PC version too much but I did play it considerably on console. At this point if you are just getting into the game, you may want to play with only friends or else you will find yourself unable to do much as the learning curve has always been high with SvM. I found that the new SvM blacklist mode to be the best of them all giving you 4 mercs vs 4 spys and having to try and hack 3 terminals. Unlike Double Agent, you dont actually need to maintain presence at the terminal, just in the region. There is a throwback mode to Chaos Theory/Pandora Tomorrow which is 2v2 Classic. I didn't actually enjoy it too much considering how much I played Chaos Thoery SvM. There's nothing wrong with it, it plays quite well but I found myself liking the 4v4 mode with new stuff more. There are also other modes which combine spies and mercs on one team however they just don't feel that much fun to play even though I liked the old gen SvS in Double Agent. The addition of loadouts added a much new feel to SvM. I personally liked it because it gives you more ways to counter the opposition. If you dont like that though, the Classic mode will be perfect as it limits loadouts.\n\nOverall I do recommend this game because it is fun and well put together, but at this point its only worth getting if you desperately want the story or have a friend to play co-op with. If you've never played a Splinter Cell game before, then I think it is a great game to get into as there isn't really any expectations. Getting it for multiplayer is questionable as the community is small and learning curve high with most people playing max level now.","February 18","true","44.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I didn't actually enjoy it too much considering how much I played Chaos Thoery SvM. There's nothing wrong with it, it plays quite well but I found myself liking the 4v4 mode with new stuff more. There are also other modes which combine spies and mercs on one team however they just don't feel that much fun to play even though I liked the old gen SvS in Double Agent. The addition of loadouts added a much new feel to SvM. I personally liked it because it gives you more ways to counter the opposition. If you dont like that though, the Classic mode will be perfect as it limits loadouts.\n\nOverall I do recommend this game because it is fun and well put together, but at this point its only worth getting if you desperately want the story or have a friend to play co-op with. If you've never played a Splinter Cell game before, then I think it is a great game to get into as there isn't really any expectations. Getting it for multiplayer is questionable as the community is small and learning curve high with most people playing max level now.","February 18","true","44.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I expected a list of black people to invite to a party. Instead i get a game with stealth tactics. Also i didnt get any splinters playing this game. was i supposed to play it on a wooden deck? i dont get it. anyway this game does have some good things. I had a lot of fun sneaking around like a sneaky slithering p*nis snake and then molesting I MEAN assassinating people. Also shooting people in the d*ck when they least expect it is pretty fun too, they're all like "OMFG SOMEONE SHOT MY D*CK OFF MAN OOOOOOAOAOAAHWHWWH JASUS CHREEST" and then die from d*ck blood loss. and when someone notices that someone got shot in the d*ck then it gets spicy like a taco bell sheet. thats when i pull out my full auto ak47 and im like " BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM IMA GET ALL YO D*CKS!!!" then everyone drops from d*ck blood loss. Sometimes there are juggernauts and those can be tricky. The tricks to get these tricky d*ckies is to either stick a sticky d*ck bomb right on their d*cks or shoot them in the d*ck with a grenade launcher. I suppose you could just stick a knife in his a*shole but i mean whats the fun in that? exactly, NO EXPLOSIONS.

The whole dumbed down approach to the game reeks of console port and the only thing decent about it are the graphics and audio, which is on par with other games but nothing to write home about. The frame rate is a stable 30 on my system, regardless if anything is actually going on or not.\n\nControls are wonky and sluggish, removing all precision from a game that is supposed to be a stealth game. In actuality though, it handles more like a shooter with cover tacked on to it and some stealth elements added in as an afterthought. Splinter Cell Blacklist is very far removed from the original Splinter Cell, and for fans of stealth games it has very little to offer.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they have also tied this game to uplay, meaning if you do not agree to having additional software running on your machine, then you can't play this at all, which frankly is probably just as well. Naturally, you will have to make an account for uplay as well for no gameplay-reason whatsoever.\n\n3/10, could be improved by better quality assurance from ubisoft and skipping the completely unnecessary uplay disservice.","December 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

This game is not only buggy as all hell, but there is no stealth. This is a call of duty Assassins creed love child and it should have been aborted in the womb. The developers of this game have no concept of what is fun and need to never make another game again. If you want to play a good splinter cell game, play Chaos Theory. It does have its problems true, but it is way better than this game.","May 14, 2015","false","31.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

There is no freedom in a "stealth mission" so what if I want to knock someone out in the balls just to further my mission? I don't care about the cutscene, the game play is more important.\n\nThe freedom parts I enjoy, just toying with my prey having fun with their dead bodies throwing them down stairs etc.\n\nIt's a good engine and works fluently but the co-op under delivers in every way since chaos theory, that is the bench mark for this game.\n\nAnd who ever made the first person mode in splinter cell I hope you are reading this because I would happily read a beano book and curl a monster turd over your head whilst I read it.\n\n","December 30, 2014","false","23.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
