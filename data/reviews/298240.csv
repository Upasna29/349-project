"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abracastabra/recommended/298240/","abracastabra","Abra Castabra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abracastabra/","71 products in account","Product received for free\n\nWanna know what red crucible is like, and in particular, their dev team?\n\nI've been banned from the red crucible discussion board for a post I made. Originally I made a thread titled "Why pay money for this" and I basically asked why should anyone pay to buy custom guns and gear that you cant use because theres only a dozen servers and theyre always not only full, but got EXTRA people in them waiting for slots to open up. They let 4 extra people join a full server to wait for someone to leave and the first to click "join team" gets to play.\n\nSo I asked, and a dev named kazdonut responded with: "Its a free to play game. Dont want to pay? Alright. Thanks for checking out Red Crucible."\n\n\nSo I responded to that, with:\n\nI'd like to show everyone, the dev shows his exact feelings regarding the playerbase and the game in his comment, which i quote (emphasis added)\n\n"Its a free to play game. Dont want to PAY? Alright. Thanks for checking out Red Crucible."\n\nHe and the rest of the developers dont care about the bugs, about the hackers, about the stupidly OP melee, the lack of servers, he doesnt give two ♥♥♥♥s about anything but your money. Just money. The DEVELOPER who responded didnt address my complaint at all. And its just one, of many complaints, that the developers dont give a fu.ck about.\n\nThey don't care if theres no servers to play on, they don't care about the bugs or the ridiculously overpowered weapons (they care about those actually, since theyre for sale), they don't care about the hackers, they dont care that a quarter of the time i'm driving a vehicle it flips upside down, the devs dont care about any of that except your money.\n\nThe developers basically said "well its 'done', It's time to get paid! Now lets just sit back and rake in the cash!" And that's their stance on red crucible. They cant be fu.cked to write a single line of code anymore if it isnt for a chest with a special gun in it.\n\nkazdonut is right. It IS a free to play game. And that's what it should remain. Free. You're an idiot if you spend any money on this and an a.sshole for rewarding their laziness.\n\nAnd now I'm permanently banned from their message board for "griefing." They had to shut me up, you see, I might cost them a dollar. Do yourself a favor, skip this turd, and if you must play it, dont pay a cent for it, cause everything is ridiculously overpriced (20 dollars to unlock an attack helicopter) and the devs will laugh at your stupid a.ss for giving them money. Don't give them money. Theyre human garbage.\n\n\nUPDATE 5/6: I forgot to mention, I hope you speak spanish, because everyone else in the game does. Good luck communicating to the rest of the server theres a hacker if you dont speak spanish. Why does everyone speak spanish? I suspect because its a free game, and because the devs cant be bothered to pay for any dedicated servers so theres nowhere for them to go.\n\nAlso, as of today, theyve introduced a new gun. The badger grenade launcher. This truly ups the pay 2 win factor of the game by a couple degrees. The grenade launcher is devastating. One hit kill while youre behind cover, shoot it through a window, whatever. Supposedly it doesnt even arc, the grenades go right where you point them. So you dont even need the skill to kill a guy in a room through a window. The guy with one in the server was destroying our team. By introducing that gun and making it completely unbalanced for anyone without lots of cash to flush away, the devs have unequivocally proven they dont care about their game, just money.\n\nOn the plus side, if you have lots of money to spare, this is a great game. Several hundred though. Remember, the devs love money.","May 4","false","29.9"," 109 of 123 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","109","123","10","2"

Sure there are Russians and Americans fighting on both sides, but besides that, the gameplay is pretty fun. And it could be more fun when you're playing whit friends. And it's free, doesn't need high PC specs and the game isn't big, it's only 730 MB.\n\nSo I say, just give it a try, if you don't like it you're always able to remove this game.\n\nBeware for moderators.

They far out-weigh all other weapons in performance yet are accessible to anyone willing to fork out the cash. Amusingly, the devs of Red Crucible could argue that these weapons are 'theoretically' attainable by even the cheapest prick through the game credits accumulated by in-game play. However, anyone who may have played the game before will vouch that these credits (or coins) are ridiculously difficult to obtain in a mass large enough to purchase a premium weapon.\n\nIn early stages (1 - 20) a player may not notice the severe advantage a premium weapon presents to their opponent, simple skills and tactics being more than enough to equalize the disparity. It is only upon reaching levels 20 - 26 that it becomes abrupty apparent, making these levels the hardest to level up from and compete in. It is only now, after many hours wasted, that I find myself in a position to compete against anybody without the asistance of a premium gun.\n\nI rather enjoyed the game to be honest, the matches are generally competetive and fun.

Huge grind. Have 2 maps as default and you unlock maps as you go along. It requires a lot of guts to call something a poor man's battlefield. This nails that. It brings elements from battlefield and other games. Lowers the quality of gameplay and reduces the graphics to make a f2p game that is designed for lower end graphics cards. Can be fun but if you want innovation and eyecandy over fun then you should look elsewhere. However it is f2p so you can try it out, if you don't like it uninstall it there is absolutely nothing you can loose.","August 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","54","77","4","6"

Reeks of intense laziness, but it downloads fast enought to warrant a try.\n\n\nThis game has potential, but that's about it. If the devs want this game to remain competitive on the steam market they have to eliminate the pay2win garbage they use currently. They release weapons that are completely better than the weapons you are provided with, and you have no way to compete against wallet warriors.\n\nAt the moment it comes across as a crappy battlefield clone, and has unoriginal gameplay. The game is badly optimized and has very unstable fps. The ui reeks of laziness, and the recoil and reload animations feel like you are shooting an airsoft gun. Textures are not well made, and look the same on medium, high, and very high settings. Your sensitivity is lowered a ton when you begin to sprint, and you cannot change your bindings.\n\n\nStill a small download file, so try it out nonetheless. If the devs shaped up then this would be one of the best games on steam.\n\n","May 31, 2015","false","1.5"," 55 of 85 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","55","85","4","0"

RC:F was made as a direct replacement for RC2, removing the latter from Kongregate and their website. Sucks to suck if you put any money into RC2. RC:F features better graphics (yes, it's possible), better maps (well...), better vehicles, more lag, and the same ridiculous amount of Brazilians.\n\nPROS:\n+Graphics (Compared to RC2)\n+Vehicles (They actually did a pretty good job here. Well, good for them.)\n+Map sizes\n+-Weapon choices\n\nCONS:\n-Performance. 40FPS on min while running GTA:V at 115FPS\n-Connection is so bad. Shooting through walls.\n-Pay to Win.\n-Vehicle driving.\n-Most weapons are pretty much reskins.\n-Everything is bland.\n-Animations\n-Map and texture glitches.\n-It's just RC2 but everything is reskinned and made 100% worse.\n-This ♥♥♥♥ replaced RC2.\n-This ♥♥♥♥ took RC2 off the internet.\n-This ♥♥♥♥ exists.\n-Ammo: A new feature in RC:F is ammo counters. Cool beans right? Well limited ammo hasn't existed in Red Crucible ever until this installation, and alot of vets are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mad. And for good reason. We're used to being able to use suppressing fire and being able to shoot in peace, not to mention the unlimited reserve ammo was a staple of the series. Now we get three mags. Three. These weapons fire so damn fast and can glitch out and even fire twice at once.

For developers to receive feedback. Instead of just saying the game sucks, at least point out where so the developers can fix it. I like the game so far, and have come across a few glitches on the elevator where the people go into the floor, and some missing audio is noticed.

It's really appalling when the game tells me how to look around and move in an FPS in 2015...anyways the training is like MW2s training only not as good and when you shoot the gun sounds like a very shy man whispering to his crush in a library in the Queen of England's presence while every celebrity in the world rides by in a gold-plated Limosine offering him a job as an actor who only has to ever say 1 word and gets 50 trillion dollars.\n\nTurning the camera is a chore and it slides all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. This game is buggy as hell and broken to ♥♥♥♥. (Might I add the tanks are so ♥♥♥♥ing smooth and quick it's like your piloting the world's fastest space ship except you can't aim the gun down and regular bullets do damage to your armor.)\n\nThe Textures on the very high setting are worse than Half-Life 1's textures on the lowest setting and worst resolution.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ed with my character customization to find everything looked like ♥♥♥♥, and played one match only to find I had no choice what gamemode I wanted, or even play until the game previously started finished. And even then the game was ♥♥♥♥, I killed everyone because they had dial up connections, flipped my tank over after crashing it into a friendly jeep just to be a ♥♥♥♥ to the driver, and then got my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in when my tank ran out of ammo. And there's different classes but they're all pretty much useless, save for assault, wich is the only one anybody competent ♥♥♥♥ing uses.\n\nWorst game of the month, not worth the 715.7 KB it takes up, go get Heroes and Generals instead if you're looking for a good game like this.

I think it has a future, but only if developers will work hard with this game.\n\nIt is really like Battlefield for slow PCs. However, it has bad optimization for bad PCs, my PC is peace of ♥♥♥♥ now (Intel Core i3 1.4 GGz with Intel Graphics 3000), but it easilly can run Warface on minimum settings without lags (but with long load screens), but when we talking about this game, I see completelly random lags, they aren't depending on locations, map, they are just... Random.\n\nWell, I said it's BF for slow PCs? Well, not really. There are very big amount of guns, but they are not customisable, there are no upgrades like silencers or scopes, only "class" upgrade (just upgrade of damage, accuracy, etc). There are 4 classes, like in BF, but only if we talk about amount. Itself there are completelly different classes. There are only Rifleman and Sniper from BF classes, but Rifleman can use shotgun (there is only one shotgun I found with the name "Shotgun", genius), and Sniper can use really ANYTHING with the scope (even your first weapon will be not a sniper rifle, but MP5 with scope, genius too). New classes are Support (Medic) and Demolition (Engineer). Support is completelly imbalanced class, it doesn't use shotguns, it uses machineguns, and in this game mechanics of MG is the same as mechanics of Assault Rifles, but MG has got much more bullets in magazine (AK-74 has 20, RPK-74 has 50). So why we even need Rifleman when we can play Support? Next is almost useless Demolition. He has got grenade launchers as primary weapon, but there aren't a lot of them, they are hard to get (for second you need 5th level, I'm still 4th, it's hard to level-up here), and only one of them in the shop is for in-game money, others are for "donation". First weapon from this class is RPG-7, but it can't destroy tank from two shots and has got only 5 bullets! As you understood, there are hard to see player with this class.\n\nNext is the worst, only 4 vechiels. Even less than in BF:H. I looked in the shop, in upgrades, but no, there aren't buyable vechiels. I promise you, if situation will not change after early access, I will just not reccomend this game.\n\nIn-app purchases and the balance aren't so much scary before you will see ♥♥♥♥♥♥-support that pwning all your team with top machinegun or nerd-rifleman with Groza, that need one-two shoots to kill. Off cource, you can buy this machinegun for in game money, but first - some weapons are just premium and buyable only for gold (we recieve only 10 gold per level, but as I said, it's too hard to level-up and this MG cost 1,000 gold), second - we recieve 10-100 in-game points per round, but this MG costs 100,000 I-GP. Oh, we can level-up and by Groza, it's cheap, but am I need to say again about level-ups?\n\nSo now the game is pretty much poor, but I liked it, it is fun to play. Can't wait to see non-early access release. Don't make me sad, developers!","June 12, 2015","true","7.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

TDM and a Conquest (battlefield refrence) like gamemode witch the name i cannot remmember are included as well as other classic game modes such as the bomb planting game mode and such.\n\nThere is Vehecles in the game such as tanks and heli's ecetera ecetera some of the maps are really well designed and are interesting.\n\nOver all the game itself is a verry good game and i WOULD rate it 8/10 just for that. HOWEVER there is one bad side witch you get with every game nowdays.\n\nThe players. Spawn camping is rediculous in this game, for TDM i cant really blame it with the maps being smaller than justin biebers ♥♥♥♥♥ but even in the conquest game mode thingy it's a bit one sided for most of the game . there is no team voip so team comunicaition is almost non exsistant and even when you do type the chat box is so small most people do not even read it combined with the fact that everyone is just out for their own and ignore you anyway.\n\nIF people worked as a team insted of doing their own thing or relentless spawn camping this game ( if you can ignore outdated graphics and sound) was one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, i started playing at like 9pm and when i checked my phone "ten minuites later" it was 2 am. you will easilly get stuck into this game and with that being said i really do recomend it.\n\nTo get the best play experience out of this game i would probably get a bunch of freinds and use some sort of voice comunicaition to use team work. playing solo can be kind of frustrating as theres slim to no team work.\n\nSome bonus things that i personally found interesting. there is 4 different classes\n+Sniper\n+Assault\n+Support\n+Demolitions\nThe characters don't really change their looks witch i found interesting as you have to customise your own character and have to change the looks yourself. and it adds variation to the game reguardless that most people go assault of support.\n\nThere is items that you save up for and can buy like med kits, grenades, spawn points, air strikes, the list goes on and it's a fairly decent list at that. and best of all most of the items are all usefull and not some random crap you wont ever use . thus making you select your items carefully.\n\nIf you are still reading this then to shorten all of this:\n\nWorth the Download: Yes i would say so. it is only a half hour download ( Australian net ) and there is allot of items to buy with ingame cash you earn , the maps are well designed tho some are a little small, there is Vehicles , A medium variety to guns, Character customisaition , and allot of potential if you have freinds.\n\nReasons not to buy: There is a rediculous ammount of spawn camping thus you may rage quit being put up against experienced players . There probably could be a few more bigger maps. if graphics are a big thing to you these graphics are a little out dated and there isn't much in the way of sound fx witch for me is a little boring but not a big problem.\n\nYou will like this game with friends . solo may be tough. thank you for reading and i hope you have a good gaming experience should you choose to Download it.","November 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","32","52","9","0"

None of them have got a real meaty, chugging gunshot sound and thats something i think needs to be improved\n- When Sprinting (which has no limit by the way; helpful in large maps) you cannot strafe sideways which is a little confusing at start but you soon adapt so its not a huge problem\n- Currency - you dont earn much of it, as i said earlier, but i guess over a long gameplay time some of the buyables become actually buyable without having to feed it real money. Saying that, the devs seem reasonablely devoted to the game and have said what money is earned from in game purchases would likely go back into supporting the game\n- The menu seems a little confusing, and its kind of awkward to create loadouts as the default is only set to the basic M16 when you start\n- The quick play feature seems to concentrate fully on the map "Autobahn" which is a pretty good map but when you progress further in the game and unlock more maps you will probably have to find and select a server that plays them\n\nOverall, I think its a promising game that is being patched up in places where it falls down, and its free to play so why the hell not?!\n\nUPDATE - a few days after I posted this, an update came out changing the vehicles and the way you spawn them in, the new features being that you dont.\nThere are vehicles that spawn in by themselves in the spawn area and some of the new vehicles are pretty cool although the Z11 Helicopter is immensly overpowered. Like wayyyy too overpowered.\nIt pretty much has the firepower and armour of a tank. And the manuvourability of a helicopter with a speed addiction, making it very hard to shoot down even with the anti air tank. It has very high destructive power and can rain down death on the unsuspecting footsoldiers and tanks below and dodge their shots with ease.\nMr Developer, please at least reduce its health and maybe the damage of the missiles as its very annoying to be chased around the map by 3 of these.\n\nApart from that its still a pretty fun game and what I said in the previous review still stands for this version of the game so dont worry too much... just nerf that god damn choppa!!!","September 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","0"

Please, this time, don't post hate comments. A lot of the reviews just broke my heart. Some of them are just spam, and others help. Most are also abusive reviews...let me just go over some things you guys don't know.\n\nQ : Why is there only 2 maps?\n\nA : It's not. You guys just don't know how to get the other maps. You have to unlock them. They're 25 coins or 100 HP. Although I do have to admit that the prices need to change, or that we need to be rewarded more.\n\nQ : Why are the graphics so "bland and muddy"?\n\nA : I have to disagree with this. Some people actually wanted the graphics to be lowered. Better graphics doesn't mean a better game. This was made with the Unity Web Player, and RGS has been working on RC since 2007. Please don't judge this game by that. Fine, why not make a game yourself? See how people will react to your game. It can take several months for graphics to change, and I know most of you are sort of 'impatient".\n\nQ : Why is the game so hard or Paid to Win?\n\nA : Everyone wants money. Money, money, money, money. This a F2P game, and so it convinces you to try and buy. They also want you to play a lot. Like I said on the first Q&A, we need more HP or subject prices to change. There is a tier system which affects your stats depending on your tier. It costs 1,000 HP or 25 coins. Plus, we have daily rewards! How nice! You get consumables, boosts, honors, and other neat stuff you need. But look at the 7th day. We get coins!!! That will range through 10 - 100 coins! I have to say economy sucks, but I'm hoping for trading and marketing in the near future.\n\nQ : Is there going to be more modes and arenas? And vehicles?\n\nA : OF COURSE!\n\nQ&A will be updated when I have the time.

If you're looking for the next step in online fps action, this is the game for you. Don't let the fact that it is free deter you from what is easily shaping up to be one of the best games of 2015.\n\nDon't pay attention to negative reviews that say things like  "this game is ♥♥♥♥" or "♥♥♥♥ this trash pile", there was an argument between some of the devs which resulted in disgruntled employees writing poor reviews for this game. Where Red Crucible really steps up is through it's intense multiplayer matches, that, coupled with next gen graphics and realistic weapon/vehicle sounds creates a fantastic combat atmosphere.\n\nThis game is truly immersive and it's FREE!! Now I know that free to play games can often garner a sense of poor quality and a "pay to win" feel where microtransactions reign supreme. But fear not because this game has ZERO microtransactions, none whatsoever. And that is good news for passionate fps gamers.\n\nYou have nothing to lose by downloading this game and spending countless hours shooting your friends in unprecedented 1080p beauty. I only have 0.3 hours on record as I am writing this review from a second account.

For a previously browser game (Red Crucible 2) it is exceptional.\nThe gameplay on this game is one of the best i have known - far surpasses any from Call of Duty. In this game there is around 10 maps i think (not sure since new updates) and all of them are so diverse from each other - One minute you could be having a close quarters gun match but then the next you could be having a tank battle in the middle of the desert. There is one flaw to the maps and that is that they (for some reason) removed Favela, which any previous players would have known that this was the best map on this game - if not one of the best for any game. And thats saying something seeming as it is a browser based game (or was). However, the CEO of Rocketeer Games has said that they would be reintroducing it to the game. Hopefully then the game will be back in its former glory.\n\nThe next thing - The guns. The diversity of guns in this game is mindblowing. These can feature from close quarters guns such as the Deagle (Which for some reason in this game is called the DEagle) to the M95 one shot sniper rifle. Gun paints are included with some weapons (which never used to be a feature) with decent designs. You can also get sights for some weapons which is epic. Only flaw to this is that they only seem to come with paid guns (or 60,000 - 100,000 honor points guns) and they cannot be bought separate or individual. So overall the guns are pretty good.\nAlso the suits/skins are very expensive with some only being able to be bought with money (another flaw).\n\nThe graphics: Decent enough for a browser based games. However they need top-range processors and graphics cards from my experience. I use a AMD Radeon 7500 series card and a Intel i5 processor (not very good to be fair) and i can only seem to run on lowest settings at 120fps whereas when i use medium graphics i can only run at 40fps (wtf????). So maybe this game is optimized more for Nvidea users. This is just my experience so no idea.\n\nHackers: The thing that lets this game down so much is that there are so many hackers. Would be great if Rocketeer introduced a new vote kicking system. I would also like to see Moderators in servers (might be in new update: ive not spent much time on)","June 1, 2015","true","11.7"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","16","28","5","0"

Most of the people here who have reviewed don't even have ONE HOUR OF GAMEPLAY. Sure, there are OP looking customized weapons, but you can get competing guns in the unlock tier with the ingame currency, which in my opinion is very easy to get, especially with the fact that there are daily rewards that grant you a consumable, honor points, and once I got premium currency, so therefore if you keep grinding and getting daily rewards you could eventually get something good. Starting the game people will just judge it by the cheesy tutorial and perhaps encountering some bad players that have no idea what they are doing in the lower levels, or vice versa.\n\nSomewhat like Warframe where you have to grind and you get daily rewards (pretty much the only similarity), I like this game. You may be bad at the beginning, or maybe you're a killing smurf, I don't know.

Now keeping in mind im aware it's in Early Access, it still feels very bare-bones and unfinished, it's the bare minimum of what you'd call a functional game. I'd check on it after a month or two to see how much it's progressed, but as it stands, there's simply not enough content. Badly done animations, awful sound effects, slow and janky controls and an overall hollow and cheap feeling that cant really be accurately described unless you try for yourself. There's really nothing special that makes it stand out in an overcrowded FPS market. Even older Korean F2P games from several years ago play and look better than this.\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ Maps are large/medium sized and feel alright\n+ Weapons appear to be decently balanced\n+ The ability to pilot aircraft and vehicles\n+ Seems to run well on older machines\n\nTHE BAD\n- Muddy and bland graphics\n- Floaty and unrefined controls\n- No voice chat\n- Menus/Options are insultingly bare-bones\n- Sound Effects/Voices are hilariously bad\n- Poorly optimized, constant FPS spikes\n\nTHE UGLY\nIphone/browser "gamers" thinking this thing is actually quality entertainment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNsrK6P9QvI\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIt definitely needs a lot of work.

It feels like it's trying to cheaply imitate the Battlefield series, but honestly, there are much better alternatives at the moment.

When the tutorial began, I was immediately greeted by the cheesy Drill Sergeant voice, you know, the one attempting to sound like a hard ♥♥♥, smokes like a train and has scars on his face. Yeah! That one! That one is tremendously annoying. Now moving on. The movement and aiming seems ancient compared to games that were released in 2005 or later, and this game was released less than one month ago on May 29th. It's as if the aiming and movement was modeled after Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Island Thunder. Granted that there are minor weapon sway animations but it feels far too scripted than it should. Lacking life essentially. Now the movement mimics the same movement from the game mentioned earlier, Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Island Thunder. It too, lacks life making the game fall below par.\n\nNext came the character customization. It's awful. When switching between different gear and weapons, the textures fail to load and you're left with a half naked character. Seems like the developers chose to not include many of the assets with the installation. Gear must be purchased with points within the game.\n\nFinally, the actual gameplay. I was able to get into a match fairly quickly which is a plus for the game. But it doesn't make up for what I experienced next. The vehicles accelerate unrealistically fast and the flight mechanics are just the same. The combat feels unrewarding.

Rocketeer Games Studio will be desperate enough to the point where they nerfed every existing weapon to release better ones so you woud keep spending your money like a fool.\n\nInstead of making Red Crucible Firestorm a better game by fixing bugs and major issues, and releasing any new content at all, Rocketeer Games Studio is too busy releasing new weapons and vehicles weekly so players would spend 20$ for it or more to gamble for it since some of the weapons are only obtainable by gambling  real money.\n\nIn short, there is no reason to ever play Red Crucible Firestorm at this state.\n\nNever waste time and money on this","May 1","false","10.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

Bad graphics: This looks like its played on a play station 2 or original xbox.\n2. Bad controls: They seem weird and clunky.\n3. God awful voice acting: I think I've only hear 2 voices the entire game: The very unitimidating  drill sargeant, and the guy who says something like "whe'll get em next time" when you lose a game. Your soldiers don't say anything, so it makes the battle boring.\n4.

The premise is good but sadly there's a lot that needs to be fixed. As the time of writing this I filed a formal complaint with the developers but I really doubt my word is going to have any sway with them.\n\nActually I should probably mention a few other things. This game is very much a pay-to-win game in which your guy weapons, appearance changes, etc. It's possible to unlock weapons and articles of clothing, but the best guns in the game area strictly paywalled and a lot of the equipment you can buy for aethetic reasons are strangely priced.\n\nAlso as someone who loves firearms I found a number of the gun's statistics very unrealistic compared to each other and their real-world counterparts. Suggesting the people who made this game either don't know how guns work compared to each other, or they simply don't care.\n\nThis game's a money-dump, pure and simple. I strongly suggest you play a better developed game unless you like throwing away money for getting unfair advantages and contributing to a company that sees you as little more than a cash-cow. If you like this game I strongly suggest any modern EA title.","March 7","false","20.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KendallJudice/recommended/298240/","KendallJudice","VCatt!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KendallJudice/","30 products in account","This game is, well, kind of good. Let me explain. I will first list the positives and negatives of the game then go on to talk about my personal complications with my first through playthroughs of the game.\n\nPositives:\n+Good Gameplay, runs smoothly on old and new computers\n+Downloaded super fast.\n+Good community, nice people\n+Doesn't really force you to pay for anything\n+Nice selection of vehicles that are easy control and spawn quickly.\n\n\nNegatives (Hope you are ready):\n- Bad Graphics\n- Horrible Sound FX\n- Over used FPS cliche (the game is extremely alike to any Battlefield game)\n- Not a wide choice of weaponry when you first start out (which isn't that big of a problem because most fps' are like that)\n- There is only 4 maps in the entire game.\n- While all vehicles are easy to maneveur they are extremely too fast and un realistic.\n- You can't turn up the brightness?\n- *cough cough* bad graphics.\n\nAlright now I am going to go ahead and talk about my personal experiences, good and bad.\n\nWhen I first launched the game the first thing I noticed was the menu, it's easy to use and fast and efficient, but is a little bit bland, with no sound fx on anything you click, which isn't a big deal but it's nice to have some feedback when you click something. I then went to the settings to see if I needed to change anything with the graphics. When scrolling through the options I noticed there is no brightness setting what so ever. This wasn't a problem at the time but would later prove as one later on. I then proceeded to start up the game after dicking with the settings and joined a game quickly. Sweet, didn't have to wait a long time so that means there is a good amount of people playing. When I finally got in the game this is when the brightness level was a problem, I couldn't see a thing and the brightness on my laptop was all the way up. Thankfully I just started using my mini flatscreen as my daul monitor and turned up the brightness on  it instead, perfect the game is good now. I will edit this later when I have more to complaim about. But over all I recommend this game, it just has some minor flaws to it but hey, it's free.","March 28","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And there is another flaw in the game wich is that if you are  looking for a good expierence in this game is that you have to basically "pay to play" meaning if you want new/better weapons or vehicles you have to purchase the special items with in game currency wich is known as honour/coins. and usually the items you have to pay for cost over 100 coins or 35000-70000 honour wich takes some time to get. if you don't want to pay with coins or honour you buy it with real money or you can buy coins and honour with money as well.

( its because , if you review this somewhere else like in their community or in facebook group , you get the ban if you had listed atleast 1 con )\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfirst let's talk about PRO's :\n1. core logic of the game is cool . your player view will make your game play interesting , you can run , jump shoot or get killed by a camper.\nthis is the only reason , many players use their money on this and still playing this game , but for the rest of the community , this game is pure toxic. let me tell you why.\nCON'S :\n1. there are over 1000's of games in steam are less then 10$ , but a single premium gun in this game cost 15$ ( and there are over 100's of premium , you should sell your full home to buy them all )\n2. dev says its free to play , players say its pay to win , but actual fact is , its pay to survive . even buying premium stuff will only increase your chance of winning , but it won't give you a sure win.\n3. free guns are joke. with that bad aim , and less ammo . you will run out of ammo , before you shoot your enemy .. unless you are a camper.\n4. one SIDED devs : rules they make generally differs for each and every players , if a player is dev friend or a member from top clans  , whatever he do , he get unbanned and he will come back to the game , in other side for a non popular person , even if you just opened cheatengine you get a permanent ban.\n5. The servers : i don't know what they are doing with the player's money , the servers are still sucks. oh wait , did i said servers ? actually there is only one.\n6. Ego DEvs: yup , if you say any bad review , you get banned straight away in their community forums.\n7. it punishes new players , 90 % of players leave this game after they reach lvl 20. its because , with that low armor and guns they have to face the lvl 35 players with premium stuffs.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nso over all for players ,\n1. if you like spend much money and like to dominate other's with your money , go for this. get all stuff , abuse it and join a top clan where you meet the same type of greedy players , make a CVA and burn other players. otherwise , stay out of this XD.\n2. if you are going to still play this , then remember soemthing , save your hp's so after three months , you can atleast get one premium weapon and you can survive with that.\nfor devs ( even tho , they not going to listen , its my job to do it ) ,\n1. can you guys first change your partiallity rules for players , everytime you guys only focus on selling new guns every week and support top clan players .\n2. instead of putting many premium stuffs , why not make this game purchasable for like 20$ and put all ingame items free , so every one can abuse it : ) , in other hand you get your money too ( but i dont think so , its going to happen , since you guys tasted a lot of money just from the weekend sales , however think about it , a good game attracts , many players and may be 100 k sales possible too )\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n***** if you not even readed my review , and comes directly down , then all i said is stay away from this game , till they change the pay 2 survive system *****","June 4","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite so far has been the MP5, due to it's longer range capabilities, while still having medium - close combat range due to hipfire and low zoom scope.\n\nThe ingame currency I am not sure how I feel about. I understand it is a free to play game, but I really don't know how I feel about someone paying for currency to immediately unlock the strongest rifle in the game. The one thing that counters this is the fact that basically all weapons ARE very balanced, so technically someone having a later weapon wouldn't matter since it's balanced, and can be unlocked through levels.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am now 10 hours in and have purchased the gun "Vortex S". I can now officially state my opinion on the premium guns. In all honesty, yes they are better in some scenarios. The reason being attachments. The red dot sight, for me, helps a ton, yet the guns are still balanced. The only difference on other guns is maybe a suppressor, which still is loud enough to hear. In general, I do not think this is pay to win AT ALL. I think it is actually the most balanced Free to Play FPS I've ever played.","June 1, 2015","true","110.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/recommended/298240/","Aandreas","Aandreas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aandreas/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRed Crucible: FireStorm on STEAM\n\nI only recommend this game if you have no other first person shooter battle game to play, It's no COD or BF, the game runs smoothly on my old XP (but it is a gaming PC). I liked this game... But this is what I found....\n\nI could only find two maps to play on (A7 Autobahn and Kiev).\n\nA7 Autobahn -is a place in the countryside with a couple of small villages and military camps that you could resupply at or drive tanks, APC's and a helicpoter.  (I only saw the APC),\n\nI had a few turns in the tank and the helicopter, but it seemed to me that others were much more skilled and knew where to fire from. I killed none in those vehicles and got exploded and killed in my vehicles before I could do anything worthwhile.\n\nEven shooting an APC enemy with my tank. I got several direct hits on the enemy, yet the APC managed to kill me exploding my vehicle in half a dozen shots. (That cannot be correct can it)?\n\nThen I went tank -v- tank and got killed again, even though I got the first two rounds into his rear from behind before he even turned round.  Then as he turned -  one shot from him and I was gone. (I started to feel this was rarther pointless)! Did he have extra armor, the tank looked the same as the one I was driving..\n\nI could not find out how to fire in the helicopter and it wasn't for personelle-transport-only -  I don't think.. I got killed from nowhere. Twice.. That was enough for me,,,\n\nThe best thing was on foot, I managed to kill several enemy who were on foot, but in A7 Autobahn - I could not find my rocket launcher to hit the tanks with. I had one in my load out - I'm sure...\n\nIn Kiev - On an aircraft carrier deck and below decks, you can only play on foot. I got most of my action done here. Good fun, But not much else to do.. I did not find any objective to complete or capture.. Its just Team Death Match - over and over and over again..\n\nI think you can design you own games, but I did not do any of that. Also - although I did not use it, there is a support link and a tutorials section. If you don't use it, you only have yourself to blame. Don't go saying this is a crap game in a review - if you have not given it a chance or used support or seen the tutorials section..\n\nI had trouble at first, because I could not get into a live match, there were no on-screen prompts to tell me how to get into the match (typical gamer - typical man - I play first then read the instructions)..  and the first few matches I tried to join, literally played out, without me actually getting in. Spectating and all that..\n\nThen when I worked out that it was some combination of mouse left right click;  I got into the game. I still am unsure. (Is it hold right and click the left? Can't remember, even though I played just last night - for the first time).\n\nAnyway...\nOnce in the game - it was great fun. However, I am not used to targeting (aiming down the sights), by pressing a mouse button. I got some good scores once I got the hang of it.\n\nVisibility was a problem in Kiev, I did not want to adjust my graphics, because there are other games I play that I am already perfectly set up for. But, the game could have done with a brighter setting ' lighter setting to get rid of those dark corners.. .\nSo, its not a problem with the game! Game was great...\n\nAlso with visibility, I found that enemy were getting lost in my field of view as they ran past. 'They didn't even see me' !! Then - when I thought I had them, as I turned to chase and shoot - I'd losoe them..\n\nI'm sure its just a mouse sensitivity thing... or screen resolution? - Possibly even refresh rate? I don't know. When you get killed you don't automatically spawn back into the game either- or at least I didn't.\n\nOverall - I liked this game. !! It was cheap enough not to regret the price..(Did I even pay for this? Can't remember)??\nI will play it a little more, but I have many more interesting games I like to play. Plus, since I am into COD and BF on the xBox, these types of games have a lot to live up to on PC..\n\nI enjoyed the game! (Can't remember what it cost). I had the game downloaded for some time I think, before I actually got  round to playing it.. It's not the usual type of game I get for PC - usually I only like to play first person shooters on console.. Just so you know where I'm coming from..\n\nI still have a SOD to play (State Of Decay) If you are wondering why people buy games and then don't play them. (That's me)! Three games of SOD - but only played two of them to date,,\n\nIf you liked my review and comment - THUMBS up YES my review!\n\nI read a lot of reviews, that are not actually reviews, but are where people are complaining about their game not running, or that they want their money back because the game is not worth it, without saying why..  That's not a review - and those comments should be sent to the game dev's support..\n\nThis is a review - I told you what my game experience is with this game and what I like about it and problems I had.. Happy?  So please click the YES / Like! Look for more review by me!","June 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

They've added a few extra features such as customisable weapons and additional consumables i.e. Claymores and Smoke Grenades. Whilst it is easier to just throw a couple bucks at this game to get some of the better, the level unlockable ones are good enough in most gunfights. The best way to think of this game is play it as a poor mans Battlefield where most things will cost you money or will take a long ♥♥♥ time to unlock.\nIs it worth downloading and playing? Yes. Is it worth spending money on? No, not unless you wish to grind countless hours like I did with the original.\n\n6/10 would be a fair verdict.

My favorite so far has been the MP5, due to it's longer range capabilities, while still having medium - close combat range due to hipfire and low zoom scope.\n\nThe ingame currency I am not sure how I feel about. I understand it is a free to play game, but I really don't know how I feel about someone paying for currency to immediately unlock the strongest rifle in the game. The one thing that counters this is the fact that basically all weapons ARE very balanced, so technically someone having a later weapon wouldn't matter since it's balanced, and can be unlocked through levels.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am now 10 hours in and have purchased the gun "Vortex S". I can now officially state my opinion on the premium guns. In all honesty, yes they are better in some scenarios. The reason being attachments. The red dot sight, for me, helps a ton, yet the guns are still balanced. The only difference on other guns is maybe a suppressor, which still is loud enough to hear. In general, I do not think this is pay to win AT ALL. I think it is actually the most balanced Free to Play FPS I've ever played.","June 1, 2015","true","110.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Hopefuly this is an easy fix and in the next update this gets fixed.\n\nTank/APC spawning: There needs to be a timer when a vehical is spawned because if i spawned a APC after someone spawned another one we are both glitched in eachother and its random but one of us will end up half under the ground unable to move. From what i know the only way to fix that is to respawn the vehical.\n\nDriving: Im able to stop instantly making me able to stablize and fire almost as soon as i stop. When driving over some barriars there can be a glitch like the spawning one where half your vehical is under the ground unable to move. Sometimes it will blow up as soon as you exit and other times it wont but this is a huge issue thats bugging me since it happends a few times a game.\n\nFlying: So far aircraft have no use other then a reason to jump out and parachute down. In an APC im able to shoot someone down as soon as they leave and since helicopters have no offencive armaments they can easily be shot down if the pilot does not eject. I know more will be added but again air vehicals are not worth it yet it will either get you killed or you will have to bail out and again die from an APC.\n\nStamina: You can infinatly run without having to stop. This is one thing i wish to see added as soon as posible since this does get annoying.\n\nMost of the issues are with vehicals but at this current state all i can say is i cannot recommend the game yet. Later on when a few more updates and patches come out it will be improved just its not there yet.","June 18, 2015","false","2.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This game is a good start up, but needs some serious work to become something bigger.\n\nPros:\n\n- A bunch of customization options\n- A good balance of graphics to appeal to a wide variety of computer setups\n- Vehicles that actually work\n- A good variety of maps and modes\n- A smooth, great feeling\n\nCons:\n\n- Wonky gun mechanics\n- HORRIBLE map balance, with teams having a big advantage on some over the other\n- Sound design is horrible\n- Class balance is whack\n- Needs polishing on a few bugs on controls and hit boxes on player models\n- While character customization is awesome, the weapon customization is zero to nothing\n\nVerdict:\n\nA very early game (Take a look at the title, "Early Access" geniuses), I would say is a good start up, though the game is held back by balance issues and even, a lack of players. I would say, try it out, and if it floats your boat, stay tuned for upcoming updates that Rocketeer Studios will put out that will make your experience even better. If you don't like this game, make sure to give them constructive feedback at their forums. I don't hate anyone more who say "I hate this game. This game sucks." And that's it.

Most of the players are terrible at the game, making it too easy to be fun.

It has quite a bit of potential, but me and my friend came across a bug: Me and him had the same # title of Kiev maps, but got logged into the "same" match and it was 2 totally different servers. But, it doesnt stop me from playing and getting new things. I'd like to see a higher player count on the bigger maps, more maps, and leaning instead of having to go in-and-out of 3rd person to check your corners.\n\nOverall, i'd give it a 8.5/10 because of the lack of maps.\nI do recommend this game, its definitly helped with my PC FPS skills a lot, and improved my console skills extensivley, coming from a console-geek. Some of the weapons need to be nerfed, like the AK-74, is kind of OP in my opinion, and you need to buff the FAMAS so far. This has won my heart so far for Mac Free-To-Play games...\n\n\n-Hawkmoon","June 7, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Take that into account when you play the game and if you review it.\n\nLets start with the cons:\n-Horribly unoptimised. It lags. The developers weren't kidding when they recommended an i7 for a processor. The game has a nasty habit of lagging, especially on a TDM server (very especially on the ship map, the rain doesn't help). Again, it's early access so I expect the devs are still working out the kinks.\n-Sub-standard graphics. Again, it's early access but even on medium the graphics it's fairly remienecent of a PS2 game. Also, it may be a bug; but on medium graphics the shaders are set to ultra by default. I had to manually tone the settings down.\n-Hit detection/weapons. Hit detection (to me anyway) does seem a little off. I could be firing at someone's head and they won't die, but if I get shot a couple of times in the leg, then I'm done for. Also, the weapons are definitely off. An AK47 should be a one hit kill to the head. Instead, it's more "spray and hope he dies"\n\nNow, onto the pros:\n-Tiny! This game is less than a gig. It's nearly THIRTEEN times smaller than CS:GO. Nearly SIX times smaller than CS: Source! It does show in places, but when you take the entire game into account then it's pretty amazing.\n-Versatile: There are a few game modes available for RC: Firestorm. There's the typical TDM fast paced action, the more intensive S&D mode and the huge, Battlefield-esque main mode. There's guranteed to be something for everyone here.\n-Fun. Without a doubt, this is a fun game.\n\nConclusion/ TL;DR:\nIt's buggy. It's glitchy. There's a metric tonne of Russians/Asians playing it. It isn't pretty. There's basically NO spawn protection in TDM. The weapons either feel like peashooters or nukes. The UI is pretty clunky, Matchmaking isn't great. You can't play if you're not signed in to Friends. HOWEVER. It's a fun game. It's got masses and masses and masses of potential.\nI recommend it, it's only 780 MB and cause it's in Early Access/Beta it'll hopefully get better and mature with time (unless they pull a DAYZ and stay in Early Access until the year 5183.","June 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Red Crucible back in the day was known for its tedious sound design, awful graphics and funny but annoying art. This is.. well its the same but with some nice graphical addtions.\nThe gameplay is smooth 'To a Degree' and the feel of the game is almost identical to Counter Strike. However, my major cutback on me giving this game 100% love is the system strain. It really does juice my custom build for what the game has to offer.\n\nOverall, Its a nice game and good for its price!

The game has alot of weapon, appearance and other awesome customisation which is a neat feature. Overall, the games pretty fun and the gunplays pretty enjoyable.

Fortunately, the  community is very active, and the developers are well aware of the state of the game and interacting, taking feedbacks from the playerbase. I have no doubt the major issues like graphics or whatever the negative nancies are talking about are going to be addressed.\n\nI've played RC2-RCF since 2010/11, and IMO, the game's allure is its simplicity. Simple enough for noobs to get used to, but still playable for more experienced FPS enthusiasts. After the "Great Balancing of 2014" the game has greatly trended towards a more skill-based game. Anybody claiming "waaaaah pay2win, credit card warrior waaaah" do not know what they're talking about. I've played with a T12 G3 and carried the team against Hellraisers, Reapers, and Groza-Ms...Don't get me wrong, premiums definitely offer an advantage, but not to the point where its impossible to beat them...not nearly.\n\nAside from addressing the current issues, RGS made big fanfare about BIG changes in the near future, like vehicles (and armor soft spots)...which will completely change the face of mech warfare in the game. This game is good now, and it will only get better. 8/10\n","May 30, 2015","true","680.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It's Early Access right now so hopefully some of the issues will get figured out before final release.\n\nThe gameplay is kind of fun but there are some definite problems that make it a bit annoying at times.\n\nOne thing I thought was annoying was how the run key isn't like a regular run key. When you hold run, you are forced to run forward. You can turn your mouse from side to side when running, but, you cannot strafe whatsoever. Also when running you can not pull up your gun at all. You have to stop to shoot, but even when stopping to shoot there is a split second where you still can't aim. This can be annoying when fighing\n\nI also had issues with shooting over crates. Maybe it was just me, but every time I would be behind a crate and my crosshairs above, and I have someone in my sights I can't seem to ever hit them, like maybe the bullet isn't making it over the box, I am not sure.\n\nThere are a ton of items & weapons in the game. When using items, you have to buy more because they each only seem to have one use. I loved using the airstrikes, that was fun stuff. Weapons seem to unlock as you level, or may be purchased. When they unlock however, they still need to be purchased (Although I don't know if they are cheaper this way..? maybe??)\n\nThe maps are a strange situation once again. You start on Kiev and can only access that map until you level up and unlock other maps. These other unlocked maps must also be purchased either in game money or real money. It's of a strange setup because I would think that it could split the playerbase somewhat. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWhen you level up in game, you earn gold and in game money (honor I think). When you complete a map I think you earn honor, but no gold. I made 2 levels when I was on, and got 15 gold each one. That's not really enough to get anything decent though.\n\nHere's my very first playthrough video if you want to check it out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6ZGkM7BRWJ0\n\nI would recommend this game because I did have fun playing. It's a bit clunky and the animations are a little basic, but it's still in Early Access and it is Free to Play so there is no loss if you don't like it. Give it a shot, why not :)\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

Do not judge without even playing for like 1 hour at least. If the game is on early acess its because its being worked on and constantly updating. RGS are working hard to make the game better and since the release, they already improved the game a lot by listening to players feedback and that's good for the community.\nAnother thing, the game hasn't only 1 map, don't worry it has 6 arenas and 1 coming soon, you guys can't unlock them but that must be some bug and i'm sure it will be fixed as soon as its possible.\nAnyway this game is a Free2Play and not Pay2Win so it worth to download it and give it a try!

It is somewhat reminiscent of the Battlefield games, but with fewer players, so basically like the console version. It is early access and shows potential for what it already has.\n\nThe vehicles are well designed and seem to be balanced. The guns seem fine and shouldn't need tweaking. What the game really needs to shine is a larger player-base and larger servers.\n\nHonestly, the fact that a game of this substance is free is pretty neat. The game is under a gigabyte in size but still has a lot of assets in it.\n\nTry the game out if your interested. It's around 795 MB, which shouldn't take long to download. The gameplay can be slow at times, but the maps are fun to roam around and you'll find enemies eventually.\n\n7/10 for its current early access state","June 18, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is very addicting, very simple, and very fun. There are 1 or 2 minor kinks, but overall, I have not seen many bugs. The game is paced well for the most part and matches are the perfect length. Guns feel nice, and work well. The community is ok, and I've only come across 2 hackers, and those were speedhacks. You unlock more weapons, maps, and character customization items with money earned in game, buying gold for real money, or just levelling up. This is a f2p game that runs well, and plays well. If you want to kill some time, I would defininetly recommend this game if you like shooters.

WHAT?" yes jumping. you dont jump to get on top of anything, jumping doesent increase your speed, the only thing anyone uses it for is to bunny hop around and dodge anyone who is shooting at you so you can then aim at them WHILE JUMPING and still maintain your accuracy even though your jumping. people also bunny hop around corners their camping to make them kill you instantly because you cant shoot back.\n\n3: last but not least is 3rd person. i know its cool and all but all anyone uses it for is corner camping. basically you third person look around a corner without actually exposing yourself around the corner and then you camp there. so if anyone comes through that corner, you will know they are coming and can pop out and kill them before they can react, which is a really cheap way to get kills. no one uses third person for anything exept that, so i think you should either nerf it so that you cant corner camp or just remove it all together.\n\nyou probobly understand the hip firing one but you are most likley strongly opposed to the removel of jumping or third person, but think about it. you cant jump to get ontop of ANYTHING nothing at all exept a few railings which you can easily go around. and third person may look cool but it just makes the game unfair. hope anyone who reads this gets what im saying.\n\nEDIT:\n\nwell it seems that they actually did the hipfire more accurate thing, exept now the game is about 90% pay 2 win. i would no longer reccomend this game. at all. $30 for a ♥♥♥♥ing burst fire assault rifle?

If you are a die hard FPS Shooter Player try it out. OR if you just want to try it out, TRY IT OUT. Thus, this is an Early Access game that is totally FREE (for the download), so just TRY IT OUT, IF YA DON'T LIKE IT THEN WAIT FOR A FUTURE UPDATE AND TRY IT AGAIN and so on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NFN_Raven/recommended/298240/","NFN_Raven","NFN_Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NFN_Raven/","28 products in account","First off, I've got more then 2K Hours invested into the game, but I play on the standalone and not this version, so trust me because I know what I'm talking about Mister Level 30 talking to you youngsters here.\n\nNow for those who's wondering if it's a Pay2Win, I'll be straight with you- no, it isn't, you can work towards getting a Premium Gun unlike other games, every 7 days you get a chance to win up to 100 coins, everyday you log in you get a reward a consumable, XPs or Honor Points. So if you're super lucky, you can earn up to 1,000 coins in about 10 weeks, or save up the 15 coins you earn each time you level up.\n\nWhy does a single premium cost about 20 bucks? because they don't want the game infested with premium users, for those who want a small advantage of not showing up on the radar and more ammo capacity you'd whip out your wallet and give them about 20 bucks, but the weapon from the Class Section is just as good, just about 10 bullet less and you show up on the radar, because I'll be honest with you guys, every weapon has a tracer, so it's already pretty balanced out, it's only a big advantage in a Search and Destroy match where you arm the bomb or defuse it, and people rarely play that match.\n\nNow if you're new and you're wondering where these 600 Honor Points weapon and armor are follow these steps carefully.\n\n1. in the menu area, click on Character.\n2. click on the UNLOCK button at the top, next to Inventory and Store.\n3. and there you have it, this is where you'd find your Weapons of all Classes: Assault, Support, Sniper, Demolition- they even have your Secondary and Melee as an option.\n4. this also where you unlock maps a.k.a "Arena"\n5. Appearence is the Armor, if you're wondering why you're dying so fast, it's because you need armor, me personally, don't get the helmet, get the armor, because every weapon is a one shot to the head, although the Developers have told me that Helmets are suppose to add to how much armor you have, but they're pretty useless in my opinion, so don't waste Honor Points (HP) on them.\n\nClick on Browse to open the servers and matches, at the top you can see 2 option Create and Browse, the Play button is an auto set up match.\n\nNow this is one of the tricky parts of the game, when you reach lvl 20 you're going to have to face players 2 tiers above you, this is NORMAL, every high ranked players have all been through this, if you're wondering why they do this I'll give you a few ideas why-\n\n1. Lack of Players.\n2. Most players rarely play Vehicle matches, they want to encourage gameplay in vehicle maps, which is why once you've hit lvl 20- I'll give you 2 options at this point, try to use demolition as a weapon, it's really hard to do but it's a ONE SHOT KILL, which is why the blast radius is very small, you have to have direct impact- or you play the vehicle maps, unlike infantry maps vehicle maps will stay the same, the tank deals the same damage, the Choppers do too, just about everything does.\n\nThings that are considered inappropriate and can result in short and PERMANENT bans are posing as Moderators, Cursing in the public chat, and HACKING, if you find hacks on this game report to the developers immediately, at http://community.rocketeergames.com/categories/bug-reports\n\nIf you find a hacker click on their profile copy their Gamer ID, (optional) record them or take screenshots, preferably recordings, report it the link above as well, this works for people who you see hacking or for people who are cursing or threatening you or making you feel uncomfortable, take a screenshot, the Developers and the community don't take kindly to them so rest assured they'll be dealt with- they have 2 warning one might be a 24 hour ban and a warning the second is Permanent.\n\nIn a hacker's situation it's a permanent ban no warning no nothing, it doesn't matter if they have payed money or not, hackers are hackers in the community and the Developer's eyes, we have morals, there are a lot of people who record hackers and are very regarded on the forums, bounty hunters in a way.\n\nThe game has evolve a lot in a year, there have been weapons, maps, and vehicles releases, we are now implementing a Achievement and Missions into the game, where you can earn up to 5K Honor points and 50 coins from doing them, though easy it takes a lot of time investments.\n\nNow if you're here and you're complaining about Graphics, yeah it isn't the greatest, but it's decent for a Free Game, if you want better you can spend your money elsewhere for it, it's a lot more then any other FPS facebook games you see out there, in the mass of CSGO wannabes this is a an okay game a lot like Battlefield.\n\nThe recoil has a pattern so it's easy to control, which is what makes it a fun and easy game, one that is simple and easy to pick up on, if you do good in any FPS games give it a try, if you don't like it you don't like it, everyone has their preferences, and that's respectable, most players quit because the game gets dule for them- which is why I recommend making friends on the forums not ingame, because you lose that connection since you aren't close, we are a family on the forum, we look out for one another- no one is bigger or better.\n\nIf you ever encounter any bugs, glitches, or issues with the game goto http://community.rocketeergames.com/categories/red-crucible-firestorm-beta-bugs\n\nBut if you ever need me, when no Moderators or Developers or responding I'll be glad to help, message me on the forums at\nhttp://community.rocketeergames.com/profile/Raven\n\nor Via Youtube (I prefer it if you messaged me on the forums, but if there are any technificulties you're welcome to use whichever media you prefer)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMuBl0zaRohQdNNr2hLAznQ\n\nI hope I have helped you, I've been going over a couple of these reviews and they aren't very descriptive or helpful, the way I see it- when giving criticism be sure to put things that can be improved on, otherwise they are just Spams, give real Opinions, not just 1 or 2 sentences based on how it was for you, that's all Folks if you stayed this long props, with that said, Peace ✌","December 30, 2015","true","17.1"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","14","29","4","2"

Fun gameplay and easy to learn controls\n2. Wide variety of unlockable guns going from small pistols to large Machine guns\n3. Decently sized mapsizes providing great vehicular battles.\n4. Game is fairly optimized at its current state and will run if you have the recommended settings\n5. pretty nice vehicle variety for its current state\n\nCons.\n\n1. The game is very buggy and sometimes your gun will shoot the barricade 2 Ft. below you instead of what your aiming for.\n2. The main menu is pretty buggy and sometimes its a hassle to navigate\n3. The desync on certain servers can be bad and you will get about 900 ping and you will be constantly kicked out of servers.\n4. The store tab is litterly just a bunch of overpowered pay 2 win weapons and if you want to play fair you have to go to unlockables and level up and get guns through that.\n5. you cannot edit your controls so your stuck with default but i'm sure that will change soon.\n6. There's no mic capability but i'm sure it will be implemented\n7. There's microtransactions everywhere and all the good guns will take you years to getv to unless you spend 20 of your hard earned dollars.\n\n\nOverall based on my 3 or more hours in-game i think its safe to say that i would rate it 7/10 in its current state and i would recommend checking it out if you have the time because its free so what could possibly go wrong besides you getting mad and THROUGING YOUR LAPTOP OUT YOUR WINDOW AND CRYING YOURSELF TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT GREAT DISHONOR TO YOUR FAMILY SO YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO SUICIDE on dayz after you get shot unconscious.\n\nWell make sure to tell me how you felt about this review and if you need me to ill change something because i dont like to come off as offensive.\n\n\nDevelopers if you read this id like to thank you for this wonderful game and ill be playing quite often and i hope to hear from you guys because i have a few comments and some bugs i would like to show you, i will be here to watch this game develop. Have a nice day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you,\nSigned, Bellaldarwish\nHave a good day","May 29, 2015","true","33.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","47","8","17","6","0"

Gameplay elements like vehicles are not that developed and it's pay2win (i dare you to deny that, the last assault rifle does way more damage than the m16 according to the stat bar)\n\nIn other games like battlefield, you can have a high damage gun but then it would have low accuracy or high recoil, however this is not the case in RC:FS. They are all buffed guns with direct upgrade stats\n\n-Very bad performance\n-Never adjust FOV\n-pay to win\n-tank acting weird when moving on a non-flat surface (i understand the game is on development)\n-Lots of grinding\n-only 3 mags for the m16? Wtf?\n-Lots of purchasable gadgets like airstrike, grenades, medkits and you have to pay for them for quite a price.\n-no full map and not so good UI (idk if you can put a full map up but i haven't discover it yet)\n-No PING display?

It would certainly be a hell of a lot more fun than what I have just played, there would probably be less bugs too.\n\nConclusion:\n11.5/10 would uninstall again. 600mb of pure dogshit, could have used the 5 minutes to masterbate instead.\n\nTL;DR: Cookie clicker but you have to buy all the cookies","May 31, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","6","13","9","0"

While it is a pay to win type of game you can still unlock items as you progress through the levels. The graphics are ok but a little dated. It kind of reminds me of Battlefield 2 in the graphics department. It runs smooth with no issues at all and I play it on a linux computer with AMD parts as we all know AMD drivers are terrible on Linux systems. I also have to say that I read a lot of negative reviews about this game, Glitches, full of hackers, hit box is off, etc... blah, blah, blah... I will say I have seen none of the issues others have had, if they in fact have had those issues. What I hate the most is people whining about all of these things when it is a free to play game. you gave it a try and didnt like it, move on and try something else.

All of the maps except autobahn and favela are terrible.  They are way to big for the amount of players that they allow.  The missions can be fun, but ussually take veery long to complete and   often do not save your progress on them when a match ends.","May 8","true","38.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I agree! And to further this, the toggle ADS in this game, has gottan my ♥♥♥ killed more times than I ever care to count. As such, I think that a toggle/hold preference would be a very nice feature to the game in the overall long term of it, as this will make combat far more fluid, and weapons(such as LMGs and Sniper Rifles) far more usable.\n\n2) Health Restoration\nNow, most shooters, have a way to restore health, however, RC:F does not. "But, yes it does!": you're probabaly rambling. No, no it doesn't. Wasting currency that is already a pain in the ♥♥♥ grind to earn for medkits, is in my oppion, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. Staying alive is a vital part of a shooter, and having a class that can deploy health, would vastly improove the game over all in things like TDM(exclude it in survival, or it'll never end), and conquest.\n\n3) Honour Droprates\nTheir ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Flat out. Maybe 30-60 for a match if you're top player for TDM and conquest, and MAYBE if you're lucky, 15-70 for winning a survival match. And to put this into perspective, the least a gun in the store costs, is 32,000. TO average the rate you'd need, you would have to play around nearly 10,000 matches to get what you need. I understand that it's probably like this because this was a facebook game taht's transitioning into a stand alone, but it's not okay to try and force the playbase to buy currency for anything of use. That kills a game fast, and it'll end up like certain other games(*cough* Warface, AVA, ect. *cough*). So I suggest to increase this substantialy. To around 150 for being top three on your team if you win, and 75 for top three for a lose. And in suvival perhaps 175 for winning, and reduce that by 25 for each place behind first you are(this being because Survival is far harder to win at).\n\n4) No Anti-Hack Currently\nAs far as I've seen there's no anti hack, and people can use hall-hacks, and aimbot to their delight, and not even have to hide it(I've seen alot of it in this games first week already on Steam) and when a hack starts playing pepole start leaving fast. I suggest you guys look into Valve Anti Cheat quickly, and a way to activaly weed out hacks who are hiding on your game.\n\n5) The Giant Graphic for Kills\nThat thing gets in the way alot for me. I often am fighting on the ground, kill a guy, and am killed from above, because the graphic blocks a pretty large portion og the upper screen.\n\nIf these things are implamented as a whole, I will be thrilled. but if things like 1,2,3,4 are implented at all, I'll be happy anyway, because it'll vastly improve overall enjoyablity of the game.\n\n\nMy current thoughts of the game, is that it's very fun, and very fast. Could use some optimizations, as FPS difference between Ultra and Lowest is about 4 frames on a number of machines me and friends have tested, which goes to say it's poorly optimized in many ways, nonetheless even on a toaster, you will easily get 19-34 FPS after the game finishes it's background downloading, which I'd like to say I'm not a fan of, the game should update before launching, and through steam so your ping doesn't spike, and your fps doesn't ♥♥♥♥ itself.\n\nAnyway, this conludes my rantish thoughts of this game! Hope you enjoyed reading, this has been BlueDarterz! GLHF and kick some ♥♥♥!!!","June 4, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

And trust me, there are some really intense moments in this game. And, even though i played this game for a mere hour i can safely say that this is one of the best indie shooters that i ever played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbang4g/recommended/298240/","mrbang4g","MrBANG4G","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbang4g/","","The ugly and the good...\n\nthe ugly:\n\n- buggy and unpolished in many ways... Some times you get kicked out from the match. Guns become invinsible. You shot the person but did no dmg. Price of the items of the store does not appear correctly and this has not been fixed for a long time. and so on.\n\n- spawn killing is common and they don't have a good solution for it. They added a system where you become invulnerable briefly after you spawn but simultaneously you cant deal dmg so nothing really changes. You just get to get out from your spawn a little further.\n\n- stupid "stacking" in match making. Ideally, you wud want players to join team 1 and team 2 in an alternating order so that the number of players in both teams are close to equal. Whats happening instead is that players can choose to join one team while there are barely any players in the other team, so whats left out is a 3 v 9 match... Very fair.\n\n- Once you reach lvl 20, you are matched against players that are lvl 20 to 35. The max tier for armors and dmg can be reached at lvl 28, which means until lvl 28 from lvl 20, you are constantly beaten up by players with higher tier gears. You also level up very slowely during this time period so you really have to grind it through until lvl 28. Btw, until lvl 20, the game is less competitive and there are far less players with premium weapons, so the game is less stressful until then.\n\n- Pricing is ridiculous for premium weapons. A typical price for a premium weapon is 15 dollars (and pretty much you have to pay real money if you want to buy one of them, even though theoretically you can buy them without real money)\n\n- Premium weapons and vehicles can be over powered, especially vehicles. A good examples is how this premium attack heli called KA52 Alligator can easily wipe out bronze, ground vehicles and currently there are no effective way to counter it except for using a KA52 Alligator. So if your team doesnt have the heli, your team is basically ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\n- there are no scores that counts assists so its either you kill or not. Pretty damn annoying time to time.\n\nThe good:\n\n- you can run this game on a potato\n\n- the soldiers make a silly voice when they die\n\n- you can still enjoy the game with bronze, unlockable weapons.\n\n- 7 maps where 3 of them are big, vehicle maps\n\n- although it will be difficult to purchase what you want due to the pricing, you can still buy clothes and stuff like that in the store to customize your character\n\n- you can leave the match anytime you want\n\n- you can switch between 1st POV and 3rd POV mode so you can intentionally use 3rd POV to scout enemies and do surprise mother ♥♥♥♥er!! when they come close to you.\n\n- variety of game modes so its hard to get bored\n\nOverall:\n\nCashgrab P2W FPS with variety of game modes, guns, vehicles and gears. And dont forget that org asm voice the soldiers make when they die.\n\n5/10","April 23","true","86.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

There are a ton of issues in RC:F and I would like to call them out, you see that there are only a few damn magazines for the gun am I right? And soldiers don't go to battle with just 2 freaking magazines right? Soldiers generally go to battle with around 4-6 magazines ok?\n\nThe HUD is really bad. The HUD is like the blind kids crying.\n\nIt's a ok game but then theres always bugs..And me and my friends found one. Oh jolly! maybe not too jolly. This has happened to me like about 8 times that the damn vehicle goes out of the world. And of course its DAMN ANNOYING\n\nHelp desk nearly does nothing and thats why its sh.it. Also we need more damn mods if this game is wanting to be hacker-free, But noo only little mods for LITTLE PERFORMANCE IN THE DAMN GAME, I've met a hacker before in a server but then as you know the other team is winning because of him (Speed hack and freaking infinite health and uses a damn machete). Now you know what hackers in the game are like. Also I've tried to kick the hacker but then the other team keeps pressing don't kick just because their team is winning. Hope in humanity?? I don't think that exists anymore.\n\nOnce I've seen the phrase in the loading screen : "Uses of hacks will result in a permanent ban" and as you know, the damn hacker I've met had no sh.it that happened to him. Good job Rocketeer!\n\nAlso don't you think the prices are a bit off? that's because THEY ARE. I mean like look at the Spetsnaz bundle as an example: 2000 COINS AND 200,000 HONOR POINTS. What do you think? OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY BAD DEAL.\n\nBuying coins cost too much, CAN'T EVEN BUY HONOR for peter's sake and almost all of us normal players are BROKE. Also did I mention that THERE ARE LIKE LITTERALLY ONLY LIKE 12 SERVERS??? AND ON A GOOD DAY AROUND 15??? Wowzers am I right?\n\nTrust me in this review. I played RED CRUCIBLE 2 for 3 years, I had to stop at 2015. And you maybe asking " Wait what does Red crucible 2 have any relation to RC:F THE ALMIGHT CHAMPION OF A PRETTY BAD F2P GAME!!!" Well the answer is pretty simple. RC2 WAS RCF BEFORE! AND RC2 WAS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. SURE IT HAD SOME ISSUES BUT THEN IT DID NOT HAVE A TON OF ISSUES LIKE RC:F.\n\nAlso Rocketeer can you be more thankful to the players to RC2 that also accepted RC:F? After I heard that RC2 was gonna go now I had cried for so long, but I accepted RC:F. After so long I keep playing this game just so I can hold back the memories of RC2. I mean the game is ok but then It's better to be better am I right? and I want that RC2 players can enter there name in a box where if you put your name in RC2 before you can get a good amount of RC2 in-game goodies. I had the Milestone before in my facebook account and also my kongregate account. I just hope that this game will be better soon.\n\nOverall the concept is nice, Performance is bad, Safety is really bad, Prices are the king of bad.\n\nHacker-free percentage: 22%\n\nHope Rocketeer will see this and accept this. Please find this helpful cause it really is.\nAnd I'll see you soon.","May 18","false","92.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I was able to charge into enemy terretory and only died when I ran out of pistol ammo, which is limited as all hell. One-two reloads in both the primary and secondary in a war game?
