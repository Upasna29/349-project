Everything works well enough so I recommend it.  In my own opinion, the main selling point is nostalgia.  It's fun for hopping into and playing for a few levels at a time for the simple, linear gameplay of the early days.\n\nIf you're looking for something that's going to push your boundaries and blow your mind in 2016 look elsewhere!","April 16","true","0.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

If you played this game when you were (much) younger and this will bring back memories, than by all means buy it.  By today's standards this is unplayable.","January 1","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Shoot enemies and collect items. Then find an old man and give one special item to him so you can progress to the next level. I didn't like the art style, but I liked the music.\n","March 10","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As platformers go, it's average.  But on PCs in the early 90s, it was pretty decent.  Granted, it definitely shows its age now, but it's still easily on par with Duke Nukem (the original side scroller version) in terms of basic play control.  It has a fairly good weapon upgrade system, and the Ad-Lib music is some of the best from the time.","May 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, points you get by collecting lemons around the level and your enemies are flying snails. Did i mention that this game runs at 12 fps on my r9 280x ?","May 29","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
