The first game in this franchise is Rush for Gold: California which is available for free from Microsoft's store. I would suggest that before you purchase Alaska, even at it's cheap price, that you give the free California game a play and then if you like it go ahead with purchasing this game.\n\nAINSLIE'S LITTLE PEARLS\n\nThis is a cute little task orientated game where you are out to help your family all the while improving the little town in Alaska. The drive to help keeps you wanting to complete the next task. I enjoyed sending the workers from one task to the next, discovering gold, scaring off the wildlife and meeting new people who help improve the town.  The graphics are quite basic, but add to the charm of the game. The interaction and game play mechanics are quite simple but this makes for ease of task completion and game progression.  I believe you could complete this game quite easily if you are a competent gamer, for a new gamer it is an easy starting point.  It is a game I will to back to as a fun little break or escape time.\n\nRush for Gold: Alaska is a charming little casual game that is suitable for all ages and audiences. It's perhaps a little too basic for experienced gamers but a good entry point for those new to video games.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 18","true","1.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

The cartoony-wild west graphics have been done really well. It plays very similarly to the Rescue series of games. I've enjoyed it so far the time I've spent. Later levels can seem to get frantic but It's a good cerebral experience.","March 8","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
