I play through the games and then 'read' them on my laptop as 'bed time' stories with the kids. The lack of dialogue encourages the kids to create their own description of the action. It's a treat to listen to them tell what they see as they see it through the eyes of children and not my tired old eyes.\n\nI have STEAM accounts for all three of the kids families so Iwill be buying this game three more times and it's well worth the money.\n\nI solved the four- card game to get the jack knife. That clever puzzle will really entertain the kids.\n\nAmanita Designs is one of my favorite studios so I hope they sell  million copies of this game so I can look forward to their next product. And take your time Amanita as the kids love to go through these games numerous times!\n\nEven if you don't have grand kids to share this game with GET IT!","March 24","true","6.6"," 885 of 893 people (99%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","99","885","893","68","46"

That game captured my imagination and left a very happy stamp in my mind. It was only many years later, when I found out about Machinarium and suddenly I realized it had to be the same developer, that I realized the game was in fact Samorost - that bizzare game I really liked.\n\nOne can only imagine how stoked I was when I found out Samorost 3 is coming out. 30 minutes of playing have already taken me back to those places of mystery I frequented as a child. It feels as if I am reliving my earliest years.\n\nSamorost 3 is 7 times more vibrant and beautiful, and mystical, than its incredible predecessors. It's filled with fantastic imagery, beautiful scenes, vibrant soundtrack, peculiar story, and original and unique mechanics.\n\nI just want to thank Amanita Design for their originality and loyalism to such a unique genre, in the ever changing environment - that is the video games scene in general. Thank you for such a creative and thought provoking world, and for such a fantastic, amazingly produced game.\n\nIf you liked Machinarium or played Samorost as a child like myself, or hell, just like games that see beyond the horizon, there is no reason you won't like Samorost 3, for it excels in what it does - portray a world the wildest of minds wouldn't be able to think of. I think the price is more than fair considering the amount of love this game got and how carefully and warmly it was handled by its developers. Thank you for a once in a life time experience.","March 24","true","3.0"," 319 of 338 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","319","338","17","12"

I mean, how could it go wrong? A new Samorost game? A full length one? AND with 2016 quality? Samorost and I go way back, as Samorost 2 was a huge part in my childhood, as strange as it may seem. My family and I used to sit all together trying to solve the puzzels, and back then, it was so much fun. When AD released Botanicula (which was awesome) and called it their last game, I was nearly heartbrocken. Samorost 3, not only announced the revival of Amanita Design (for me at least), but also a continuation of a nostalgic experience of mine... I could'nt ask for anything better from AD. Now, it may sound like I love this game because of it's predecessors, but It's not true by any stretch. Samorost 3 is a beautiful, simple enough game with a charm unlike I have never seen. I know some are reluctant to buy it due to it's cost, but believe me, it's highly worth it. I realy hope Amanita Design continues to thrive and produce those amazing experiences, and I truly believe they would finally get their well deserved recognition after Smorost 3.","March 29","true","18.0"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","34","35","2","2"

The best part of it all? Despite everything being so strange and utterly alien, the world makes sense and its easy to get a grasp on what's happening even after a single glance.\n\nWhat all of this results in is a world that's so creative, and so unique, that you can't help but continue exploring it in order to find out what bizarre creatures you're going to encounter next, maybe a group of lizards singing the opera, or maybe even a bunch of goblins from 'hell' dancing around while cooking their food, or perhaps even a couple of monkeys relaxing in a hot spring that's located at the bottom side of a fruit-shaped meteor.\n\nIn short, Samorost 3 is a lovingly crafted game that's filled with vibrant, beautiful locations and events so strange that they have managed to fully capture my imagination and leave me desperately longing for more.\n\nIf you're a fan of Machinarium or other similar point & clicks, and don't mind paying a bit of a premium, you will find that Samorost 3 is a fantastic adventure that's well worth experiencing.\n\nIf you're interested in a bit of a longer review, I welcome you to check out either the written version:\nhttp://www.gamesear.com/reviews/samorost-3-review-a-strange-new-world\nor the video I've done on the topic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJYj4eN5oKc","April 3","true","4.7"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","32","33","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhNooStudio/recommended/421120/","OhNooStudio","OhNoo Studio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhNooStudio/","317 products in account","Samorost is a beautiful synergy between artwork, animation and music. Especially music and sound effects adds familiar but unknown element to the game which make you feel almost at home -it's hard to describe it's better to understand it when you "experience" it by yourself. As for the story it fits well to the eco-friendly-spiritual world of samorost. Like I was mention before the music plays the main part of the game and its story because all creatures seems to have something like "sound souls" and it's fun to discover them by your trumpet which you have to find out where it came from by first place. So the promise at the beginning is quite simple but it gets complicated later on. The artwork was done by Adolf Lachman the same man known from his previous work -"Machinarium" which is enough recommendation. The graphics is absolutely brilliant! I love his rendering technique and his attachment to details. My favourite stage is lava like stage with little black creatures in it. I wish it could be more stages like this one! The animations are superb aswell. They are puppeteer type of animation but with a lot of complexity and variations and with all funny sound fx attached on -they are joy to watch. As for the puzzles they seems to be very "sound" focused and abstract oriented but they are fairly solvable. I had several mind blocks (especially with flower genetics) but with hint system builded on it's always helpfull to move on without being frustrated. I have finished the game and after the credits you can still collect missed achivments -great idea! All in all it's a great p'n'c game you should definitely play by yourself!","March 27","true","8.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

Everything about it. I really don't know how to explain it. The music and art style are so entertaining on their own, it feels like I'm looking at more of an artwork than a game. The gameplay is simple, but some of the puzzles can be very tricky to solve. I would definitely say this was worth th $20 it cost, however if you are looking for a longer game with more content, this might not be what you're looking for. It took me about 6 and a half hours total to complete this game, and that was with every single acheivment unlocked. Other than that, this game is basically perfect. My only issue was the lack of information about the controls for the menus and things like that, as there were no words, just pictures. But that's more of an issue for me than with the game.

When I finally played and finished it, it left me a tad bit dissapointed\n\nRight off the bat, I instantly fell in love with the presentation. Like Amanita Design's previous games, the world is weird and wonderful, with all of the vibrant colours and impressive locations. The world is constantly full of life and energy; often at times, I just stared out into the distance and saw weird creatures in the background and observing their behaviours, and each time doing so felt like observing strange animals in David Attenborough documentaries. It is not hard to fall in love with the off-beat world of Samorost 3. The atmosphere is pushed forward with the beautiful score by Tomas Dvorak, the same composer for the music from Samorost 2 and Machinarium. The sound design, much like Amanita design's previous entry, Botanicula, is very bizzare and maybe even out of place at times, but that made the world even more weird and charming. The presentation is definitely where Samorost 3 really shines.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you would expect from a point-click adventure game. You explore a world by clicking on where you want your little gnome character to go, and solving devilishly hard puzzles. The puzzles, while cool, can be a bit vague and frustrating at times. There is sometimes some tedious backtracking, such as when going back and forth lond distances in order to solve a complicated puzzle. The hint system isn't much of a help either; it looks very vague and even looks more like a complicated scientific calculation than a walkthrough, due to all of the arrows going in precievably random places and the fact they tell you exactly what to do in a very complicated order. There are collectables, which will involve your little character to find sound vibrations using your trusty golden trumpet, which is sometimes used in the main game. They are surprisingly fun and rewarding to collect, which would make for something fun to come back to after you finish the main game. Overall, I liked the gameplay, despite there being some nit-picks and flaws that are hard to ignore here and there.\n\nVERDICT:\nWhile Samorost 3 is one of Amanita Design's weaker games, Samorost 3 is still a unique, wacky, and gorgeous world that deserves to be experiences by puzzle lovers young and old.\n\nPROS:\n+ Amazing art and sound\n+ Beautiful Score\n+ Colourful and surreal\n+ Fun collectables\n\nCONS:\n- Can be frustating at times\n- Some backtracking\n- Poor hint system\n\n8.0/10\nIt would be better to get this game when it is on sale. Even so, I would still reccomend checking it out soon.","April 11","true","6.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Fantastic art and a beautiful soundtrack are used to present a simple yet interesting story in a very imaginative way. The puzzles feel like part of the story and strike just the right balance between being fairly straightforward and a few being a bit more challenging.\n\nIf you are a fan of Aminita Design you will not be disappointed. Each new release they refine their process and make the title even better than the last. If you are new to their games I recommend this game whole-heartedly.

Yay for poppy pod dream spaceships!\nBeautiful, deeply crafted mini worlds with no dialog or instructions. The play and story unfold solely with images and music. It takes far more skill to do this in a universally accessible way (and to me, a far more appealing method) than forcing an ill-fitting tutorial with badly done dialog into a poorly written base story.\nYou must find you own path. Piecing together the play, puzzles and charming underlying story as you go. Samorost 3 is a joy to slowly explore, listening to the inhabitants and music of each exquisite world, teasing out the path to the next. Then, going back and finding all the little things you missed the first time! Tons of achievement secrets and just for for fun interactions with flora, fauna - and fungus ♥!\nIf you find diffucluties there is a very creative hint system... Which even if you don't want to use it to initially solve the game, is worth looking at after. Just for the little window peek into the developement.","March 28","true","10.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It sounds strange, and it is, but it's the sort of whimsy and wonder that has filled the game from the first (free) flash title 13 year ago. You live on a mossy, chunk of wood that floats around through space, Samorost lives with his dog in a observatory and strange creatures and people inhabit all of the worlds you explore. Early in the game you build a space ship out of a bathtub, waterbottle, stool and giant mushroom; it's wonderful. Everything in the game is amazing to look at and figuring out how things work is a joy. Every screen is a piece of art.\n\nIf you've played other Amanita Design games (Machinarium/Botanicula) you'll feel right at home here, and if you're a fan of the previous Samorost titles you'll find the same charm and game design you've come to love and more in a larger, more detailed and elaborate title.","March 24","true","5.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The scenes are rich of phantasy in which always something more can be discovered. The game has a duration of 4-5h, maybe less if you are quick. But Samorost 3 invites the player to slow down, relax and discover, not least because of the fantastic soundtrack from Floex.

If you played Botanicula you'll notice that the structure is almost in the same style: misc. things to click and obtain collectibles, interesting sound design, and pretty (really pretty) things to look at. However this is the first Samorost game to have a completely explorable world, and once it ends, it doesn't fade to black or go back to the title screen. There's actually more to collect! I hope for future Amanita games they go this route since I love their blend of realism and photo manipulation. So beautiful. Ending on about 5 hours and still a tiny bit more to do, I can say this puts the series up to another level.","March 25","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The experience Amanita Design gained from making Machinarium and Botanicula is noticable right away. The interface is polished, the visual and sound design is incredible and there is a bigger focus on the plot this time, which is conveyed mainly through animated speech bubbles and enviromental details.\nThe puzzles are logical despite taking place on alien planets, sometimes with different laws of physics and a very different flora and fauna. They rarely get too hard or too easy, and in case one gets stuck there is a hint book, although I never used it so I do not know if it's any useful.\nCollecting all the secrets gives you some reason to continue playing after the credits, although you will probably already have found most of them during the main story. This is not the kind of game you replay several times, but since it's relatively short (I beat it in 7 hours), you can always return to it in the way you would to one of your favorite movies, if you can't wait for whatever Amanita is cooking up next.","April 6","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The artistic touch put into this is spectacular, the storyline is just fine for 5 hours of gameplay, slightly reminded me of The Neverhood, some of the puzzle mechanics were really similar to it as well, although the puzzles in The Neverhood are definitely not as intuitive as the ones in Samorost 3.

Traveling from one floating island or ‘planet’ to the next, you explore otherworldly places, interact, observe and solve puzzles to find your way further into the unknown of space.\n\nTechnically, Samorost 3 is as point & click as it gets, but to describe it as a point & click adventure game is somewhat misleading. Like Amanita Designs other minimalist games, Samorost 3 dispenses with many of the trappings usually associated with the genre. There’s no boatload of items to collect and carry around. As a matter of fact, you’ll rarely be carrying more than two items with you, one of them being a trumpet you’ll use throughout the game, both as a hearing aid and a musical device. There’s (almost) no backtracking, since most puzzles can be solved within a single screen. Neither are there complicated logics puzzles that will require a pen and paper to solve. You point at a thing, click, and something interesting and/or useful will happen.\n\nThe game's landscapes are where the minimalism ends. The planets you visit are fantastic, rich and colourful places, presented to you one screen at a time. The landscapes are mostly static pictures, but they are nevertheless full of motion, sounds and life, since every space in Samorost 3 appears as a living, bustling ecosystem inhabited by a multitude of creatures.\n\nExploring them is a joy. You click on creatures or objects, and observe what is going to happen as a result: bushes rustle and tremble, birds fly away, strange bug-crab hybrids retreat into their shells. All of this is animated with incredible care and accompanied by some of the most astounding sound effects I’ve ever come across in either a game or an animated film. The same is true for the game’s soundtrack created by Floex, which seems less like a thing apart than an integral part of this world; less background music than emanation. Creatures sing, sigh, whisper and mumble with gusto and oh-so charming whimsy. It’s as silly as it is heart-warming and beautiful.\n\nFull review at http://www.mashxtomuse.com/#!Samorost-3-Review/e7krf/57000c420cf2f28d5dd5b986","April 2","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a chill point and click adventure game about a tiny man in a white onesie as he plays with his new (and super jazztastic) horn. You travel through the vibrant and, quite frankly, gorgeous world solving puzzles and saving the world.\n\nthe first thing that hits you about this game is its art. The game is absolutely gorgeous. The fantastical aesthetic makes for a living world and each individual area builds its own personality out of the backgrounds. There's not much to say but that this game is one of the best looking games I've ever seen (especially the onesie. It's the best).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you're going to find that the game consists mostly of environmental puzzles with a few key items that can be pickd up and used. In other words, it's no Lucas Arts game where your inventory fills up. It tends more towards the Myst style, where you alter the environment to progress.\n\nSamorost 3 excells in letting the player discover the game. From the beginning, you know nothing about the tiny dude sporting a onesie and a horn except that he is very inquisitive (and a master jazz musician). Then, the game relys of the players own inquisitive nature to find the path forward. In other words, tiny dude's got good game design.\n\nAnd this is only scratching the surface. Samorost 3 also has amazing music and some really interesting puzzles. The first puzzle that I came across (the card game) was unique and truly a breath of fresh air after so many repetitive puzzle games. The puzzles also continued to be quite fun from then on.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Between it's beautiful art, chill aestethic, and some truly novel puzzles, Samorost 3 truly deserves the onesie that it contains. Because it is just so stylin'.","March 26","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So is Samorost 3, and this time it's a bit of a problem.\n\nTheir previous major games, "Machinarium" and "Botanicula," have fantastic puzzles, beautiful art, and charming gameplay.  Samorost 3 has charm and gorgeous art, but the puzzles are mostly guess-and-test.  There are a couple good ones in here, but most of them don't require much thought, and the remaining can't be solved logically, just trial and error.\n\nI had hoped they would make this game their biggest yet, and it might be, but it doesn't feel like it because there aren't enough interesting people to meet, fascinating puzzles to interact with, or unique places to explore compared to Botanicula and Machinarium.\n\nThis isn't a bad game.  There's so much good in here.  The side puzzles are fun, and seeing all the cute things the wildlife does when you poke it is fun, but instead of adding so many of these things, they should have made the main story longer, with more places to visit, more things to do, more people to meet, more steps to take to discover and resolve the story.  As is, the story is over much too soon, and it's too easy.\n\nIt looks like the team devoted most of their energy to the visuals and didn't think of as many interesting things for the player to do this time.","April 30","false","9.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

However, many of the puzzles are just a systematic trying of combinations, and it gets a little old after a while.  Overall, it's a good game, especially for me to play with my 4 and 6 year olds engaged, since it's not violent, but I rarely play without them due to the repetitive puzzle setup.  Giving it a thumbs down, but I'm really right in the middle on it.","March 28","false","7.4"," 16 of 107 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","16","107","2","0"

Then again the game gets pretty easy after you figure 1 or to things out so maybe it is better this way.\n\nI love this game and i am not a puzzle game guy nor have i played 1 or 2 .\n\nif i can give some advice without spoiling it is look at the trailer. you can see some interactions there that should make it clear what u can do in some cases with the environment you can click - don’t confuse this with your average puzzle in which u just need to click some stuff in a certain order for things to start working or happening.\n","March 30","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
