A working online mode, small character customizations with hats that you get from bosses and give you different bonuses, The Party Mode with a cute minigame that is kind of like Rocket League.\n\nAll of this however, is just a framework. CPS has the potential of having so much more stuff in it. More stadiums, more crazy weapons and character customization, more mini games that have party game potential....\n\nNow the important question: Would I recommend you to buy it at this early stage?\nI would say yes!\n\nIt is already super fun to beat the living hell out of everything that tries to stop you in your mission to streak around and it gets even better with a couple of friends (and probably a beer or two :D).\nDon't let yourself get fooled though! Despite of its more "cute" retro graphics style this game is extremely challenging and whether you play alone or team up with your friends, you're going to find yourself thinking about a plan and some tactics to survive long enough to finally go into the bossfight, without having every item used already and dying within the next hit.\n\nFor now CPS will probably give you around 15-20h of fun before you did and see everything.\n\nI'm going to keep this review updated when the development advances.","March 3","true","27.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

Hard to master." Lubiterum Games needs your help for the perfect Gameplay =3\n\nOpinionCrazy Pixel Streaker gives you a strong dose of Humor in pixel-style which I never meeted before.\nAnd if you don't like sports like football- here is no mercy.\nSo\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636446539","March 17","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'd like to see a shop of some sort added to buy upgrades / weapons.\n\n~ You can launch all your followers at once to cause damage. I feel like this would be more enjoyable if you had the option to launch them one at a time.","May 25","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've played this game both in single player mode and multiplayer. I can't even get past Guillermo on my own, but it's definitely much more intense and fun when playing multiplayer with friends. Also, I personally prefer playing on a TV with controllers rather than using mouse and keyboard :D\n\nSince it's an early access you can expect a few bugs here and there, but I've got a strong feeling that this game will be much more than it is by the time it's officially released ♥","March 13","true","1.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
