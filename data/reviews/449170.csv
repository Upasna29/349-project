Will she manage to restore everything and show the wrong to the Troll Queen?\n\nI must say that I've bought this game because I enjoyed the first one, the achievements are easy and there is trading cards, though they're not still dropping as not implemented yet. And there is no change in the gameplay for this one, so, don't mind my lazyness, I'll copy/paste that part from the first game review.\n\nLike for 12 Labours of Hercules, the main character isn't helping at all. In other words, it's the servants that are doing all the work. Gnomes Garden 2 is a casual time management game where you have workers that are gathering resources needed (food, wood, stone and crystals), building mines (for the stone and crystals), farms and windmills (for the food), workshop (for the wood), upgrading these for a better production and repairing routes and other objectives (like light a fire or activate portals). However, the servants can be helped by witches (needed for some objectives - they can restore trees, plant them, activate portals, make the trolls or the sleeping golems disappear, grow lilypads) and firemen (helping objective plants to grow or to scare the little monster that will incapacitate your witch or servant from doing their jobs for a few seconds). And you'll repeat that for 50 levels.\n\nHowever, there are temporary bonus, regenerating over time, that can be activated : run faster (your minions move faster), work faster (less time for the building to give the resources) and stop time (the timer is frozen for a limited time). And these are very handy if you want to reach the three stars. Indeed, you have a timer. If you go past a star, you're loosing it. The less time you spent, the more likely you'll keep three stars. And as it's an achievement, you're also motivated. Nothing is wrong to loose one or two in the first run, so that you can try different strategies for the level. However, keep in mind that sometimes, you need to manage tightly your resources: you may be lacking some of them when they're needed and can't advance anymore (example: no more stones for a hole in the road - the building that could have given you the resource is behind this hole and there is no other road to it - you're doomed to restart). One of the good points is that you're not limited in the tasks done by the servant, if you want to gather 3 woods and 2 foods, you can check them without restriction (compared to 12 Labours of Hercules where you couldn't indicate more than 3 tasks). Also, I found some improvement: the task that will be done is highlighted AND finally, the resplenishing for the bonus isn't no more affected by the use of another. On the downside, the timer bonus is now very slow to be full.\n\nHowever, I found the levels more easier than in Gnomes Garden, as I only restarted a couple of levels and not many of them. I don't know if it's because I was more aware of how the game worked or not, but well, I finished it much faster if I compare the time: 5,8h against 7,8h. Well, when trading cards will be available, my time will raise.\n\nAs you can see, the gameplay isn't hard per se, it's just a matter of being efficient and to make the right choices (no need to upgrade a building to the maximum if the current level is sufficient or to upgrade the house - I've made the majority of the levels with two workers only). However, you don't have any other characters that can help. It's just the minions, not even the princess is present in the level to do something.\n\nI found the graphics being more polished than in the first one. I don't know why but the map looked better, the presentation of the objectives were less harsh and I found the buildings and characters more alive. I don't know if it's a question of colors or a question of being used. However, the objectives in the bottom of the screen is still confusing, though now that I know of it, it seems less inconvenient than in the first game.\n\nThe soundtrack is also nice.\n\nBut while I preferred Gnomes Garden 2 to the first game, there is still the magic missing from 12 Labours of Hercules. The gameplay didn't improved at all apart for rebuilding a cable car and a statue of the king, the rest is the same as in Gnomes Garden. So, while I'm still recommending this game for any casual time management lover, I would advised you to wait for a real discount or for a bundle.","May 20","true","5.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

I've become addicted to time management games after playing Hercules and have combed steam inside out for all time management games I could find. I had run out of games when I saw that gnomes garden 2 was released. Oh the joy! I played gnomes garden 1 right after hercules and found it to be a good game I enjoyed.\n\nGnomes garden 2 has NO challange to it whatsoever, I found it to be SO easy I was falling asleep and just fiddeling around with no strategy what-so-ever and still had TONS of time left on the 3 stars. At that rate I don't even see the point of the timer or the stars, it just all feels like a 100% casual game for granny.\n\nIn addition to that a few maps in, a map to rebuild stonehenge came up. I was fuming. It is a 99%  carbon copy of a map from Gnomes garden 1. If I wanted to play the same maps with the exact same mission again I would just have replayed the first game, then at-least I'd be having fun because I might have to use some effort to beat the timer.\n\nI am sad that the game I thought I'd be sitting here playing all night feeding my adiction for time management litterally made me fall asleep. I may be addicted, but there are limits!\n\nFor anyone looking for other time management games, here's a little list of what you can find on steam:\n\n12 labours of Hercules\nGardens Inc.\nRoads of rome\nThe tiny tale 2\nNorthern tale\nBallad of Solar\nIsland tribe\nMOAI\nViking saga\nGnomes garden 1","May 20","false","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's a time management game and each level you are given various tasks to complete. You use your gnomes to clear structures, build buildings, upgrade them, and gather resources.\n\nThere seems to be about 50 levels just by looking at the map which span across 4 different worlds. The graphics and animations and really nice looking and the soundtrack is relaxing. I'd expect at least 5 hours of gameplay if you do all the levels. Probably more than that.\n\nIf you're into time management games, I hear a lot of people saying this is one of their favorites. If you've never played time management games before, I think this is a nice one to start with, it's a lot of fun and I would recommend it.\n\nI'm still not sure about the price. $4.49 (on sale at the moment) isn't that much and I think it's price fairly, but I think most of us are just spoiled by steam sales and getting games like skyrim and fallout for that price.","May 18","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
