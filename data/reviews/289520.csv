Actually, it has the potential to be one of its best installments. The key word being "potential".\nUnfortunately, I cannot possibly recommend buying it to anyone. After one month participating in the early access program, I logged 400+ hours playing and testing it. I posted several suggestions in the forum and took part in several other discussions posted by others. The developers gave us, non-russian speaking customers, almost ZERO feedback. All we got were sporadic monosyllabic posts about technical issues. They posted no information about patches and/or the work that was being done.\nThey pushed back the release date 5 days without warning us - let alone telling us why they did it. After these 5 days there was a cosmetic 10 meg patch and that was it. The product was out.\nAs it happens, the game they put in the market bears very little difference from the beta version I started playing one month ago. There are huge empty areas, very little or imprecise information about several quests, many balance issues, unclear tooltips, and possibly a number of minor/major bugs. In short, it is NOT a finished product. I expect (and hope) there will be future patches to change all this. But, unless you want to buy an unfinished product,  I would wait a few months to buy it on sale.","August 20, 2014","false","414.1"," 1,145 of 1,256 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","145","1","0","40"

It really is, gives almost as much enjoyment as previous iterations. So why the thumb down? Because there are issues which I'm not willing to see in future releases of this game, nor in any other games for that matter.\n\nThere are reviews saying that the developers completly ignored the community. I personally don't care if devs are listening to community or not, as long as they're good enough to release a consistent product. Which this is not. In far too many places it looks like the devs (level designers mostly) were thinking "ok, here's a draft of a level, I'll save it now and finish it some time closer to the deadline", and then never did.\nFirst catacombs are ridiculously lined with eggs along the corridors walls, just like someone would launch a level editor and made click, click, click, click to spray them in few minutes and voila! We have a level!\nOn Whitehill there was not enough will to do even that, it's just a barren land with a couple of enemies and badly aligned textures.\nAralan feels deserted even thought there's no reason for that in the story, it's an Elven mainland!\nMost other levels are ok, but from time to time you'll see things that strike you how someone couldn't be arsed to finish something on a decent level.\nYou don't release something in such a merry state, they should rather cut such unfinished content alltogether. Now it's like a lovely pie with a ball of poo on top instead of a cherry.\n\nThen there are bugs. Not game breaking ones (I haven't had even a single in-game crash), rather little or bigger annoyances. Like inability to have an aspect-ratio correct display with sharp graphics (everything gets soft-scaled with some blurry filter), unless you switch your monitor to game's native resolution (1680x1050) without scaling, which makes things look better (but still not perfect). Or crashes when you switch resolutions (had to edit the configuration file manually). Or crash on every exit. Or some badly working spells. Etc.\nThe point is that it's not that the devs ignore the community. They outright abandoned the product - there were practically no meaningful patches, and probably never will be.\n\nWhat annoys me most is that publisher is now probably sitting there scoffing "we released a 20% unfinished product and look how it sells! lets make the next one 60% unfinished, straight in the customers face hahaha!"\nAnd they will charge it 30 euro, with 60% of levels being deserted whitehill lined with eggs, provided that you'll get out of washed-out main menu without a crash, to be fixed with the next patch, which will never come. And we'll buy it.\n\nAnd that's why I thumb it down. To have the next King Bounty as well designed as The Legend, as bug-free as Crossworlds, and as rich as WotN.\n\nAs to what I liked: the overall story is fun, even though I don't empathise with evil scum (I'd rather be a hero). Some dialogues are ingenious, but some are childish (I guess there were several writers). There are no bosses (except the final enemy), which I never liked. There's some new beautifull music by Lind Erebros (he's a russian Paul Romero ;).\nAnd it's generally another King's Bounty, which is never enough.\n\nGo get it, and then thumb it down to let the devs/publishers know that they can do better.","November 11, 2014","false","98.4"," 171 of 190 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","171","190","6","1"

Apparently, the only tool at his disposal is a level editor, since Armored Princess, Crossroads and Warriors of the North have been pretty much the same game over and over again. Is it any wonder that Dark Side is no different? If you've played any of the previous titles mentioned, you know exactly what to expect from this game: There's just nothing new or fresh to it, everything looks and feels like you've seen and played it before - because you have. Almost 30 hours in, I just can't bring myself to continue playing. It's just so incredibly dull. Been there, done that. Yes, King's Bounty: The Legend was great. But with each installment, each failure to actually add something new and exciting, I liked the series less and less. What were small annoyances in The Legend (the chaotic quest log, the useless maps, the horrible path finding, the inflexible camera, the small battlefields or the down-time due to travelling and restocking) have  by now become major issues for me.\n\nPlease, 1C, set that sad little gnome free, hire some talented programmers and give us something really new for a change.

I don't know what happened here, but the quality control was completely lacking.\n\nAfter playing the first game in the series, I never hesitated to pick up the sequels on launch day. I could play these games forever. When Dark Side came out (and I had no idea it was in the works), there was a lot of negative sentiment and complaints of the game being bug ridden. I had faith in the developers, so I decided I would wait to pick it up until they had time to iron out the bugs. As the 4th (5th?) game in this series, I knew that the UI, combat systems, character development, were all very mature, so any bugs  in the game would have to be related to quests and items specific to this game, which is really just content.\n\nAfter some time went by, they dropped some big patches and a "Premium Edition" for the game, and it went on sale for a large discount. I figured this was the signal that it was time to give it a go, I was excited to have another chapter in the Kings Bounty universe to explore! The reality was a little different.\n\nThere is no Kings Bounty universe to explore here. The worlds filled with secrets, quests, and story wonder are completely absent. What you get are large maps, that are distinctly Kings Bounty areas, with pretty much nothing on them. Where you'd ordinarily have criss-crossing side quests, caches of items in every cranny, buried treasures, and a wicked gauntlet of enemy mobs to navigate, there was instead long hallways full of spider eggs, and nothing else, towns filled with houses with no residents. Guards with no dialogue. Gates that don't actually open. Dead ends with nothing in them. Large open rooms with not a single monster or treasure in them. I couldn't go on.\n\nTo me, it seems like the team that worked on the other games had little to no involvement with this game. They polished the engine and the map making tools to a degree that perhaps ANYONE could use them to make a Kings Bounty game, but that's not necessarily who SHOULD make a kings bounty game. This one feels like it was made by someone's nephew, who wanted to get some experience in the video game industry, and obviously nobody at the company ever played it, because I can't imagine that it would get the seal of approval from anyone involved in the previous games. It should be called "King's Bounty: Experimenting With the Map Maker".\n\nI hate to think that I now have to give conditional recommendations to the King's Bounty games. "Yes, try King's Bounty! Oh, except for Dark Side, that game sucks."  People don't respond to those kinds of recommendations, and if someone happens upon this series by chance and plays this game first, they certainly won't be coming back for more, and will instead miss out on the magic of the other games. That's sad. This game should not exist, and I'm sorry to have to say it.","October 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 96 of 106 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","96","106","0","1"

As a result, every fight plays out the same, and since you generally fight the same armies over and over, you wind up banging your head for hours playing the same fight with different permutations over and over.\nOnce it stops being expensive, it doesn't matter becuase the game becomes so easy (even on Impossible, the difficultly I played at) , the units are poorly balanced and while the game does its best to just overwhelm you with AI stack sizes it doesn't really matter, your armies still crush them due to abilities and stats.\nThe game is just too long, areas drag out and any novelty of being the bad guy is drained away as you get two pages of interesting story for every few hours of grinding fights.\nI've played every KB game since The Legend, and I appreciate the fresh take on the story that Dark SIde is trying to do, but it is unfortunate that the rest of the game didn't get that same fresh coat of paint.  I'm not opposed to playing games that take a long time to complete, but those games must make me change up my routine and present interesting strategy gaming play, which Dark Side does initially but fails to do as the game's systems scale out to larger numbers (in both stats and army size).\n\n\n\n","January 1, 2015","false","49.1"," 104 of 118 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","104","118","7","0"

Mainly it´s a bit of a fresh take storywise (and therefore also regarding your troops), since you don´t play another boring good guy hero, but finally you can help the forces of darkness, which are being overwhelmed by their enemies, the supposedly heroes. Poor orc babies are slaughtered by mean elves, century old vampires are cowardly destroyed by slimy vampire hunters and the beautiful demons are driven from their lava pools by ugly human paladins.\n\nSo far so good or rather dark, now what´s in it, beside a real refreshing background story?\n\nFirstly the engine is the same as in the other games of the series, so are many basic gameplay mechanisms. Therefore this game propably won´t appeal to people who are complaining about that KB series just repeats itself.\n\nAlso the "choosing" of your heroes race and class, is not as free as the marketing may claim. Basically you have your orc warrior, your Demoness "paladin" and your vampire sorcerer. Though they not only differentiate in their main skill tree, but also partly in story and even the companions you can get. So while you don´t have real free customization, the replayability is as good as never before imo.\n\nNaturally there are also new rage skills, new units (some are real new units, some are variations of existing ones, for example the human traitors), many new item sets etc. A handy new feature is your own "base", where you have an amount of dark basic troops and a teleportation ability, which eliminates some grinding and extra ways. Furthermore you can and have to improve the base, steadily opening new options.\n\nSince the game is still early access there are still some bugs in it, some unbalanced things and some quests which lack proper description (but knowing the series, maybe the last part will stay that way ;) ). Overall though i had a quite good and stable experience in my 30+ hours.\n\nConclusio: for fans of the series and/or for fans of a bit more dark (but extremly funny imo) scenario this game is a clear recommendation, for critics who want something totally new, this won´t be it.","June 4, 2014","true","72.9"," 143 of 189 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","143","189","2","9"

If you take the plot seriously you're playing the wrong game.  However, the quests are also sometimes buggy and often ambiguous to the point where you'll probably have to consolt Google to know what to do next, which is not OK -- but not fatally so.  That's because the quests are merely an awkward contrivance to get you from one battle to the next -- which is where the game really shines.\n\nAs with each new game in the series, the basic combat engine is the same, with a handful of minor new mechanics for new spells and monsters thrown in.  You also get a new "companion" that provides a suite of new special abilities in combat.  In King's Bounty:Warriors of the North you got Valkyries; in Dark Side you get... well I'm not quite sure what it is, some kind of demon, I think.  As usual the new abilities are a mixed bag: some you'll use every combat, some you'll probably only use a couple times to see what they do and then file them away.\n\nThe thing that makes the game fun is the variety of units and spells you can use in combat.  After a few introductory campaigns, you can switch your army's "build" pretty easily at any time, which allows you to do all kinds of experiments with different tactics.  Over the course of my game, I went from an army built around a couple of super-strong core units (dragons), to one compsed almost entirely of undead melee units, to one focused on plastering the enemy from afar with ranged units.\n\nPlus, there is huge variety of spells that can supplement or even become the focus of your tactical strategy.  Pump up the Hypnosis spell to its maximum level and use it in conjunction with your companion's Jealousy ability to turn your emeny's army against itself.  Spam the Call of Nature spell to overwhelm your enemy with a horde of summoned animals.  Make your own army effectively immortal by casting Resurrection every turn.  Or just lay into the bad guys with good old fashioned Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.  Those are just a few of the many strategies I've used with success.\n\nThe spell and unit animations are more or less the same from previous games in the franchise, but that's not a bad thing since they are, as far as I know, the state of the art.  The same can be said of the whole game, really: there's nothing new here, but until something new does come along, King's Bounty remains the best turn-based tactical combat game around.","October 8, 2014","true","247.8"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","66","86","2","0"

Why u ask? Well, as strange as it might sound, because it got released! When i was playing the early acces I obviously had fun playing the game and when I stumbled upon some bug or ballance issue I would just shrug and say "beta"to myself, the hope of a future patch was always there. Can't do that anymore. Then came the forums (mostly lurking), being very familiar with beta-testing (mostly non-steam) I always try to read the forums to prepare for bugs and so that when I see a bug I know if I should post it or if it's already known to the devs. This imo came to be the biggest source of anger for all us early acces players: 0 Communication (honestly the first post I saw by a dev was about snowwhite, during the release). It sounds silly but it really annoyed me, the methaphorical straw that broke my back I guess. Haven't played since.\n\nSo in conclusion the feedback/patches/communication were so badly done that even though they were imho the game's only flaw (love KB) it was enough to turn away a fan of the series since the beginning.\n\nHopefully this gives slightly more insight in the angry old posts and drama for the potential new players.

It takes ages to finish, which is usually a good thing. However, in this case it takes ages because you have to run around from one island to the other...again and again.\n\nA typicall quests looks like:\n\n"Hello evil vampire, I would like to cooperate with you, but first you got to fetch me the following three items and kill 3 enemy heroes".\nOff you go, often to a different island, where you have been before and where there is nothing left to do, just to talk to some NPC that gives you the desired item. Then you have to return to your quest giver. And you do this over and over again... walking...walking...walking...walking.\n\nThe quest log is horrible as well. It does not tell you what to do in many cases. So, if you didn't read the quest text carefully, you need to look it up on the internet. Otherwise, there is no way to re-read the quest text.\n\nOh, and the fights are very repetitive and unbalaced (nothing too unexpected, if you played the first two KB games. But this one felt even worse).\nOn the first island, the difficulty seems alright, then it becames very difficult suddenly (could be because I played the mage class). After the first few islands it then becomes too easy. All enemy groups classified as "deadly" or "invincible" are a joke. You just use your call nature spell to summon animals that did ~55.000 damage at the end of the game.\n\nTo sum it up, don't buy this game, unless you like getting frustrated.","November 22, 2014","false","78.9"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","55","73","3","0"

I'm expecting a new patch soon, and hopefully the Mac faithful get a better game. Because this game is super fun.\n\nI was mystified to read some reviewers thought it the worst in the series (or maybe the "weakest"). That's not my impression at all. I think they stepped up their game significantly w/ the writing, quests, and overall sense of humor. Also, for those of you tired of playing the same old standby human and dragon units, this is the game for you. You can of course over time get a significant medley of old favorites, but I would recommend trying to stay close to the thematic choices that fit the 3 PCs: Mage (Vampire) > Undead units; Paladin (Demoness) > Demon units; Warrior (Orc) > well you get the idea. I've only played as the Mage, but I suspect I won't feel differently after playing the next 2 PCs.\n\nMore than past games, you really should have a pad of notepaper, and keep notes on where NPCs are, what they are selling, etc. A lot of times, the main clues for a quest are in dialogue only, so pay attention!\n\nThere is a massive amount of bang for the very modest buck you pay out (I'd go for the Premium Edition for the 2 new islands, 1 of which has a cool new unit). I spent a ridiculous amount of time on just 1 playthrough, and I plan on 2 more to come.\n\nThere is one particular new unit that is one of my all-time favorites: the Dragon Rider. They cost a fortune and are hard to get initially, but--at least for a small army game like the Mage/Vampire has--they were a huge part of my success mid-late game.\n\nThere are minor criticisms I might have, but that's all they are--minor. If anyone cares what I think, here they are:\n1) while underground "realms" get maps, dungeons don't; that should be an easy fix going forward in the series;\n2) changing the camera's perspective can be a minor pain, sometimes having to poke your horse into a wall and swivel around just to see from a different perspective;\n3) the "bleed" damage is OP in this game. All it takes is some puny archer to hit your Black Knight stack and all of a sudden you're losing numbers of them from what should have been a minor wound;\n4) on a similar note, I wish they would calculate damage/status effects a tad bit more "realistically"--for example, it's great that Ents take double fire damage, but why should any of the undead units take "bleed" damage? Silly.\n\nDon't get discouraged in the early game when you seem limited in troop recruitment etc. Once the game opens up (i.e., other islands and realms), you'll soon have a dizzying number of potential quests.

I'm a huge fan of the King's Bounty series but I feel like 1C is just dicking us around at this point. They're releasing a bug-riddled, rehashed, mostly re-appropriated-content game. I don't mind paying for a new 'campaign' essentially since the engine is the same for the most part and they carry over most of the same units, but this is really just a case of relabeling a bunch of units and calling it a day.\n\nIf you're an absolute completist, the game isn't unplayable. You should prepare to spend most of your time running around trying to figure out where you're supposed to be going, though, since the quest log is almost useless and you have to guess most of the time where the quests or story wants you to go. Most of the land is pretty lazily designed and doesn't flow that well. There are re-used maps aplenty.\n\nUltimately, I just don't know if I can keep playing these half-baked games. They have such a solid engine to begin with, they could probably just let some users come up with new stuff for them and release that, but I guess they just really have no intention of caring about these releases. Such a sad fate for such a promising initial entry.","April 13, 2015","false","147.8"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","41","53","3","3"

Unfortunately, the King's Bounty series has stagnated.  They started out with a solid game, but successive iterations haven't really improved upon the original.  I only own this game because it was included with a bundle and I'm unlikely to purchase any further King's Bounty games or replay the ones I own.\n\nThe combat in this game remains among the best of any strategy game I've ever played but the questing is miserable.  Although the developers have thankfully taken the time to include the origin of each quest in the quest log, most quests in the log don't explicitly state where to go for each step (not where on the current map, or even which map).  And in terms of content, almost all of the quests are simple fetch quests that require slowly shuffling back and forth between a few locations many times or collect quests that often devolve into a pixel hunt.  Even with a flying mount and the new teleport mechanic, constantly running trivial errands is very boring indeed.\n\nI feel like having some good voice acting might help ratchet up the fun-factor with some injections of character, but the quests in Dark Side are again text-driven.  The fun-factor is also hindered by some serious flaws with the underlying quest engine:  collect quests generally don't mark items as critical, leaving it possible to consume or destroy quest-sensitive items, quests frequently have hidden interdependencies making whatever quest you're currently on fail to update without feedback, etc.  It is shockingly easy to find oneself with quests that are impossible to finish without restarting the game anew, but who wants to replay 80 hours just to deliver some thorn spores?  Maybe a well-documented script console and/or comprehensive wiki pages from the developer would help here.\n\nI think that my favorite KB is Crossworlds.  On reflection, I think that the simple arena-style quest progression is what makes it so much better.  Combat and army-building are the focus points and uninspired questing is greatly abbreviated.  In contrast, I feel compelled to arm myself with pen and paper prior to sitting down with Dark Side and I hate having to do so.  1C must evolve or perish.","January 15, 2015","true","25.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","1"

It's running on my desktop and laptop. Cloud sync isn't working so I'm manually copying save folders.\nSo far, it's running as it's own standalone story without wading through the same game again.\nThe graphics are bright and flashy, so my desktop is lagging but I haven't had any crashes like I had with fighting Loki in WotN and with Advisors in Ice and Fire. I'm concurrently playing Ice and Fire and haven't had any Advisor crashes today. A coincidence or unexpected fix?\nI'm only at level 2 playing a Demoness at Normal but I've already encountered new spells and units and I'm looking forward to more. I haven't found a Manual or Guide, so it's been learning by trial and error. Maybe it's too early in the release cycle to expect one.\nThey've also continued the vein of humor found in the newer releases. Nothing stupid, just enough to give anyone so inclined, like myself, the opportunity to appreciate it. I've wondered if it was just the translators doing it, but aside from the Snow Black visual pun in the logo, I've found an example early in the game itself.

It feels incomplete - not because there is missing content (although, there might be after the point I stopped playing), but it just feels like the developers cared less and less as you progress through the story. The plot is pretty barebones from the start, but 22 hours into the game, I am literally running around gathering x for y for no good reason.\n\nIt's not so much that the quests are generic either (although they are). Rather, how random everything is. Often, I got some vague text like "you should find someone who knows X", without any other useful clues. I had to resort to randomly running around checking every nook and cranny of each (relatively large) world. Just Google "King's Bounty: Dark Side, where is..." The forums are filled with people getting stuck because there is no relationship between the content of some of the quests, and the things you need to do to solve it. Furthermore, the game feels "padded". There are quests that, upon completion, "humorously" reveal to you that you need to do more nonsense to complete them. That got old fast. If anything, you feel tricked.\n\nWhat's good? Sadly, the things I enjoyed about the game only made me feel more disappointed because of the amount of potential wasted. The combat mecanics are of the classic similar-to-Heroes-of-Might-and-Magic persuasion. If you're into that sort of thing, it can be fun running around collecting troops for your expanding army. It can also get boring really quickly when weak enemies constantly overestimate their strength and charge at you, wasting your time. There are times where the game is genuinely funny, but those are few and far between. Most of the time, it just reads like amateurish writing.\n\nI will admit I bought the game off the hype. I looked at the picture of Snow White, read about "Light and Dark", and though "Oh, cool, this will be a game about how members of the fairy tale community take sides, and wage war on each other". I found myself hunting for ♥♥♥♥ing dwarves on the behest of that stupid woman, only to have her disappear when I had killed them all.","August 30, 2014","false","21.8"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","1"

After 110 hours, I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nDark Side has some minor drawbacks -- unmarked quest items are too easy to sell/discard, quest dialogues don't appear unless you've solved the NPC's previous requests -- but in general I think this is the best of the KB titles. It solves the single most annoying thing about the previous games, the constant need to backtrack to previous realms/islands to replenish lost trooops. A teleportation system in this one makes travel a snap and there's a virtually endless supply of troops.\n\nThe scenery is the prettiest of all the KB games, and the game's a visual delight once you learn to fly. The game's major conceit works well: You're playing as the bad guy. Yet as the story unfolds, you quickly end up believing you're on the right side of things.

The combat in this section of the game also suffers, whereas in other entries of the series you’d get your companion early, and unlock the extra battle functions, in Dark Side you’re on your own, the most fun and inventive part of the combat locked away as you drudge through the battles, trying to make your way to the start of the main quest proper.

This is as good as the King’s Bounty series gets, in a fresh new skin and from the point of view of the “bad guys.”\n\nIf you’ve played the series before you’ll know what to expect, and if you haven’t, and you manage to drag yourself through the games opening, you’re in for a treat.\n\nMy favorite in the series so far.","June 27, 2015","true","17.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/recommended/289520/","MonikaWeiss","Monika "I.Q." Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","King's Bounty: Dark Side is the third sequel for King's Bounty: The Legend, which was released in 2008.  Like all of the other sequels, the engine for Dark Side remains basically the same.  Rage skills have changed, companions work differently, and there are a handful of new items and units, but everything else is all but identical, and so if you're familiar with the franchise, then playing Dark Side is likely to give you a strong case of déjà vu - which might be good or bad depending on how much you liked the original game.  I think the King's Bounty games have a winning formula, but after spending something like 500 hours with the franchise, I'm to the point where I'd rather see something new rather than a rearrangement of what's come before.\nThe good news is that at least thematically, Dark Side is different than its predecessors.  You play a "dark" character - either an orc (warrior), demoness (paladin), or vampire (mage) - and unlike some other recent games (like Blackguards) that have purported to have you playing some sort of bad guy, in Dark Side you're not just misunderstood; you're straight up evil.  You want to wipe out the "light" using any means necessary, and you don't shy away from kidnapping, torture, and deceit.  This was a nice change of pace for me.  I rarely play bad guys in games, and I hadn't used a lot of orcs, demons or undead in the King's Bounty games previously.\nIf you're not familiar with King's Bounty, let me give you a short summary.  You control a hero with an army.  Your army consists of five stacks of creatures, where the size of the stack depends on your leadership statistic and the power of the creature.  You explore maps in real time and without any competition, and then when you encounter an enemy army, the game shifts to a turn-based mode so you can duke it out.  During each round of combat, the stacks receive a single turn where they can move and attack, and your hero can cast a spell (which costs mana) and use a rage skill (which costs rage).  Battles earn you experience and levels, which reward you with leadership points and runes to spend on your skills.  Along with the battles, you also meet NPCs during your travels, and they give you quests, so you often have a reason for the battles other than just grinding up your hero.  If you like small scale battles, then the King's Bounty games are great, because there are just so many ways you can put together an army and build your character, that you can tailor the game to your playing style regardless of what it is.\nEarly on in Dark Side, you're evicted from your home by the forces of light, and that sets in motion your need for revenge.  Nicely, the beginning of the campaign changes depending on the race you're playing.  Each race starts out on its own map and has different units available, but eventually the storylines merge and the three heroes meet each other, at which point your hero takes over and the campaign plays out about the same, albeit with a large dose of randomness about how powerful enemy armies are and what spells and equipment you find.  Normally I'd say that differences like this give a campaign lots of replay value, but it took me over 150 hours to complete Dark Side, and so you'd really have to like the game to want to play it through multiple times.\nFor me, the best thing about Dark Side is its difficulty.  When I played Warriors of the North (the previous sequel) as a paladin, it was so easy that it was dull.  But in Dark Side the battles are much tougher - playing as a vampire mage, almost every enemy army was rated as "deadly" or "invincible" - and the game is so chincy with spells and crystals (which are needed for learning and upgrading spells) that I had an extremely limited spellbook throughout.  Early in the game I was stuck with Poison Skull (which poisons enemies) and Flaming Arrow (which sets enemies on fire) as my only two useful spells, and it was all but impossible to finish battles with no losses.  Later, you find more shops and things open up a little, and you're also allowed to recruit any dark creatures you want, but even so the battles never get so easy as to be boring.  In fact, Dark Side has achievements for finishing battles without using spells or rage skills, but I wasn't able to earn either one because for an overwhelming number of battles I needed all the firepower I could bring to bear.\nOf course, Dark Side also has some problems.  None of the King's Bounty games have been pillars of spelling, grammar, or punctuation, and sometimes this makes it difficult to tell if the developers are trying to be funny or if something else is going on.  For example, the campaign references locations named Loserania and Bear Butte, and you learn that vampires come from Portland (which is strange because I thought they came from Corvallis).  Are these jokes or just a case of indifferent translation?  The game also has a few crash bugs associated with its new units and spells (especially the Last Stand spell), there are a few quests that can't be completed, there are many empty buildings sprinkled throughout the world making some of the maps feel unfinished, and the quest journal isn't nearly helpful enough, often not telling you who you need to talk to or where you need to go, which is a problem because there are a ton of quests (at one point I counted and found I had 42 open at once), and it's difficult to remember the details about them without assistance.\nBut overall, I enjoyed my time with King's Bounty: Dark Side.  It was fun playing an evil character and kidnapping princesses instead of rescuing them, and because Dark Side includes all of the units from all of the King's Bounty games, it has a tremendous amount of variety, and it does a nice job of presenting you with lots of challenging battles without making them too repetitive.  That being said, all of the King's Bounty games are something of a grind.  You have to enjoy fighting battles just for the sake of fighting battles.  But if you don't mind that, then Dark Side is a good value at its $25 price tag, even with its well-worn engine.","May 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","0"

Specifically the sound is very buggy, especially during battles and the ending is incredibly disappointing and short considering the source material and the length of the game itself.  Some missions are also bugged, with locators randomly either not showing up or refusing to go away for the rest of the game.\n\nCollision detection is nightmarish, and the maps often have some points(especially bridges) where the pathfinding simply collapses. You can use this to your advantage when being pursued by monsters(if you don't get stuck), but since you can FLY and monsters can't that's almost never a problem. Since you'll find the majority of the power-ups in the overworld maps anyway, it's entirely possible to avoid most of the combat until your leadership, spells and war chest are so inflated from kiting that you can seriously stomp the game regardless of difficulty.\n\nThis game more than any other in the series has way too many step and fetchit quests, which eat up time and money in game by making you run around all over the place for seemingly little more than to pad the gameplay. Seriously, often you're revisiting areas that you depopulated of all opposition forever ago. In it's favor though it does include a ready means of teleportation between the lands, which you're going to use and overuse a lot.\n\nThe plot is, like most of these games, insanely stupid and funny and not very serious.\n\nClasses are the standard fare for the series, with a warrior, mage, and paladin archetype - except they're the orc, the vampire and the succubus. I went with the vamp for the first playthrough, the mage class is always good for being able to crush half the life out of an army before the first round even really gets underway. Crystals seem to be much rarer in this game, so choose to learn only the spells you know for a fact you will use a lot.\n\nSecond playthrough will be with the succubus, which I may or may not finish depending on if which character you choose changes the gameplay significantly. Past games in the series have avoided this, but since the classes are actually characters in this version one can hope...\n\nAt this point, the game engine needs a serious update. Navigation seems primitive now, it hasn't changed since the first game - right along with the ridiculously locked camera angles. The camera itself still seems to fight you even after almost a half-dozen games have been made.\n\nThis game should be able to be ported to tablets. No joke. The graphics are pretty badly dated at this point, it's time for an overhaul.\n\nAt least this game doesn't deprive you of your special abilities in boss fights, something that was always insanely pointless and unfair in previous entries, although the powers are significantly more limited.\n\nAll in all the series continues it's slow decline since Armored Princess. Some serious improvements need to be made and better production values need to be embraced. Still highly enjoyable and definitely worth the cash for all it's little flaws.","July 4, 2015","true","67.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I love being able to play the evil for a change and actually commit horrible deeds to warriors of the light. Its charm, however, starts to run really stale as soon as you reach the 10'ish hour mark. Fetch quests are among the abominations of poor game design. Yes, no 'RPG' is complete without them and I'll look that through the fingers, but here comes Dark Side, where a fetch quest can consist up to 10-15 stages, where the player is running / teleporting back and forwards, making it an _absolute waste of your time_\n\nIt's not just 'bad' in the sense that this happens, it's 'bad' because nearly every quest is like this!\nOn top of that, the quest log has to be the poorest excuse of a 'log' that I've ever seen, yes, even worse than the games before this. 90% of the time, you're wandering about aimlessly, looking for an object / npc / location, only to find out you actually had to go to the shelter. A good example? A quest said: 'talk to the acolyte'. Ok, which acolyte, there's quite a few of them? Turns out to be in the shelter. 2 steps down this questline, it says 'talk to <person name>' which is the acolyte... As I said before, this isn't just 1 quest, the whole game is riddled with this nonsense.\n\nThe difficulty curve is another big peeve of mine. In Warrior Princess and Warriors of the North, the curve was somewhat acceptable. In Dark Side, you either have a series of fights you can waltz over, only to get a tough as nails hero to fight against you, or you fight through tough as nails monster packs, only to waltz over a ♥♥♥♥ easy hero fight. There's no rhyme or reason and you find yourself going back and forth to your shelter every so often.\n\nI've enjoyed this game for the first 15-20 hours, then it became stale and I found myself just wanting to finish it as quickly as I could, hoping it'd get better.

Nope zip nadda nothing.  There is still empty areas and bugs (just try to pick up all of the spider eggs at the beggining I dare you!!)  The game is overly hard at the beggining but then it is too easy once you hit level 6 and can sneak into about 80% of the areas and collect everything you need.  You can be at level 14 without killing one group after you make it to Portland.  The randomness sucks as you pretty much get the same things everytime even in the same place.  Replayability is a joke and don't bother playing any race except for Demons.  They are the only ones that give you enough units early in the game and the only ones that can sacrifice so you NEVER have to purchase new troops again.  I hate to say it but I liked Warriors of the North better.  At least when you replayed you can more random items.  BTW I am currently at level 21 Vampire I can kill ANYTHING with my Phoenix and Snow Storm combo.  Gets reallly boring really fast.  I would not recommend until they actually release a new game instead of just spinning out the BEta with no changes.  They probably got enough money already and are working on the next release or a DLC for this one like they did for Warriors of The North.

This game builds upon those established formulas and offers a fun experience for those who enjoyed that part of the ones that came before it.\n\nThe Bad.\nThe English localization is pretty bad. While very little of the dialogue is grammatically incorrect the phrasing and tone of many characters is awkward and confusing. Many conversations, especially those dealing with the evil nature of the player and their companions, come off as quite childish, almost like they were written by an 5 year old. Some of this may just be bad writing. It's hard to tell. Maybe they were aiming for dialogue that had a narmy charm to it? If so they fell slightly short.\n\nQuest objectives are often vague and the solutions can be non-intuitive. In multiple cases I scouring a region for half an hour trying to find an item before discovering that the item in question was located in another region found later in the game. The icons for Quest Giver, Quest Objective, and Complete Quest are very hard to distinguish and often seem to be used incorrectly.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend the game only to people who enjoyed the previous games primarily for the battles and exploration. If quests, plot, and dialogue matter significantly to you, you'll probably be happier spending your money on something else.","December 12, 2014","true","44.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Been playing it for about 5 hours today with no troubles. I think some of the areas are just not finished yet. I found a secret passage in a castle but couldn't go down the steps. There's also limited inventory in the shops and castles. Some castles don't have anything to start with but the one where I installed a new king did get inventory just not what I needed for my army.\n\nI'm getting the idea that the game will differ slightly depending on the character you're playing. I'm playing the Demoness right now and she just got her companion. I do find it frustrating that I don't find any demon units other than at the shelter. I lost a key unit during a fight with a dragon and have yet to find someplace where I can get more. Probably one of those things that hasn't been fully completed yet.\n\nI'm still pretty early in the game, though. Just headed to the third island. The only quest that really annoyed me is the one to deceive the castle guard on Monteville - or whatever the island name is, I dont' remember now.  Other than that, so far, so good.\n\nMy only other complaints are probably things that wil be addressed as the game get closer to being finished. One would be that some of the initial areas and underground areas don't have maps for consulting. Don't know if they're just not done yet or if there won't be any. Another would be that I have people in my inventory that I don't know what to do with yet. I like that I get to take prisoners, I would just like to know what to do with them.\n\nReally looking forward to seeing how the game will be completed and what extras will be there when its officially released. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a King's Bounty fan and was disappointed with Warrior's of the North. This one seems to be in better shape before completion than Warrior's of the North is even now.\n\n\nUpdate now that the game is officially released....\n\nI know people are disappointed that we didn't get a mega patch with the official release but that just tells me we've basically been playing the full game all along with early access. Yes, there's still some work left to do and I personally am hoping for additional DLC but as of the release, I still like this game. I've started completely over, looking for anything new. Nothing stands out so far.\n\nAnd yes, I do still recommend the game and I'm glad I got in on the early access so that I do have the extras in the premium version. However, the extras are only $5.00 more and if I hadn't gotten in on the early access, I would be willing to pay it. The extras are worth it in my opinion.\n\nLooking forward to what the devs have in store next.","June 14, 2014","true","229.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

They removed skills like artificer so you don't have to keep every crappy items till you reach like level 3 artificer and can just break any level items for crystals and runes.\n\nCons of this game\n-Still have crap tonnes of bugs and glitches that crashes the game\n-Even though units are easier to buy, you have to reach mid game ish for them to be easy to buy\n-Quest objectives are really vague so you don't have a clue most of the times so you have to look up guides\n-Story is terrible. It is a pro that you can play as evil side but it doesn't really feel like you are that evil. Most of your actions are justified because they made the "good" side way more evil than the actual "evil" side.\n-You are still someone's errand boy. This was an ongoing problem throughout the franchise but now it feels worse becuse you are supposed to be this evil protagonist but most of the times you are spoon feeding the NPCs with your money and some crappy random items that you normally sell or don't even bother to pick up.\n-Difficulty curve: I really don't care about no loss play on impossible or some random hardcore play like that so I played normal difficulty and tutorial bit of the game was ridiculously hard because of the limitations of units& skills I can use. After you get to mid game till the end, game is extremely easy. This is once again ongoing problem in the franchise but got really bad on this one.\n-Too many useless units for the effort required to get them: Some units are easy to get but useless but units like those clown things that shapeshift are way too hard to get for what they are.\n-No big boss fights till the end: Yup. And last boss is ♥♥♥♥ easy too. Makes game pretty repetitive since most enemies use same units in the same area most of the times.\n-Lizardman are gone. No more T-Rex\n\nSo basically if you can withstand all the glitchy gimmicky-ness, unfriendly quest log, repetetion don't really care about story, go ahead and buy this game. The actual game play for combat and tactics bit is kind of better than previous games because your rage skills are little more better for any class you chose and there are few more spells you can choose from.","February 24","false","44.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It looks more like they just threw together a bunch of half completed projects and map and called it a game.  It's not terrible but where Armored Princess was a great game, this feels incomplete, unpolished and average at best.\n\nA few things to add after playing longer... the balance is way off.  Everything I am running into is stronger than me.  You can still get through most fights but it costs a lot to replenish after each.  But thankfully that is easy to do since they give you a teleport minion that you can use to run away from anything stronger than you (on the map) and go to your shelter where you have a shop with unlimited minions for your class (3 shops, one for each class).\n\nBeyond this, BUGS BUGS BUGS. I don't know that I've ever played such a buggy game.  You never know if quests end because the icons above the houses are mostly all broken, some quests I have show as every step completed but they won't reward me and other quests I try to advance but they just don't move.\n\nThis game is not worth it, maybe when it'll be 3-5$ but do yourself a big favor, don't go paying anywhere near full price.","December 19, 2014","false","41.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

This is the fifth game in the Kings Bounty series, and\nI have found that for the most part, the game has remained unchanged from the\nfirst game.\n\nAs a turn based strategy game, you lead troops into battle as an Orc,\na Demoness, or a Vampire on your choice of difficulty.  Strategy and tactics\nare at this games core, with your decisions on what kind of troops you use, what\nclass you choose, and what spells you use influencing how well you do in the game.\nThe Orc (warrior) gives a bonus to Attack, the Vampire (mage) leans more heavily\non spells and spell power, and the Demoness (Leader) is the middle ground,\nrelying on both magic and numbers of troops.  Each unit or spell can synergize\nwith other units and spells, so you must be aware of what you are doing to excel.\nThere is a place for everything\n\nThis game series best and strongest feature is its combat.  It is highly\nenjoyable and satisfying.  The issue I had with the game was that it is too easy.\nWhile this game in the series starts out with a steeper learning curve in the\nbeginning, but it has the same problem as the other games;  mid to late game\nbattles are too easy with the gear provided and abilities earned.  It becomes\ntoo simplistic and redundant.  The difficulty level does not increase as your\ncharacters power increases.\n\nAs for the story;  it gets by, but is definitely not a strength to the\ngame.  In this particular game, you play as a dark side character, but spend the\nmajority of your time doing fetch and carry missions or reuniting lost loves;\nnothing that falls in line with the darkness of your character.  This story\nis the weakest one of all the series.\n\nGraphically the game has not changed at all from previous games.  Also,\nthe quest log hasn't changed from previous games-listing current and completed\nmissions on the same log, making it next to impossible to find a particular one.\nYou are bombarded with a multitude of quests that do not fall in line with the\ncharacter you represent.  As to level design, you unlock different islands as you\nprogress, but in contrast to previous games, they made the islands larger and more\ncomplicated, with convoluted roadways.  I don't play this game to enjoy the\nscenery between levels.  By complicating the level design, it becomes more\nannoying and doesn't respect the players time.  It slows the gameplay down in\na negative way.\n\nWhile the combat is good, it is unchanged from previous games in the\nseries.  Graphically it is the same, the aesthetic is the same, the level design\nhas only been made worse.  The story is a waste of time.  I cannot recommend\nthis game, and would point you to the Kings Bounty; Armored Princess game if\nyou are curious to try out this gamestyle.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","January 19, 2015","false","95.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

New game is somewhat 'smarter', enemies much intelligent than in previous games, crystals don't lie down like crap anymore, they are pretty scarce so you get most of them by destruction or in later stage you can buy them (no cheap solution though). Bottom line, you must consider really well which spells you will use often.\n\nQuests much more interesting, less of ‘go there bring me that’ and the plot is developing really nice.\nThe pet dragons are replaced by a single creature who can learn some nice tricks with time and teleports you anywhere you want, no need to run miles and miles to get to specific location.

Much as I love the soundtrack it's also been heavily reused in each game and is starting to get a bit irritating.\n\nIt's a solid game with alot of content a good 50+ hour campaign, it doesn't hold your hand like other games and won't point you towards exactly where you need to go for each quest, this can be interesting or annoying depending on your patience level.\n\nI still enjoyed it and it's a decent game for any turn based/fantasy/rpg type players.

This is a game I well recommend to all lovers of turn-based strategy, I'm sure that those already well used to this Series will love it.\nI've just completed the game for the first time with just over a week to go before the official launch and it is complete. So if you want to buy now at the pre-launch price and get the added extras, do so, you're buying a bargain. I'm pleased to report that I suffered no crashes in +190 hours of game play (a problem that KB players will know well from previous games in the series). Just a few minor gliches, and a continuity repetition that didn't spoil the game play. I'm sure the Guys will iron these out. This is also a more "thinking" game than others in the Series and without spoiling, do not worry if you're not able to solve side quests straight away or if you're stuck, quite simply think of a different approach to the problem and remember there may be more than one solution ....

And by that I mean a person who played the original King's Bounty game in 1990 too.\n\nBefore I start analyzing, I must tell you something. A single play-through of this game, doing all quests and fights, will take you over 100 hours. I am not joking. I am dead serious. If you want to do a no-loss play-through and are forced to repeat some battles, or better yet, you play impossible (meaning each fight takes a long time), you will be looking at 150+ hours of gameplay. Know what you're jumping into. This is 150 hours for 18-21€.\n\nThere are already a few reviews in. Before I start, I will state the obvious: King's Bounty, in all of its installments, is basically a single player Heroes of Might and Magic game (regardless of the fact that King's Bounty actually pre-dates HOMM). Opinions are divided, and I will tell you why: because some people are missing the point of this game. Everyone is so preoccupied in expecting an upgrade to King's Bounty: Armored Princess and Crossworlds, that they fail to expand their view and realize what the developers have been thinking. While I am not in their heads, I can see quite well what they did, and it is simple: they gave us 3 different play-styles, which you can mold YOUR WAY and have them do the stuff YOUR WAY. This is what's important to me: a game letting me do stuff MY WAY, and not forcing my hand through a plethora of corridors and bottlenecks.\n\nPeople on the 1C forums have been complaining that they were forced to play the humans for 3 games in a row since time immemorial. So many wished to start with different races: be it the elves, the demons, the undead or the orcs. Now that we got a game that allows us to do it, people suddenly shift their opinion and start complaining about lack of troop variety in early game, or complain about no-loss victories.\n\nI myself am an avid Impossible/No-loss King's Bounty player. While I take pleasure in having such a play-through, it is not the only way to play the game - hence the play-style remark. Orcs are supposed to be numerous, and with adrenaline boosting their attack and skills, they can trounce an enemy before they suffer big losses. Demons have high Hit Points troops, but as a whole, they lack healing and resurrection capabilities, until you find means to do so. Undead can also form swarms, but it is their mobility that makes them great. A single vampire, switched to a bat can kite the enemies for a millenia, while the Vampire Wizard hero, regenerating lots of Mana per turn, destroys them with spells. Never ever miss the general idea of all King's Bounty games - they allow you to get creative. So be creative - don't just jump to conclusions. Never forget that all the games up intil KBWOTN had the classes working with the same race. Here you have races tied to classes. This alone separates KBDS from any other installent till now, and I think it works well. Never forget that when the game opens up, you can still do your own thing and get your favorite line-up. Nobody stops you from doing so.\n\nHaving cleared this out, let's analyze the components of the game itself.\n- Main Menu: nothing different from other King's Bounty games. There is also a 3D option, but I don't suggest you play the game in 3D for a long time.\n- Graphics: a very slight upgrade over other King's Bounty games. Some textures are clearer, and some troop models look better. Then again, not by much.\n- Sound: the soundtrack of King's Bounty has always been its strong side. It has different themes, mostly orchestral with opera motives. 1C has always promoted a captivating soundtrack, and they provide it in this game as well.\n- Gameplay: this has always been the strong suit of all KB games. You can mix and match line-ups, get creative, and reap rewards. You also have 3 different heroes to do it with. This allows for hundreds of hours of fun.\n- Price: 18EUR is a very good price for this game. I always judge the price of a game harshly: I expect a 3 to 1 return at the very least. This means that to me, every 3 hours of game time cost 1 euro. I can easily expect dumping over 100 hours in this game, so I am quite all right with the price. There are so many games on steam that don't even make the 1:1 cut, it is terrible.\n- Day 1 DLC: while I don't support this practice, if people were smart enough to research the game, they should have bought the early access. I agree that nobody is forced into doing so, and I would like to set your souls at ease, that the game is perfectly playable without it. The extra item, which people have been fussing about, doesn't really do much, it gets easily outdated, and must be swapped for a better one - so you are not missing a whole lot.\n- Bugs: yes, they are still present. The release is actually still quite buggy, but there are no gamebreaking bugs. If you can't start the game, try to work around it: update your video card drivers, try it on another system and so on. There is always a reason for everything. If you haven't found it, you haven't looked into it well enough.\n\nConclusion:\n- KBDS is a good game, at a good price, providing lots of hours of enjoyment. Don't ever get this wrong.\n- KBDS is based on what the fans on the forums have been complaining about: getting to play the other races in the game. Don't ever get this wrong.\n- KBDS allows you to get creative just as much as KBAP and KBCW did. Don't ever get this wrong.\n- KBDS is based on different playstyles, and as such it separates itself from the KBAP version of the game.\n- KBDS still allows for Impossible/No-loss play-throughs, if you are willing to invest the time to do one. A no-loss play-through was never easy in any of the previous KB games. Same here. It is doable and I will prove it in the end.\n- If you are still unsure, visit the King's BOunty forums for extra info: http://forum.1cpublishing.eu/forumdisplay.php?f=180\n\nWith a view of all this game would give to you, I will most certainly recommend it to people who:\n- like strategy games from the HOMM genre\n- liked the other King's Bounty installments\n- like to get creative in a strategy game\n- like to challenge themselves\n- like to squeeze maximum potential from a game\n\nIf you are not one of this gamers, then KBDS is not for you.","August 20, 2014","true","163.3"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","0"

I've enjoyed this game so far, however, I'm wondering how many hours it will credit me as having played.  The only real glitch I've run into so far is that the game has deleted my saves and reverted me back to ones made hours before, TWICE.  I guess, that's early access hazards? Or maybe a steam related problem from allowing steam to do download fullspeed in the background? No Idea.\n\nAt any rate, the game is fun, and I've enjoyed it so far.  I think I'm going to wait for the game to mature a bit before playing more, because I've literally lost (over) half of my game play despite being one of those people that saves every 5 minutes.  I guess that transfer saves to steam cloud deal was meant to be a (do this or you're screwed thing?).\n\nWell, anyway the game is fun.  Although I have no experience with the other King's Bounty games, I only had a couple minutes of  "What do I do?" time pushing buttons to find the dig key (d) to find artifacts (and then later seeing it next to the minimap and feeling dumb.)\n\nThe player can pick his/her surname/nickname (but not first name) and pick from between three characters.  Female being a demoness in a g-string.  Males being an aloof vampire and a very likable orc.  The choice seems to make no difference other than cosmectically, as you can use the other characters skills in combat, and you only see your troops in combat not your main character.\n\nYou do, however, travel in the real time world as your character and encounter mob groups like in Dofus or many other turn based games over the years that most of you are probably more familiar with than I am.  So far, despite what I read in reviews prior to purchasing the game the story is quite amusing.  It's very light and does not take itself seriously at all.  It's no Shakespeare, and it's definitely not Gloria Steinem, (fantasy games almost always equal big chested males and big chested women) so don't expect otherwise. Especially since this one doesn't even take itself seriously storywise.)  Speaking of stories, don't expect voice overs.  It's clicking on dialogue.  The dialogue is amusing (to me.) However, don't expect big budget stuff. I don't recall a single cut scene.\n\nThe game is basically you buy, pick up items that turn into, or you just run across units that you use  to fight for you.  You can also use some hero powers each combat round to turn your mana into damage, healing etc. depending on your powers, and some other ones based on "rage".  The three characters can use each other's rage powers, and I believe everyone accesses the same skill trees so again your hero choice should be cosmetic?\n\nI will be posting in the future when I regain my patience and redo the hours I've lost in gameplay.

My complaints are that the last couple of Kings Bounty games have had a lot of mission related bugs are there are perhaps too many mission details to keep track of and the engine doesn't always give you enough info to remember where you are with their progress. It can become confusing all too quickly with 100 or so missions available and I find them to be a big road block for me wanting to replay. I still recommend any of the Kings Bounty Games(I've played and finished all the single player ones) but the mission complexity is getting overkill and the amount of bugs they keep having to fix is very symptomatic of that.","February 22, 2015","true","51.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

That sounds pretty fun to me. Which is why I keep trying to like this series of games, as the original King's Bounty was such a staple of my childhood. But sadly it is a deeply flawed series, so despite some positive features, just isn't recommendable.\n\nIn (literally) the first battle you fight, the opposing army uses abilities that causes your armies to act on their own accord instead of listening to your orders. While the fight itself is easy, this is a good indicator of how the game goes. Design decisions were made that may have sounded tactically interesting, but result in a poor user experience where you often find yourself watching things unfold on-screen with little to no meaningful input on your part.\n\nThe AI is also acutely aware that while it can throw limitless hordes at you, you have a very finite force. It often makes decisions that would make no tactical sense in terms of winning the battle, but pick aware at you. Again, this may seem tactically interesting, but the end result is a lot of reloading and long trips back to recruit more soldiers.\n","December 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Another uninspired, deal-breakingly buggy King's Bounty release. Dark Side is more like glorified DLC than a stand-alone game. Kind of cool to be able to play the "evil" factions, but I remember the good ol' days of Heroes of Might and Magic III (K's B is sort of an offshoot/fork/sidebranch of the HoMM series) when you'd get to play a variety of factions in a single campaign. But I'm okay with that – can't expect too much for a game at this price point.\n\nDark Side's also a little grindy, but I'm okay with that too. I mean, it's King's Bounty, of course it's grindy. Embrace the grind!\n\nBut the sad fact is that this game is extremely buggy, to the point of unplayability. It stutters and crashes within five minutes of playing (sometimes on the opening screen!), every single time. I should add that A., I have a pretty nice rig, 4Gb of RAM on my GPU alone, and B., I've tried playing on the lowest possible graphics settings. Nothing helps.\n\nMaybe the developer will release a patch that actually patches things? I hope so. But not only would I not recommend this game, I'd seriously think twice about buying anything from these guys – Warriors of the North, the previous installment of the KB series, was just as bad.","December 13, 2014","false","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But then the quests become VERY repetitive and boring, you have to walk a lot, talk a lot, fight weak enemies (if you are not playing on impossible difficulty), get some stupid items, etc. Dialogues are mostly boring too and in many quests you hear the same things from 2 or 3 different characters. Some levels are badly designed and you can't even use your flying mount there, so you walk over and over and over again. Many important landmarks or characters are not marked on your map so you have to remember everything.

The game is very glitchy, and crashes often. It crashes when I try changing the resolution, loading games, turning the wrong direction... It is obviously rushed, there are a lot of areas that feel unfinished. There are a lot of instances where you can't get to chests, enemy troops, get stuck in spots due to bad layout.\nThe earlier games are pretty laced with phallic imagery and mostly-naked females (nipple armor is about all they get), so I knew that going in, but it is a bit much in this game. I wish we had the option of selecting somthing more than a thong for the character. It just made me feel like they were trying to get virgin 12 year old boys to like the game and overlook poor prgramming.\nThere is a lot of errand hunting and going back and forth in this game, which can make it seem kind of slow and pretty boring.\nThat being said, I enjoy playing it for the most part. It isn't as good as the other games, and it seems a bit lacking in content. There are a lot of names of NPC's that seem like they weren't supposed o be kept for final product (Marie Curie, Sandy ♥♥♥♥, etc) that are either real people or the kind of names that make me think of prank callers. Sometimes the dialogue is funny (when you can actually read the script, which is blurry and difficult to see at the best of times), but often it is very cheesy and amatuer. There is a different tone like there were several different writers that didn't talk to each other.\nTurn-based games are hard to find, so for that reason, I am okay with the amount I spent on the game, but the quality is really lacking, and I won't buy any other games that may be released. I\nActual fighting in game is a little slower than I remembered, and some of the spells don't work (wanderer especially like Titan's Sword).\nAll in all, it plays like an unfinished product lacking quality.

The environment and scenery are very nice and those combined with the breathtaking music really add to the atmosphere. Once more as with several other games the music is simply stunning: the tune heard in the Elven lands, the tune heard in the Demonic lands etc are so different and captivate the land they describe perfectly.\n\nThe story if quite interesting, but it's especially the humor used throughout it which makes for a great experience.\nIn a way it reminded me of Overlord: the game is like a parody on the traditional 'goody goody' RPG's. It's really littered (in a positive way) with funny stuff, ranging from the obvious 'victimized' role of evil, over passwords like 'QWERTY', the names of the Beatles and the island of the Light having the shape and road structure of a big peace sign.\n\nThe amount of different units in this game is quite big and each unit has its own pro's and con's which makes for a great amount of tinkering and combining to try and get the 'best' army.\nThe game also has some nice features like for example upgrading items: in order to do this you actually have to fight the 'Keepers' of this item and only if you win does it get upgraded.\n\nA minor issue with the game is the Quest log. While definitely not bad it does lack some important info at times making it unclear what has to be done to complete a given quest (in most cases such quests will advance later in the game).\nNear the end of the game some quests require specific scrolls in order to be completed, however those are nowhere to be found (probably already sold during the course of the game). This is a bit 'meh' in my opinion since nothing makes those scrolls stand out in any way, thus the only way to complete those quests is in a new playthrough.\n\nA bigger issue are crashes and bugs: in 50% of the time the game crashed when exiting to Windows. This is not an issue since I'm exiting anyway but it's annoying. During gameplay I had a sporadic crash caused by clear bugs. For example if one of your units does 100% damage (so kills all enemies) the game will crash, probably because the number '100' doesn't fit the allocated space or something. This happens quite rarely and when you 'know' it you can avoid it.\nDuring my playthrough at one point I was not able to go to one specific island anymore, neither through sailing nor teleporting, the game would always crash. After some rummaging on forums I found out that verifying the Steam game cache magically fixes this. All of these bugs are luckily not game breaking but they should have been ironed out by now.\nThe advice here is to quick-save regularly so no data is lost.\n\nIt took me 98 hrs to finish the game on Normal difficulty doing all quests which could be completed which is time well spent. Note that this is the first King's Bounty which I have played, so I cannot compare to previous installments.\nOveral I can say this is one of the best games I have ever played, great fun.\nI'm giving it a 9 out of 10 where the one point is deducted for the bugs.","August 5, 2015","true","98.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For some quests you really have to be lucky cause there are very few clues about where you can find the particular person, item or place mentioned in the quest dialog. It is also advisable not quickly skipping the dialogues, cause sometimes the only clue you may get lies in that dialogue. And you can only see the short desciption of the quest in your quests list, not the dialog which contains the clue itself.\n\nThere is a new concept of something like "base" called shelter, and you can get improvements and develop special units from here. This is a really nice addon.\n\nI am also glad that the darned "runes" thing and the spells related with that disappeared in this new version.\n","November 21, 2015","true","133.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have a better sense of achieving something, and so my 134h were great spent. I could complete all but 1 quests (bugged), so the game is in a good state.\nPlaying the dark side, in my case a seductuve Demoness, was a nice change, you almost felt bad for ruining true love, making the most happy person cry and break the most loyal person :)\nPlayed on normal, and in contrast to earlier KB games, its almost a bit too easy, as with time, you have access to unlimied supply of troops (if you have enough money).\nHighly recommended, and looking for the next installment!","October 18, 2015","true","136.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I haven't gotten too far in on Dark Side, but so far this feels pretty weak in terms of level design and pacing. For example, the catacombs had their walls just lined with eggs, and thats a LOT of clicking to collect them. There are treasures with 15k gold in the first few minutes (just unguarded and hidden away in a random corner) which is ridiculous. There were areas I could get to, but I clearly wasn't supposed to be there (because there were no enemies, all the doors were locked)... and then I had to go back and talk to a person and suddenly the area could be used.\n\nIn other King's Bounties, the loot and itemization was really well distributed through the map. This isn't the case here.\n\nKing's Bounty never had the greatest writing, but a couple of places it was really phoned in. Just walls of text that have nothing to do with anything.

I saw this and saw that they had 2 previous games release in between so I expected alot of changes I was sorely dissapointed : /. The graphics are identical to the first game, the text is still insanely small (thats why I'd always give up on reading it before cause itd give me headaches leaning forward to read it), the talent trees are still nearly identical if not identical, gameplay so far is identical, and even the unit sprites are the same just with different names. I'll admit there may be a little be of new content later in the game and I suppose I'll find out since I spent the money i may as well play it, but overall I'm annoyed 4 games later and the game is still the same as the first 1 just with a different story a few new units/spells/abilities/items.\n\nI'd still recommend the game for people that haven't played any of the king's bounty games, but if you've played any of the predecessors and considering buying this just go back to the other one not worth it.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/recommended/289520/","clairne","fista1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clairne/","43 products in account","King's Bounty: Dark Side is the latest installment of the King's Bounty serie. For the first time, you will play as the bad guy. The balance of Light and Dark was disturbed. The forces of Light are close to wipe all the creatures of Dark. Players will choose one of the dark heroes- Orc warrior, Demoness paladin, or Vampire mage. The beginning of the game is specific for each of the character, but the rest of the game is the same. Players will be even able to travel to the places where other heroes start. In general, I find the story to be good.\n\nThe combat system is the same as in the previous games. In addition to sending forces to eliminate the enemy, players can cast spells or use abilities of their companion. The only change is that there is only one boss battle in the whole game, which some people may don't like.\n\nThe other thing I don't like very much is the design of quests. In many cases, players will just run back and forth from point A. For example a witch give the player a quest to bring her five ent sprouts. Now, ents are warriors of the Elven army, so player may expect to find them in one of the two Elven isles. But to which one to go? In the end, the Ent sprouts are to be found in a completely different island, where players can buy them from the local witch, if they didn't kill her previously. Some quests may not be finished at all. For example, there is another witch that wanted from me to bring her three magic scrolls. Unfortunatelly, I was not able to find one of them in the whole world, so I couldn't finish the quest. I've seen many people complained in the forums about this kind of quests. I've aldo read in the forums that some people had some of their quests bugged. Luckily, I didn't encounter this. However, I had problems with quest marks. Sometimes, after I progressed in a quest, the question mark appeared on the next location of where I should go, but the old one didn't disappear. This caused that sometimes I had two or even more question marks regarding one quest. Sometimes, the question mark was completely missing. The quest log isn't very helpful , because it only contains the introductory description and tasks what to do in order to complete the quest. Sadly, the tasks are often written in an rather unhelpful way(e.g. “Buy a puppy”, but where to buy it). Sometimes, you are given an advice how to solve the problem and where to go, sometimes you are not. One of the quest stopped upgrading after a while. So yes, there are flaws in the design. Not frustrating, but  they spoil the fun. The game even crashed a few times. Luckily, the loading times are short, so it doesn't take much time to return to the world of Teana.\n\nOne of the pros of King's Bounty is the humour. You can find references to other work of pop-culture, like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Some dialogs are quite amusing. However, in some  dialogs players will be given more than one options how to answer, but it seems that whichever players choose, the result is the same. That is not very good, in my opinion.\n\nThe story is quite good and the locations are nice. Graphics is the same, which I don't find a big problem. They added a few new songs, but in my opinion, they aren't very good. There is also the problem that remained from Warriors of the North- the game seems to select a song that is not very suitable for particular situation. Many times I've heard combat songs in the world map and vice versa. In my opinion, this spoils the atmosphere a bit.\n\nIt's hard to decide whether to recommend this game. It's still fun to play, but it has its flaws. If you have played the previous games and just want another journey from King's Bounty universe and you don't mind some glitches, then you might find what are you looking for. For others: if you didn't like the previous installments, you probably won't like this one either. If you are interested in King's Bounty series but haven't played any of the games, I'd recommend you to pick The Legend or Armored Princess, which are the better ones, in my opinion. If I'd have to choose between Warriors of the North and Dark Side, I'd choose WotN, since quests in that game can be completed and it's in better technical shape than Dark Side.","January 29, 2015","false","58.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't that much of an issue the way I'm saying it, but using the same troops for the whole game just makes it so repetitive it becomes boring, give haste, orc shield 1 unit, charge, kill everything, repeat, barely any fight does it require anyother strategy.\n\nOf course, this is just my personal experience, I do love the series, but it just felt weak compared to the others, doesn't help that the game has some issues which the developers don't care enough to fix the problems, like the sound cutting out when too much stuff is going on or swordsman doing their idle animations way too often.\n\nIf you want a good King's Bounty, buy Crossworld, it pretty much is Armored Princess (the best one in my opinion) with an expansion pack to it, as well as 2 new campaigns, those 2 campaigns might be short compared to the complete game, but they are satisfying to play.","June 14, 2015","false","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having never played any of the other King’s Bounty games I found this one to be quite enjoyable, with a few caveats.\n\nPros:\nAn enjoyable combat system reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders, with scores of units to fight and recruit. Moreover, there is an interesting and expansive Magic/Rage system with boatloads of spells/abilities.\nA fun and remarkably funny storyline. You get to play the bad guy(!), which is definitely a change of pace from many games; but, to my happy surprise, the writing was good enough that I actually began feeling like I was the good guy.\nIt’s a long (loooooooong) game, very easily 100+ hours. (Have a great deal of time that you need to murder? Look no further.)\nCons:\nI found pacing to be a bit-- screwy, while looking for quest objectives you can wander into an area or zone that you really should not be in and quickly find yourself on the wrong side of an a** whooping. Save early, save often.\nSpeaking of looking for quest objectives, the quest log can be somewhat vague, and at times downright counterproductive. Quite frustrating, but in the end a minor quirk.\nIt’s a long (loooooooong) game. Unfortunately, there’s a point where progression becomes unbalanced and the story become hidden behind an endless grind of meaningless battles. This is the biggest detraction from an otherwise excellent game.\nOverall, I found more positives then negatives with the game. I didn’t encounter any of the bugs that others had run into, so that might have colored my experience; however, apart from a few gripes, I found the game more than decent. For me it’s a recommended-if-on-sale.\n\n7/10  (Pretty good for a game that I bought to see what bloody Snow White was all about.)","June 26, 2015","true","237.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is full of bugs. I saved after every battle or major event, and still had to retrace my steps repeatedly because of crashes. And after a while, I had way more in my army than anyone could defeat, so I gave up using spells entirely and just let my army units do their thing(s).","May 29, 2015","false","184.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I DO enjoy these games a lot but this one went in a mega fedex tangent and I didnt know where I was meant to go. SO, its good but I cant say brilliant. Combat is bigger and better but so are the worlds.\n\nInstead of making these games much longer I think there should be a campaign focused on more quirky combats... mad layouts and 2 v 1 or hostiles in the map sort of thing. Maybe even a 1v1v1 sort of setup happening. Regardless, its more of the same but longer and a little more tedious to complete quests.","January 28","true","78.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's bad and good at the same time because it can take some time to start the game where monster's can be defeated.\nLater, game difficulty significantly reduces if you have right warrior's stack in your army slots.  To finish some quests you have to read dialogues carefully. They mostly contains useful tips to complete them.\nNew units are imba, but they're great. Building your own "citadel" where you can upgrade your units is brilliant either.\nI would recommend game for those who like the series.","January 22","true","310.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine the Amazon river from hell with all its twists and turns and little streams that lead nowhere.\n\nConvoluted. Back and forth. Ever decreasing circles. Ragequit.\n\nThe Developers have even - belatedly - added a line in the quests summary pages saying "We don't have the time to add in proper clues - so figure it out your self - IT'S FUN!"\n\nAddictive. 450 hours in across all the various KB games. That is a lot. So I am not saying "I played this game for 100 hours and it is crap". I sort of love them. Finished the first two but can't seem to bite the bullet and keep going on these later two (this and Warriors of the North).\n\nI really love the King's Bounty series - it is probably the most fun, absurd, ridiculous and obtuse series out there. Choose a fighter, paladin or mage. Amass an army and send them into battles on a turn based chessboard. Cute graphics. No bugs or crashes experienced. My early army consisted of Wizards and Imps. Now I command mostly dragons that can fly around the battlefield unleashing hellfire. The series reminds me a bit of the Diablo clones where you just want to do one more battle to level up and increase your various map. They promote exploring as you can find cash, magic runes, other runes and spells. The battles can be very strategic.\n\n450 hours in and I still like the music - found myself humming it this morning. What is wrong with me?\n\nIn the Dark Side the forces of good have done bloody war on the evil minions and the evil demons and orcs need saving. As a lady Demon Spirit Paladin class - I travel the various worlds encouraging the various leaders to "Turn to the Darkside" and support our cause. If they don't, I replace them on the throne by hook or crook.\n\nThe more positives aspects of this game:\n\nFor probably the first time in a KB game - I quite enjoyed the story telling and various chit chat.\nI like some of the quirky people you meet on your travels - like the Seven Dwarves - very bad people.\nYou can enable cheating - but still get the achievements - cool\nI came across a "Colossus" spell that when cast game me random Level 5 troops - hello Archdemons and Cyclops\nI liked the Tomfoolery you could do with Blood Priestesses where I sacrificed my troops to increase some of the others. At one point I had 100 red and green dragons in reserve - at no cost!\nI liked you can trick a Dragon Leader into accepting fake princesses who he then subsequently turns into the best units in the game - fearsome Dragon riders.\n\nThe negatives in this game can be reflected in one single word - Whattheheckisgoingon?\n\nSome of the quests are diabolical. Impossible to figure out on your own. God save the Internet and special thanks and high esteem to two Steam users (Shadowcran and Siannah) who posted two fantastic guides. The developers should be thanking them for the majority of positive reviews.\n\nThe Seven Dwarves quests involves searching three different maps.\n\nIn the Island of Monteville - you need to get into the Castle. This quest involves a travelling circus, make up, a portrait, an elven outfit and a password. CONVOLUTED.\n\nBuy these games cheap and you are virtually guaranteed 20-30 hours of fun. After that it's like running a marathon - all about your stamina.","April 28","true","120.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Interesting setup, classic KB humor, and unlike previous KB games, you dont play as a righteous hero this time but as an evil vampire, orc or succubus. Most the units are familiar from previous titles but the new units like the amazons, the spies, the strongmen, and the dragon riders are really special with interesting abilities. But the best thing is the quests. In that department Dark side surpasses all the other KB games. The quests here make you to think  they are generaly more rewarding and there is a stronger RPG element. Also, many special units can be aquired only by completing some quest line. The companion is awesome,  you can recruit units directly for him by giving him prisoners and also he can teleport you in any island/territory you have visited before for a small fee.\nOne of the negatives is that the  introduction is too long and kinda boring can discourage some players and a few bugs i encountered (not critical though).\n","May 19","true","104.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
