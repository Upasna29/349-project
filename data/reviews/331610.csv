I played it again, I did the tutorial to read everything and make sure I was doing it all correctly in hopes that somehow or some way the 2nd time would be more fun and engaging.  .Sadly that didn't happen and my score of the game hasn't changed and as much as I want to like this game, it just isn't "fun" to me.\n\nI gotta be honest in my reviews, I'm just not the type to give it a thumbs up and say something witty like "The sexiest actress told me NO to any amount of money  10/10".  That's the kind of lame review that I know lots of people love here, but that's not honest, informative, or helpful to people genuinely trying to decide if this game is a wise purchase for them.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br82NF1rIew&feature=youtu.be\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nDon't let my negative review turn you off of this game if you like games that are 100% strategy and numbers games.  As far as numbers and strategy goes, this game very well could be great.  My review and score below is MY opinion of the game and my liklihood to play it again after my first 45 minute long first look.\n\nThe problem for me with this game is it really offered nothing to reward me or fault me based on my decisions and my choices.  I think I would have liked to hear actors talking in the background or see a newspaper spin onto the screen saying what movie made the most money on its release, or how bad my movie did at the movies, or something.\n\nInstead, it's just adjusting numbers and hiring actors with point and clicks but no sound effects, no screen dazzle, just leaves it feeling kinda "blah" to me.\n\nThe background graphics are plenty well done, and honestly don't need to even be nearly as good as they are.  I think that I was just looking for something more in the sounds, updates, or voices, or SOMETHING to make me feel and see easier how I was progressing rather then just requiring to me look at data on a chart on the screen.\n\nI'm not asking for a lot.  Just basic musical sounds or gongs or something would help a lot.  And it just doesn't give you any kind of musical or graphical rewards in any way, shape, or form.  I guess just seeing the numbers about if your movies are making money is supposed to be all that you need to keep playing, I dunno.\n\nA big thumbs down for me, because I knew what kind of game I was buying, I knew it wasn't going to be a big graphics action game.  I love strategy games.  But this game just didn't inspire me in any way, shape or form to keep playing.\n\nMy score is a 15 out of 100.\n\nPS - For those of you looking for a game similar to "The Movies" from back around 2006 or so, this game is nothing like that and will likely leave you very disappointed.","December 17, 2014","false","2.2"," 161 of 204 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","161","204","4","7"

It was very late and it sounded like fun. Plus it was cheap. I like management games but this one needs more development. I don't want to give it thumbs down just yet but I'd say you should hold off on buying it and see if it gets updates. If not, only pick it up if you get it super cheap or part of a bundle. Too many developers just dump games on Steam and walk away from them.\n\nRemember that game The Movies? That Peter Molyneux game that was going to be the most amazing thing ever but never lived up to its potential? (Kind of like every Peter Molyneux game?) I got a lot of enjoyment out of that game even though portions of it never worked right. Nobody has done a game quite like it since.\n\nWell Movie Studio Boss The Sequel (was there a first one?) is a bit like The Movies but you take out all the micromanagement like lot building or keeping your stars happy. You're just basically making a bunch of decisions. And as far as that goes, Movie Studio Boss is more detailed. There are a lot of different stages and people that you have to hire to get your movie made. So it is a bit more realistic in that respect. If lots of menu screens are your thing and you don't expect some sort of update to The Movies, you might like it. It exists somewhere between The Movies and Game Dev Tycoon but not as polished as either. It needs some work. I hope the developers realize this. Some of the options are not explained very well and I can't exactly figure out the whole marketing and releasing part as of yet. Plus there's no real reaction when your movie does come out. No reviews or goofy, nonsensical movie to watch. There needs to be more incentive to keep playing.","December 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 51 of 71 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","51","71","4","6"

The only thing you can do is make your film by clicking the Studios, you have to hire actors but you never see them making a movie. Its just click, hire, click, waite untile all is finished, click to the next part, click, click, click and hire, set your movie quality, waite that the weeks pass and all is done, press again, read newsletter and start again making a new movie by clicking.\n\nGraphic looks nice but thats all.\n\nIf you love Games where you only have to waite and click, this game is for you, else its just waste of money.\n\nYou see nothing in that game expect from the buildings and the windows where you have to select things.\n\nRate 1 from 10\n\nif you still use Win7 or XP play the original the Movies+AddOn, its a realy good game!

Whilst certain features are certainly interesting, the actual fun in production is completely lost, and its contents are limited to simple text windows, which are all handled by algorythms that are simply boring to handle.\n\nThink of Movie Studio Boss: The Sequel as a successor to the movies, only with all of the actual fun from The Movies removed, and one or two features added that mean little to nothing to the product as a whole.","March 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaneThanatos/recommended/331610/","ZaneThanatos","Zane Thanatos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaneThanatos/","567 products in account","In a word - clunky. Fairly simple game overall - pick out same basic stats for your movie (genre, setting, etc), hire the associated staff (actors, extras, director, etc), get the thing filmed, send it to post production and hire vendors(?) to do the work there (CGI, musical score, etc), and send it out to the world (pick out your marketing budget, release format, etc) and that's about it. Not as much interaction as some other similar games, it's really just entering numbers and selecting who you want to hire without much feedback about what those choices actually do or how they effect the final product. However, if you happen to like that sort of thing the game wouldn't be to bad. The problem is a lot of what you have to do to hire all those people and set the numbers isn't streamlined very well and the effect they actually have isn't very clear.\n\nSome notable examples:\nMy epic space action movie required 2000 extras - but you can only increase the numbers one at a time (everything else allows you to click and type in a number so not sure what happened there).\nOne of my directors REFUSED to work in a digital format, would have been nice to know before I hired him.\nOne of the actors refused to work with the director I hired, also would have been nice to have this information before I tried to hire him.\nAlmost every person you hire is ranked 1-5 on a number of attributes. Unfortunately you can not sort or filter this in any manner so you just have to scroll through to find who you like (and half of the avaliable workers are already hired but you can't sort them out either).\nEvery actor/actress I tried to hire refused the default salary (they usually required 200-300% more to actually work for me). No real guidance aside from "Nope, to low for me". You get 3 chances to get it right then they won't talk to you for another week.\nIn short, don't buy the game. It had some underlying potential but the general pain of actually setting a movie up isn't worth it.\n\nIn a response to the comment about time played: All of my points were honestly found within the first 15 minutes of gameplay. It doesn't take very long to see something is that clunky and is little more than a numbers simulator with a movie overlay.","December 17, 2014","false","1.0"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","25","41","3","2"

Start with $1b and make movies, that's it. But it allows you to hire screenwriters, directors, actors and actresses, DPs, and extras... a surprising amount of detail, really.\n\nIf I have a complaint, it's that I wish I was given more detail about the movies I'm making, even if I was allowed to put one in.\n\nThis is all about money management and gauging audience reaction to different films.
