Key supplied by developer.\n\nSo here's an interesting idea, when is a twinstick not quite a twinstick. When you ramp up the incomming fire to near bullet hell levels of difficulty!\nSeraph, from the developers of Ironcast, a rather interesting game in its' own right, is in essence a side on shooter where you play an acrobatic angelic/human host, bound up in a prison explicitly designed to hold said angel, for reasons unknown, and at the start of the game, your prison is opened. The guards are well, they're not doing so good, you collect a pair of pistols from the ground, and set off to find answers.\n\nAs an angel in a human host, you have access to miracles, most key of which is the ability to despatch demonic invaders with a flash of your wings and a touch of your hand. This requires you to be in -close- proximity. Considering that everything in the local area wants you dead, and you've a limited time to make this happen, this can be rather dangerous. You also have your rather human tools to hand - guns, lots and lots of lovely guns. They come currently in two flavours, the default twin pistols, which can be aimed at two seperate targets, and primary weapons, which range from the straightforward (Autopistols, shotgun, submachine gun, AR) through to the nutty (Railgun... RAILGUN?).\n\nSpend your bullets carefully, you don't have infinite numbers...\nThese primary weapons are categorically more powerful than your plink plink pistols, but they have limited ammo, and as a consequence you have to budget your use of these powerful primary weapons carefully, saving them for the much more powerful demons that can regenerate, and the multi stage demonic champions that require multiple smites in order to bring down.\n\nThis arsenal is all fine and well, but it doesn't touch on the signature element of Seraph's core gameplay, a "smart targetting" system that takes the hassle of finding enemies for you. Seraph will auto-lock the closest threat and direct her fury at them with whatever firearm you've selected whilst you focus on moving, using miracles, and generally not dying. The not dying is important, see, these enemies will throw a LOT of nasty attacks your way, and as the difficulty ramps up, the attacks not only increase in damage output, they'll also increase in variety.\n\nEnemies gain -new- tricks as your difficulty dynamically cranks up, matching your skill as you go. Finding things too easy? As you mill the enemies, you'll see the difficulty counter in the bottom counter begin to race upwards, and before you know it, your opponents will have new toys to play with, will hit harder, and need more ammo to bring down. The reward however is more components, and more experience.\n\nAn early taste of the angelic offerings\nCurrently the game only offers a subset of the possible blessings, oaths and miracles that will be in the full version, we've a lot more to look forward to, but the moment to moment gameplay is absolutely excellent, providing a good cross between spectacle shooter and bullet hell where your management of the blink resource and your positioning proves more vital than targetting and dealing damage. This is a game that rewards good placement and evading your foes, before surging forward to deliver lethal strikes in a real hurry. You need to be fast, elegant and acrobatic.\n\nGraphically, for a two dimensional game it is highly reminiscent of ACE's Abyss Odyssey, but with a very futuristic touch, and a matching soundtrack to boot. The soundtrack having a very electro-industrial feel puts you in mind of things like Equilibrium and the Matrix, which is very fitting given the gunplay involved.\n\nThere's also suggestions and bug fixes being worked through by the developers, and more good things will hopefully be on the way.\n\nAt this point my final judgment is -\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended","April 26","true","6.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","4"

But the core gameplay is VERY good so it's all expanding, which is positive\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBRmKFBlhBk&ab_channel=GuyLogic\n\nTextual summary:\nA bit of text will never compare to a long video in dept of detail, so i always recommend watching the video.\n\nThe game has a ton of cool stuff to it, from the various procedually generated levels, the 3-tries system before a death and the many arcobatic moves it all fits together.\n\nThe main thing that drives this game is the smooth animations and platforming experience, both in terms of completion, unlocking new content as well as the "lite" crafting system. The various mobs are well designed and the abilities they have are all pretty great.\n\nSadly, the lack of variety and limitations to the number of mobs, unlockables and aspects to the game do limit it's replay-ability.\n\nLastly, the game runs at a smooth 60 FPS at all times, no drops or dips. But this comes appearantly at the price of rebindable keys or a proper keyboard layout. The game recommends using a controller, but i'd go so far as to say that the experience on a keyboard is below sup-bar. definitely needs work.\n\nOveral, i feel a few months in early access will do the game a ton of good both in fleshing out it's content and fine tuning the PC port and it's options, but even now, if you ARE interested in early access, this is an amazing title right out the gate. just light on the content.","April 26","true","12.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

OMG WHAT? HOW COULD THIS BE A GOOD THING? You will have to try it to understand, but honestly it's actually a lot of fun to focus on your movements rather than constantly having to adjust your aim\n+ A nice industrial / rave soundtrack that flows well with this futuristic looking game\n+ Crafting is probably the greatest feature this game has going for it. Each level you will pick up shards and eventually components that you can use to build new weapons and unhance your character and her bailities through a wide assortment of upgrades and perks.  This expands the replayability, and let's you go back to collect if the game gets a bit too hard later on.\n+ Visually the environment and especially the effects look great. The gunplay, fireballs, explosions, abilities all look nice and really give an intense action vibe during close encounters.","May 2","true","4.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/425670/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nWhen looking at screenshots I thought Seraph was yet another twin shooter, contra style game maybe with some Metroidvania thrown in for good measure… oh how wrong I was.\n\nThe best way to describe the game is a roguelike action shooter that plays out like a 2D game version of the film Equilibrium. The key game mechanics on show here is that aiming is always automatic allowing you to focus fire on your closest enemy or in some cases 2 at the same time when dual wielding. This then radically changes the feel of the game to be less about shooting and more about avoiding enemy attacks bullets and patterns that feel like a cross between Diablo, a bullet hell shooter and a spectacle fighter such as “The Devil May Cry.”\n\nThe game plays wonderfully and controlling Seraph is such as joy as you bound around the levels shooting and dashing. The game really does do an amazing job at making you feel incredibly good at playing it.\nAnother key mechanic is the game’s progressive difficulty setting. As you kill enemies and open chests you gain XP orbs. These let you advance your level but also fill up a meter that over time gradually increase the game’s difficulty setting. If you get hit this lowers the bar and decreases the rate in which the difficult increases. The game can be started in normal, Hard and Expert which start the difficulty at 1, 3 and 7 respectively. I personally found the game starting to get difficult around the 3.5/4 mark but if it is the absolute high scores you strive for then expert is where you must be.\n\nTo smooth this out however the game offers two progression systems. Every time you gain a level you can give yourself a blessing which gives you help in the game usually providing some sort of effect such as health regen after killing a stronger enemy or your double jump causing a mini explosion that causes holy damage. The other systems is in the shape of Oaths and Transmutations which can be purchased between playthroughs and offer either abilities or incremental stat increases. These boosts do however make a difference and carry over through each play session so each time you step back into the game you are generally that little bit stronger than last time. This really adds longevity to the game and made me want to keep playing.\n\nThere is also a challenge mode that changes every day and has a ranked leader board. This sets you a task such as survive as long as you can with a very rapidly expanding difficulty or kill 50 enemies as fast as you can. This is a fun little side mode I have enjoyed completing once a day albeit way worse than some of the best players out there.\n\nEach floor which plays out much like other roguelikes such as The Binding of Isaac sees you either kill an elite demon or close 1 or more demon gates.. This works well but I did hope for a little more variety types and hopefully we will see more of this in the final game.\nWeapon variety is pretty good as well with different weapons packing enough punch to warrant going out of your way to find the best one.\n\nVisually the game is brimming with style. The enemy design is good and the effects are strong. The game moves at a blistering pace and looks wonderful to boot. The sound design is also outstanding and really stands up as one of the best action scores I have heard in the last few years. It is rare I would actually go out of my way to listen to a game’s soundtrack but this could very well be one of those times.\n\nMy only slight gripe is even as you go through the games different worlds the level design both visually and structurally rarely changes. There are a few room configurations such as a tall room with a ledge at the top with a gap into the next room above that seem to come up regularly and while a minor issue I did found myself beginning to correctly predict layouts in the design even after only a few hours play.\n\nOverall however Seraph is one of the best action games I have played in a long time and is unbelievably satisfying to play. The auto aim gunplay makes you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ and the platforming and bullet dodging is incredibly satisfying. The game plays like a dream and with hopefully a little bit more varied content leading up to its full release Seraph is definitely one to look out for and pick up.\n\nTHE GAME WAS OBTAINED VIA A KEY FROM THE DEVELOPER. MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS ARE OWEVER MY OWN.\n\nCheck out our video review to see the game in action: Seraph Video Review	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\nIf you found our review helpful join our curator page: The Game Tutor Curator Page","May 3","true","35.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

What this means is that the game is much more focused on movement and dodging enemy attacks and getting into a good position to kill the enemies.  The game has an interesting difficulty mechanic where the longer the game goes on for, and the better you do at it, the harder the game gets.  Not only do the enemies have more health and do more damage but they unlock new abilites, more types of enemies get unlocked etc.\n\nSo far it seems the thing that needs to be added is general content, eg abilities, upgrades and etc but the game is already extremely fun and satisfying to play and the daily challenge runs are very fun to do and offer a much faster paced alternative to the story mode.","April 26","true","53.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

They take a quite simple idea: You don't have to aim for yourself! And create a really great game mechanic. It's a shooter but then again more like a platformer and what I love about it is that you have to stay in motion the whole time. You have to dodge your enemies' attacks, try to kill them as fast as you can and then don't relax but hurry to get the motes they are leaving because you're being rewarded to be fast!\n\nIt's a shooter and a platformer and it has RPG elements as well! As you move through the randomly created levels you will get experience points and when leveling up you can choose between different "blessings" that will make you stronger. There are also oaths and transmutations and in order to progress in those systems you have to collect rare shards and crafting material. I like the oath system so far because it let you try different things and you can get your points/shards back whenever you like to try something else.\n\nMore important: You get a better chance of finding rare stuff AND getting a harder challenge the better you play because Seraph has another great concept beneath that "automatic aiming" idea. The difficulty level scales with your skill level. That means: The better you are, the harder the game gets but also the better are the rewards! It's a great idea because it not only gives you that idea of "Yeah let's beat that level" but also tweaks it as now you don't want to get hit at all! Because not getting hit but hitting all the enemies is the key to make that difficulty level go higher! The game shows you all the time at what point you are and also how fast it's rising if you continue as skillful as you do at that moment!\n\nWhat could be improved but remember this is still early access... maybe voice acting for the cut scenes? And the levels themself do feel a little bit monotonous so far... a little bit more variety to the textures and obstacles would be cool. :)\n\nBut for that super smooth and fast gameplay alone I would definitely recommend it so far! The controls are tight, it's challenging but fair and the soundtrack adds to the tense, immersive action.\n\nIf you like to see me play the game take a look at my ongoing Let's Play!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZtfKj0PeDs","May 10","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And honestly if you had to control all of aiming too this game wouldn't work.\nYou can target enemies if you needed to with right stick, Or you can leave the game do it all for you.\nYou really need to try this game!

Using auto-aiming really allows you to focus on all the other things going on in the game, which can be enjoyably overwhelmingly challenging quite often! The design feels polished, well thought out and 'snappy'. The soundtrack is great. I certainly recommend this game!\n\nThere are a few bugs, but I'm sure they'll all be ironed out before going out of early access.\n\nDisclosure: I got a free copy from Daniel, who is a friend and made the game.

Double jumping and dashing around the stage while avoiding incoming attacks is a lot of fun!\n\nI was a bit worried that the gameplay would feel stale when the aiming is automatic but bar a few moments (like when there's only one bullet-spongy enemy standing in front of you that's not doing much) it's exciting and fast paced.\nFocus is instead placed on avoiding enemy attacks and navigating the environment, it's easier to compare it to a shoot 'em up in that sense rather than an action platformer.\n\nOverall it looks great and most attacks are telegraphed in a way that makes it feel like if it hits you; it was your fault. At least most of the time, there's a few kinks here like for example; fire eruptions on the floor can be hard to spot sometimes and enemies charging their attacks before they're finished spawning in.\nAfter completing the first 15 stages then seeing the next tileset was rather jarring, it looked out of place and I felt like it wasn't finished yet. Especially compared to the great look of the maps up until then. So on the grounds of it being in Early Access - I'll assume that it's not actually finished.\n\nWhen it comes to the sound and music, what's there is great but the music gets repetitive pretty quick. As the Early Access description says though, more sound and music tracks are upcoming. So I don't see it being a problem further down the line - but as it is currently, it's rather monotonous.\n\nThe story is delivered in dialogue boxes at the start and end of a level, Seraph comes across as not really having a defined personality (on top of being inside of a host body who also is her own person). Sometimes she comes across as thoughtful and caring and other times as callous and bloodthirsty. When the story shifts focus to the plot then it becomes more intriguing and makes me interested in learning more.\n\nAs far as Early Access games go, this game is in a good state. If they manage to work out the kinks in the self imposed 6 month deadline until final release - something that seems entirely doable - then it'll be a truly awesome game.\n\nGameplay video without dialogue: https://youtu.be/OGLV8T3oblk","April 28","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
