"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4887247/recommended/34410/","4887247","47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4887247/","115 products in account","Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a WWII-era stealth game in which you play as a Russian agent named Semion Strogov, a man tasked with eliminating espionage-related threats to the Soviet Union. The missions that you must accomplish range anywhere from gathering intel to assassination, with the locations in which you will be inserted range from German military camps to an English hospital. The areas are varied, and you never feel like the developers ran out of ideas.\n\nThe gameplay of Death to Spies is very similar to the Hitman games, with most of the stealth revolving around disguises. While crawling through bushes and vents are a viable way to play the game, using the game's disguise system is the most reliable way to play. The disguise system in this game is usually pretty realistic, and the AI is consistent when it comes to detecting you (I'm looking at you, Hitman 2 Japan levels), so you always know why your disguise did not work, and what you can do to improve it. Certain disguises don't work in certain areas, and if you take the clothes of a high-ranking officer, the guards will recognize that you aren't the person you claim to be. Adding to that, in the higher difficulty settings, blood-stained clothes and clothes with bullet holes are unusable, so stabbing and shooting is a no-no. Much more reliable weapons are the garrotte and chloroform if you prefer a non-lethal approach. The game doesn't seem to punish you for taking the lethal approach (as long as you are merciful to civilians), unlike many other stealth games out there.\n\nI can't speak much for the graphics of the game, since it doesn't seem to like my graphics card, washing out all the colors. This made the game look like an old movie, which in my opinion added to the atmosphere. The animations are nothing special, but they do their job and you can always tell what's going on. The music was mostly forgettable, but it always fits what's going on.\n\nOne thing I did not mention earlier is that this game is very difficult, and the poor shooting mechanics don't do anything to help it. Unfortunately, there's no tutorial in this game, so some of the more nuanced parts of the game must be learned through experience. I personally enjoy when games give me a challenge and didn't mind the lack of a tutorial that much. As for the shooting mechanics, this is a stealth game, so you shouldn't be shooting much anways. This game really shines when you're walking down the corridor of a German military base, doing your best to remain inconspicuous.\n\nThe thing that really sets this game apart from other games in this genre, and indeed, from other games period, is the amount of realism in this game. As I said earlier, if you stab people or shoot people, it renders their disguise useless, and people may recognize you if you take a unique disguise anyways. One of the options in the game is to make everyone speak their native language, adding to the atmosphere. Being a German speaker really helped me here, as most of the enemies in this game are German, and certain small hints can be drawn from their chatter. Strogov himself is, obviously, a Russian speaker, making all of the briefings and cutscenes in Russian with English subtitles. Death to Spies itself was a Soviet anti-espionage program during WWII, which I did not know originally.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Death to Spies: Moment of Truth. People calling it a rip-off of Hitman obviously didn't see the game for what it is: a realistic spy game set during WWII. A disguise system and assassination missions don't make a game a Hitman clone. Though the story is mostly nonexistent, and the game's soundtrack is mostly forgettable, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a fun stealth game that, as long as they iron out some of the wrinkles in (hopefully) future installments, could become one of my favorite games. This game is a definite recommendation, as long as you don't mind a difficult game.","May 24, 2014","true","15.5"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","61","65","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chapston/recommended/34410/","Chapston","Chapston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chapston/","90 products in account","If you like the Hitman series, have an interest in espionage or WW2 this game is for you. It is a bit dated now, and you can see this by the graphics and the UI however that doesn't harm the game in anyway as even now it is very playable.\n\nWEAPONS\n\nThe first reason I liked this game was the detail in terms of authenticity and gameplay. There is a large amount of historically accurate 'spy' weapons availiable including a Nagant silenced revolver and the classic silenced sten gun however if you are looking for a shooter this is not for you. Most of the weapons feel fairly weak - mostly because they are silenced but even the machine guns feel a bit 'odd' for example the STG 44 doesn't sound right and doesn't give a real kickback it should do, by affecting you physically, it instead just seems to tilt up when you fire. The guns are hardly the main meat of the game but for an authentic game such as this they could have done better.\n\nVEHICLES!\n\nMoving onto a positive note there are vehicles in the game, and correct me if i am wrong, but i do not think hitman or any other simular stealth games include the ability to drive vehicles whilst useing them as a tool to hide bodies or escape. Sure they don't drive very well but it is not a racing game and they are slow, but it is nice to have the option to hide a german officers corpse in the back of your bad-♥♥♥ opel blitz.\n\nAI\n\nThe AI is competant at what it does, the detection system is good - the sense bullet noises, if you are near them or in their line of sight and yet still allows you to use morphine or take out a guard from behind. There is always problems though-AI can be a bit stupid sometimes by repeatably charging into a room you are camping in whilst you gun 20 of them down, you cannot just walse through missions like this though as in the end they will pull back and wait for you, or 'lob' a grenade into your hiding spot.\n\nSTEALTH/TOOLS\n\nThe main component of any game of this genre is stealth i.e the ability to have to avoid, usually enemies, without being noticed. In Death to Spies moment of truth there is a variet of ways to do this...\n\nYou can go in quiet using morphine, silenced weapons, diversions and patience to outwit the enemy or you can play it on easy and run-and-gun, but the latter doesn't work often and why would you want to anyway? The stealth is statisfying but you don't have the ability to do much in the way of interesting tactics. The interactions you are given throughout missions are good but they can be hard to find sometime, I spent ages trying to work out how to get passed a party of german officers only to find that the plumbing had to the solution.\n\nGood points:\n\n-A Completely solid game, I have had no problems with running it and the aesthetic and the gameplay complement each other perfectly (although the art direction is nothing to write home about- but the normal 'trying for realism' graphics suite it well).\n\n- Authentic levels, objectives, weapons, uniform (there is disguises in the game).\n\n-Up to you in how you complete the mission, big level design with choices of which way to go and what you do and (I think) sometimes even say.\n\nBad points:\n\n-Lack of direction, doesn't really tell you the options you have to complete missions, and figuring it out as you go along on harder difficulties ends in death.\n\n-Boring mission objectives (Blow A up, kill B officer, find C secret documents - very cliche)\n\n-Bad gunplay\n\nOverall I had some fun with it, I would recommend it if you are remotely interested in this period of history (late WW2, early cold war), stealth games or simply a challenge (saboteur mode is hard - no disguises).\n\nIf you would like to learn more about this game message me on steam or if you have any possible ideas or improvements I could make to my reviews also message me.","November 27, 2013","true","10.5"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","2"

You are a russian agent operating behind German lines and accomplishing all sorts of tasks, ranging from killing high-ranked officers to sabotaging entire U-Boats. The graphics arent't up to date, but the game looks very nice. There's so much detail in everything and the game manages to create an extremely realistic and tense atmosphere! The Uniforms, the guard routines, the Nazi hierarchy and the layout of the levels... The 40s march music sounding from the radio and the Nazis themselves chatting in German (The German is perfect by the way, they hired native speakers). Not so perfect are the German signs and Book texts, but that won't bother you unless you're a native German speaker.\n\nDeath to Spies isn't your average shooter, it's a stealth game at it's finest. Simply drawing a weapon at the wrong time will get you killed in an instant.\n\nI would not recommend it for impatient people, because in some levels you may have to sit around for quite some time to figure out what you're supposed to do.\n\nI honestly don't understand why this game got so little attention when it was released...","May 4, 2014","true","29.3"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

After a couple of years I could finaly play it again, and it has aged well. Like a fine wine, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is best enjoyed in short sips. Take your time with it and feel how its taste brings you into another world.\n\nSet in WW2 and the early days of the cold war, you play as a Russian spy and infiltrate German bases and camps. There are also 3 missions in the USA, the UK and a Soviet base (with a bunch of filthy traitors! hrrrng!). The levels (except for the USA level) are AMAZING. Even tough the "objective zone" isn't always that huge, you have the feeling that you could travel the whole world from your current location. Detailed bases and vehicles decorate a realistic, living world that  really sucks you into the game. There are tons of weapons, uniforms, driveable vehicles and many different ways to solve a problem.\n\nTiny minus point is the German writting and speech in some of the levels, but this shouldn't bother anyone too much.","August 7, 2013","true","12.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

If you require a good game which involves planning, thinking, observing and acting at the right moment this game is for you. You really need to play the first one before hand which is now really cheap and just as good! The first one has a boot camp which introduces you to the franchise and gives you all the basic controls. This one just throws you in to continue the story! It has driveable vehicles, many weapons and objects to use at your disposal. You can use, steal and loot enemy weapons, uniforms (and get away with wearing them) and the enemy are none the wiser unless you pass  SS personelle or an Wehrmacht officer. This is a modern version of "Hidden and Dangerous" series which is my all time favourite but no longer obtainable or playable on recent versions of Windows. You choose your weapons, kit, equipment and even a backpack to carry extra things to help such as wire cutters, explosives and compass/binoculars ect ect.\n\nTakes forever to play and even longer to complete but at the end it's deffinitely worth it! Replayability is good and each mission has hours of different approaches. It's not a run and gun (although you can do this if you choose) if you wish to survive minutes or create a party conga line of enemies in a bunker doorway. Personally I give this game a 9/10 purely because the concept is genius, but the 1 it missed out on was because they have not made another one which is disappointing! No DLC or future anouncements of further franchise expantions which is a shame but does not cull the name of these two little beauties which are Death to Spies and Death to Spies - Moment Of Truth.\n\nGo on....make a party conga line of Nazis in a submarine base....you know you want to ;-)","August 6, 2014","true","22.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobobaggins/recommended/34410/","bobobaggins","Consigliere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobobaggins/","352 products in account","Russian, WWII-era Hitman.  I didn't really even know anyone had ever attempted to do something like Hitman. And what a brilliant mix, a Hitman game about killing Nazis!\n\nOkay, so first off, this game ran fine (Windows 7 x64 still), in widescreen at good resolution without any effort on my part whatsoever, all I had to do was disable depth of field to get rid of some nasty textures.  You can't even get most Hitman games to run in widescreen without doing all sorta funky hacks, and again, its a Russian game, most Russian games I've played required serious effort to get running on any modern system.\n\nThat outta the way. HOW DID I MISS THIS!?! I love the Hitman games, and this is arguably better than some of the old Hitmans, maybe even on par with Blood Money (maybe, I reserve judgement until I've finished the game).  I've never heard of Death to Spies until this sale, which really sucks because it does some things better than even Hitman does. For starters, if you shoot a dude anywhere but in the head, or if you slit his throat//stab him, the uniform he's wearing has bulletholes/blood stains, which are a dead-giveaway, so you can't use it.  Small, simple, brilliant. The objectives are a lot different, the primary focus isn't necessarily assassination like it is in Hitman, you're more of a spy than an assassin in many cases, you just have a license to kill and you USE IT =D\n\nSecond, this game rates your performance waaaayyyy differently, killing someone other than your designated target doesn't automatically bone you out of the highest ratings, its more about how professional, silent and clean you are. Strangle a guard and hide the body - and containers to put bodies in are rare in this game, you just have to dump them somewhere out of the way - and you're golden; make a mess, have a body get found, or set off an alarm though and your score is obviously penalized like most stealth games.  If they find a naked body you've taken the uniform for, they start looking for intruders wearing that uniform, making it useless and lowering your score.  However, you have a backpack, and you can actually carry disguises with you, again something we've never seen from Hitman. You have to do more than wear the clothes though, if you're disguised as a Nazi soldier, you need to swap out Russian weaponry for German weaponry, found on bodies usually, or you can choose to start the mission with German guns in most/all cases. If they see you using Russian guns while posing as a German sentry, their suspicion of you raises very quickly. Additionally, your dude can go prone and crawl, which is really useful in open, outdoor sections without generous cover (not to mention making sniping a hell of a lot easier).\n\nYou do have a non-lethal option, namely a bottle of chloroform that works similar to how it did in Hitman 2 though it has 5-10 uses and 1 use knocks out an enemy for the rest of the mission, whereas knockouts in H2 only lasted minutes. You can also just punch someone in the face, but its not as effective and is noisy. Also of note, you can actually drive vehicles in this game, which was never a thing in Hitman; its useful too since the maps are pretty big; you can even use a truck that has a canopy to hide a body and move it around. On the hardest difficulty, the ability to take disguises is removed entirely, which basically equates to some missions being impossible to get through without garroting a few patrols and guards, however you also get an automatic score boost, to rectify any loose ends you had to tie up.\n\nI'm excited for the third one, it originally failed a kickstarter I think, and its not the original developers or publishers, and its more of a spiritual successor than direct sequel since its a different main character and set in the Cold War, but they have something here, excited to see where they go with it ---\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/406720/","December 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Whistling to distract. Three stances with two movement speeds between them. Usable vehicles (with usable horns.)\nAccident systems.\nAt least one level with a straight up logistics puzzle.\nOh, and really solid, clockwork inspired music.\n\nMost impressively, easy difficulty has more spaced out patrols and scripted lures that don't exist on other difficulties, ensuring that even novices have more than a fair chance to understand the workings of the game.\n\nThis isn't for people who want a story with their game. Frankly, this isn't for people who want anything but a raw, enjoyable set of levels that end up being fun to play through.\nThe animations aren't the best, nor is the plot anything amazing, and the combat AI isn't fantastic. That said, if you're picking this up the odds are you're not looking for any of those things.\n\nIf you like stealth for stealth's sake, this is easily one of the best games you can pick up on Steam.\nIt's the expansion pack Hitman: Blood Money never got, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.","March 24","true","140.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","2"

It's a bit more graphically demanding. AI has decreased in quantity and increased in quality - there isn't that spamming of enemies and civvies on a tiny map that you got with DtS 1.\n\nThe fewer AI require more "fooling" though - you won't get by with just dressing up as an officer. You will have to dress up as several different character types throughout each level (civvie, worker, butler, soldier, officer, scientist, cop, FBI agent) and have the relevant paperwork in order to be granted access to various sections of the map. The levels and challenges are much more unique, so you won't be doing the same thing over and over again, but instead complete different tasks each mission (reconnaissance, assassination, kidnapping, sabotage, counterintelligence, intel theft).\n\nOverall, DtS: MoT is a shorter, higher-quality version of DtS 1 and is definitely worth playing.","November 25, 2014","true","17.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

So basically you are pretty much open to do whatever you want withthis game.\n\nWays to kill in this game :\n\n*Total stealth. - Sneak up on them and Garrotte, or Chloriform them.\n*Brutal Stealth. - Cut their throat, Beat them up with your fists, Hit them with countless blunt objects.\n*Non-Stealth. - Landmines, Booby trap bodies, Rig doors to explode, or set up countless "scripted events" to happen.\n*Stealth at a distance. Throw Knives. Throw Coffeecups, and otehr map objects. Use silenced guns (including silenced sniper rifles.)\n\nLots of startout items!!\nPoision\nFirst aid\nThrowing knifes\nGarotte\nChloriform\nlandmines\nGrenades\nHuge selection of guns.

There as several tweaks incuding the ability to carry a disguise in your backpack, the addition of yellow enemies whom get suspicious only if you get close.\n\nThe biggest change is the disguise system where its more about getting the right disguise for the task as opposed to going straight for the officer disguise, for example in the second mission the officer disguise is good for the 3rd floor however in the shipyard most enemies are suspicious towards the officer. However most of the time getting the officer disguise will do the job.\n\nSome negatives about the game are its length, there are only seven missions, a lack of tutorial, leaving players confused and struggling unless they played the first game, there is a visiual filter that gives the game a sepia filter, which looks extremely ugly in my opinion however you can get rid of it by disabling depth of feild also vehicles are not well utilised, they can be used in 3 missions only and are not too useful.\n\nThe biggest flaw was that the game didn't give you as much help as it should, sometimes I would get stuck and have to go to a guide to work out what to do. For example in one mission I needed to kick a bucket of water on my target to get him to a secluded location, however the bucket looked just like a normal prop and the map didn't highlight the location of the bucket leading to frustration.\n\nOverall if you liked the first game or enjoyed the brutal difficulty of Hitman 2 and Contracts you will enjoy this one, the game is just as unforgiving. Your freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives is less than the extent in hitman but more or less the same as the first game.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are better.\n-You have some freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives.\n-Unique Disguise gameplay is excellent, this and hitman are the only games that utilise this feature effectively.\nCons:\n-Can be confusing\n-Quite short\n-No Tutorial\n\n","June 9, 2014","true","47.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

A lot of the gameplay will be extremely familiar to you and you will enjoy it the same way you enjoyed Hitman. Hell, it's even got an "A new life" type of level where there's a house being guarded by the feds, and the game plays out like Hitman: Contracts, where you watch as Agnet 47 wakes up and then play through his memories of the missions that led up to this point.\n\nDeath to Spies has all of that.\n\nIf you haven't played Hitman, but you're interested in Death to Spies, the game basically works as a giant playground of strategic freedom. You enter the level, receive your objectives, and then the game stops holding your hand while you work out everything yourself. You choose what order you'll complete the objectives in, how many people you'll kill, and plant all kinds of traps to catch your enemy off guard.\n\nMy main problems with this game is that the controls can be a little clunky at times, and that CTRL+S quicksaves, for some reason. F5 already does that, game. I don't need another control to do that for me.\n\nOther than that, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth, is an exciting extension of Hitman that I would definitely recommend to any stealth strategy fans.","December 20, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You're a Soviet officer infiltrating Nazi bases, British codebreaker camps, etc, usually (but not always) to assassinate someone or to sabotage their government. It's not as visually impressive as the late Hitmans, but I think it's probably a lot more clever AI-wise.\n\nOne notable feature is the option to play any mission with disguises turned off, but with silenced weapons -- this basically turns the game from Hitman to Metal Gear Solid and often forces you to approach levels completely differently (and usually with a much higher casualty count).

It's incredibly difficult at times as the enemy AI is pretty smart and will recognize odd behavior (which can vary depending on which uniform you've disguised yourself in).  This is a game that takes stealthy undercover spy work very seriously. If you run-and-gun, you're as good as dead.\n\nThe best part is that you're free to complete your objectives however you see fit!  Say there's a high ranking Nazi official you've got to assassinate.  Do you want to plant explosives on the runway so his plane explodes when he lands or do you want to impersonate an SS officer, get the official alone and stab him?  How about take him out from a distance with a sniper rifle?

It does force the player to work slowly and deliberately most of  the time, which makes the few frantic moments in gameplay all the more so.

So far, i have not noticed many improvements upon the first game, although ive only played the first level of it. so in short it feels like a really long dlc to the first game with a few small improvements, only one ive noticed has been a slightly different disguise mechanic than the last game.\n\nEdit: started paying attention to the story, makes no sense whatsoever even though ive played the prequel, also evidently they added random backpack searches which, while not particularly dangerous are stressful when you are carrying something such as top secret merchandise that you just stole.","December 14, 2014","true","3.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Yes, the cut scenes have nothing to do with the missions at all, but I think they can be ignored as irrelevant to gameplay.  The tricky controls make gameplay challenging, since you can't just go around beating up everybody with your fists.  Each mission has multiple ways of completing the objectives (although there are inumerable ways to not succeed) and that gives it replayability.\n\nOf course you might just have fun challenging yourself to improperly play the game and figure out how to kill all the Nazis on the map.  That is fun too, and is worth the price.","May 4, 2014","true","20.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Prefer gritty, hardcore, super realistic tactical espionage action where getting caught usually results in you on the losing end of a very short firefight? Well, perhaps you've stumbled upon this diamond in the rough as I have. The game plays similar in some ways to the MGS series with many elements from MGS3 Snake Eater (backpack, etc); mini map with enemies and their field of vision represented by a much larger cone than in MGS, FOV cones shrink when you go prone and stop moving for a few seconds. It grows even tinier if you are in grass and can utilize your camo. There is so much more into figuring out how to beat this game on hardest difficulty as you cannot procure enemy disguises. It's doable though, a trail well hidden / disposed of, garrotted, and chloroformed bodies later and I was damn proud of myself for infiltrating that Nazi airbase near Prague and putting a stop to the prototype Nazi Me-163 new rocket type fighter on the first mission!

Since I love stealth game, this game is just right for my taste. It's pretty much like the Hit-man series but in  the war time. Enemie's AI is good even on easy level, so a low profile is always recommend, you are supposed to finish the job by changing uniforms, which means you are a ghost without anyone's notice. Like what I said, you are pretty much like agent 47.\n\nThough I had few glitches, happens when you stuck in the corner of wall, and sometimes guards raise alarm long after you take care of someone. But overall this game is awesome,it is quite like Hitman but not all. First you get the important point marked on your map.So instead of wondering around thinking where to start with, you have some hint so you will not lost. (Though the map usually is big and it's interesting to investigate most of the places) Also when you successfully changed your uniform,which means your identity, other guys will not notice you so don't worry someone else in the same uniform will blow you away. Likewise usually you have more than one way to get your job done, walking or driving, just remember to find the right angel make sure your enemy does not see you.\n\nHowever, like the latest Hitman game Absolution, the rating system is flawed. I shot my suppressed pistol to break a window so I could get in, but actually this lowers my grade since I made noise. ( Feel like I should get the highest rank but fails somehow everytime lol.)\n\nI know the team is creating a third game of Death to Spies, and after I tried the Demo which contains the first mission. I'd say I'm really looking forward and I'm glad to see the game feels the same but goes more smoothly. Great job,\n\n120% recommend.","June 30, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No its not worth 2$, im not even sure how this is fun. First of all this game has the worst controls in a game I have ever played. It has no tutorial and lets you find out your controls by rebinding all of them and seeing what they do for yourself. Its locked in a terrible third person and the animations are awful.\n\nOK but sure once you get past the terrible controls and graphics the game is pretty good right? No. I set this game on the second hardest difficulty and i'm not really sure what to say. You spawn in the woods with a guy on his knees by what I assume is a radio transmitter. You can see two german guys standing by a truck that im failry certain is a cube with one edge lower on the front end and a transparent recantgle for a window. If you sneak over to them and pull out your silenced pistol you can't even shoot them until you get within 5 feet or so because a red x appears over them if you aim at them. I took out my ppsh and expereinced the worst recoil in a game i have ever seen. After shooting 3-4 bullets your gun is effectively pointing at the sky, that is no exageration. You cant shoot beyond 3 bullets at a time. So now the two german guys know Im here trying to kill them. One crouches and starts strafing to the side extremely slowly while shooting at me with a mp40. He misses, and while he is doing that the other guy runs in zig zags toward the base because there is no ai pathfinding. I manage to kill the guy shooting at me after a full clip becuase it is not possible to aim. Then the alarm sounds becuase the other guy managed to zig zag his way back to the base and activate it.\n\nI decide to just go in guns blazing so I get in the VW or whatever they were standing by and start trying to drive. Its insanely bad driving but im not sure what i expected. The truck manages to hit a tree and I just get out only to be mowed down by 3 german guys.\n\nI try again where I instead just sneak towards the base and ignore the two guys in the woods, I go prone and crawl towards it but get spotted and end up running through the woods while nazis zig zag after me, then stop to shoot, realise i am out of range, get up again, and repeat the process. I never got past the first level, and im assuming it didnt get much better.\n\nPros\n- You can choose your equipment before a mission I guess\n\nCons\n-Terrible Graphics\n-Terrible Gunplay\n-Terrible AI\n-No Tutorial\n-The difficulty system is basically centered around the limitations to putting on people youve killed clothes.\n-Im not sure how you stealth kill people in this game\n-????\n\nConclusion - dont buy this game","November 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","12","0","0"

One day it came on sale and I thought "why not? time to get it".\nNow I regret not making this decision earlier.\n\nIf you are a Hitman fan YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME. It may not have the same level of polish and production values but it more than makes up for with amazing level design and a solid sneaking and disguising mechanic. In that respect it's actually better than Hitman.\n\nIt's much easier in this game to understand what your enemies are up to, who is detecting you and why. This eliminates almost entirely those situations that occured in Hitman where your cover would be blown for no apparent reason. It's not very realistic but it fits the gameplay really well. And you can always play on highest difficulty with no helpers. Still, even with the helpers, the game is difficult enough and very punishing if you don't take your time. This is not for people who lack patience.\n\nMy only dissapointment is that there are only 7 missions. Then again, they are extremely intricate and each one took me at least an hour to complete on my first playthrough (with some taking over two hours).\n\nOne other negative which personally doesn't bother me because it's not how I play this game is concerning shooting mechanics. They are bad. I mean really bad. They're good enough to get you out of a tight situation (a silenced Nagant is a dirty but effective way of disposing of a nozy nazi) but don't think you can shoot your way through missions.\n\nOverall though this is a great game and I'm eager to see what's next when DtS 3 comes out.","October 19, 2015","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some gameplay quibbles have been fixed like instead of certain guards breaking your disguise, only going into unauthorized areas with an unauthorized outfit will get you busted. Crouching counts as sneaking now so you dont have to move at a snails pace. One strange visual choice they made was to put everything in a sort of semi-sepia vintage filter. Changing depth of field off will get rid of it partially, but not fully. Not too big a deal though. Overall its definitely a step above the first in terms of complexity, but not length. Only 7 missions long. Like the first, some of those missions could take upwards of 2 hours depending on how you play it, but it still feels short.

NPC AI is very intuitive and boasts some personality—they are quick to catch on when something is amiss, To fool them will take practiced skill, patience, and a lot of game-saves. This is Splinter Cell meets Hitman, meets the original COD.\n\nOne thing Death to Spies is not, is a full blown FPS—the AI breaks down once a full on fire-fight ensues and the game mechanics simply aren’t suited for intense action. You may fire the occasional shot, but you'll mainly be sneaking around, collecting, quietly assassinating, sabotaging, poisoning, and changing your cloths often to avoid detection and gain access to restricted areas.\n\nAesthetically, the graphics and sound are good for the day—far from next-gen, but more than sufficient to create a compelling, immerse atmosphere where hours will pass before you know it. And although your objectives are clearly laid out, you'll find a moderately high replay value here, where you can go about your mission in a variety of ways.\n\nThe Score\nGameplay 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nSound 7/10\nFun Factor 10/10\nOverall 8.5/10","March 12","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
