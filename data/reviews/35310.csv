The animation when you run a zombie over is really funny as they cling onto the car. The gameplay is well done and keeps you engaged. Some of the game modes feel repetitive but overall it was a good experience. There is racing and free roaming in this game which makes it fun to play around with. This has everything a good horror driving game should have and more. I really enjoyed this game and if you want some crazy carnage and want to kill zombies at the same time then this is a game to definitely pick up.","October 20, 2013","true","9.4"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","28","39","0","2"

People who like Carmageddon will probably like this\nPositives:\nGood graphics quality. Really good I guess for the time of the release, no worse than in more recent Carmageddon: Reincarnation\nFun physics\nNice maps with destructive elements and stuff like ramps or tunnels to perform stunts\nCars eating zombies\nCars setting zombies on fire\nCars getting energy from eating and dismembering zombies for a nitro boost\nYou get to race and eat zombies with your car inside the Large Hadron Collider\nGame-appropriate music that goes well with munching zombies at high speed and wrecking opponents\n\nNegatives:\nAn incredibly stupid lore that is hybrid of partially being ripped off S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and adapted to the Cern environment. Serioulsy, if you are trying to get people to play who know what the LHC is, it would be better if you worked more on the lore.\nVery small selection of cars\nCampaign's plot is far below average, if the game took itself less seriously, the plot would have been more appropriate.\nColours in most places are far less vivid than in Carmageddon and for the amount of nonsense lore the game has, it takes itself too seriously. If it had more of Carmageddon's senseless fun, it would have been better.\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend to buy this game if you like killing zombies with cars and getting bonuses for that. But maybe better to buy this when on sale.","May 17, 2015","true","15.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","1"

Clutch is a post apocalyptic racing game that's geared just as much to racing as it is dull side events that feel like I'm a dog playing fetch. All of the races take place in three major areas, a small city, a neighboring freight yard and an underground network of tunnel tubes.\n\nClutch plays like other arcade racers, you have an accelerator, a brake, headlights, a respawn and a nitro boost. This boost of your runs on zombie blood. Sure you can still jump off ramps to refill your nitrous, but for the most part you need to be ramming into what were once your fellow human beings. Think of it as saving bullets at the expense of fuel. Well the game has neither, so just ram those zombies dead and boost away!\n\nIn terms of upgrades,you can purchase a variety of side slicers, bumper spikes and nitrous boosters. The boosters consume less fuel and last longer. The side slashers are automatic, they extend in an instant to give you extra reach to get that sweet zombie nitrous nectar. These upgrades are all vehicle specific and four hours into the game, i feel like I'm at the last event and there are only three vehicles with one skin each. Even with only one skin, you can still select your skin, which means there has to be more. You'll have to unlock the upgrades by winning events and then purchase with cash that you'll get from winning races, events and destroying other racers.\n\nThere are giant glowing spheres in several key locations. Each color does something different, gold gives you more cash, blue refills your nitrous, green either repairs your car or completely repairs your car. That's right if your car runs out of health it explodes and you lose the event. Purple gives you three times the damage.\n\nSomething interesting to note is that the vehicle models take damage, which is cool. Blood covers your hood and turns your headlights red. Your car lights on fire when its low on health, but even when you are repaired to full health, your car still looks damaged.\n\nIn some races there are wind tunnels that will dash you forward faster than any nitrous boost. In other events such as demolition derby there are air vents that will launch your vehicle into the air. It adds to the arcade feel and makes me want to like the game more than I do.\n\nIts similar to other street racing games where most races are closed circuit and block off sections of the city. I can only imagine the logistics of flying in arrow signs and heavy cement blocks during a time of zombie crisis to setup a race course. One of the first problems is that the arrow signs when racing can be knocked down and by the third lap, you need to have every dark corner memorized that you turn here. There is a mini map, but it does little more than show you yourself, other racers and where spheres are located\n\nRather than selecting each event from a menu, you need to drive to them, following an arrow at the bottom of the screen to guide you. In one way, that could make the game more immersive, but in another, its a prolonged stay in a city that you'l lalready be competing in over and over.\n\nThe best side missions are the demolition derbies. Like the races, you face off against five other competitors. Other cars, a hum vehicle and a giant piece of construction equipment to keep it interesting. This piece of equipment runs as well as one of the other cars. You can flip other cars over and ram them. Of course if you're driving a low to the ground vehicle, you can watch as they use you as a ramp. The challenge here is destroying three or more vehicles before the time runs out.\n\nCompleting one even with a rank of T(een), M(ature) and C(hild?) in each event will unlock a the next. The game is more than races, and for me that's where it takes a wrong turn. I'm happy if a racing game has more than races, but the vast majority of these feels the same, but with a twist for difficulty sake.\n\nIts all stuff like collect X number of artifacts before time runs out. To get more time, you touch the floating artifacts with your car. For each one you touch, a new one spawns and your arrow will tell you where its located. You can also see it on your mini map too, but if its out of range, you'll rely on the arrow anyway. One of these events early in the game stopped me after completing each tier of collecting Y number of artifacts and then I went onto the next tier. This event lasted far too long, which I suppose is why the game cuts in and says done with this tier, would you like to do something else?\n\nOh but that's just where the formula begins! Other events include saving sports cars from zombies. The cars spawn in one at a time and you need to rescue the car before its destroyed. Then there's a how many zombies can you kill before time runs out? To add time to your clock, you need to run over special bio hazard zombies that will douce your vehicle with some blue liquid to drain its health. You need to kill 100 or so zombies or fail. These zombies are sparse, but you can usually kill three at a time.\n\nThe game keeps ramping up the challenge with these side missions. The missions add other cars to hinder you. Others have you competing against other cars to see who can get the most artifacts. This would feel more fun if it was in the daytime and I could see where the objects spawn rather than relying on my arrow. Then I could get some strategy involved so I could see this and that car can reach the object long before I can, so I should hang out here and wait for the next one.\n\nThe final event forces you to clear out all zombies from a tunnel either in thirty, twenty or ten minutes, depending on what rank you want. This alone is tedious enough, but the fact that its dark and you need to rely on headlights makes it worse. To top that off after a few minutes, the game sends three cars after you.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up and play with no complex mechanics. It plays well on a keyboard or 360 controller. One problem I do have is the chase cam is relegated to four angles (front, right, left, rear) rather than having full control. Hey I'm still happy there are four angles. There's also a variety of cameras to chose from, hood, bumper, far chase cam, near chase cam and so on.\n\nAs for the graphics and music, both are worth mentioning for both good and the bad. The music is some mix of 50s and 60s style surfer rock'n roll. There is a little more diversity than that, but it got old fast.  The graphics do look convincing. Its more of a beautiful blue sky over a dreary city. The zombies and gore are fair and convincing, but no one is playing for the zombies.\n\nI'm really on the fence about this one. From a technical standpoint, the game is fun, easy to play, but its a little too easy. So its good for children other than the whole zombie gore factor. There's no wow factor that other racers have. A wider variety of courses would have been appreciated rather than racing in the same city for two hours and then the other two areas for an hour or so a piece.","September 12, 2015","false","4.3"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","21","36","4","2"

Because the comparison is so obvious I just needed to compare the two.\nThe main difference, aside from the graphics ofcourse, is that the Carmageddon series are way more extreme. In Clutch you will be killing zombies instead of humans. Carmageddon is a lot faster and the maps are bigger and more exciting which also results in more extreme and higher jumps. Carmageddon's cars are more fun and overall there's more humour in the game.\n\nOverall Carmageddon beats Clutch on every level. That doesn't mean this game is bad, far from it. Like I said before, the maps are not as interesting and can be pretty boring with lots of grey. Aside from that, the graphics are obviously better than the first 3 Carmageddon games so this game could be a pretty good game to relive those days.... weren't it for the fact there's a new Carmageddon (Reincarnation) coming up (still in Early Access).\n\nClutch is a cheap(er) choice but if you got some money to spend, Carmageddon: Reincarnation might be your better choice which also includes the 3 classic Carmageddon games.\n\n\n\n","January 6, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Granted it has a few gems to it. I mean come on, who doesn't like fast cars and killing zombies at the same time.\nThe game mechanics are generic but the physics are believeable enough. The hud is extremely confusing unless you pay close attention and die so many times in demolition. Demolion mode has some quirks to work out with the A.I. but otherwise generally decent.\nNow this is  personal gripe so take it with a grain of salt, I like customizing my cars....alot. From moving the decals to upgrading pistons in the engine. This game just gives you paint job with no choice in decals whatsoever. However, you can upgrade yur car's weapons which is decent....It's not.\nAnd getting new cars is a challenge in itself considering you have to litteraly beat the everlasting hell out of the other car you want. And even then, there may be the case your car is slow enough to be overtaken by a snail  that the other car can leave you in in it's dust blood and zombie infested wake.\n\nAll in all the game itself had potential, and it could have used some major developing before being turned loose, but the mediocre customization, confusing as hell story, and difficulty of getting something better than that clunker you get at the start almost make this game dead in the water.\n\n4/10 "The Diamond in the Rough zombie driver."","February 1, 2014","false","6.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Sure, the races take place in a zombie-plagued future, but your tasks are essentially the same as in every other arcade racer out there, just with a "STALKER-ish" paint job.  There's fixed checkpoint races, (semi-) random checkpoint races, demolition derbies, "ram the other racer" races, and variations on these themes.  The fact that you're mowing down zombies between point A and point B is kind of exciting at first, but then you realize that there's far better arcade racers out there (say, the first GRID) and far better mow-the-peds-down racers out there (the old, but still vital, Carmageddon).

Zombies...how lame. I sure am sick of zombies in video games these days…oh okay, this game came out in 2009. "I guess it might be fun for an hour or two." And it is…for about two hours this game is pretty fun. Then you’ll be like, running down zombies in your spiky car, and you’ll think to yourself 'this game sure is incredibly repetitive even for a racing game’, and then you’ll turn it off, and then you’ll uninstall it, and then you’ll forget about it forever.\n\nIf you spend $10 on this game…don’t spend $10 on this game, because it’s worth about a buck twenty-five tops. Not to say that there's anything wrong with this game though. I mean, the controls are good and are somewhat reminiscent of Daytona, the graphics although outdated aren't bad looking, the soundtrack is acceptable and fits the carnage, the racing is decent, and there are various modes to play such as straight up racing, demolition derby, and other zombie hit em’ up type challenges. But still, even with the diversity in modes, this game still won’t entertain you after a few hours. Maybe if the developers got off of their high horses and lowered the price somewhere closer to a buck twenty-five then I could maybe recommend this game for the few hours of entertainment that it will dish out. But no, they insist on asking for $10 for this zombie racing game that was originally released over 6 years ago; which is basically just a newer, inferior version of Carmageddon. Darn it, now I kind of want to play Carmageddon.\n\nThe best part about this game is how it tries to shove its awful story directly down your throat; presented before each challenge in stylish dialogue boxes made up of terrible writing that sounds like some drunken Russian wrote it. “Oh, what’s that? Everyone in the city is zombie? You guys want to race? Oh yeah, and we can also go around helping people being attacked in their cars by zombies.” Give me a break, why can’t these people just drive away on their own? Their cars work fine, and they do drive away when you help them anyway! And wait a minute, I thought everyone in the city was a zombie except me? On second thought, I can’t even recommend this game for a buck twenty-five. No, no, this game is worth more like forty nine cents; which is about what I paid for it; so I guess I can’t be too mad.","January 5, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The handling is pretty smooth and there's a clever mechanic whereby hitting zombies gives you nitro, meaning that swerving into as many zombies as possible is often the fastest way to get around.\n\nUnfortunately, once I unlocked a faster car and got to some of the larger races, I realized there's some incredibly blatant rubber-banding going on and it absolutely killed the game for me. It's frustrating as hell to get out in the lead in your zippy little sports car and gun the nitro only to have a hummer zip past you. This alone pretty much ended my interest in the game.\n\nThere are some other problems. There are a lot of side missions to do for cash to buy upgrades, but they're all variations on either hunting artifacts or smashing zombies and it gets old really quickly. There's very little feedback or information (not even a spedometer) and things are really rough around the edges. For example, the UI may or may not display your objective progress depending on how it's feeling at that moment.\n\nHonestly, without the rubber banding this would have been a fun if slightly clunky semi-open world zombie-murderin' racer. As it is, it's just not worth investing the time in completing dull side missions and upgrading your car just to have the game decide that you should be in third place now.","February 9, 2014","false","4.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"
