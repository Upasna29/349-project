The goal is to escape each level by powering the engines that enable the exit. Different surfaces effect how your ball moves and some blocks can be destroyed to open new pathways. There are loads of levels and the bronze, silver, and gold times to beat will provide replayability for the completionists.\n\nI played this with keyboard and mouse for a YouTube video because I didn't have a controller available. The game recommends a controller and I think that is probably the best way to play it. The levels are quite challenging and I think it will be difficult to get gold scores in all of them. The game is a Unity game and is lacking some expected options such as volume control for the music (it can either be on or off), but the music is only present on the menu screens. Some ambient music would be a good addition. Some of the graphics on the menu screens seem a bit unpolished. I enjoyed it and will play more on a machine that has a controller connected.\n\nCheck out my first 20 minutes with the game in my Twenty Minute Tryout video on YouTube...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NSofnqC4jOg","April 4","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Not a huge fan of the textures of the stage and the balls, but the gameplay is fun enough. Kind of wish it was zoomed out a little bit so you could see more of the maze at once, but then again it does create for more of a challenge but not seeing it, well then I accidenlty pressed space and found out you could lol\nIt really started getting crazy when spaces "fell" making the levels alot harder and resemble more of marble madness or the holes in labrinth.\nI like that right out the jump you can just skip to any level your heart desires, But at the same time it leaves you with nothing to earn besides the medals on each level.\nI know its harder to integrate but I would of like a story of some sort. The music is mediocre, its not bad, but its not great either.","April 12","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
