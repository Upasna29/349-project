So what's good about this game, and what's not. Well..\n\nPros:\n- a little art of slightly undressed women, i guess..\n\nCons:\n- Horrible soundtrack, repeats every god damn minute\n- Uninspired writing, with grammar mistakes and dull language\n- Subpar art at best\n- Writing that tells a rubbish story without more or less any substance or reason\n- Throwing in lines about killing people for fun + lesbian and incest things without explaining why, and without it adding anything to the story. Just having it there for the lol's i guess\n\nThat's more or less what this game is, i would not reccomend buying it. Not even at this price, simply because you would be wasting your time. And as a final note, you can change three sound settings in the options menu. You can change music, speech and "effects". Yet, the only sound in-game is a really annoying soundtrack... Wonder where the other sound elements are, maybe they are in the next game.. If you want to look at it some more, you can check out my youtube video of it below.\n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/FkADB9gC1Rk","April 23","false","0.3"," 115 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","115","130","5","5"

Well, it's a VN that supposedly "follows up" the story from the game I Am Caligula. It definitely follows in I Am Caligula's footsteps in terms of absolutely awful writing, grammar, and spelling. The story reads a lot more like a poor fanfic (or, in this case, "real person fiction" would be the accurate term). You have the original character Lucca who is apparently the favourite slave of Drusilla.\n\nI cannot suggest Drusilla Dreams at all, and I highly suggest you run far, far away from it. There are FAR better VNs out there that cost less than this (and this already does not cost very much). If you want to find out more about the real Drusilla and Caligula, go to wikipedia and don't support this game. Also be warned that there is a fair bit of sex talk in the short amount of time this VN will take. It's something that makes me question why this game doesn't have some sort of age gate on it, but what do I know in terms of that I suppose.","April 23","false","1.3"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","52","60","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aviddking/recommended/458060/","aviddking","Joonysuke Higashikata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aviddking/","355 products in account","So, after bickering with someone that seems to believe this... "Thing" is actually good. I took the liberty of wasting $0.64 just to see how garbage this mess really was. AND BOY IS IT GARBAGE!\n\nPROS:\nIf you're into incest and lesbianism, then this is for you.\nIf you have poor eyesight, then the art style can be actually quite refreshing and worth noting for it's "intricate" design.\nIf you like your games less than an hour long, and about the rate of completion on par, if not surpassing 'Gone Home', then is a worthy investment.\nBuy this game if lighting dollars on fire is a natural pass-time for you.\nIt has multiple endings.\n\nCONS:\nAs soon as you start up the game, you're greeted with a screen devoid of any audio.\nThe UI, if you can call it that, looks like vomited feces that has pieces of corn in it of varying widths.\nSpeaking of audio. I've not once heard any voiceovers, and the background music gets grating after the second loop... Which loops pretty often if you're a slow reader like I am. Fortunately, it has more than one track.\nIt's riddled with spelling errors, and poor punctuation, you'd almost think this was made by a bunch of Weeaboos with a love for history *COUGH*. Excuse me, I have an allergic reaction to my own irony.\nThe ability to make decisions happens once in a while, and dictate when and how your ending will play off. If you think that's normal, you'd be right... Except if you spacebar'd through the monotonous text, then decisions mean nothing since the game ends as quickly as it began.\nI'm not very good at history or linguistics, but I'm pretty sure Romans didn't talk like these people. I'm not even refering to the fact that English probably wasn't their primary language.\nRemember those endings I mentioned earlier? Yeah, there's probably like 4-8 (I only encountered 3 of my own) endings, and each one is just a history lesson about the two protagonists. I'm referring to Caligula, and Drussila. Oops... SPOILERS! Like it matters...\nSpeaking of Caligula. He's in this game for some reason, which contradicts the whole point of Drussila "overthrowing him", considering that in one of the history lessons that preceeds one of the endings, it mentions he passed the throne to Drussila after falling ill. Hmm....\nThe text box sucks. It's far bigger than it needs to be 90% of the game, and when text does fill the window entirely, it's welcomed by its co-pilots, BAD GRAMMAR & PPFT-WHO-NEEDS-WORD-WRAP.\nRemember how I said the art style is great for those with poor eyesight? Now, if you can accurately see your screen, and actually have artistic taste, then you'll probably agree the characters and the accompanying background look atrocious. I mean, most DeviantArtist's would likely agree that it looks "nice", but this isn't DeviantArt.\nIt kicks actual Visual Novels in the balls for being better at being a VN than this monstrosity. By that, I mean it isn't a Visual Novel-- Because it's not the length of a novel... Not even a Light Novel.\nThere's controller config in the options......... Why?\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf I can get my money back, I likely will proceed in doing so. Even if it's a measly $0.64. That 64 cents was spent to prove a point. The point has been made, and I'd rather go back and play Zombie National Park before I play another "game" by this company again.

And unless it turns out I was missing something here I strongly suspect it'll also be my last.\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high.  I figured this would probably be some sort of Roman history fan fiction, but in less than 20 minutes I think I explored ALL of the possibilities and got all of the endings (4 or 5 I think).  Choices really didnt matter - this seriously lacks any sort of depth.  Ends after 2-3 "choices"...why does this even have a "save" option???","April 23","false","0.3"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","30","38","3","7"
