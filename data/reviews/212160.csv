I have experienced the game from 1-80, and currently have a level 80 character, as long as 60-70 for most other characters. So all of what I have to say is from experience.\n\nPros\nCombat is engaging and skillbased.\nEngine can be funny at times.\n\n\nCons\nNexon is a terrible company.\nThe community is full of trolls and elitists.\nEconomy fluctuates rapidly without rhyme or reason.\nPay2Win.\nUnbalanced classes.\nEarly-Endgame is intimidating and unrewarding.\nProgression becomes incredibly difficult.\n\nVindictus by definition is a Korean-made Hack 'n' Slash action game, with a choice of 8 current character classes (one upcoming) that each mostly fill a niche in the game as it stands. Storywise? The game is lacking. It's apparent that the voice acting in cutscenes are terribly synced, with zero enthusiasm whatsoever. Not to mention, it barely makes sense, it's tough to relate to any of the characters, and questing/story has devolved into a way to level up faster. As far as mechanics go, the game is amazing. Early on, the game guides you along in combat, but hits a wall in skill requirement once you begin to transition into endgame (Level 60-80). This leads to a challenging, engaging experience, as you require quite a bit of skill, and knowledge of both your character and the boss in order to succeed. Example being the solo videos out there on YouTube, which are quite impressive. Vindictus currently runs on source engine, the physics can be wonky at some times, however. With such things as clipping, or bulging polygons extending throughout the map, or a monster getting launched into space for no reason whatsoever. These can lead to much hilarity. The problems in Vindictus however, are too large for me to be able to enjoy this game anymore.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about your experience from beginning to end. So you start up Vindictus. 8 characters to choose from, how exciting! Can you change their genders? Though this is something that is common in most MMOs, no. Can I change my appearance? Your options in the beginning are very limited, if you want to change up the look of your character, expect to pay $20 or more on just that. Now let's discuss the balancing of the characters, and the roles they play in Vindictus. Though this topic is very short-lived. The balancing of the game is handled very haphazardly. Currently, Hurk and Kai hold the position of godtier within the game. Where everyone else is disregarded. So if you're looking for stats, choose those two. So you've chosen your character! Time to get into the game! But wait, why don't I have any money? Well, that's because Nexon decided it would be a great idea to gut the early game by preventing gold gains from 1-25. Why? To combat botters. This is concerning however, because the earliest parts of a game are usually the most important to ensure people stay around. Surely the game will pick up right? Correct, the game does end up picking up once you are able to make some money, and have gained a general bit of knowledge about your character. Sadly, this is also when Vindictus transitions into a grindfest. Your experience at this point will consist of rushing through the "storyline", leveling up with barely any money, until you finally hit a brick-wall -- endgame. Endgame in Vindictus is atrocious. If you're not willing to expend any real currency within the level 60-80 range, don't expect to be progressing at all, unless you're incredibly lucky with drops. This is where players frequently quit, if they haven't already in the beginning. As the game becomes frustrating and unrewarding as it attempts to milk you of your money. Upgrades are incredibly hard to come by, and risks can leave you with absolutely nothing. Only the longterm players have stuck around at this point, when the game becomes a social hub for them.\n\nThe community itself is terrible. New players on the nexon forums are frequently driven away when attempting to ask questions. Which in itself is filled with trolls, and sarcastic elitists. Don't even get me started on the ingame community. Where if you don't meet the standards of the host, you can be kicked out without hesitation. So yes, the game itself is also filled with elitist jerks. Though it's to be expected out of any game, I have not seen any community similar to Vindictus in this aspect.\n\nNow, let's talk about Nexon. Nexon is notorious for treating its players terribly. Send in a ticket? We'll answer with an automated message then get back to you after a few months. Concern about bugs and patches? There's a chance we'll even consider reading about your concerns, and if we do, it's likely we'll do nothing about it. However, here's a poorly designed event to hopefully make you forget about all of these problems. Updates? Maybe we'll release a bit of content after half a year, of course we won't tell you anything about it. Over my time with Nexon products, I'm ashamed I've stuck around with their games for so long. If Vindictus were to be handed over to another corporation, I'd gladly come back, but the way that Nexon is handling Vindictus is slowly killing the game.\n\n\nTL;DR Vindictus is slowly dying. Fun for a while, but then you hit a brick wall.","November 22, 2014","false","817.2"," 835 of 915 people (91%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","91","835","915","46","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/recommended/212160/","Farlander13","Farlander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/","445 products in account","Vindictus is a textbook example of how Nexon operates.\nThey take a well designed game, tear out content, and set up a fiendish pay2play and pay2win system.\nVindictus follows this pattern to the letter.\n\nThe game itself is rather well designed. Engaging, live action, hack and slash combat is what Vindictus is all about, and the actual gameplay is pretty fun.\nHowever, as you'll notice fairly early on, this game is absurdly grindy, and super repetitive.\nWithin all the areas, the difference between one level in a certain area and another level in the same area is the boss at the end...and that's it. You'll run the same path through the same map each time, fighting the same mobs each time, and doing the same things each time, until you reach the boss, which is usually marginally different from the last. (Though most times only marginally.)\n\nNexon has taken great care to rip out most of the gear our friends in Korea and Europe use.\nIn Korea and Europe, options abound for endgame gear, which greatly reduces grind.\nIn NA, unfortuately, the only endgame gear option is "Everlasting" gear, which can only be obtained by finding a rare item in a raid dungeon (which you can only do 3 times per week) which has a drop rate of below 0.0000001%.\n(Subsequent patches have added other gear options, but Nexon has nerfed those gear options, to perpetuate the need for Everlasting gear.)\n\nApparently, Nexon seems to think, "If we prevent the Americans from being able to get to the endgame and "win" they'll play forever." I am living proof of their ignorance.\n\nAnd then, as a final insult, if you do manage to get the endgame gear, against all odds, your gear is worthless unless it's enhanced. Unlike many other companies, which have moved on to more player friendly enhancment models, Nexon still clings stubbornly to the age old system that threatens to destroy your items if special "protecting" items are not used.\nIn this case, those "protecting" items cost 25 dollars in Vindictus. 25 dollars! And what do these protecting items do?\nThey protect your item ONCE, and are consumed regardless of success or failure. Nexon will charge you, literally, hundreds of dollars just for enhancement alone, which is practically mandatory if you want to be able to do anything against the endgame bosses.\n\nSo basically, if you want to do ANYTHING in this game beyond just mindlessly leveling your characters, you'll need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get anywhere.\n\nIt makes me very sad, because Vindictus could have been a good game. I could have enjoyed playing Vindictus for years to come, but sadly, the evil of Nexon has corrupted yet another game...more wasted potential.\n\nIn short, Vindictus is yet another soulless machine designed to suck up as much cash as it can, and drive away anyone whos pockets aren't deep enough to keep up with its demands.","November 7, 2014","false","15.6"," 1,440 of 1,613 people (89%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","89","440","1","72","67"

There is an IP lock for a good reason. If you live elsewhere, look out for the European, Korean, Japanese or Chinese (<- no IP lock on this one!) version of the game depending on where you live. There are plenty of guides online that can help you get into any of the servers I mentioned, along with English patches.\nSo, I’m known as Penguin. If you use the forums, or play on the West server, you might know me +hello. I don’t usually write reviews, but after seeing negative reviews only exaggerate on the negative points, I decided to write this. For the record, I started playing Vindictus on and off since open beta in 2010. Yes, scroll up and check that release date.\nPROS:Gameplay, gameplay and did I mention gameplay?\nExtremely skill-based\nExtensive armor customization/Fashion simulator 2015\nUnique combat style for each character\nAmazing graphics\nAmazing soundtrack\nSo much free stuff from events\nGame has a learning curve; it takes EFFORT to get goodCONS:RNG, RNG, and did I mention RNG?\nHourly lag\nBots\nBadly optimized\nLimited character customization\nPVP is unbalancedNEUTRAL:Peer2peer system\nCash shop\nTwo ends of the community\nGrinding/Farming\nGame has a niche audienceGameplay:\nSimply amazing. This is the main reason anyone plays Vindictus. As far as I am aware, there is no f2p mmorpg on the western market that even comes close to how fluid and enjoyable the combat system Vindictus has to offer. The game runs around a normal/smash combo system where you use left/right clicks (or j/k keys or your gamepad buttons) to control your character. Unlike your traditional mmo, there is no tab-targeting, and your quickslots are mainly for potions and consumables. I fell in love with Vindictus’ combat system 5 years ago. 5 years later, I still love it. For comparison purposes, Vindictus is like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls.\n\nExtremely skill-based:\nAs discussed in the above post, Vindictus is a non-targetting action mmorpg. Raiding involves learning how to use your character’s survival mechanic to survive the attack patterns each boss has. Unlike many other action mmos on the market, a fraction of a second is enough to determine whether you survive or die to a boss. Something I heard from Junyoop, a relatively famous player and streamer of Vindictus KR (Mabinogi Heroes): ”in many mmos, if you play the class that has a shield without equipping the shield, it is impossible to survive. However in Vindictus, you can play the character with a shield (Fiona), and still do extremely well without equipping the shield”. As someone who mains Fiona, it’s true. You can play shieldless Fiona and survive solely with your invincibility-frameless roll, granted you have the skill. There are a few instances of sandbag bosses (Lakoria, Kraken head, Pantheum), but for the most part, facetanking raid bosses will most likely end with you dead.\n\nExtensive armor customization/Fashion simulator 2015:\nNeed I say more? Each equipment set has an extremely unique appearance, with most equipment having three dye slots that you can customize. You can even cosplay your favorite characters from whatever game/anime/TV/movie using the armor sets and dye system available in-game [and you can acquire the look you want using ONLY in-game gold!](click here[vindictus.nexon.net] for some examples). Seriously, Vindictus can may well be fashion simulator 2015 :D.\n\nAmazing soundtrack\n‘nuff said. Especially raids. Samples: one two\n\nRNG, RNG, and did I mention RNG?\nProbably the only real legitimate concern about the game. Loot is RNG, your damage has (slight) RNG, enhancing/enchanting your gear is RNG. Update: seal shop is here, you will be able to get your level 80 weapon within a week of raiding. In addition, Purple tier regina (Lv90) gear is dirt cheap.\n\nBadly optimized\nVindictus was developed on the Source 1 engine. As a result, the game mostly runs on one core, resulting in your modern multicore processor taking performance hits (Intel runs better than AMD for this). As far as I am aware, there are no plans on moving to the newer Source 2 engine. DevCat has tried to remedy this issue by adding multicore support for raid hosts, and the function works amazingly when it does decide to work, but the multicore function is still in beta and can be buggy.\n\nPVP is unbalanced\nBecause Vindictus was intended to be a PvE game. PvP was only added because of popular demand. Devcat has made some modifications to PvP in an attempt to balance the characters, but it isn’t quite enough. It’s still fun though.\n\nCash shop\nCosmetics, protection items, RNG boxes (don’t buy these, ever), pets, self-revives, temporary equipment, outfitters, consumables, VIP service. Nothing game-breaking here. Vindictus is F2P, how do you think it survives? I will discuss everyone’s favorite topic of “pay2win?” at the end.\n\nTwo ends of the community\nLike every other game, there are nice people, elitists/scumbags and the silent people who just enjoy the game. As of late, I haven’t seen many elitists nor attack requirement boats, which is really nice. The silent people who just play the game take the majority though.\n\nGrinding/Farming\n“This is a Korean MMO, it’s OBVIOUSLY a grindfest” …. In terms of leveling: not really, especially with how the low level content has been streamlined. Back in 2010, it took me a solid 8-10 hours to get to level 12. Now, it takes me 2 hours. Exp is no longer split between party members, and story quests give ridonkulous amounts of exp. Of course, there still exists some form of grinding, as this is an MMO, but seriously, unless you have zero tolerance for any kind of grinding, Vindictus isn’t much of a grind as you think it to be.\n\nSo, is Vindictus pay2win? My answer is a big, fat NO. ”But so many of the other reviews say that Vindictus is pay2win”. Go read the comments of those reviews. No reviewer has ever brought any evidence where players MUST pull out their wallets to advance in the game. Here are a few definitions of pay2win and how Vindictus does NOT meet most/all criterion.\n\nGames that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.\nAs the saying goes, a dead DPS is no DPS. You can have God-tier gear and still die to lack of skill, AND get out-dps’d by a skilled player with moderate gear.\n\nAbility to purchase high-end gear with your wallet\nUh no? Unless you count the 2 day temporary lv sets, which are easily nothing in comparison to what you can acquire by actually playing the game. RNG boxes? Sure, they contain “high-end” gear, but I highly advise that you stay away from them. The rates on those boxes are crap for a reason.\n\nAbility to get something/where that a non-paying player will never acquire without spending real cash\nOne thing. Prime outfitters. That is all, and the bonuses that come from prime outfitters have over regular outfitters (that can be obtained for free) are 200 att, 2 balance and in-town movement speed, which at end-game, is quite negligible. Otherwise, everything stat-wise a paying player can acquire is acquirable by a non-paying player.\n\nPS: I sent in 2 tickets recently, both got answered within two business days. They were not NX related.","July 2, 2015","true","873.1"," 290 of 313 people (93%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","93","290","313","24","24"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AliceMargatroid/recommended/212160/","AliceMargatroid","Master of Puppets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AliceMargatroid/","142 products in account","I feel it's time to redo this review since it's been a while and I've had more time to polish my idea of Vindictus. Let's jump right in.\nLike I said in my previous review, Vindictus provides great combat immersion due to animations and combat mechanics. When you strike an enemy, unless it's a boss/miniboss, it's going to flinch or get knocked back. The combat feels weighted and many of your attacks feel meaningful rather than simply standing in front of a mob and pressing a few keys.\nThe dodge mechanic is vital to your survival and makes for a good system. Each class has a nice dodging/absorbing mechanic which allows you to keep up in the fight. This adds to the weighted feeling because it means you have the opportunity to avoid damage rather than be forced to take it just because an enemy swings in your general direction. Though not completely precise, it still works wonders for the general feeling of combat.\nAnimations and models are absolutely lovely. Nothing really feels stiff, every enemy has life to them. Devcat's animation studio is fantastic and I would love to see more beautiful animation like what they've provided with vindictus.\nThe music in Vindictus is incredible. The boss battles, the music in towns, it all feels fitting. There's not much else to say on this matter, I love the music.\n\nNow for the reasons I can't recommend this game.\n\nNexon. Ohhh, Nexon. Why must you be such a terrible publisher? Nexon is one of the worst MMO publishers to date, generally ignoring their userbase and not paying attention to critical issues in their games until it's too late. Their customer support is downright impossible to work with. Pray you do not get hacked, for you will be waiting on customer service for likely months, if not years.\nBoats are incredibly reliant on Peer to Peer connections, which can cause significant latency issues in a game about precision timing depending on the class. You could end up down and out before you even realize you got hit if you have bad latency. While multi-processing has improved on this, it is still incredibly buggy and may or may not function at all.\nIf you're not incredibly lucky, you will never get to participate in later game content. Most people require you to have at least 16k ATT/M.ATT in order to participate in the raids of Annwyn. If you're like the commonfolk, you probably will only have about 13-14k when you're able to participate in these raids. These require you to now find methods to get stronger. Which would be fine... if not for the risk of losing everything.\nLet's start with the grind for better gear. On the one hand the game has lasted long enough for some good later-game gear to get cheaper. However, most of the gear you need to GET to those tough raids are... in those tough raids, incredibly rare/expensive, or require a grind that lasts for weeks. Later locations require you to run through multiple maps, sometimes back and fourth, to progress. It's similar to how it used to be, but has changed significantly. These locations are much larger and can't be navigated nearly as quickly. The main offenders of this are the Twilight Desert and Moonlight Peak.\nNow let's move on to enhancements/enchantments. Enhancements allow you to gain boosts to your weapons/armor up to a certain degree. You use enhancement stones in order to do this, and enhancements can be done up to 15 times. However, you risk decreasing the enhancement, resetting it, or destroying your weapon/armor as you progress up the chain. It becomes harder and harder to upgrade each time you enhance, leading you up to a point where the odds are nowhere near in your favor. You can purchase enhancement runes to protect your item from resets/damage, but that's all it does, it is no assurance you will succeed. Not only that, you must pay real currency in order to purchase this item.\nNow for enchantments. Enchantments can give your weapon/armor certain buffs based on the enchantment scroll you use. Enchantment scrolls are ranked in letter/number grades, with rank 8 currently being the highest. Higher ranked scrolls are harder to obtain and are also harder to use to enchant items. You're less likely to succeed with a rank A-8 scroll verses an F-C scroll. You can improve chances through the use of Brynn Elixirs, but only to certain degrees. The punishment for failure is a bit worse than that of enhancement due to the more likely chance of success. Your item either loses durability or is destroyed. Like enhancements, you can get enchantment runes to protect from failure. Same deal as before.\nNow I could look past this if not for the awful way they handle recovery. You can now recover your equipment through the strange traveler for the low low cost of AP. Wait, did I say low low? I meant incredibly high. Level 70+ gear is going to cost you at least 20,000+ AP if you want to recover it. If you've been levelling your skills, this should be next to impossible to do outright. So now you must go back to all those daily missions/missions you didn't do too much and grind out to get your equipment back. Or you can buy AP or wait for meditation AP. None of these options are incredibly appealing.\nOverall grinding is a chore, not in the least bit pleasant to do. This goes without saying for most MMOs but I feel that Vindictus has made it much worse.\n\nSo suffice to say I love the game at its core. Gameplay itself is fun. Being locked out of later missions just because I can't grind/be lucky/pay money? Not so much fun. I recommend steering clear if you have issues with severe grind/sudo-"P2W" gameplay. If you can look past these issues, then feel free to play. I just can't recommend this game.","February 24, 2014","false","493.3"," 711 of 898 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","711","898","0","28"

Optional pay component assist the player in levelling and customisation of their character.\n\nWhere character design is concerned the game offers a detailed (and above average) character editor but remains restricted to a handful of pre-designed in look and combat abilities archetypes.\n\nIn principle the game is all about instanced combat. Each instance is travelled to by the party where it can attempt to complete various primary and secondary quests as its members hack their way through legions of instance specific monsters. The whole thing takes between 15 minutes to 1 hour (at least in the early stages of the game) after which you are free to move onto a next instance (as long as it has been unlocked in story progress).\n\nEnemy AI, aside from bosses is non-existent, though boss fights are challenging and on rare occasions entertaining.\nThere is a story attached to this offering though it should be interpreted through Far Eastern lenses (NPCs, archetypes, conversations, events are exactly what you would expect to find in modern JRPG).\n\nVindictus is a mediocre game, one that lacks support and interest from its developer and publisher. Nexon is quick to ban players (even paying ones) for problems beyond their (players) control and the GMs remain unresponsive to their tickets leaving some stranded for weeks if not months at time and in some cases without a way to resolve the issues.\n\nAll in all there are better offerings available to those interested in free to play setup as such it is my recommendation to give this one a miss.","October 10, 2014","false","16.4"," 268 of 328 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","268","328","7","2"

Heres what you want to know and my personal experince/opinions.\n\nFirst and foremorst, while i do reccomend this game. Be wary, dont let it consume it, dont let it get to you. My total play time doesnt come from years of play, but rather months. And while a lot of it is due to afk hours (especially getting tired and just leaving the game open while i slept) thered be alot more if it counted my playtime i had on the standalone desktop version (downloaded from the site, used whenever steam wouldnt let me log on)\n\nPROS:\n\n-*TRULY* a free to play game. You honestly dont have to spend a dime if you dont want to, and thats something i loved. Almost anything can be bought with gold in game.  (The only *exception* to this is the under armor, mainly for females. No, not because i want my character to run around in skimpy underwear, but because the defult underclothes will make some armors look bad. Especially shorter skirts/shorts. Now while you dont *need* this, its something that i opted to buy on both my female characters. Thankfully Nexon is nice and offers a kinda cheap deal of $13 PERMANANT Inner armor/Hair style (choose wisely))\n-Really nice graphics for a free to play game. My Notebook couldnt handle the max settings, most of the time i played on lowest to push out the most fps i could get, but i have friends who can run it better, or watch videos. The game is honestly stunning, from environments to boss battles.\n-Fairly well learning/difficulty curve. Easy to learn, hard to master.\n-Fairly nice community, specially if you join up with a guild when you start, i made some friends that will always hold a place in my heart.\n-Nexon hosts frequent events with rewards/giveaways. Allowing you to snag $ items for free.\n-(Pro/Con) Easy to get into and to continue playing, lots of things to do and work towards.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Nexon.. Need i say more?\n-FPS problems on lower-end systems, most likely caused by server inflation and patches with new content (This is one of the reasons i took a large break and then eventually quit the game. I used to not have many problems, but after Arisha came out and Nexon started handing out items like candy, my fps dropped to basically unplayable levels (15-10 or lower). If your PC is beefy enough to handle the game well, you shouldnt have a problem, but me and my notebook wept.)\n-Community. Im adding this in both PROs and CONs because well, thats how people are. Ive ran into some really rude people, made my fair share of enemies, and got ripped off more then once.. But, that honestly goes for any MMO.\n-Boat kicking/ATT requirement. Early on, this isnt a problem. You wont notice it and it wont bother you. Later on, when you start getting to lvl 70+ people will start tagging Attack requirements onto thier boats, kicking anyone who doesnt quailify. While i understand that certain bosses may need this due to the fact that theres a high chance youll fail if your DPS isnt good enough, Its troublesome, specially if you dont spend money/grind for hours/have help.\n-GRINDING. This is the last, but probably one of the most important things. Unless you get help, or know how to play the market really well, youre going to have to grind for your items. This kinda goes hand and hand with the boat kicking. Boss drops sell for ALOT of gold, but are extremely rare and RNG, and thats hard to grind for if youre getting kicked all the time. Just be wary about it, find good friends, and enjoy the game.\n\nI leave it up to you if you want to play the game or not, i HIGHLY reccomend you at least download and try the game out. Dont be discouraged by the CONs, its ultimately up to you wether or not you enjoy the game. Just when you play follow this 3 golden rules.\n\n1. BE FRIENDLY AND FAIR\n2. JOIN A GUILD AS SOON AS YOU CAN/MAKE FRIENDS\n3. MOST IMPORTANTLY.. JUST HAVE FUN\n\n(P.s. You may notice the striking numbers of downvotes and negitive replies, while there is a bit of truth in all of them, the games not going to get better without new people coming into the game. With more and more people leaving or getting turned away by the bad reviews, the game is just going to become worse.. Its slowly dying.

That's really nice. Maybe you got in some of those double xp weekends too and you got your level easily. That's great, levels are great.\n\nBut it comes at a price.\nAll gear comes at a price. You may think I mean crafting, but no. Crafting is the easy part.\n\nThe real price of playing this game is your entire life.

This game will ♥♥♥♥ you until you are sucked dry of your emotions and you become an endless farming machine, you will become a slave to NEXON and their NX prices, praying to get money to buy enchanting runes so you don't break your gear while crafting. You will spend the same amount of time getting to max level, adding +1000 dmg to your weapon by enhancing it. Did I mention, if your RNG fails you have to start all over? You do.\nI ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game but it keeps calling me back for more. I lay in bed and I can't sleep.

The gameplay is fast-paced with emphasis on timing and reactions compared to traditional MMO's. The developers, devCAT, accomplished this by making it dungeon based with party limits. It's a game that relies on peer-2-peer for hosting purposes.\n\nEnvironments\n+ Different environments\n+ Sections are randomized\n\nEvery chapter has a different theme with several maps. Sections of the levels are randomized to prevent the game from being too repetitive. Variety of traps can be discovered in many of the levels.\n\nYou end up grinding, if  you don't finish enough quests or simply want to power level the fastest way possible. Grinding is not bad until you hit level 43~ where hidden is. Hidden is the most tempting grind spot in the game for exp and will result in you neglecting some side-quests in favor of it.\n\nCharacters (Classes)\n+ Unique playstyles\n\nThe classes stick out alot as a result of unique weapons,skill sets, and stats. Playing as for example Kai will feel dramatically different from a evie even if they both use range attacks and are not as complex as the other heros. You will find yourself trying out all of them because they got alot of varation to offer you.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269462338\n\nEquipment/Loot\nEquipment is not to hard to get to be useful until you get level 59+ where it becomes more of a challenge. That being said since the big payoffs are the daily raids its worth it just to login to play against epic bosses and have a lottery ticket chance at the nice items possible to drop from them.\n\nPay to win or not?\nNow the question you may have is. Is it free to play or pay to win? Really I would be sort of lieing if I said that money didn't give you ridiclous advantages over others. It is far easier to upgrade your equipment and get stronger gear. As a free to play model it ranks average seeing as how gameplay wise it mostly just benefits people who party with them but at same token this game is mostly geared towards PvE so its not really that much of a concern when the heavy hitters are on your side 99% of the time.","December 4, 2013","true","847.9"," 120 of 137 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","120","137","0","0"

I have experienced the game from 1-80, and currently have a level 80 character, as long as 60-70 for most other characters. So all of what I have to say is from experience.\n\nPros\nCombat is engaging and skillbased.\nEngine can be funny at times.\n\nCons\nNexon is a terrible company.\nThe community is full of trolls and elitists.\nEconomy fluctuates rapidly without rhyme or reason.\nPay2Win\nUnbalanced classes.\nEarly-Endgame is intimidating and unrewarding.\nProgression becomes incredibly difficult.\n\nVindictus by definition is a Korean-made Hack 'n' Slash action game, with a choice of 8 current character classes (one upcoming) that each mostly fill a niche in the game as it stands. Storywise? The game is lacking. It's apparent that the voice acting in cutscenes are terribly synced, with zero enthusiasm whatsoever. Not to mention, it barely makes sense, it's tough to relate to any of the characters, and questing/story has devolved into a way to level up faster. As far as mechanics go, the game is amazing. Early on, the game guides you along in combat, but hits a wall in skill requirement once you begin to transition into endgame (Level 60-80). This leads to a challenging, engaging experience, as you require quite a bit of skill, and knowledge of both your character and the boss in order to succeed. Example being the solo videos out there on YouTube, which are quite impressive. Vindictus currently runs on source engine, the physics can be wonky at some times, however. With such things as clipping, or bulging polygons extending throughout the map, or a monster getting launched into space for no reason whatsoever. These can lead to much hilarity. The problems in Vindictus however, are too large for me to be able to enjoy this game anymore.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about your experience from beginning to end. So you start up Vindictus. 8 characters to choose from, how exciting! Can you change their genders? Though this is something that is common in most MMOs, no. Can I change my appearance? Your options in the beginning are very limited, if you want to change up the look of your character, expect to pay $20 or more on just that. Now let's discuss the balancing of the characters, and the roles they play in Vindictus. Though this topic is very short-lived. The balancing of the game is handled very haphazardly. Currently, Hurk and Kai hold the position of godtier within the game. Where everyone else is disregarded. So if you're looking for stats, choose those two. So you've chosen your character! Time to get into the game! But wait, why don't I have any money? Well, that's because Nexon decided it would be a great idea to gut the early game by preventing gold gains from 1-25. Why? To combat botters. This is concerning however, because the earliest parts of a game are usually the most important to ensure people stay around. Surely the game will pick up right? Correct, the game does end up picking up once you are able to make some money, and have gained a general bit of knowledge about your character. Sadly, this is also when Vindictus transitions into a grindfest. Your experience at this point will consist of rushing through the "storyline", leveling up with barely any money, until you finally hit a brick-wall -- endgame. Endgame in Vindictus is atrocious. If you're not willing to expend any real currency within the level 60-80 range, don't expect to be progressing at all, unless you're incredibly lucky with drops. This is where players frequently quit, if they haven't already in the beginning. As the game becomes frustrating and unrewarding as it attempts to milk you of your money. Upgrades are incredibly hard to come by, and risks can leave you with absolutely nothing. Only the longterm players have stuck around at this point, when the game becomes a social hub for them.\n\nThe community itself is terrible. New players on the nexon forums are frequently driven away when attempting to ask questions. Which in itself is filled with trolls, and sarcastic elitists. Don't even get me started on the ingame community. Where if you don't meet the standards of the host, you can be kicked out without hesitation. So yes, the game itself is also filled with elitist jerks. Though it's to be expected out of any game, I have not seen any community similar to Vindictus in this aspect.\n\nNow, let's talk about Nexon. Nexon is notorious for treating its players terribly. Send in a ticket? We'll answer with an automated message then get back to you after a few months. Concern about bugs and patches? There's a chance we'll even consider reading about your concerns, and if we do, it's likely we'll do nothing about it. However, here's a poorly designed event to hopefully make you forget about all of these problems. Updates? Maybe we'll release a bit of content after half a year, of course we won't tell you anything about it. Over my time with Nexon products, I'm ashamed I've stuck around with their games for so long. If Vindictus were to be handed over to another corporation, I'd gladly come back, but the way that Nexon is handling Vindictus is slowly killing the game.\n\n\nTL;DR Vindictus is slowly dying. Fun for a while, but then you hit a brick wall.\ni copyed AkaGengix comment because is 100% true","January 22, 2015","false","626.8"," 248 of 316 people (78%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","78","248","316","22","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterMichanMan/recommended/212160/","MisterMichanMan","♜ Michan ♜","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterMichanMan/","258 products in account","AS OF: August 3rd, 2015\nBefore I really go into the review, I must admit I had a lot of fun playing this game. It's very unique and I've yet to see another MMO come close to the smooth combat system that Vindictus has. The game, much like any other popular MMO's, is a drug and you have this tendency to keep playing (which still happens to me sadly). However, with that said, the other aspects of this game is atrocious. The easiest way to get into things would be a pro-con chart.\n\nPro\nUnique combat gameplay that requires timing and skill to deal the most damage (Dark Souls-esque but at 2x speed)\nMechanics of the game work relatively well (Skill paths, different attacks, special attacks)\nUnique set of characters, each with their own play style and difficulty\nFull man party raids against huge bosses\nWide variety of bosses, missions, etc.\nAs of recent update, easier to get "rare" drops from bosses to craft higher level items (seal shop, higher drops)\nInteresting story that fits in with the Mabinogi series\nA multitude of content (from items, to enemies, to missions)\n3 Different areas that are fleshed out (a 4th currently being worked on)\nCustomizing characers via in-game armor, inner armor, hair, makeup, outfits, costume armors, etc.\nPlenty of special events that occur often\nLevel cap currently at 90\nCon\nEverything in this game is either time or farm based (raids once a day, AP generation, expertise)\nThe economy of the game can be inflated at times (to incredible amounts)\nAlthough skill plays a role, wallet warriors can still have the upper-hand\nThe characters/classes you want to choose are gender-locked\nEnhancing weapons, armor, etc. requires a lot of in-game gold, materials, and the looming chance that you will blow up your weapon. The whole Enhancing scheme is soley revolved around RNG (that can be avoided up to +10 by buying in-game runes to prevent leveling down items or having them be destroyed)\nEnchanting items (speaking of higher scrolls, high than Rank 9) also has the chance of blowing up your weapon, which also can be avoided by buying runes. High level scrolls in the current economy are also ridiculously priced, so you're honestly better off buying a rune to not only save the Enchant Scroll, but to save your weapon\nMost later game raids require extremely high damage which can be hard to obtain. This leads to a "stagnant" period where you have enough damage to do early raids to have some progress, but still not enough to satisfy later game raids (Season 2 raids --> 18k attack)\nThe game itself is poorly optimized (if hosting, your FPS will go down to 30, regardless of your PC specs. Capped at 60)\nCustomer support haunts this game\nOnce you reach level 60, the grind for XP, Gold, AP, weapons, armor, etc. become excruciating\nUnlike most other MMOs, Vindictus is very linear and involves small time combat\nMaterials to craft high level items either require loads of in-game gold or a lot of farming *cough* iron ore *cough*\nVindictus overall isn't necessarily a bad game by any definition. What makes the game great is the awesome combat system combined with doing full party raids to take down these heavy hitting bosses. The problem isn't that, it's everything else surrounding the combat system. The game is very poorly optimized, and strictly relies on Peer to Peer connections; this in combination with a heavily timing based combat system is a recipe for disaster. Not only this, but at higher levels, raids (at least most raid parties) require a minimum damage requirement, which ends up being an obsurd number that is difficult to reach without heavy amounts of grinding. The game isn't necessarily a "wallet warrior" type of Free to Play, and is definitely playable without the use of your money; the game just makes it harder to do so, especially with the current enhancing system in place. A don't even get started on expertise, as I've spent countless hours farming pre-pre-requisite materials to spend countless hours crafting pre-requisite materials to finally craft all that into materials I need to craft armor pieces, and it only yields a few armor pieces and a few points to level up my expertise. If I have to idle craft stuff in any game, that normally isn't a good sign.\n\nEven after all this, and if you still feel inclined to play; I'd recommend that you reach level 60 and really decide if you want to continue playing, as the daily raids are available to you at that level.","July 30, 2015","false","247.9"," 109 of 133 people (82%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","82","109","133","17","4"

My main account and the account attached to my steam are TWO different accounts, that's why I have such a small amount of hours, regardless I have put in hundreds trying to enjoy the game with each of their characters. I reached max level and end-game on my other account and it was painful but even enjoyable.\nI do not recommend this game because you will experience headache server issues and lack of help from their customer support.\n\n\nNexon won't help you ever. Don't expect help, expect NOTHING but unstable gameplay. Their customer support is either A: Talking to a brick wall or B: Talking to an automated bot that replies with a generic apology. Nexon and Rockstar and hand-in-hand in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ customer support.\n\nI've played this game closed beta. I played the open beta. I didn't always stick around but I came back to try new characters or to just get back into the game again. I've put in many many hours. I downloaded it from steam to keep the game updated, and boy am I glad I haven't spent any money on them because regardless of the issue they will refuse to help you no matter how small the problem. Nexon America will screw you over time and time again. I can go into my ticket history and not one single problem was resolved. They should just close the ticket website (Which is down anyways at this time) and just tell you out right that you will not get the help you want. I love this game, but with any game comes problems, and boy have I had problems. Some for example small ones where I didn't get an event item for logging in, and I understand they can't help there. Other times I have lost millions of gold in items just because their mail system didn't work this one time. I had an item from when I made an Arisha that I sent to my Evie through mail. I bought the item because it was a great quality item and it cost me 10million. For some that's not a lot but for me its hours and hours and HOURS of gameplay to get the items to make that much money.\n\nBefore in the past since 2006 I have had countless problems with them and each time I sent a ticket I have been helped 0 times. Zero times have they helped rather each and every time they tell me they have reviewed my problem and they "Can not help me with "Enter problem here" and we apologize for the inconvenience." I wouldn't give a flying F**K if they would use their adequate logs to assist me in retrieving the mail lost in cyber space. No this hasn't happened in just one game but all of them. I can list 20 tickets at least where I have unresolved problems, just an apology. They refuse to help and I don't know why I expect them to. If you can accept the fact you will spend time and that spent time will disappear on command (Nexon is incredibly notorious for things going horribly wrong especially during events and updates) then enjoy the game and expect absolutely no help from them.\n\n--TL;DR--\nIt's like a good game, but it's glitchy as f**k in alpha and there is no customer support, rather an apology center where they finger their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not to mention everyone is always complaining of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers because they can't host a game worth ♥♥♥♥. It can take months to get a reply for example being banned it took them almost two months to reply and still didn't resolve the problem. I even forgot about the ticket until I received an email for it and probably only because it was neglected for so long was an automated bot triggered to send an apology as if they actually reviewed the rusted ticket. By then he quit the game completely considering he was banned for botting... (This was a friends account who never again played). Expect no help and expect to get disconnected at ANY TIME ANYWHERE.\n\n--TL;DR version 2--\nIt's like buying a really nice car with no insurance. It's such a good car you spent your money(time) on. You will spend a ton of money(time) on this and it only gets better as it goes on. However if anything goes wrong whether or not its your fault, too bad so sad. If you want the problem solved you will have to spend your own money(time) to get it back to normal.\nI forgot to mention the gas pedal likes to stop for no reason sometimes and it takes a bum off of the street five to ten tries to get it fixed. This tends to happen a lot during a nice ride down the highway when you are going to an important business meeting.\n\nCopy pasted responses from tickets I submitted:\n\n"We appreciate your patience and do sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. After carefully reviewing our logs..."\n\n"We have reviewed the situation and unfortunately, we will not be able to assist with the recovery of this mail. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience."\n\n"Thank you for contacting Nexon America Customer Support. I'm...\n...Thank you again for your continued patience and please remember to check your mailbox periodically throughout the week.\n\nThank you\n\nSincerely,"\n\n\n\n(Update 7/31/15) Because I decided to try some Vindictus on a 2x exp event and some sort of early christmas event, not to mention I felt like playing some fast paced sort of game. Got on a 71 character and tried to do a 4 person Twilight Desert full run. (Twilight Desert is season 2; you finish season 1 with all quests complete you'll be around 62-67) After completing every boss, finishing story quests for some people, we had 10 minutes left and went to get the treasure chests. Right as we plan on leaving the second the timer hit ONE MINUTE it failed us and we only got 1/10th the experience we should have gotten. 0exp for bosses and we spent over 100 minutes doing it. Not to mention the couple of party goddess graces used because we were terrible. Wasted all wasted because nexon is by far the worst at managing, updating, fixing or repairing their game or servers. Oh and unless you have a perfect connection to the host you might as well give up fighting bosses. You and mobs will freeze up every 5 to 10 seconds unless your connection is god status. If you ever wanted to finish this game and complete a character, good ♥♥♥♥ing luck. You either solo because the game is nearly dead of any new players, or you attempt to play with others who you can't establish a stable connection to; losing connection all together sometimes.","January 15, 2015","false","6.6"," 181 of 242 people (75%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","75","181","242","21","14"

My crowning achievement was getting a crappy Scythe to +13, and it took me literally dozens of Scythes and millions of gold worth of enhancement stones, and I couldn't take it any farther because the in-game economy crashed after a new wave of gold seller bots arrived, making enhancement stones cost dozens of times more than they had only a few days prior.\n\nI knew people who had submitted support tckets over two YEARS prior to the point where they finally got a response that summed up to "Your ticket was just discovered as being REALLY old, so we're deleting it. Please submit a new ticket."\n\nThe gameplay is AMAZING in this game, until you reach the 60+ level range, AKA the endgame. At that point you can expect to find:\n- Unblockable attacks\n- Instakill attacks\n- Unblockable instakill attacks\n- Loot drops with chances of under 1% from raids you can only perform once per account per day\n- Enemies that require enchantments and enhancements to even DAMAGE, and both of those upgrades can destroy your equipment entirely based solely on RNG, and even when they don't kill your equipment they'll still more than likely fail to do anything and just eat a hole in your gold purse\n- Horrible lag from incredibly bad code\n- Experience gains rivaling the speed of the receding glaciers after the end of the Ice Age\n- And so much more!\n\nMeanwhile you'll wait months for updates only to find out that now your character and all your hard earned gear is utterly useless thanks to "balance" patches, and the new "content" is even harder to obtain than the last.\n\nI could go on for days with horror stories of how bad it ends up, so I'll sum it up here:\n\nFun to play up to level 60, after which it become naught but pain and pay2win.\n\nIf all of this sounds like it would entertain you, SEEK PSYCHIATRIC HELP.\n\nFor everyone else?

A company that lures players with FREE to play games\nbut eventually you'll give into temptation and spend a ton of money -cough Pay2win-\nNOT for fun. If you want to have fun, I suggest you play something else and stay away from NEXON.\n\nFirst we have to pick a class/character to start, 9/10 players would ignore the big black guy.\nLet's pick a girl, while we're at it, why not make her look attractive and sexy. (Definitely not trying to hit on guys online)\n\nLet's start with character customization, you pay for your hair and underwears, Deal with it.\n10/10 would enlarge boobs to maximum. The more pixels you have, the better.\n\nLet's play the game now, level 1 to level 40. Basic training and learning the foundation of your character's\nmove sets and skills, do the same maps over and over again and you finally do some quest to get transformation.\n(You're very likely to play by yourself until level 60)\n\nNow level 40-60, you've learnt how to kill mobs in a few clicks of the mouse and bosses are re-models of every\nsingle mob you see and they're either bigger or have different colours.\n\nThe real challenge lies in raiding, like any MMORPG would lead you to.             I LIED.\n\nThe real challenge is within the community.\nMost of you would quit before level 30 realizing how boring grinding can be. Otherwise, allow yourself to be\nintroduced to the community, visit channel 1 for all the emotional dramas.\n\nEmbrace yourself to:\nPoverty - buy some gold, buy some nx, empty your wallet and credit card, what is life? vindi is life.\nBragging - 400 titles! such is life, +15 level 80 items, majestic as osama bin laden. Bombing raid bosses with dem DEEPS.\nEnvy - What OP players have is what you want, what you want is what leads you to poverty.\nAutism - Learn to deal with people that are autistic, you cannot learn from anywhere else better.\nCancer - What you get if you can't deal with autism.\nHarrassment - Bad at something? Said something wrong? Did nothing? You get it no matter what you do.\nDepression - What you get when you finished the game and realized how much time and money you've spent.\nAnger - Proudly brought to you by Nexon, sponsored by pay2win players and trolls.\n\nBack to raids, attack requirement boats, isolated from raid parties, no invites? Congraulations you have hit the\ndead end of Vindictus.\n\nAt this point, it's time to pluck your money out of your wallet and shove it up Nexon's butt hole.\n\n-Buy some AP\n-Buy some gachapon boxes\n-Buy some runes to enhance and enchant\n-Buy some gold while you're at it, everyone knows you're poor\n\nLevel 60-85, you grind between repetitive dungeons and raid bosses in order to gear up and do new\ncontents. At this point, you should be asking yourself, what's the meaning of all this grind?\n\nWe all have fun in the games we play, we all want the strongest items in game and want to be known\nfor achieving and looking fabulous. If you don't think you've had enough of that, enjoy wasting more\ntime and money refining your character that'll eventually make yourself ask the same question above.\n\nOtherwise congraulations, you've finished the game. Regrets... too late. Literally a dungeon's name that warned you\nbefore Level 60 contents where you may resort to spending money.\n\n10/10 recommending 12-16 year old players, autistic rustled jimmies and cancerous trolls.","December 15, 2014","true","639.6"," 302 of 452 people (67%) found this review helpful 324 people found this review funny","67","302","452","324","32"

THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS GAME THAT I DO RECOMMEND\n\n\nThis game used to be great. Now its a unoptimized, lagging, 90% P2W fest.\n\nWind the clock back a few years (to a time before it was on Steam) This game was amazing and I put easily another 200 hours into the game in addition to the hours shown on Steam.\n\nTake Dark Souls combat, speed it up by 10x and give it more depth. Add some of the most badass music, awesome enemies, and the most flashy/beautiful combat animations and graphics and you had Vindictus at its peak.\nHeck it was just barely grindy, it had awesome combat, every fight felt awesome, you looked awesome, you felt awesome.\n\nIn fact, to this day/time I've posted this review, I still have yet to find an MMO with combat as engaging, dynamic and as action packed as Vindictus.\n\nTera? Blade and Soul? PFFFT, not even close to the speed and fluidity of Vindictus.\n\nBut now to the present. Vindictus has gone down hill, and Nexons only fked up it further with their greedy ♥♥♥ cashgrabbing.\n\nFirst off, as I've said before, the game lags like ♥♥♥♥ now for larger raids (it used to be so much more fluid). Only the smaller runs retain most of the fluidity.\nI have 55.80Mbps download speed, and 9.85Mbps upload speed with 12MS ping.\nI'm also running a pretty high end gaming setup, over $1k easily\n\nAnd this game is still choppy as hell on LOW-MED settings. Not matter how badass your combat is if your frames are ♥♥♥♥ and everything is teleporting/choppy as fk the game will still feel like ♥♥♥♥.\n\n2nd off. 90% P2W. The community can be very elitist. and I mean VERY elitist.\nIf you don't hit a certain level of attack, they will kick you out of the raiding party. Why? Because if you don't have good damage, the end game bosses take forever to kill.\n\nWhy are they made to be so hard to kill? Well because Nexon wants to sell you stuff for real money\n\nOften times you needed to enhance your weapons to +11 atleast. And guess what. The success chance for said enhances are stupidly low.\n\nWhy are they stupidly low? So Nexon can sell you items that can "protect" your items from being destroyed when you fail a high level enhance. AND THEY ARE ONLY 1 TIME USES\nIn short, if you do not spend real money on buying Nexon's items to insure your weapons (which you grinded weeks for btw), you are relying on a very unfavourable RNG system that will most likely destroy your weapon.\n\nI've asked a lot of high level players about how much they've spent on these "protection" items for their weapons. the majority of them have spent over 100 DOLLARS.\nAnd guess what? THEY THINK IF YOU DON'T SPEND THE MONEY YOU JUST AREN'T DEDICATED ENOUGH!\n\nHere is a direct quote from one of them said: "If you like the game and want to get better then you should be spending money. If you're not gonna spend money that just means you aren't dedicated enough, 100 dollars means nothing if you are dedicated enough"\n\nSo I'm not joking when I said a large amount of the community is elitist. Nexon is just feeding off this way of thinking, just like Konami is with Yugioh. Both communities believe that you need to spend a lot of money constantly to be good.\n\n\nSo. finally, the question you are probably looking for: Is this game worth playing?\nYes, and No.\n\nFrom levels 1-50 this game hella fun and I would recommend it to everyone for sure. This is a prime example of hack and slash combat done right. And you will still feel awesome when playing this game (when it doesn't lag)\n\n9-10/10 at this point. But this doesn't last too long btw, the majority of the time is still in late late game\n\nfrom levels 50-60, the flaws start showing but this game is still decent.\n\nIt gets a bit more grindy here but still a solid 8/10 when it doesn't lag\n\n60-70. the game just takes a sudden drop, and ♥♥♥♥ gets surpringly grindy. And with bigger raids the lag really starts to creep in\n\nI'd recommend you stop playing by the end of this point. 5-6/10\n\n70-80-90 is the grinding pay to win fest. If you don't have +11s, chances are, you're getting kicked out of every end game boat unless you meet some truly kind people.\nIn order to excel in these levels you need to\n1. Have a lot of disposable income,\n\n2. find someone willing to sell their old weapons for ingame cash (get ready to gold farm)\n\n3. get lucky as fk with the RNG system and +11 your stuff unprotected (PS: GL with that)\n\n4-5/10","April 10","false","173.6"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","44","50","4","3"

I guess they did it to fight gold farming bots, which doesn't seem to have done anything because I still saw gold spammers. All it did was make the bots change their farming strategy and make the new player experience awful.\n\nTL;DR: Nexon doesn't care about their customers. Nexon doesn't care about making good games.

It is a very fast paced action oriented MMO. To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the story as I played it like Monster Hunter. I enjoyed this game even without the story. The beginning can be very dull but it gets better later on. Having friends and guild members to mess around with in instances and raids definitely makes a difference. There won't be much players on lower level instances for the most part unless there's going to be a new character released. Expect to grind for materials for armor unless you have the cash to buy it.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't played the game too much after season 2 arrived\n\nPros:\n- Unique and fun Characters\n- Character skills are awesome\n- Each Character has a choice between two weapon types\n- Amazing visuals\n- Combat is fluid and fast\n- Very challenging (soloing instances, raids etc)\n- There's a storyline\n- Perverted camera at the end of each instance\n- No more token system\n- Spin to win (go play spear Lann, though you probably will get kicked from raids)\n\nCons:\n- Gender locked (for those who have problems with this)\n- Lag/DC out of an instance (I remember the servers lagged pretty hard and everyone was trying to crash it because it wasn't getting restarted)\n- Grind fest\n- Pay to win (can buy revives and instant potions to your advantage)\n- Enhancing/Enchanting weapons may require you to spend real cash (not required though as it just increase the chances of success)\n- You have to go through the cut scene on the boat every time :/\n- Can't hide megaphone chat\n\nIf none of the cons bother you, check it out its an amazing game.","November 25, 2013","true","127.8"," 52 of 64 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","52","64","0","0"

If you can make it to 60 get ready to die a lot and do nothing in the raids till you get decent equipment from doing them a lot.

Having played since the orginal NA launch and seen the game evolve I can say that if you make it up there and beat all of the raid bosses and get good equipment, get ready to wait several monthes for them to add anything new.

However, now the game is obviously suffering from many afflictions that a MMO goes through going past it's prime.\n\nEvents are no longer entertaining or worth doing, events have been degraded to the point where it's either free consumables from cash shop, increased EXP/AP/Raid Counts etc, or cash shop sales.\nTypical blatant cash grabs by Nexon in the form of in-game pets or vanity sets, seriously $30 for vanity set?\nBeing able to run the later raids especially in Season 2 requires excellent gear, most of which will be forever out of a large majority of player's reach, unless you buy gold...\nThe inflation in this game is pretty bad but maybe not as ridiculous as other MMOs but new player's have almost no chance.\nPopulation decline.\nThe actual gameplay revolving around 3rd person camera is actually quite good, it is very reminiscent and similar to how Ninja Gaiden operates.

The characters have unique playstyles, stylish moves and a great degree of combat is based on player skill. Some of the boss battles are insanely fun, and the fights are engaging so you dont feel like you're just stabbing a giants toe until he keels over. One character can even use his strength to stop certain boss attacks mid-swing and enter a clash of strength if you can time it correctly. It feels pretty badass to save a party member from a potentially fatal blow and in the process hold the boss down for your other teammates to kick his ♥♥♥♥ in\n\nUnfortunately these attributes are hampered by the fact that end game content is severely walled off. Most of the end game raid partys which are level 80-90 will require a high amount of ATT stat (which is what attack damage is based on), to the point where if you dont upgrade your weapons, its unlikely you will break that ceiling. Although this sounds normal the problem lies here\n\nUpgrading your gear is EXTREMELY RNG dependant. The blacksmith may weaken your items durability and reset all enhancements hes previously done on it back to 0, or just outright destroy it at higher ranks. The magician can enchant your item with special qualities, but once again this is RNG dependant and can damage your gear if it fails.\nBut of course there is a way to prevent these outcomes: $$MONEY$$\n\nIf you want any realistic chance of upgrading your rare and difficult to obtain weapon to a respectable level, you will NEED either cash shop items or a large amount of resources and attempts. Dont think for a second that other people dont use these items either, pretty much everyone you see will have at least +8 weapons on high level raids. You CAN get these items from events, but they are one use only and quite rare. They aren't guaranteed successes either, they just protect your weapon from getting damaged, so you could stockpile 4 of them from events and level milestones only to reach enhancement level 7.\n\nThe game would be a 9/10 for me if it wasnt so dependant on RNG to make progress late game. You can try it up to around level 70, before the RNG kicks in too hard, but after that I wouldn't recommend it. But if you like to gamble or have a plenty of cash on hand, go for it.\n\nif you think I'm overblowing the whole RNG thing, you can check the wiki for the RNG tables yourself : http://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Item_Enhancement  But keep in mind, the upgrades are not equally spread, so going from +2 to +3 doesnt have anywhere near the same effect as going from +6 to +7\n\nTL:DR End game is a slot machine for necessary gear upgrades, and the community is on life support since black desert came out","May 12","false","830.6"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","10"

Level 1-50 is easy.  At level 50, you unlock "Hero" mode which makes the game harder and much more fun (if you have the gear). This game has its flaws but I don't know a game that doesn't. If you want to give this game a fair shot level to 50 and play a couple of the battles on "Hero" and join some raids. This will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect for end-game content.\n\nI recommend finding a good guild through the Vindictus website or in-game using the "Search Guild" function. You can also see if any guild is advertising with the !megaphone (purple font) as well.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of this game is the story. At first, it begins kind of slow but it really picks up towards the end. If anything, get through all of that and if you STILL don't like the game then quit. It's relatively easy to solo all the missions because of different settings. Or better yet, grab a few friends or find people in-game to complete the story together.\n\nThe flaws or drawbacks is random lag spikes/fps drops, not a very vocal community (there are some bots wandering around), and high level end game content requires a lot of rare gear to participate in. Money shop is a little on the expensive side but it doesn't necessarily unbalance the game to my knowledge.\n\nLove it or hate it.

The Player appreciation\nevent would've been better off being called the "player depreciation event". The contents they gave out during that event were not very good and not really even worth it really, plus this event happened right after an event that went completely downhill in the last few days. Several of my friends stopped playing after that even because of how big of a ♥♥♥♥ off it was.\n\nNow let me tell you of this event. It was a bingo event, aka for this game, kill specific monsters on certain days, collect a number, and bingo at the end. I'm ok with  level cap for events but don't you dare put it on the last 3 days to make all the lower level people who really wanted the event rewards to be completely crushed. Because, I don't know if you know or not, but not EVERYONE pays in a free to play game, hence the "F2P".\n\nNow that is not even the worst part. On the forums, you can clearly see multiple people complaining about the level cap randomly popping out of nowhere, and you can also see people who got the numbers that was currently impossible to obtain by their level be complaining to support in time. But you know what? They nitpicked and only gave it to the people who cried about it. Because you know what? After a ton of people complain about the level cap and not getting the numbers, lets not give everyone below x number the numbers. Because you know someone who isn't doing the event isn't gonna benefit from the numbers while people who were crushed can actually get what they deserve.\n\nNow if you like hack and slashes then by all means play the game. I like it, and would like to play more. But the fact that they literally don't care about their consumers really. Their servers are pretty trash as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KR-H/recommended/212160/","KR-H","Sylvie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KR-H/","211 products in account","3000h+ edit \o/\n\nVery well-done Korean Hack n Slash MMO-RPG Co-op game. I've been playing since Closed Beta, there are ups and down such as usual lags that most of Free-to-Play games tend to have, games combat area is hosted by a player rather then Vindictus server, so connection between you and the host tend to be very important. Just to note, when they have outfits on sale for limited time only, they mean it, those things never comes back on sale except on very rare cases. (real money outfits. If its rune of some sort, high chance it will be back later on but not often.)\n\nTo answer if this game is Pay To Win, I would rather say this game is more of Luck to Win. There are so many RGN (Random Generated Number?) things are there, such as\n95% of raid drops, which you kinda want a good drop for money if you do not want to farm (personally I dont think Vindictus is a farming game, its a bit hard to 'farm' and time consuming compare to other mmo) However this doesnt really happen often that sometime you wont even really get anything thats worth a money untill couple month later of running every daily raids.\nAbove RNG drop rate is to change with new sealshop update so anyone who bother to farm raids for a month can have full geared 80 set.\nEnhancing (Success rate 100% -> 75% -> etc etc decrease down to 40%)\nEnchanting (Depends on Ranks, and your input. Almost everything thats useful enchants have 40~50% rate of success and it can blow off your equipments when not used with rune)\nI would say Enchancing and Enchanting is the number one reason why people come to quit this game.\nInfusion (Either gives you crappy ♥♥♥ stat or even negative stat)\nOfcourse, all of above doesnt matter (enhancing/enchanting/Infusion) as much if you are not one of those 'elite' people. (..I kinda am)\n\nCharacters have their own name(other then the one that you name. People call out the characters given name to defind their 'Class'), and are gender locked. I didnt really mind about Gender-locked system since I was never really bothered by 'I really wish I could play as a female/male character' All 8 Character have their personal weapons that does have very different characteristic and I suggest you try other 'class' if you do not like the one you've chosen.\nSo far in order of release -\nLann(M) - Dual Sword (Shares with Vella)/Dual Spear\nFiona(F) - Hammer/Sword + Small Shield/Large Shield (Large shield is practically useless)\nEvie(F) - Staff / Scythe\nKarok(M) - Pillar/Blaster\nKai(M) - Bow/Crossgun\nVella(F) - Dual Sword (Weapon is Shared with Lann)/Dual Chain\nHurk(M) - Great Sword\nLynn(F) - Battle Glaive\n\nCombat system is very well done I always comes back to Vindictus due to its unique combat system thats rarely found in any other MMO RPG. Very awesome effects but carries counter side. Sometimes raid becomes messive 'Wherethefkistheboss' situation when the boss happened to be a human character size. There is an option to not show other players effect but human size monsters are still not visible when its inbetween 5,6 characters.)\nBecause you have to time and counter/block enemy attack when required, its hard to do so with bad connection. Since servers are not provided except in 24men raids, connection between you and the host tend to be reallllllllly important. You will NOT be able to move when its a crucial movement, and attack if you are running with someone thats not able to host or in long distant area from you.\n\nStory, you will love the story compare to other mmos if you are interested in reading them. There are two story, Season One, and Season Two. Its easily explained like a quest in any MMO, where main character is asked to take A or B route. So those who take Season 1 would be considered as they have taken A route when those who take on Season 2 would be considered as they have taken B route. Which one is better? Personally I will say Season One. I just couldnt come to like of Season Two. Season One however is very very well done in my opinion, I suggest everyone to read them.\n\nThere will be couple areas player come to be bored for the new players and quits mostly in that area which is around level 25 ~ 35 esh. However real game starts over level 60+, I suggest anyone that plays to take time and play up to 60 where they can start the raids.\n\nYou like dress-up games? because Vindictus do a good job of it. Yea sure they do have couple outfits you have to buy in real money to enjoy your new look, but there are only maybe 3-4 outfits thats not limited time only and all of them arnt really customizable compare to the ones that you can get from in-game. They do have stats attached to them however they arnt so game changing, limited outfits does have higher stats, but personally I dont see much difference, it helps for lower ATT users to join higher req dungeons which is set by another player. (Limited time only outfits have 500+ ATT/MATT increase)\nGames town really have nothing to see if you are into looking for every single details. the very first town we incounter is the most populated place and people tend to hang around there, making new friends, untill they find a guild that is active and have their 'own' channel.\n\nCommunity is.. bad..? Im not sure honostly, since I've found my 'buddies' shortly after started playing this game. I did play around in Vindictus offcial community forum as Seanna, translating Kr stuff. But I got busy and stopped translating things. When sometime I visit the forum, it kinda shows that they arnt taking care of their forum that much. As long as you find group that you like, you probably wont really care about the rest of community.","December 6, 2013","true","633.1"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","42","56","0","5"

It has the best fighting system in any free to play game i have ever seen. It is faster, more simple, more intuitive, and requires much more skill on the player's part.There are very few hot-bar skills. For the most part, you control every step, hit, and dodge. And there is an impact every time you hit something combined with realistic blood splotches, very rewarding. Also, there is a fighting style for anyone.\n\nbut... To unlock the full potential of your character, you have to grind to 52 just to use all your skills. From there, you probably need to reach level cap and grind for many days more to rank these skills up to the point where you can fight effectively (i.e. Battle Respiration and Stamina Mastery. If you are a melee character and you dont have these maxed, you will have some trouble keeping up with certain bosses).\n\nBut even when you have maxed all of your skills and can use your character effectively, you will be hard-pressed to get into a raid party simply because you might not have the stats necessary. So how do you get stats? You get it with very expensive and rare gear. This gear is simply unobtainable to casual players who dont want to spend money. Nexon wants their money...\n\nThe game does have a saving grace, however, and this is why I love it. There are some great guilds out there that are willing to help out new players with leveling, gearing, money earning, and enjoying the game. Many powerful guilds will be willing to take under-geard folks into end-game raids for chances at loot and practice. Any active guild will, to some degree, fulfill most of Nexon's shortcomings and make the game fun (I say "most" because there are problems that NOBODY can fix like server issues).\n\nIf you are interested in playing, find a guild and be active in it. They will treat you well and you will have a good time.\n(Good Guilds: Colossus/Wanton, Citadel, E S P A D A, Sweg, Peace, StormWingsv3, VforVindictus, and many more that you will discover with experience +wink)","June 7, 2015","true","647.9"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","0"

Overall, It's very fun and engaging. It allows you to have a sense of acomplishment and excitement about your character throughout the initial stages of the game. The content is very interesting if you read the dialogue, and I believe it can appleal to fast pace action fans and rpg fans alike. However, in my opinion, from lvl 30 and on is where you begin to realise your character is starting to buckle.\nI myself, as a non paying player, followed several online guides related to my class in order to obtain the "optimal" skill levels and gear necessary for comfortable to advanced gameplay. Getting as close to these recommendations as possible, I continued to progress my character. After breezing through the first couple of chapters being able to solo all of the content on "hard" difficulty, I found it more and more necessary to have others in your party to be able to make any progress through higher tiers of content. This is completely understandable for "Raid" and other missions requiring exceptional damage output. However, the fact that I am not able to gear my character appropriately with that stats on the gear that I can OPENLY obtain, makes it extremely difficult to be of any significant value to other players who have donated personal funds to advance their character as such. Therefore, I feel it's going to take more than an average "casually serious" player, to be able to have any inforcing role in true end-game content. My positive recommendation would be for any player not wanting to progress seriously, or any willing to pay for a more serious, exciting end game experience. Simple as that. It's true, there are elitist jerks in the community who want to demoralize you and make you feel like less of a person through a video game. This can be said with any MMO ever released, but it's your game that this company released for free for YOU. You should be able to play it the way YOU want to. However, unless you are able to pay a premium, you will never live up to the expectation of your fellow gamer. It's very sad that a gaming community has come to this, but what can we do as players?\nThat being said, I will continue to play the game FOR FREE and document my experiences and how I am able to proess as a casual, non-paying player.\nCheers!","January 29, 2015","true","55.1"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","41","55","2","0"

I have had a ticket filed in june and not get answered till decenber.\n\nOverall I would not recomend this game due to the fact it will turn many people off once they hit the wall of end game grind and begin to understand how the cash shop effects the overall effectiveness of your character. But for the few people that are used to grinding and when I say grinding I mean doing the same content for months on end then this game will be good for you. I personally enjoyed this game when it was alive but now it has been slowly falling off and many of the players I use to play with and know are no longer playing this game.\n\nFree to play so in the end never hurts to play it and see for yourself.\n\nUPDATE: Just wanted to give an update if the game has changed at all and sadly it has not. Content still comes at a snails pace and NA servers are still a mess. The gameplay is still the main core of the game and makes it playable but the cons still weigh this title down. The main problem is how Nexon does not treat this game well, maintain, or improve it.\n\nStill does not hurt to try. Best way to find out if this game is for you is to try.

I've never been in love with an MMO this much, and it was the first I've ever played. Honestly, many people hate on it and I guess I can see why, but that shouldn't stop you from trying the game. I really only have a few steam friends that have actually played the game for more than a few hours and would love to help any newcomers when available. If you do try the game, I recommend that you join the west server regardless of your area due to the fact that east server has less people and is dead for the most part (I even heard that they get less events).

(Dev's note: Look to this game for ideas for your MMO. Vindictus actually has characters and narrative with a little substance rather than a sequence of generic fedex quests. The UI is also brilliant. Game mechanics that actually get you into the fight rather than spamming macro keys.  That being said Vindictus does fall flat in a few areas. It would be far more immersive if NPC dialogue was voice acted. More/better ambient sounds wouldn't go astray either. My biggest gripe though is that the F2P micro-transactions really aren't that micro... $30 for increased inventory space? Really?  That's more than I purchase most Steam titles for.  I would be more likely to make purchases if it seemed like better value but you could easily spend a tonne of money in this game for really minor customizations.

Without friends, you're going to be going in empty for pretty much many of your dungeon runs.\n-Mediocre customer service/PR\n-Events are more of people sitting around doing nothing for ~2 hours.\n-Events ingame are more often just as unstable as the game itself (An event advertised at 7PM PST will most likely happen around 9PM PST)\n\nOverall, the negatives of the game really outweigh the positives of the game. But what can you expect? It's Nexon. It's a decent game to play, but if you really want to find an RPG (And I use this term very loosely for Vindictus), you're better off finding another game. I wouldn't really recommend this game to any of my friends because of the negatives of this game and the company that runs it.\n\nEdit: I will add to this, since I still do not recommend it. Vindictus is pretty much a dead game. There is little to no interaction in the game at all from other players. The only time I ever see more than one person online is either in the first 3 channels, or when an event happens. And even then, people do not interact with each other, and they go to do their own thing. The game interaction is dead, and the game itself is dead.

For a F2P (Free to play) game, it has AMAZING graphics, alright storyline, vast areas to roam around, and the best part.....the Combat System. First of all, I'd like to say that there are seven classes to choose from, each with thier own unique ways of fighting and skills to perform. Why is it that so amazing? Because this Hack'n Slash has beautiful attack animations, skills and combos that are performed through right and left clicks, along with some button pressing on your keyboard, taking the concept of regular old "Press to activate skill" to an entire level. It's very easy to grasp the controls at first sight, making it an stylish, and bloody combat expereience, while other MMO's claim to boast the same things, you can most definitely expect the best combat out of Vindictus. Combat is the sole heart and soul of Vindictus. Forget everything you know about traditional MMO combat. Vindictus pushes it into real-time and amplifies it ten times. You have a regular attack and a heavy attack that can be strung together to form beautiful combos. Grabs will usually act as finishers, allowing you to smash an enemy into a wall or viciously break its back over your knee. It's this visceral brutality that makes Vindictus hard to put down.Vindictus uses Valve's Source Engine, and the result is stunning. From the tiny details of armor to the fluid animations, this is one gorgeous game to watch. Small touches, like cats and dogs scurrying about, breathe life into the city of Colhen. The same cannot always be said of the dungeons, which constantly recycle rooms from previous areas. It is not a dealbreaker, but I hope to see more variety in future updates. With the Source Engine's physics, wooden barricades can be smashed, suspended bridges can be cut and lowered, bodies crumble as they are cut down, and... certain body parts jiggle.Vindictus is truly a huge advancement in free-to-play MMOs. You'll still find a shop for purchasing or even renting outlandish outfits for real cash, but without the cut-rate gameplay and outdated graphics that most titles offer in exchange. Even with limited character-options and the lack of a sprawling world to explore, the action-packed combat of Vindictus is unrivaled in the genre.","May 7, 2014","true","54.0"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

It's very unique and it's very skill-based. A fraction of a second can be the deciding factor between life and death.\n-Awesome physics/graphics/particles/effects/etc. : Visually appealing. That's pretty much all I have to say.\n- Great free2play from lvl 1 to 70. Then from 70-90 its another story.\n\nNow the bad part....\n\n-Pay2win. Did I mention pay2win? Yea pay2win by the way: Anything ranging from EXP boosts to AP boosts (This is required to lvl up Skills) to increasing enchantment success.\n- Bad servers : Unstable at most times but still manageable\n- A lot of unfixed bugs/crashes : It gets frustrating. Most of these are reported but it seems Nexon doesn't fel like fixing them.\n\nIt's a great game. Great potential.... but Nexon. I feel invested in my character and the combat system is just too great for me not to play. I just get tempted a bit too much by the p2win aspect.\n\nAll in all, it's worth to play for the first 70ish levels, then it becomes a grindfest for rare loot and the p2win aspect comes into play. Play at your own risk. Very addicting if you're the type of guy with some spare change.","November 15, 2015","false","847.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

(been quitting and returning). So I've seen how this game was, has been going and how it is now.\n\nWhile I like the non target battles and exciting background music and all, this game is NOT NEWBIE FRIENDLY AT ALL.\nLike most other rpg games, "everything starts from max lvl (90)." But way to get there from scratch is total nightmare.\nDO NOT START unless u have a friend who is already playing this game that can support you otherwise you'll have to cover it with insane grinding.\n\nNot many people playing the early stages so if you start fresh you'll mostly play solo or need to get help from higher level players.\n\nNot much chance to earn golds before level 60 and equipment inflation price starts from lvl 70 so hopefully you get lucky loots in between and earn some 'enchant scrolls' which can get you few million golds to cover the equipment prices.\n\nFor level 70+ dungeons you'll need to enhance/enchant your equipments but both processes are heavily dependant on random chances (can destroy your equipments if you fail). If you don't want to destory ur items, you'll have to buy "runes" with cash that prevents destruction when enchant/enhance fails.\n\nlvl 80 equipments are so expensive (10~20million golds PER PIECE / 1 weapon + 5 armors) that people try to skip that and get lvl 90 equipments which are cheaper; which means you'll have to risk enhancing/enchanting your lvl70 gear even more (and possilbly destroy) to advance to higher lvl dungeons or keep grinding the same dungeon over and over for lvl 70-90 section.\n(you must enhance otherwise your ATT will be too low and people won't accept you to thier party)\n\nIf you complain/wonder about such inflated prices of high lvl stuff, horde of old users will rush to you shivering their fat chins and preaching about supply/demand. Well, the sad truth is that this game was once overrun by so many BOTs that spammed billions worth of golds/items with hacks. Most of bots are now banned but spammed gold remains (and people also buy golds from gold trading websites) + there aren't any end game content that makes users to spend chunk of gold DIRECTLY. Therefore those golds keep cycling amongst high lvl users inflating item prices more and more.\nWhat is even more sad is that old users are actually promoting these bubbles and justify it saying "well, you can earn hundred millions if u get lucky" = join-the-league-or-gtfo logic. Result? no new players, same people everyday, not enough matchings for dungeons.... yay! :D\n\nThere are no devs in this game. Every single patches, policies and events come from KR HQ and they don't approve much changes unless theres some serious bugs/errors. What NA team do here is just translate -> test -> deploy and they are so good at that job that whenever there is a major patch, people suffer from bugs/random disconnection/client crashes.\nPlus your feedback is completely ignored becuase NA team don't have any power to change anything.

The game is a lot more skill based than it is stat based, meaning you HAVE to dodge attacks, time yours well and not stand there like a ♥♥♥♥♥ soaking up damage like in WoW.  This MMO is anything but traditional, in both good and bad respects, the good being the aforementioned combat and the fact that you don't have to sink hours a day into the game to get stuff done.  The downside is, there's no huge world to explore, just a small hub you return to in order to recieve and complete quests.  The combat is done entirely instance-based, and much of those instances need to be repeated, so repetition WILL be there.  Finally, most machines will struggle over the ham-fisted optimisation and some players who prefer to solo their MMOs won't get very far without rolling with a party, so I highly reccomend you go into this with friends.  It's a good game though, and you've got nothing to lose in trying it.","July 18, 2012","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l0nigiri/recommended/212160/","l0nigiri","l0nigiri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l0nigiri/","41 products in account","As a person who frantically searched for a good hack and slash MMO I thought I had finally found a slice of heaven in Vindictus. It's very interactive and requires you to be attentive and think on your feet in fights, lest your enemies best you. Additionally, the character design and physics engine are quite unique for a free-to-play game.\n\nUnfortunately, there are several things keeping Vindictus from being a good MMO; the pay-to-win feature being in first place. To elaborate a bit, the first thing that comes to my mind is the 'inner armor' feature, where your character can be fitted with customizable undergarments that is worn under the armor. Your character is fitted with defult inner armor, but the nicest way to move on with this review, is to state that if you don't want to look like an idiot, you must purchase nexon points to buy new armor to look less foolish in the armors you pick up in the game. Inner armor is only the beginning, players can purchase 'temporary armor' which allows for any level player to rent a set of high-level armor for about 7 days, for nearly a real dollar each day, as well as items that can selected in a random lottery (purchaseable of course!) that are not necessarily usable by your character, but that also can not be sold in the in-game trading post. Finally for this topic, there are also 'bound' items; which are items that get locked to your character and make them unsellable in the marketplace or trading post. To unbind these, you must then purchase from the game store, potion stacks that may or may not have enough per stack, to unbind your item and make it sellable.  Which brings me to my next problem with Vindictus: ingame money system.\n\nThe ingame money system in this game is absolutely in shambles. There does not seem to be any rhyme, reason or hierarchy for items which may be put up for sale. I have, on more than one occassion, found something as simple as cloth for sale for around 1k gold, and something that's difficult to pick up or find, on sale for 400 gold. If I check the market the next day, the cloth may have gone down to 200 gold, and the rarer item could inflate up to 3k in gold. It doesn't seem Nexon is setting any rules for these items to be sold at a minimum or maximum price, resulting in player prices that are unheard of, be they high or low. This means when you get to higher levels, paying for armor past level 54 is nearly impossible as armor inflates from around 24k per piece to 1-2 million quite quickly and weapons are even higher in price. The burden becomes real when you realize you're exchanging around 70k in gold for repairs and health potions. Not to mention that the pay rate between NPC sale rates and user marketplace rates have a very significant gap.\n\nMaking money is out of the question for your first 15-20 levels; and that is no exaggeration. Nexon actually released a patch that prevented players below a certain level from gaining monetary rewards in dungeons, and to impress upon this, I would like to add that Vindictus is completely instanced; there are no open world opportunities. Now you may pick items up in a dungeon that could sell for money, but nothing noteable enough to allow you to upgrade things such as armor or weapons. Making money in later dungeons is a bit easier, but often requires quite a bit of trickery or repeat trips, which can ocassionally be fun I admit, but becomes cumbersome after the first few times you attempt it. Be that as it may, it's still very difficult to save enough money for crafting or purchasing new armor or weapons as you get higher in level, which makes doing dungeons, and more importantly raids, where the majority of your money comes from at higher levels, very difficult. In some cases, after completing a raid a certain amount of times, you completely stop gaining money from it.\n\nSpeaking to dungeons, or more specifically, speaking to raids requires quite a good internet connection as you carry anywhere from 4-8 players on your back. It's often hard to find raids to join that do not require you to be well-equipped, well-backed by your internet and beginner friendly for those unfamiliar with the way they work. Additionally, Nexon does not seem to have stable enough servers for large party raids requiring 16-24 people, which can halt a player's progression completely. Rather than being stable, the player-to-server ratio is very ill-managed.\n\nNow I could go into the many other and much smaller issues that Vindictus has, such as the abismal drop rate for rare items, which is comparable to squeezing a diamond from a squirrel's behind, the stat fluxuation between armor and weapons from one level to the next, the chance meter for enhancements which fails about 70% of the time, the lack of character updates and gender locking, or even the fact that Nexon tries to make up for these issues by running events which can leave the user with a lot of useless and unsellable items to take up precious inventory space, but I think I've said enough.\n\nAll of these problems, which are serious drawbacks for players who really want to enjoy the game, can be put aside to a certain degree and the game, especially when played with a good team, can be distracting and immersive in the level of fun it creates. That being said, these problems together whether they're big or small seem to be the result of a mis-managed product that eventually becomes more of an expensive toy that repeatedly breaks and requires money to fix, than a free-to-play immersive fantasy game for people to enjoy together.","July 29, 2015","false","137.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Be it grinding for pieces to make higher level weapons or armor. Joining a guild with people that you like is a big bonus as they can both help you improve and become great friends.\nThis game is best starting with a few people, you can easily do it alone, but obviously it's more fun with a group, as most things are.\nThe biggest complaint I've read in reviews is it being pay to win, but considering the most anyone pays for is underwear (best they give you really ugly long johns to start with) and other cosmetics, it's not really a big factor. You can be just as successful in the game playing during events, and grinding for what you need.\nIt's really a shame that the community is continuing to shrink, it really is a great game, especially for free.

I do get slight enjoyment out of slashing enemies, and some of the bosses are moderately fun, but overall the levels, A.I., story, and the world in general seem mediocre. I found myself clicking through most of what the characters were saying, and constantly wishing there was more to do (exploration, for one).\n\nThis is one of those games that is often painful to play for long periods of time, but also strangely (and uncomfortably) addictive.","January 31, 2015","false","11.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsunari96/recommended/212160/","tsunari96","Tsunari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsunari96/","80 products in account","Vindctus has been one of few action RPG that allows pretty much crisp battle (excluding bugs) and entertaining character customization. However, the fact that such fantastic experience awaiting for new palyers is rather contained in ugly Nexon logo says more than it needs to be.\n\nAlthough varied play style is magnificant and suits probably most of players but it should be recognized that there are too many classes that intefere each other; especially when the cooperative gameplay regards dealing damage at most, the roles seem to be vague relative to killing enemies faster enough to satisfy the party. although combat is very fast-paced, it begs to force players to take in some Nexon cashes to improve--a typical Nexon ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t #1. By means I don't suggest player skill is important, but there's clear barrier between investment of "real effort" and imporvement of player skills. The way that player's attack has to surpass defense of target enemy is not-so new idea, but the way game pushes or forces you to obtain the higest number-available pretty much relies on enchantment of the weapon and armors. Enchantments DO cost alot while you also has to buy enchantment scrolls that grant special attributes. (Funny you ask, I still don't understand the point of scrolls having 7-day expiration date.\n\nAs few reviewers suggested, the stories are quite enjoyable other than delivering pancakes to literally 5 meters away from quest giver, or some relying on rare-drops such as xxxx's hearts. Overall, stories are okay until you end up having to fight against raid bosses that are limited to once a day. This came to be a great problem for our friend group because the fact we all sucked as ♥♥♥♥ resulted in deliberation of the game. I honestly don't understand why the story suddenly has to put a giant barrier by forcing players to be part of raid group that require practice and understanding instead of asking higher-level players to clear. There's no clear balance between making game harder to play and making game difficult to enjoy.\n\nThird of all, as I have observed, any PvE oriented games are not suited for PvP  with few expecptions. Vindictus is one of horrid PvP gameplay sprouted from enjoyable PvE atmosphere lik a damned cancer tumor.\n\nThere are many pros and errors but it's definitely one of those games you might want to try. After all, taking a bite of this juicy-action packed game does make good appeal to players. However, once the juice is all dried out, there's no real reason to continue chewing on the world-class flavor of Nexon. Whether you want to continue or not is totally up to your taste buds.","July 9, 2014","true","300.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is slowly dying, due to the people's desire for inner armors for female characters, Nexon wanting you to spend real money, power hungry people, and Nexon's horrible, horrible game server and customer service (Since when did they have customer service?), you'll get lagged every minute or so randomly.\n\nOnce you get yourself from level 1 to level 60 (Or 70), big boy raids are here. There are boats that wants party members to have the defense and/or attack required to get the raid go smooth as drinking an Iced Strawberry Brandy, but that's like last year or so, not sure how it is now. Not many people hosting raid boats now a days. Even when you do get in a raid boat, you just hope the host's connection is good or you'll be getting bad lag from the host itself, since it's Peer-to-Peer connections, not directly from the server. People can leave the party whenever if you're hosting if you have bad connections with them. You'll mostly be connected with people with three bars of connection (Most of the players are from China).\n\nThere is false advertisement when choosing a character to play as. Hot character showing lots of skins? Nope, you get a white overall instead of showing lots of skins. You'll be starting out with an inner armor that can only be changed by purchasing new hot inner armor with real money for $10 permanently, around half price for 30 days. Don't like the basic hair you can only choose when starting off? Better give them money to change it, around $8 for permanent or around half for 30 days. It's almost "Freemium" tier.\n\nNexon wants you to spend NX for item shop badly. For say, you have a +5 equipment and want to go +6, but you fail regardless with the gamble of enhancing and goes back down by 1 level each. Got to +7? Want to +9? Hope you have enough material and money to afford the cost of the rank resets. The success rate for enhancement is extremely bad. There's a better solution to use protection rune to protect your equipment from losing it's enhancement. but for a cost of real money. And it's pricy for one protection rune, save money and your sanity (Not really) by buying a bundle of 5 for a pricy discount. There's also "avatars" that looks nice for characters, but for $20, it does add addtional minor stats too. Everything is expensive in the game with real money.\n\nPeople are too "power hungry" for stats, so they would spend real money to just be the strongest, but no knowledge of how to play the game itself. Ever since Nexon released the Ability point capsule that gives 1000 points, people really can't play the game from what I'm seeing. They have the attack and defense, but the execution is terrible. It's almost like, all talk but no show. Even an experienced player that has low attack and low defense can beat raids.\n\nNexon's customer service horrible. There was a Q&A long time ago, not sure if people can find it again, saying they will answer your "ticket" if you spend enough NX on them. Not paying NX means they won't answer back from whatever you submitted to them. The server is usually lagging for some reason. They don't work on weekends either.\n\nOverall, it's bad. Nexon fanboys will try to deny the harsh reality of what they're doing to them.","December 21, 2014","false","67.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The Game doesn't really pick up till you're lvl 80'ish, so you won't get an accurate description of the game from comments alone. Many people who quit either quit to early to really experience vindictus or quit because this game is "pay to win". The only reason this game would be pay to win is if you buy gold (which is against vindictus rules) so the game it self does not implement a pay to win system, how about runes you might ask... there's events for that. Vindictus does alot of events that gives away free runes. How about vip? vip does nothing more than add stats that is barely noticable at end game content, +100 att or so when my att is 23-24k. VVIP? adds goddess graces which is totally not needed if you're in a party and or have a guild. In my opinion you can consider lvl 1-59 (Fairly easy to reach) the tutorial for this game. lvl 60 the introduction to "real raids". lvl 70 the grind of getting to end game. However I suggest not judging the game until you reach at least lvl 80 at this point since most of the content unlocks at lvl 80.","April 12","true","634.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You wasted 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour waiting for people to join your boat when nobody obviously will and you're forced to solo it.\n\nAnd the raid? omg the raids...\nYou're doing a big boy raid (big boy raid meaning a raid that ops love to spam) and you're so excited that you're going to take part in a dangerous task of defeating a destructive beast, then BAM! Every op in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ room kills it in 3 minutes and they all bag on you for not doing anything at all.\n\nSo after facing that humiliation you "oh I'll just get stronger and prove it to them". Yeah? good luck soloing ever dungeon trying to complete every side quest just to level up and get bored trying.\n\nWhen this game was first released in 2010 when I was 12 years old it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, channels 1-7 where full of people and every dungeon you did always had people starting a party boat in them, your friend list would fill up because when you need to do a dungeon the first thing you see is what party boats are available and they make it more obvious than the create your own party boat option.\n\nMy point is this game is fun to play friends but extremly boring when you make op level friends and they carry you all the way to level 80. It was fun when you slashed monsters with the other people the same as your level, it was fun doing a raid where what you do matters and the intensity of trying to defeat it with other people but having a hard time because you actually need to cooperate with them.

Meaning that if an enemy is hit it's because the player is in range to land a blow properly...and if the player dodges or blocks then they avoided an attack by moving out of the way etc; no accuracy or avoid stats are present meaning that combat is inherently reliant on skill and learning attack patterns. A single player can solo the entirety of the game or hook up with some friends to ease the burden. I've played the game since beta and reached nearly maximum potential end-game with every character aside from Karok until I put it down some time after Regina was released NA. This review will be express my thoughts on the game in a Pros/Cons format.\n\nPros\n\n+F2P - The game is free although it expresses a pay-for-convenience model with an in-game store. Everything in the game can be achieved for free assuming you are willing to be patient and wait/participate in events. Everything else in the store aside from pets are pretty much gambling and not worth the money...unless you're feeling lucky.\n\n+Dress-up - If character customization and outfit creation is your thing, there's plenty of it in Vindictus. I suggest only spending money on cosmetics to customize your character level 70+ if you are buckling down for the long haul. My reasoning for this is that equipment that can be easily achieved with a little grinding for level 70 or higher gives huge power spikes and looks drastically different from sub 70 gear; it may not look very good with some cosmetic items that seemed to match lower level equipment.\n\n+Diverse Cast - Rather than choosing a class Vindictus offers several preset characters that may be customized quite in-depth and have their own way of approaching fights as they level up and obtain skills to meet new challenges.\n\n+Mission System - Queuing up for a mission consists of going to a "Mission Board" with a list of sub-areas containing currently hosted quests for an area by other players. Selecting a quest (or hosting one) will transport the player to a lobby of sorts where they may wait for others to join, or choose to embark alone if you have no friends.\n\n+Combat - Fighting style depends on which character is chosen, however there are constants throughout all of them. Left-click launches "light" attacks which can combo into various "smash" attacks via right-clicking to end your light attack combo strings. Additionally, players will have a skillbar which will fill with a unique moveset to your chosen character as you level up. In optimal conditions combat is extremely fun and laggy fast-paced, the best I've experienced in any MMO.\n\n+Transformation - Level 40+ players gain access to a sub-quest line that will enable you to Bankai transform. You will have the choice between becoming a Dark Knight or a Paladin. Even though they offer different stats the forms are ultimately cosmetic end-game. The stats transformation offer are miniscule in comparison to the power given by gear so feel free to choose your side. May the Force be with you.\n\n+Boss Fights - The main attraction of Vindictus. Over the top superbosses that are a blast to clash against. I have never played an MMO that has boss fights more fun than Vindictus.\n\nCons\n\n-Leveling - To be frank it can put anyone to sleep, especially after having experienced it on multiple characters already. The entire appeal of Vindictus is the end-game bosses and the entire "constant" playerbase is at end-game. Meaning if you don't have a battle buddy you'll likely be running most of these boring grindfest missions alone.\n\n-Dull Story - The story lacks any real appeal. It's cheesy, predictable, and full of walking cliches.\n\n-Market Board - The market is always suffering from price gouging. Players should stay away from buying items and strictly sell until you can deduce what items are worth.\n\n-Drop Rates - Materials to create end-game gear has disgustingly low chance to drop. So much so that I've seen players run a boss for months every single day and not get what they need.\n\n-Weapon/Armor Enhance System - Taking a weapon or armor piece to the forge allows the player to exchange gold and materials to enhance it. This will increase its power and eventually speed drastically (or defense in armors case). Enhancement is represented on a piece of gear with a +1-15 tacked on as a prefix. The higher gear enhances, the more likely it can fail. Failure can result in gear resetting to +0 or even destroying it. Destruction of a piece of gear can be reversed one time with the exchange of AP (ability points) accrued through missions, but after that it'll be gone forever. The odds of achieving a high enhancement is stacked against the player heavily as a blatant cash grab via protection runes.\n\n-Weapon/Armor Enchant System - The second layer of gear gambling to the Dark Souls difficulty equipment modification system is Enchanting. As you play the game you may stumble across enchantment scrolls. Scrolls are rated in a rank system of F-A to R9-R7. Failure of F-A scrolls will result in gear max durability loss. Failure of R9 or higher will likely cause item destruction unless you're willing to shell out money for runes to protect your gear on the chance of failure.\n\n**Note** Enhancement/Enchant runes are given out during certain events for free if players are willing to wait for them, just like every other cash shop item. However these runes do not modify the abysmal chance of success.\n\n-No Dedicated Servers - Aside from four gimmicky raids, all missions are run off a peer player hosting the run. If the host has poor connection, everyone lags. If the host has a lag spike so does everyone else. If the host disconnects the entire runs progress is lost and any consumables used are wasted. All boss drop rewards are passed out about 30 seconds after the boss dies, if you disconnect during this period you will recieve nothing. For a wealthy company like Nexon there is no reason for the game to not have dedicated servers other than being cheap.\n\n-Poor Servers/Botters - The game itself has poor server performance at times of high traffic. Additionally because of botters (people running automated programs that play the game for them) the lag is much more intense and the market is flooded at random times. Ironically this lag goes away temporarily when these situations drive real players away from the game.\n\n-Bugs - If you decide to get involved with Vindictus these are your new best friend. Almost every patch introduced breaks something else for an extended period of time. Random maintenance is a frequent occurance and they don't even resolve the problems half the time. At one point there was a bug that caused the game to crash when you opened your mailbox and put your mouse over an item. This was not fixed for nearly a year.\n\n-Lack of Content - This may not be evident to a new player. However, once you reach end-game this will make you question why you ever started playing at all. Nexon KR (Korea) is in charge of the games content creation. Meaning anything they get, we will get patched into our game anywhere from three months to a year or more afterwards (if at all). If you're a steady player of the game then for those three months or more you'll be running the same end-game bosses over and over till you're bored to death of the boss fights that are supposed to be fun.\n\nTl;DR: After playing the game for so long I really wanted to make a positive review. However I couldn't do so in good conscience after thinking it all over. Good concept torn apart by Nexon's haphazard care/greed.

Fun battle system. Sometimes glitchy. Season two dungeons are much better then season ones, and that's where I felt the game play really stood out.\n\nOne of the laybirinth dungeons is really soul sucking, it's one where you kick a little golden ball to damage enemies. Don't bother with it unless you have to. You will cry. Your party members will cry. No one has fun. =c\n\n\nHeres a tip:\n\nFor extra money in the marketplace near the begining of the game, sell your mana dusts. You might not need them for awhile because the equipment you get at the start will not be worth enchanting. Take advantage of the steady marketplace price for a decent supply of money. use this money to help with quests or save up for exspensive equipment later on.","January 24, 2015","true","34.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

I max leveled in tera online and got bored so I was on the prowl for a new MMO to play, and some friends introduced me to vindictus. After downloading the game, I tried to launch it and it crashed. Over. And over. And over again. The launcher REFUSED to work, let alone let me create an account. The little times it did work, it would give me error 500 everytime I would try to log in. I spent an HOUR constantly fighting with the launcher to let me log in and finally I got into the game. When I got into the game I was INSTANTLY reminded of rusty hearts. There are "classes" but instead of being called archer or lancer, they have actual names.\n\nI decided to go with the big sword dude, and was instantly thrown into the game. I was going through the tutorial mission and doing just fine, actually kinda liking the game now cause it had a pretty fun combat system. Well guess what. The game glitched and I got thrown out of the map and had to skip the tutorial mission before I was ready because I couldnt figure out how to restart the tutorial. So I had to begin the game before I knew things properly. Figuring out how to do missions was simple enough BUT OH MY GOD THE ♥♥♥♥ING MENUS.\n\nTHIS GAME IS MENU CITY. I still dont understand what half the menus do, and I still have not figured out how to accept specific quests or do specific things. THERE ARE SO MANY GOD DAMN MENUS IN THIS GAME ITS RIDICULOUS. I spent a good 30 minutes fighting with the menus to see what everything does and it still ♥♥♥♥ing confuses me. I don't know how skills work, and it seems like they require gold? or ap? I dont know. I was constantly annoyed by how many menus there were and how they just intruded on everything.\n\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥ THE NPCS IN THIS GAME ARE ANNOYING. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SKIP TALKING TO NPCS AT ALL AND IT TAKES 400 YEARS TO LOAD EACH CHARACTERS DIALOUGE. I'm serious every time another npc decides it wants to talk it literally takes a loading screen, and the loading screen is a small little spining circle at the bottom of the textbox. This loading takes FOREVER.\n\nThe character creation in this game sucks. Plain and simple. Half bad haircuts and bad body maker, half pay to win. You literally have to buy the hair. Yeah.\n\nGameplay gets boring and repetitive VERY FAST. with the dungeons just being rusty hearts.\n\n4/10 really bad rusty hearts rip off.","December 23, 2014","false","1.4"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","1"

Great game.\nShould you play it? Hell no.\nWhy?\nProblem #1: Servers suck and since Nexon doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ they wont fix them(Probably the biggest thing holding this game back)\nProblem #2: Elitist community. (No im not one of them but it pisses me off to see it happen)\n\nTo elaborate on the problems.\n#1 figure it out. Describes itself.\n#  The community wont change because the fact is likely 95% of the new people to try this game give the ♥♥♥♥ up because its hard as hell to play a game when you try to join/start a boat and are required to restart game BECAUSE THE SERVERS SUCK ♥♥♥♥. No constant flow of new player means no new community and the new players who do end up sticking to the game just end up joining the Elitist community to get kicked and shunned from boats because they dont have the acceptable gear to do that raid even when the "Acceptable" gear is only obtainable FROM said raid. The community expects you to buy all your gear so you can do the runs to get the gear you just finished buying. For what? to gear your other chars? What about your main? Only way your getting anywhere is if your hooked up with a guild of Elitists that see you can play the game decent but just lack gear and at that point will carry you through the raids most of them can do solo to begin with.\nDont really need to go into depth on the game and the various other issues it has because every game has its normal flaws that people dislike but i mean not everything should be easy.","December 22, 2015","false","416.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

My play time may be deceiving, because the majority of it came shortly after I downloaded Vindictus.\n\nFirst off, the characters are all unique both in appearance and feeling, as well as gameplay. Great. The gameplay itself is much more satisfying than any other MMORPG I've ever played. The way you position your character, the multitude of different combos you utilize by threading both attacks and spells together literally blew my my mind with every drop of gnoll blood I splatted upon the cold, cursed ground.\n\nI love the combat mechanics in this game, and I always will-\n\nBut the story is simply lackluster. It's hard to explain, because the story is there and there's really nothing wrong with it, but its execution is just bad. I'm not sure if there is a single character model for any of the NPCs in the game. The fact that you never see commander so-and-so fight ANYONE, or general whats-her-face kill ANYBODY, or any of these supporting characters DO ANYTHING, it makes you feel alone, and that makes for a very weak story.\n\nThe story also suffers from sheer repetition in each level. Go through these ruins, kill these dogs, repeat. Same ruins, same dogs, repeat. OH WAIT A BO- aaaaaand it's just a big dog with a similar attack pattern abusable by anyone with half a brain.\nOkay new area. Icy tunnels. Goblins. Bigger goblin. Repeat. Tunnels. Goblins. Bigger Goblin. Repeat.\n\nMind-numbing.\n\nI like this game, I really do, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially because it's free.\nBut in summary this game is a testament as to why you cant make a game great with gameplay alone.","July 16, 2014","true","59.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game looked promising at first. The prologue was great and the combat system was also pretty good. However, everything changes as soon as you finish the prologue.

Also the mouse cursor is off when trying to click on buttons in any menu. You have to click below the button for it to register the click. I would not recommend playing this game unless you don't care about those things.

My highest characters are nearing their 50s, and I've gotten that far with 3 different characters. This is entirely based off of my experience and the experience of others I have played with.

This game a lot of perks to group play, but is not as rewarding to solo players.","June 2","false","107.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","4"

To be honest, i was very disapointed in vindictus when it first launched, and about just as disapointed a year later, but when i did come back to it this summer, i felt like everything i've ever wanted in an MMO was now a part of this game.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Combat System , arguibly the best feature of the game.\n-Decent customization system for character and gear.\n-Lots of fun characters(classes) , most with 2 weapons (completely different playstyles usually).\n-The more you learn and the further you get, it will only intrigue you more rather than bore you like most MMOs.\n-Good Trademarket/auction house\n-Good events, rewards, freebies, etc.\n-Most stuff you pay for is either small boosts to exp and drop rates or just cosmetics. (unless you count the temporary mid lvl (50-60) you can buy , which you can also get from redeployment packages for free.\n-Absolutely BEAUTIFUL visuals, graphics, animations, characters, mobs, etc.\n-Lots of rich characters and stories and information to be learnt if interested (more of a con for me).\n\nCons:\n-Lots and i mean LOTS of some what annoying text/chat bubbles from characters.\n-to level up quests are practically neccesary (that includes a lot of side quests)\n-The most Frowned upon part (that i havnt personally had much of an issue with) is that dungeons and instances are peer to peer connection.\n-Price difference of good mid-high level equips to great mid-high level equips to end-game equips is quite noticeable.\n-Requires some what of an actual graphic card and processor (not saying high end or even mid-tier, but you cant expect to play on an intel hd graphics or a very outdated low-end graphic card and get good frames).\n-underwear/underarmor sticks out of some armors and the defaults are plain white tights that can only be replaced by other under garments for real money (per character).\n\n\nOverall: this game might have been less fun in comparison to similar games like dragon nest, c9, diablo, etc in its earlier days, but now it outclasses them in certain different ways. i simply hope they make end game gear more approachable, let more ppl from more regions play the game, and with an actual server sided hosting system. but some of these things might just be too much to ask for. Well at least untill black desert comes out (if it's as good as the hype) this will be my goto and favorite MMO.","December 12, 2014","true","132.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I didnt get very far though, only to level 20 or so. The last time I played it was around a year ago, too.\n\nThe main part of the game is the hack-and-slash segments with a little bit of exploring thrown in, but the fighting gets very repetitive. The stages are just recycled. They were too lazy to even change the layout most of the times. All they did was put the enemies in new spots. Leveling was very grindy. When you found a weapon better than the one you were using at the moment, you were lucky. I kept a lvl 8 or 10 weapon until I stopped playing. The fastest way to get better gear was to use the market.\n\nAnd now the part that turned me off the most;  account pin code. When you first started the game, you were prompted to make a pin code, so as to not have someone log into your account and delete all of your characters and stuff. The thing is though, you forget that code, forget your chances of ever playing on those characters again. I didnt bother to contact support though, seeing as how that I didnt really have a desire to play the game again.\n\nOverall, the game is good. It is just the company that ruined it. It had a very good design and a very poor execution. Like I mentioned at the top, I didnt get very far. I just couldnt push myself to grind through the repetitive levels over and over and over just to find something that had +5 damage over my current weapon.","February 28, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

There is zero customer support what so ever, the servers are very unstable and always have been.\n\nDont get me wrong, the gameplay itself is fantastic and one of a kind but everything else has completely ruined the experience for me. Gold farming bots have been taking over vindictus since the release date and has destroyed the economy of most items making it so players just spend their own money to get top tier items without actually putting in the grind to earn it themselves.\n\nEnd game content is alright, your forced to buy enchant runes that fail/blow up at a 40% chance on top tier scrolls, dungeons hardly exist anymore and if you find one they are most likely with an attack requirement(19k-21k atk) which some new players who haven't spent any real money most likely will not be able to join.","February 20","false","848.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Its hard to stop, I enjoy MMOs with ACTUAL combats and good PVPs and some bad ♥♥♥ monsters that make you wanna hate them, love them or just wanna destroy them over and over. Vindictus maybe a P2P or Pay to look sexy but its not about how you look, its about how strong and having the right stuff and know your jobs. There are some bad parts about this game that I must protest about. Steam makes the game extremely laggy and crashes shoter than 30 minutes or a hour. Please fix that ♥♥♥♥. I had to move to Nexon due to the numerous lags. Hosting is terrible when playing through Steam and just makes gameplay not fun and extremely frusting.\n\nI love Vindictus. Its the first MMOs (Besides Blade and Soul and Mabinogi. Sorry for my misspelling.) thats gotten me hooked into it and just want to play more and more. Nonstop. I love testing my strength, I love challeging others, I love showing off the most kick-♥♥♥ weapons I have in this game.  If you like fighting big ♥♥♥ monsters, hot female bosses and booming your weapon by enchacing 200,000 times then this is your game. But hey thats my opinion on this game. Lets see what you can do and how well you fight to become the master of battles.\n\nNow some cons I want to speak about\n- Nexon is not great w/ customer service. I wouldn't buy anything from them if I was you.\n- DevCat.... ehhhh Good music tho but ♥♥♥♥ man...\n-Too much money to buy 100,000 NX or higher. At least set up some discounts xD\n\nOh and some other pros\n-Good ol' jiggle physics\n-Kick-♥♥♥ armour\n-Cute pets but I don't usually buy them\n-Furries. I don't know if you like furries but there ya go.. Furries... but only men are furries.. not the women..\n\nHAVE FUN!","January 22, 2015","true","407.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","9","15","3","3"

Save yourself the trouble, and do not play this game it's a waste of time and money.\n\nProblems\n\n*#1.   If the vast skies were scrolls and the endless oceans were ink, I could not write enough bad things about any Shixon run game, this game is no exception.\n\n*#2Servers are absolutely horrible.   You wll get disconnected, you will lag, you will not be able to play the game properly no matter what server you are on.   The community has complained to Shixon about this, but it seems like they are unwilling to upgrade their 56k dialup internet connection.\n\n*#3Bots.   As with any Shixon made game, bots are a problem.   Not only do the millions of them that ruin this game cause severe server lag, but they also destroy the economy and other areas of the games completely.   Right when you first start playing the game on Channel 1, you'll be greated by Bots standing right in the middle of town trying to steal your credit card information by selling gold for cash.   Shixon has been unable to catch these bots even though they stand right in the middle of town yelling to everyone.   DO you think it's safe to give your credit card information to hackers?    Shixons lack of action against these bots shows that Vindictus is also a risk to your financial information and identity.   You might spend $100 on your credit card on premium items only to have some hacker spend $10,000 on your credit card for a vacation to another country.\n\n*#4Shixon.   This argueably should always be the first problem anyone mentions when reviewing a game made by this company.   This is the worst online gaming MMO company that has ever been formed.\n\n*#5Poorly thought out events, drunk moderaters is the only explanation.    Imagine that you played the game for a year or so, we all know how these MMO's work.   You play the game and work hard to get your high level gear which can take MONTHS on this game.   The day you get your high level gear you realize that Shixon has decided to run an event which practicly gives new players the same gear you have, and for free.   What do you get for being a  level 85 player who contributed to the game since the start?   20 healing potions.   Yes this really did just happen.   Typical Shixon.\n\n*#6Unoptimized engine.   You can have a 5 GHZ (Turbo) 8 Core liquid cooled AMD 9590/Nvidia 660TI/OC and the game will still find random ways to stutter despite the fact that I can play newer games like Wolfenstein the New order on max everything at 1080P without a stutter or hitch.   This is due to a poorly optimized engine that does not use multiple cores what so ever at any point in time during playing.   Intel Cpus are better for this game due to the pathetic level of coding since Intel Cpu's are usually rated better on single threaded applications.\n\n\nThe Good.\n\nThis can be summed up in one paragraph, at the core this is a great action hack n slash game.   You'll play this game and say wow this is really great, this guy reviewing it must be crazy.    Then you'll keep playing the game and realize everything I said was true a month down the road and you'll instantly wish you had the last month of your life back.\n\nSave yourself the trouble my friends, friends don't let friends play Vindictus.\n\n\n\n\n","April 24, 2015","false","881.7"," 70 of 134 people (52%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","52","70","134","32","23"

Sometimes it takes hours to even go up one level.\nThis game is near impossible to play alone, so if you planned on doing so don't even bother. Many of the battles are tough and will require more than one person, or countless hours of levelling yourself up to do them alone.\nAquiring armour and weapons at higher levels over 60 isn't easy or cheap. You pretty much have to make them yourself and it takes a lot of work and I mean A LOT of work or lots gold to buy the pieces.\nThe game gets very repetative. Collect blah blah from battle blah blah.

Sometimes it takes hours to even go up one level.\nThis game is near impossible to play alone, so if you planned on doing so don't even bother. Many of the battles are tough and will require more than one person, or countless hours of levelling yourself up to do them alone.\nAquiring armour and weapons at higher levels over 60 isn't easy or cheap. You pretty much have to make them yourself and it takes a lot of work and I mean A LOT of work or lots gold to buy the pieces.\nThe game gets very repetative. Collect blah blah from battle blah blah. Now go back into the same battle 2 more times and collect new items.\nGame not recommended past the first 30 levels. :l","June 16, 2014","false","478.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingerdoodle/recommended/212160/","wingerdoodle","Aesthetically Potato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingerdoodle/","137 products in account","Even with the update to make leveling easier on this game, farming is still a necesity to get anywhere without you shelling out some money (and the farming is painful in this game due to low drop rates). The characters also have enough diversity to suit most people's playstyle; a lot of the weapons unique and not-so-generic. The story isn't exactly engaging but it's adequate (I myself read the dialogue and see some humor sprinkled here and there).\n\nThe main reason why I still continue to play this game is because the combat is so fun!\n\nDespite its shortcomings with a heavily chance-based enchanting/enhancing system and repetitive farming, I still recommend this game because the gameplay is enjoyable, fast-paced, and intense. That's what makes Vindictus different from other MMORPGs at the moment.\n\nSide note, however: Lag seems to be a pretty large "con" in this game. It relies on P2P (peer-to-peer) hosting for running dungeons, which is the only method of completing battles in this game (another "con"). There is also some server instability during large events.\n\n---EDIT DEC 2015---\n\nI have officially ceased playing this game because I have a backlog to clear, the endgame grind just isn't working out for me, and the pretty pixels and fast-paced combat system isn't enough to keep me playing anymore.\n\nThere was an implementation of a seal shop which helped players who dedicated much of their time and effort in hopes of obtaining rare mats to craft higher-end gear. However, with the expansion of Season 3, there are more crafting components to focus on - this time with managing the grade/quality of individual materials. If you are complacent with O.K stats, this is a good thing. If you want to join elitist boats, this is not always a good thing.\n\nDevelopers are also stalling the possibility of adding second weapons for newer characters (Hurk, Lynn, Arisha, and Hagie) in favor of pushing out even more characters. One problem with this is that there is less variability in playstyle for the characters I have listed above. Another is that there are increasingly more alts you have to manage if you wish to level each character.\n\nIn short, I'm not exactly happy with where this game is headed.\n\nVindictus's team from Nexon NA is also a bit "distinguished" for their inability to manage bots or improve server stability.\n\nThat being said, I still recommend this game. I still would recommend anyone interested to give it a try, because it is fun no matter how I look at it.\n\nHowever, I am no longer investing my time and energy into the game because of 1) the still largely present and unforgiving RNG element in obtaining suitable endgame gear, 2) lack of attention on newer characters in favor of producing even more new characters, and 3) Nexon NA.","July 16, 2014","true","067.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I maxed out every graphical setting and even forced some things from my own desktop control panel.  Nothing of this game is worth the time, even F2P.  Very dissapointed in the way this game works and runs, even on a high end machine.  As for the dodging and combat, you just hit space when you see a enemy hammering down on you and well even if you are standing there, you will dodge it.  Every time you hit an enemy the screen pauses for a .1 of a second, which was clearly intended.

I have a reasonable amount of experience with the game (4 characters over 75 and many above 50).\n\nWith that being said I'll start with the pros, or what made it attractive FOR ME.\nThe combat is simply amazing. It's fast paced yet fluid and responsive, versitile yet easy to learn. The reason why I stuck with the game for so long was because I wanted to try out every character's skills (with my favorite being Lann). You will rarely find a game with combat as action packed as Vindictus.\n\nAlthough it is instance based, Vindictus does a good job of making sure that the environment does not get too bland. Doungeons are has enough differences that you will never feel like you're just doing the same level again (with very little exceptions). This is achieved with difference in themes, maps (of course), traps (and not too many of them), and interactive elements.\n\nNow, the factors that made me quit.\n\nThe story. It's pretty engaging and interesting... if it's your first time playing it. It follows the genderless and universal hero formula as all other one-path MMORPG storyline. No (interesting) sidequests to explorer, no extra content. The whole game is just sending you from place to place and instance to instance.\n\nThe fact that you can buy almost everything with NX. If you've played old school Maplestory, you'd know about Nexon's mistake (or not since they probably milked those whales dry). In Vindictus, Nexon applies the same principle. You can buy almost anything in the game as long as you have the NX. From potions and revives to skill points and endgame gear. Yes, it is a skill based game, but think about it... being able to heal to full hp almost instantly, reviving without penalty, and all the damage boost. When I bought my first skill capsule (skill points), I thought to myself... "wow all those hours wasted grinding dailys was kind of pointless." I immediately lost a bit of passion for this game.\n\nOverally, for me, it's worth the first playthrough. It's something to pick up during your one week break and then let go as soon as something better comes up.\n\n","January 4","false","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But that's about it.\n\nThe game is plagued by gold sellers which has in turn caused an incredibly inflated economy on trade materials revolving around the crafting/enhance system. When you can buy 100million gold for $13 and then buy all the trade materials off the market place...yeah...I've already earned close to 1million gold by just selling trade materials and haven't even reached level 15. Some trade goods go for about 100,000g each, while some weapons and gear sell for about 1,000g.\n\nOn top of that, this game runs like trash. It's an unopimitized heap of trash. HUGE framerate spikes. Stuttering from anywhere about 10fps to 40fps in an area as you simply stand there...makes no sense and is incredibly frustrating.\n\nOn top of it all, the dungeons and enemies can become incredibly bland and boring as there is very little to zero variety. In the end, the combat system is the only thing it has going for it.","January 20","false","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is nice, the progression too, graphics are nice and all. So, why no reccommend it? Easy to say. Nexon have little to none support. you spend money in the game, you might or might not get what comes with it, what you will surely get is no answer from their part.\n\nGood features\n- Great gameplay, varies depending on the character and weapon type.\n- Graphics are nice.\n- Music isn't bad, not great but it's enjoyable.\n- Story is brought in a more Japanesse way, which isn't bad, but don't expect big cinematics as the story is more textual.\n\nBad features\n- Customer support is a myth (I heard that a few people could get an answer from their part, but I never got any)\n- Real money spent in the game might end up split into two different pool of currency making you unable to buy the stuff you put money in for. (That is if you get some in-game currency for that hardly gained real money)\n- Servers are often buggy and/or down\n- There is a lot of connection issue known with this game.\n- Hacking is a common ground around Nexon account (or so it seems, I actually got my main character's gear stolen, but I used a not-too-secure password, otherwise this point is more about what I've read on the community forums of Nexon at the time I tried to get my money back for a purchase that they did not give what was paid for).\n\nVerdict : It is a game to try, but never to invest real money in.","July 3, 2014","false","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Pretty sure that would be more fun and better use of my time than it is.\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way.....\n\nI played this game a lot before it was on steam, I had no money at the time and a friend that loved it to death.\nHe got me playing it to pass the time, as I had nothing better to do and and my aforementioned activity had not yet occurred to me, I went for it.\n\nAt first glance the game seems alright, a nice cast of characters, a mediocre customization menu, the game doesn't look too shabby graphically, and it was free.\n\nThen I started walking.... The animation was smooth, so smooth in fact that I seemed to be sliding my feet along the ground, only moving about half as fast as my animation suggested I should be.. So I turned and ran to the left and I glided along in a way that could almost be compared to a cat trying to gain traction on a recently waxed floor, I mean I did turn, just not in the way one might expect a human to move across dirt and grass.\n\nI got to a combat section and because thought to myself "This is where the game will redeem itself!!" but I was Let down by this as well! It's by no means awful, but in my eyes it was typical, it didn't do anything I hadn't seen before and the execution of the system didn't wow me either, It lacked polish.\n\nThat's when things started getting weird, suddenly I noticed that my character's physics would randomly spaz out while I was standing still, parts of her armor and/or body would jolt around like a kid who's had too much sugar. And I would randomly become stuck at odd angles against terrain during combat\n\nLets move on from all of that though.\n\nI feel like I should mention a few more things that struck me as odd...\nThere are more loading screens in this game than you can shake a stick at. You wanna go to the docks where you access the missions? Loading screen! You wanna start a mission? Loading screen, which then leaves you on a tiny dock with a boat on it. You wanna start the mission for real this time? Loading screen!!!!! Just when you think that's all of 'em done, you kill a few baddies and walk a little ways... LOADING SCREEN!!!! I think you get the picture...\nThe camera controls are shockingly sluggish for an ARPG.\nThey call it an MMO, it's not an MMO it's a Co-Op multiplayer ARPG with a giant chat room where you can find up to 4 players to run missions with you.\nYou need to use real money for most of the cool looking stuff.\n\nTLDR: The game claims to be things it isn't. It's not an awful game it's just a huge let down.\nIf you like the concept of this game play Warframe, or nearly any other ARPG instead. (I mention Warframe only because it's similar to this game)\n\nIf you think this review is unfair, feel free to dislike it. We're all entitled to our own opinions.\n\nP.S. Shortly before writing this I redownloaded the game on steam and nothing has changed.","September 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's by no means awful, but in my eyes it was typical, it didn't do anything I hadn't seen before and the execution of the system didn't wow me either, It lacked polish.\n\nThat's when things started getting weird, suddenly I noticed that my character's physics would randomly spaz out while I was standing still, parts of her armor and/or body would jolt around like a kid who's had too much sugar. And I would randomly become stuck at odd angles against terrain during combat\n\nLets move on from all of that though.\n\nI feel like I should mention a few more things that struck me as odd...\nThere are more loading screens in this game than you can shake a stick at. You wanna go to the docks where you access the missions? Loading screen! You wanna start a mission? Loading screen, which then leaves you on a tiny dock with a boat on it. You wanna start the mission for real this time? Loading screen!!!!! Just when you think that's all of 'em done, you kill a few baddies and walk a little ways... LOADING SCREEN!!!! I think you get the picture...\nThe camera controls are shockingly sluggish for an ARPG.\nThey call it an MMO, it's not an MMO it's a Co-Op multiplayer ARPG with a giant chat room where you can find up to 4 players to run missions with you.\nYou need to use real money for most of the cool looking stuff.\n\nTLDR: The game claims to be things it isn't. It's not an awful game it's just a huge let down.\nIf you like the concept of this game play Warframe, or nearly any other ARPG instead. (I mention Warframe only because it's similar to this game)\n\nIf you think this review is unfair, feel free to dislike it. We're all entitled to our own opinions.\n\nP.S. Shortly before writing this I redownloaded the game on steam and nothing has changed.","September 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Here is what i have to say:\n\nGame itself is fantastic and actually fairly challenging to master. Many people have mentioned the sharp learning curve in raids, and I won't deny it does take effort, time and practice to get used to each boss, but in my honest opinion that's what makes this game unique and awesome. It is not a simple brainless point and click adventure like most other MMOs out there but actually takes quite a bit of skills to play well. You actually feel good after beating something. This is one of those games that defense is not that important once you can master it.\n\nIn a nutshell, raids/raid bosses are where this game is mostly at. You do raids, gather seal of braveries and craft lv70 gears which would allow you to join those silly attack boats in Season 2. Acquiring 12 seals a day is perhaps the most efficient way to get gears up to speed, so you can have enough stats to do kraken and lakoria for their drops. You can choose to farm, but that is imho very time consuming and not worth the return you'd get. Instead, play 1-2 hours a day with a guild, run the raids of your choices + lakoria and kraken (mandatory, they are easy raids with valuable drops) and grab all the seals on all the characters you can.\n\n\nSince I mentioned characters, let's just say some characters are more powerful than the others. Certain character in this game has been pretty bad since 2011 and is still pretty bad lel. (aka that male character everyone thought was so cool holding 2 swords and looked like he would decimate everythng in this game but turned out he was the one who always got decimated for making 1 mistake huehuehue), and certain characters are a lot harder to gear up to the attack boat requirements.\n\nWhat I recommend is to roll one of these characters as your first character for now (in order of most recommended to least: hurk/arisha - kai - vella - lynn - Karok/evie/Fiona) and wait for the dual-sword character buff coming (test server in KR for now). The ones I listed are pretty fun as they are actually, and should keep you busy for a long time.\n\n\nSo, to fully enjoy this game, I recommend:\n\n1). Spending enough to make a good weapon that can bring you up to 15-16k attack. How good the weapon has to be is up to you. I'd say to do end game lv80 dungeons, a +10 lv70 nighthawk is perhaps the best option for most people before they get hold of a lv80 weapon. They are good cheap weapons and very easy to make. Doing this is to join all these stupid S2 attack requirement boats.\n\n2). Have a decent computer to be able to run this game at 60fps in DX8. Otherwise you will not get the most out of it. Hardware from 2011/2012 is more than capable of this. Recommend an intel processor because this game hates AMD processor.\n\nOPTIONAL: if you choose to host 8-man dungeon, make sure your internet is at least 2mbps upload, in addition to meeting the 2012 pc requirement.\n\n3). Overlook the bad things Nexon does, and take full advantage of good things they do.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that we all know how Nexon works as a company if you have played any of their games, and you can QQ as loud as you can, but every now and then they do some events and all that which are actually good for the players, and you don't wanna miss those just because how much personal grudge you hold against them. Things like giveaway, events etc. are for us, and we need to get all of them.\n\nMeanwhile get on forum and QQ/vent all you want when something goes wrong, because some of these issues have been there for YEARS and still not completely fixed. Cough cough server hamsters etc.\n\n4). Avoid rolling a dual sword character as your first character for the reason I have described above.\n\n5). Avoid too much farming for reason I described above.\n\n6). Focus on the gameplay and raid boss fights. Treat it as an action game and work on how you can improve and do better.","January 2, 2015","true","385.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Within the past 2 it has been surprisingly hard to find a solid contender for the "Action RPG", as I thought they would become more popular. I've been seeing nothing but, attempt, after attempt, of companies trying to produce an action oriented combat system, all but a select few falling very short of what I would consider polished, and functional. I played in the original release of Vindictus up until Evie was released, and picked it back up shortly after Kai was released.\n\nThe beginning was rough, with few characters, and the mission limits, with a token system that forced players to pay actual money to play more than a couple missions a day. However, now that stuff is gone, and what I see, and experience is a truly thought out, polished, and challenging combat system, that cannot be found in any other MMO out there. It is on par, and in some cases better than single player, full price fantasy RPGs. However, there are still major draw backs that prevent me from recommending it to everyone.\n\nOne; the way the game is set up, it forces players to go through one of the longest, and cruelest, grinds of any game I've ever played. By having all of the cool, and unique adventures restricted now, but not last March, to being level 50 or over. Many new players go in to try out this cool game, but are forced to drag themselves through repetitive areas, and a story that no-one is going to read,(Trust me, I tried), just to get to maps that are unique, and drastically more polished parts of the game. It's like giving someone a game, and saying, "These first 50 levels are just a test, to see if you're worthy of the good stuff". On a positive note, those forced 50 levels are fantastic practice, so you aren't likely to be terrible on your first major raid. I just don't understand the decision to increase the level restriction for the big raids in Malina.\n\nTwo; even though it has been said numerous times, the utter lack of choice a player has when making a character without paying a little for a hair style, or inner. It's brilliant business wise, I understand, but character customization is  huge factor to an increasingly large amount of MMO players. The simple lack of variety in new characters is a huge turn off, and a reason I can't give this game a perfect pass. Now, I've spent well over a few hundred dollars on this game, simply because I love it, and I'm invested into the characters I've spent over 500 hours with. When it comes down to it, there is a large audience that will give this game a shot and dwindle away shortly after reaching level 20 or so, since there isn't much to do, very few will continue on to actually play the "game".\n\nIn the end, Vindictus is a game that gives players an unparalleled action RPG experience, it may take a long time to dive into, but once you've past your "test", you'll likely never find another FREE* MMO that gives you a truly ambitious, and thrilling combat experience.","December 6, 2014","true","040.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DavidShepard/recommended/212160/","DavidShepard","David","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DavidShepard/","355 products in account","The game uses a "hub" system. Combat is instanced in small (and incredibly repetitive) areas. Content is recycled for about 20 levels all the way up to level cap, meaning for every twenty levels of play you're killing the same stuff, but recolored, in the same areas, either forward, or backward.\n\nClasses are varied, but they are also gender-locked. Some classes have a lot of similarity, but they simply created a female version because thongs sell better than boxers (no joke, females are basically barbie dolls to dress up). Content is plentiful, but experiencing and unlocking this content is a nightmare. You are expected to run the same dungeons over and over, and when you're not doing that, you're reading (or skipping) long, tedious storylines that you are only able to skip one dialogue sentence at a time (how long can your index finger or thumb mash on those buttons before they're just sore?).\n\nThis means that even when they have Bonus EXP events, you will actually out-level the content that you're in. You are REQUIRED to play a lot of missions twice or more in order to fully "complete" the requirements to unlock the next mission. There are at least THREE LAYERS of restrictions on content, either "Completion" points, "storyline" completion or "character level". These three restrictions can be infuriating to deal with, since the majority of the content in the game (the normal story missions) can literally be completed in a matter of minutes.\n\nI am not joking when I say you will spend more time talking (reading text) to NPCs than you will actually doing missions. You will have to talk to one, two, three, four or more NPCs to learn about a particular mission, and then it will only take you about two minutes SOLO to complete said mission. Only exception to this is Raid Bosses. They are the only fun element in Vindictus, but if you play in a full party (there is no level restrictions, you can get hard carried in these raids) then you can normally get away with dancing in a corner doing nothing while your allies whipe the boss in several minutes.\n\nAnother problem with this game is the business model. They've tried to be as fair as possible, but in the end what they've come up with is a system that heavily rewards paying users by giving them more exp, more loot, better loot, better consumables (potions you can drink while laying on the ground), more teamplay items (revive tokens etc) and just overall a better experience.\n\nBeing a free player in Vindictus is tedious, tiresome and not necessarily rewarding. To be a free player you need to spend dozens of hours preparing for the next section of the game either by crafting, buying/selling on the market or collecting mats from dungeons. This process is incredibly time-consuming, and does not feel rewarding. Finally acquiring that "next level" set of armor is only the first part of the puzzle. You will craft items in random (and disquesting) colors so if you care even a little bit what you look like then you'll be obligated to proceed to the next part of the process which is customizing the color.\n\nIf you do not buy things with real money you will literally be spending millions of gold (3.5mil approx for one color) to get the specific colors that you want. If you don't mind wasting time (and gold) you can roll for random colors for signifigantly less, but normally you will get hard clashing colors, desaturated colors, or poop brown. A lot of the time there is one item in the set that simply does NOT roll the same colors as the rest of the outfit, so you will have a clashing color no matter how much time and effort you spend rolling. Best bet is to farm gold to buy dyes directly from players. Unless you're fine with spending $3 to randomly get a color from six possibilities. Yeah, you read that right. $3 to gamble colors. That's Vindictus.\n\n\nThe other things you can buy through the real-money store is essentially wigs and underwear. There is a "depot" that contains pets, consumables etc. and if you plan to be a serious Vindictus player then you simply can't get away with NOT buying from the depot.\n\nCasual players will want their characters to look decent, so they will likely want a wig and some underwear. $10 a piece. Why? Because breast physics and buttcracks. If you use the default, you'll have an ugly white cotton undershirt and shorts. Basically all the armor sets are designed WITHOUT these inner-armors in mind, so they will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\n\nWith all of these things listed above I simply will not recommend this game to anybody, ever. The business model is awful and punishes free players in almost every possible way. The pacing of the game is incredibly inconsistent and painful (literally, my finger & thumb go numb when I play for more than 30 minutes) and the story is your typical Eastern Anime-themed "Oh noes I'm a diety but because I'm a helpless girl I need every strong man to save me from stupid situations" and frankly it drove me nuts. You're a member of a mercenary group and the amount of petty squabbles, incompetent recruits (and generals) and whatnot is just appalling. It's hard to believe that these people even know which end of the sword to carry.\n\nDon't bother with Vindictus. When it first came out it was basically the first Western MMO to play like this, but now we have different games that do the same thing in a much more fair and reasonable fashion (Tera, for example). This game will try your patience, hurt your fingers, frustrate you when it should be entertaining you. Unless you're a horny teenage boy or girl that likes looking up skirts, avoid like the plague.","July 22, 2015","false","130.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It has become a cesspool of pay-to-win, arrogant imbeciles who have very large egos because they already have end-game gear and you don't, despite long months of straight work to get where you've gotten with your character. On top of that, this game is jam-packed full of bugs that are to blame from both the publisher, Nexon and the developer DevCat. Both would rather punish players instead of fixing whatever bugs may be present. I'm personally not sure how I invested so much time into this game. The gameplay itself is just about the only good thing about this game. Unfortunately, that's just not enough to make this game good as a whole. I would really like to see completely new management from the publisher's staff. I'd like to see a complete overhaul of bug fixes and things in the category. I would also LOVE to see stable servers and a rewrite of some of the internal coding of this game. One of the things this game has going for it is the blatant and shameless sexuality that it promotes. That's one reason it does semi-well, due to the inner armors (underwear) that you can purshase for your character. Basically, what I'm trying to say is: "Just don't waste your time on this game." If you decide to play it, then just don't expect much. This game is designed to take a very long time to obtain items, whether they be weapons or armor, and it's also designed to nearly force you to spend money on it in order to protect your gear from potential failed enhancements or enchants, both of which can destroy your items.

Granted it was poorly implemented to begin with, but instead of opting to fix it, the instead removed it, and sunsquently reworked all of seaon 2, map lay out and enemys, to compenstate for the player no longer being able to jump.\n\nSecondly, they actually removed the option to run season 2 from levels 8-49. Because high level players where farming them for Seals (needed to buy high end mats) and AP (needed to rank up skills, some of which need 2 or 3k per rank and you at best, getting 250) so again, instead of fixing the issue, they just removed a chunk of the game.\n\nThen there what Nexon it self is doing, since Devcat isn't the only one ruining this thing.\n\nThe cash shop is starting to lean toward a 'pay2win' model, granted, it's still a LONG way from that, but it's starting down that road, from the overpriced pets who grant extra, and rather potentant effects like buffs or mining ore for you, to the laughably over priced Enchantment, and Enhancement Runes that are pretty much required to be usefull in the 70-80 tier content,\n\nThe 'events' are pretty much ONLY for lining Nexon pockets with money, with what ever free items being little more then the cheapest items in the cash shop, while what ever good items that are attatched are only attainable vai 'random item' boxes you buy from the cash shop, with a rather horrible chance of actually getting the event item, as you'd probably expect.\n\nSpeaking of the RNG, It's horrible here. Drop rates have always been bad in this game, but pretty much any equipment worth using level 60 and up requires AT LEAST one ultra rare mateiral drop, per piece, and I don't mean 'I've been farming for a week and finally got one' rare, I mean 'this raid has been out for a year, I've been running it daily, still haven't gotten the drop I need' rare. Sadly, I'm not exagerating ether.\n\nThe RNG ties into the final issue I want to mention. the price of things. The amount of gold you need to cercumvent the drop rates is prohibitive to every one who isn't willing to risk getting ripped off to buy gold. the Seal Shop, which sells the ultra rare mateirs you need, is suppossed to combat the drop rate issue, but it really just added to the grind problem, with some taking anywhere from 5 days, to more then a month of JUST Seal farming to get. (12 seals per day, 1 seal per raid run, 1 victory per raid a day)\n\nThe actual gameplay it self is still fun, but Nexon effectively destoryed what ever potental it had utterly through greed and imcompatence. The game is dieing, and at this point, I say let it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been playing it since the open beta 2 years ago\n\nVindictus is an action based MMO the centers on instances, and TRUE SKILL when fighting bosses. to win you need to learn a bosses tells and openings, you gear, even maxed out, only makes up about 10%, at best, of your odds of winning, the rest is on you, the player.\n\narmor and weapons must be made by gathering matierals from bosses anf raid bosses, with the only short cut being the auction house, and even then all gear has a level and skill requirement, even the stuff in the cash shops weapon/armor packs, which are filled with imporved gear, you can make on your own with out spending a dime.\n\nthe cash shop it self is mostly about convienace, potions, graces and invintory space will likely be the bulk of your purchices, along with some avatar items to make you character look better.\n\nall in all, it is a good game that deserves more attention then its gotten, and despite what Tera says, Vindictus IS the first true action MMO","June 26, 2012","false","901.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has features of one, like a global marketplace and raids and the sort, but it stops there. There are only two cities in the entire game and a field that seperates them with little activity in either one. Aside from queing for battles, there isn't much to do in the locations, there's crafting and quest givers that can provide some interesting dialouge, but it stops there. Honestly, this isn't too much of a problem compared to the more pressing problems I have with the game.\n\nGameplay is very solid, however, the skill tree for each of the playable characters is very diverese as each character is allowed to use two different weapons in their class; such as a mage who can choose to use a scythe or a staff or a tank that can use either a pillar or cestus as a weapon. Each provide their own strengths and weaknesses in their own regard and I found it enjoyable learning the combos and intricacies of each weapon and skill.\n\nUnfortunately, the pros for the game stop at the gameplay. The largest problem I have with the game is the developer; for those that don't know, Nexon is a very greedy company. The in-game store offers a range of items that either change the cosmetic appearance or provide a game breaking and pay-to-win experiance like buying items that buff your stats to paying to allow yourself to do more raids, it's downright criminal. The downfall of this also comes into the heafty price they ask for literally EVERYTHING. Just to change the hairstyle of your character (as you can only choose about 5 when you first start, then have to pay, seperately, for the additional 20 Nexon expects you to buy) runs you about $7. Want to change your clothes? $10. Want to be able to do more daily raids? $10.\n\nAnother serious problem with Nexon is their support for the game. While the branches of Nexon in various other areas of the world like in Europe or Asia recieve timely patches to the game that actually provide new content like new characters, new locations, new raids, etc. The Nexon supporting this version, Nexon NA, is the about the most incompetent company I have seen. Instead of working on updates that the community has been begging for, they keep making new events that act as little mini-games or side missions you can do that, SURPRISE, you have to pay real money in order to even finish, and sometimes even participate in.\n\nProbably the largest problem I have with the game, despite how dreadful the company is, is the absoltuely absurd grind that you have to do at high levels. The main story lasts from levels 1-60, which is not that bad and you may end up being overleveled for some missions you must do, but after you finish the main story comes the real pain. From 60, the level cap is 80, and you can obtain the best weapons and armor in the game, but in order to do this requires you to not only grind many, many hours away hoping you get the materials required to make a weapon or piece of armor, but to withstand the god awful drop rate that about every item has. The drop table is about as bad as the enhancing and upgrading system in the game. To make matters worse, in order to even get the item you need, you have to grind raids. Remember what I said about how greedy Nexon was? Well you can only run the raids you need about 3 times or so a day, so if you really want those materials, you better pull out your wallet because grinding that raid is gonna cost you extra.\n\nHonestly, I really want to recommend this game to everyone, but unless this game gets taken over by a more respectable and competent company, I simply can't.","June 29, 2014","false","447.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But Nexon really makes it hard to even enjoy the game without buying anything. Your character will look like ♥♥♥♥ until you buy a inner armor package, and the really nice outer armors are basically impossible to permanently own unless you buy.  Features within the game itself sometimes are lessened in quality because of course, you did not buy anything. It just really get frustrating after a while.

The cash shop gives a certain advantage of time, where some players must grind and farm the same boss over and over day after day hoping to pick up the rare crafting item they need with a 10% drop rate, cash shop players can simply buy it on the spot. Power ups can be rarely obtained from special events, but the majority are from the cash shop, and they give such an advantage that a level 40 player with amazing gear could be owned with ease in pvp by a level 30. The progression system gets old as well, since the ENTIRE game is about killing stuff, expect to see the same enemies a level or two higher each time you do a quest, add in the occasional boss, until you reach the next area. Oh, and you can't get your hands on that ingredient you need to finally complete the armor you wanted? No problem my friend, just stop by the marketplace, after 2-3 minutes of waiting for the marketplace HOME page to load, you can now purchase your rediculously overpriced item which will drain you of that 10 hours money grind you did.\n\nFinally, there are the raid battles, where the REAL fun in this game starts. At level 20 you can start your first raid battle, which is a bunch of people all fighting a GIANT monster, usually a dragon. Sounds like fun right? Wrong, the matchmaking system takes an hour to pair 10 people together, and you need 15 to start. The first thing you'll notice when you start is, 1) there are at least 3 players YOUR level with absolutely overpowered gear from the cash shop, 2) there will be people sitting in the back, often your healers, doing nothing but spamming the chat, 3) surprise surprise and happy birthday, you cannot deal substantial damage to the boss until you're at least 20 levels above it. no worries though, hit the boss once and stand back like the healers, you get the same reward as everyone else for just standing around with your thumb up your ♥♥♥. The worst part about raid battles though, is the daily restriction on how many times you can run them, at high levels this doesn't matter as much seeing as you have access to multiple raids (each one has it's own daily counter thank god), but again don't expect to do much to the boss at all unless you've reached a much higher level than it's requirements or paid $50 in the cash shop for end game gear.\n\nMy recommendation is to not play this game, I had fun for a while and you can too, but eventually you reach a point where you'd rather strip all your armor off, unequip your weapon and just yolo into a boss naked because, hey why not those cash shop players do and they never die right?","June 27, 2014","false","100.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which way you lean, and how you want to fight yourself.\n-Amazing graphics.\n-Allows you to do raids, and work with a team for missions- Very helpful.\n-Did I mention the action was flippin' AMAZING?\n-If you say "Eh, I don't wanna play for a while." when you get pack, they give you stuff to say "PLS PLAY AGAIN" permanent epic weapons that aren't really rare, but sure look cool and are probably a step up from your old weapons, however it takes I believe 3 months of vacay from the game to get it.\n\nNow to the CONS:\n-Some stuff you have to pay for, but that's not too big a deal.\n-There are gaps in levels, where you have to grind to a certain level to move forward.\n-At times, it's very hard to play, sometimes the story won't finish until you repeat certain missions to even unlock the next place.\n-Limited weapons for your "class", don't get me wrong, it's nice to have weapons only your class can wield, but.. there's just not much variety, you get probably 3 weapons to choose from every 10-20 levels and at times it makes the choosing of appearance and how you wish to look for parties and what not rather dull. If they had more styles of weapons for your class, different shapes for them, more in general, it would improve the "fun-ness" of the game and make people more easily willing to play with more given choices.\n\nIt's an amazing game, definitely worth playing. I have 275 hours logged into it and more are sure to come, but unless you want to play the game for a long time, and get involved with its story- it might not be for you. Keep that in mind.\n\nOther than that, a really enjoyable game, and free to play? Well, damn, sign me up!\n\nOh wait, I already am.\n\nSee you in Vindictus my friends!\n\nBattle on.","July 8, 2014","true","277.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How about some action, RPG, and a whole lotta hack'n'slash? Vindictus is that game. Taking place thousands of years before the fantasy life MMORPG, Mabinogi, another Nexon title -- this game is definitely not about picking wool off a sheep or raising crops on a field. This is the most simple yet highly complex Action MMORPG out right now.\n\nMany have tried to emulate this style of MMO but Vindictus had laid forth a tyrant of an action game. Running on Valve's Source engine, the detail level of this game is simply gorgeous, the physics are top-notch (hilarious rag doll physics included), and monster AI will prove to give you a run for your golds at higher difficulties.\n\nVindictus is mainly a dungeon crawling Action MMORPG with hub to dungeon travel via Story /Quest Boards and some stages may look repetitive and they are but as you keep playing, you'll find many other things to do.\n\nWelcome to the Vindictus where skill matters..","July 25, 2012","true","734.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plenty of characters to choose from, and the graphics are crisp and clean. I don't play on steam cause my account is on a different email so my hours aren't accurately represented. Early on it may seem like a fine game, and it really is. But level 60 and above is where the game forces you to grind for gear unless you want to pay some large sums of gold to buy it instead. Gear also needs to be enhanced, and that can be a real headache since items can be destroyed or reset unless you have a rune (which is usually bought with real money). It's a long and tiring grind unless you got some real good luck, so I suggest you play with friends, join a guild, or do something to keep you interested in the game because this grind is going to become a common part of the game when you reach the higher levels. In fact, I HIGHLY suggest you get yourself and your friends/buddies/whatever to play together, cause playing alone can get boring when you're grinding for hours.\n\nPros\n- Great combat with intense and fast battles.\n- The game looks real good, and the gear makes you look cool.\n- Plenty of characters with their own kind of playstyles. Some have a 2nd weapon which also changes their fighting style.\n- Lots of content, the game has been here for quite a while, and more is being added. (Season 3)\n- Community is welcoming, guilds will usually be willing to tell you about the game and such.\n- Plenty of character customization.\n- The grind is worth it considering how badass you will look with all that glorious gear. So work hard! (Or not.)\n- Did I forget to mention how cool you will look? (no really.)\n\nCons\n- Atrocious drop rates on items you need for gear.\n- Gearing up can be VERY gold/time consuming. However, you only really need to worry about this at high levels.\n- Marketplace prices are inflated...don't be surprised if things are being put up for millions.\n- Grind, grind, grind. Grind for your items, gold, gear. It's going to become a nuisance if you don't embrace it.\n- Some people insist on having a certain amount of ATT for raids, so you might get kicked from them.\n- RNG aint on my side\n- You may suffer some lag problems during events or fights.\n\nIf you can look past all the faults this game has, then I assure that you will find a great game with combat unlike any other MMORPG I have seen. Just remember to take a break sometimes.","July 23, 2015","true","164.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far this game has a very slow and long update for the next new thing. This game has so far improved bits by bits over the years and i say, after season 3 comes out, everything will totally be easy for those who aren't hardcore. This is a great time to get started as doing raids, or solo, is much easier. Do not fret from being kicked from a boat if u need a quest done, simply go easy mode, which was just added, just to complete your quest without the need to find or wait for a raid. Leveling will still be a stingy part of the game so fret forward on that. So far as gameplay goes, the graphics are really nice, combat style is great, there is a good amout of characters to choose from if you don't find your fitting. Only part of the game you will be losing money on is the customization, whether you choose a male to look like Auron, or some other, customlization is a big thing in this game if you wana look cool, or look like a colorful clown, either way, you're going to waste somewhere around 10-15 for the Dazzle'em Dead pack, which is cheaper on steam than in the game. So expect to pay for cosmetics. Honestly this game might not be for everyone, but if you are the casual, expect to easily gain items as you play as it gets easier after Season 3, and also expect to be on a two to three month break of the game, like most people. To me, I will forever play this game as I become the number one Pantsu Fifi, so grind them materals*^*","July 2, 2015","true","305.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is nothing to write home about, some of the characters are interesting, the questing is rather dull (and heavily RNG'd on the Side Quests) but my biggest problem in this game comes from the insane difficulty spikes in higher level content.\n\nI'm fine with tough fights.  I love a challenging encounter.  A fight with a boss that can one shot anyone, hit half the arena (and not even as a special attack, that's just one of many) with no possible angle of attack where you can't get annihilated by a random attack with a 0.5 second tell.  God help you if you ever lag.\n\nYou can suggest that I'm bad at games if you want, but the real reason for this is actually quite brilliant.  This Nexon game allows you to buy 'Extra Lives', so making the end game raid fights as punishing as possible is 'good' game design.\n\nI love this game's combat system.  It flows nicely, it's entertaining and the animation/sound effects really sells the strength of the hits.  It's only a shame that such a good game was given to Nexon to monitize.  This game system with a better publisher would have been amazing.\n\nAs it stands, if you want to romp around and just kill some grunts with a good combat system, it's good for that.  It's almost got a Dynasty Warriors feel to it, depending on the character you pick.  However, when you get to the late game there won't be anything for you but brutally punishing 'Raid' battles that stand between you and continuing the story.  I don't mean one or two, by the way.  The last DOZEN quests of Season 1 contain at least 9 Raids.  Hope you have a lot of friends, or like waiting for people to join your party so you can keep playing the game.\n\nFun for a quick romp, but look elsewhere if you want anything of substance.","January 17, 2015","false","300.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat system alone makes the game worth playing, it's actually a shame you don't see this type of combo system in MMO's very often, as this makes it alot more interesting. It's very addicting, and you'll be spending days late game trying to catch those elusive raid drops. However, as with many Nexon games it survives off of microtransactions, as paying for certain aesthetics and even some game changing items are in the game, this being one of it's major flaws. It IS possible to get through the game without spending a penny, just very difficult.\nThe exp gain rate is okay compared to most MMOs, only getting truly painful up in your 65-80 level range. But by the time you're level 70, getting to 80 isn't always on your mind and it's best to just ease into the level. Overall it's a VERY good game despite it's flaws, yet every game has flaws of it's own.","January 9, 2014","true","222.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viperthesamurai/recommended/212160/","viperthesamurai","Viper Nakajima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viperthesamurai/","225 products in account","First of all, i come from the beta days. Back when there was only 3 characters and Evie still swung around her staff as a melee weapon (which is funny cause her doppelganger in the labyrinth still does this).  There are now 9 characters, each with very different styles of play, VERY pretty and powerful skills and while it can get a tad repetitive it's still enjoyable. While i do not support Nexon, i support this game. It's pay2lookgood, not pay2win. You can do everything you need to without paying a cent which is what free2play games are supposed to be. Granted progress may be slower than what you "could" be getting but that's just how F2P games stay afloat. They take advantage of impatience and what people want which depending on your stance may be a good or bad thing. Regardless, if people didn't want to throw money at these things, they wouldn't exist. Fact of the matter is, people want to play games but they don't want to spend money on them, which is another reason why F2P games are so popular.\n\nNow for the meat.\nThe game itself is entertaining, dialog is nice and funny if a little dodgy in the translations every once in a while. The season 1 story gets interesting at around level 30-40ish and i found myself losing even more hours to it as i went back to discover more and i haven't played much of the second season yet.\n\nYou level fairly quickly in the beginning and I only really noticed a big slow down at around 40-50. Which isn't bad considering you get most of your characters main skills at around 30, so you have a good idea of their capabilities and play style.\n\nThe combat itself is similar to a Dynasty Warriors game, which you use heavy movement and large attacks to damage enemies that come at you in small groups of up to i think 10 at once in some areas.\n\nMissions consist of an instance for your party, which for normal missions is a max of 4 people. Later on, you find larger raid boss missions that can have anywhere from 6 people all the way to 20+ The big boss battles are fun and are easy once you know what their attacks are and how they will react to yours. I am also under the assumption that every mission in the game is solo-able if you are just that good, i however am not. I can play just about everything in season 1 by myself but need a decent party for the big raid bosses.\n\nThe community from what i've seen isn't as trolly and elietest as some might say, whether they used to be or not i have no idea but i've not come across very many distasteful people in the times i've played. I also play on the West server, due to my understanding of it being strictly the U.S server, while the East server is Europe's. I have at least 100 hours if not a bit more, as i don't play as often as i used to but i have two characters 60+ and others in their 40's-50's.\n\nThe anime-esc visuals are quite pretty and the game can get quite fan-servicey which is also a love or hate type of deal. I personally love being able to look good and even some of the full armor sets look very good on either gender.\n\nCharacter creation is somewhat limited as you pick a pre-determined character but get to mess around with them a bit. Changing hair, height, size of various body aspects, tattoos and skin color, as well as their underwear which "can" consist of skimpy outfits but there are non skimpy options as well.\n\nLastly, i am not an MMO person. I don't typically like the styles they use and i don't really play the ones i like most of the time. But Vindictus is one of those games i enjoy and still come back to and it's loads better when you play and level with friends. I don't think it's the best game out there cause it's sure as hell not but it's free so it's something you don't have to devote time and money to if you don't want to. That being said, some of the money options are very helpful, and a couple of them are rather dumb but it doesn't hurt the experience much at all.\n\nIt's free, you don't need to spend any money to do what everyone else can do. Just play it for a while, get to around level 20 and then decide if it's worth your time or not.","January 24, 2015","true","53.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll still want a keyboard and mouse handy for the town areas and for typing and UI selections though.\n\nI find it difficult to enjoy most MMO titles, but this one really feels like you're playing an action title. The gameplay is fast paced and action oriented. Dungeons are initially doable solo, but eventually the difficulty ramps up too high for that.\n\nThankfully, joining random groups is simple and streamlined. Quest and mission objectives are usually very straightforward and areas are fairly linear for the most part, so teaming up and working together with other players is rarely a chore or hassle.\n\nThe story is a bit on the weak side, but the gameplay is the star of the show, and it shines brightly.","August 11, 2012","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Vindictus does it better, and it's been around longer.\n\nCombat is purely action-based, so much so that it feels more like God of War than World of Warcraft. It's tons of fun to slaughter hordes of enemies, and absurdly satisfying to take down the tough boss at the end of the dungeon. You can do all this by yourself, or party up with strangers or friends for a co-op experience.\n\nThis game is very skill-based, and while upgrading your in-game gear and abilities matters, the person who does the most damage to a boss usually depends on who knows the boss's attack patterns best. And with enough skill and patience, you could even defeat a nightmarish raid boss all by yourself! It's not EASY, but it's certainly doable.\n\nBut if you're going to play this game, I have one piece of advice for you: enhance and enchant your gear with caution. If you go too high (past +8 enhancement or Rank 9 enchants), your gear might break.","June 22, 2012","true","99.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So far this game has a very slow and long update for the next new thing. This game has so far improved bits by bits over the years and i say, after season 3 comes out, everything will totally be easy for those who aren't hardcore. This is a great time to get started as doing raids, or solo, is much easier. Do not fret from being kicked from a boat if u need a quest done, simply go easy mode, which was just added, just to complete your quest without the need to find or wait for a raid. Leveling will still be a stingy part of the game so fret forward on that. So far as gameplay goes, the graphics are really nice, combat style is great, there is a good amout of characters to choose from if you don't find your fitting. Only part of the game you will be losing money on is the customization, whether you choose a male to look like Auron, or some other, customlization is a big thing in this game if you wana look cool, or look like a colorful clown, either way, you're going to waste somewhere around 10-15 for the Dazzle'em Dead pack, which is cheaper on steam than in the game. So expect to pay for cosmetics. Honestly this game might not be for everyone, but if you are the casual, expect to easily gain items as you play as it gets easier after Season 3, and also expect to be on a two to three month break of the game, like most people. To me, I will forever play this game as I become the number one Pantsu Fifi, so grind them materals*^*","July 2, 2015","true","305.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I do have to add, though, that the game suffers from awful optimzation and terrible servers.\n\nMy system (i7-920, 12GB DDR3, GTX 660) gets 15-45 FPS with many many spikes into unresponsive 0 FPS. There is an option for using multiple processors but it's much like MWO's DX11 option in that it does absolutely nothing. If you host a raid you better have an i7-4790K that's pretty overclocked to get good framerate or any dual core and higher CPU with a frequency over 4GHz. This game is very limited by the CPU and it's clock speed. If you have an i7-4790K and throw a 7800GTX in, the game will run almost as good as if you put a GTX 980. It's that bad. I know, I've tested it.\n\nResolution: 1920x1080\nCPU + GPU - Average FPS - when tested\nP4 2.4GHz + 6600 GT - <20 FPS - at release of game\ni7-920 + 7800 GTX - ~30 FPS - 3+ years ago\ni7-920 + 2x 7800 GTX SLI - 33 FPS - 3+ years ago\ni7-920 + 2x GTX 260 SLI - 35 FPS - 2+ years ago\ni7-920 + GTX 460 - 40 FPS (see a pattern yet?) - 2 Years ago\ni7-920 + GTX 660 - 43 FPS - Today (After a fresh OS reinstall)\ni5-2500K + GTX 760 - 50 FPS - Today\ni7-4770K + GTX 690 - 60 FPS - 2 years ago (iirc)\ni7-4460 + GTX 970 - 60 FPS (seems to be the framelimit even without VSync) - a month ago\n\nMind you with every single one of these they had <30 FPS if you hosted a large raid. If the CPU has less than 3.2GHz clock speed you go down into the teens with spikes of unresponsiveness. The i7-920+GTX660 was struggling on Lakoria, Glas Ghaibhleann, Thor (especially bad), The Evil One (just unplayable...), and The God of Fomors (full party = 5-10 FPS).\n\nI've played Alpha's of newer games with better optimization.","February 18, 2015","false","574.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's market is messed up because of bots which the devs refuse to do something about.\n3. The game is full of antisocial people who never talk or work as a team when you party up, side from a few rare people you might find.\n4. Theres allmost no real choices for making you ideal looking person four hair types eyebrows six or so faces and you can't even pick you 're sex beacause thats restricted to classes which really kills the "rpg feel of the game" Allmost all the hair types you have to pay real cash for.\n5. The world is not open at all, you take a boat to each dungeon which isnt fun after a while just gets old, would of been fun if i had to huff it to a place on foot or some kind of mount.\nThere are only two pros.\n1. The graphic's are great.\n2. The combat is smooth and you can use allmost any game pad, vs mouse and keyboard.\nOverall stay away from vindictus.

It has good looking characters with plenty of customization and there really isnt another online game with combat like it, but thats the extent of its good. The game story is completely forgettable and you will be spending most of the time attempting to skip it when speaking with an NPC, voice acting for cut scenes is C grade at a stretch.\n\nThe whole lobby/dungeon system and no open world really makes it feel confined and serves to simply diminish the feeling of there being any real content. Youll run the same runs with the same scenery over and over and over and over, itd be one thing if you could explorer a vast and beautiful world but you cant, it doesnt exist outside your small towns. Speaking of the environments they are rather poorly made, they get the job done but in contrast to the characters they look like crap until you get to certain parts of Season 2 but still very dull in appearance and not much life to them.\n\nOnce you reach endgame its going to be a 6 month if youre lucky grind but more than likely years of grinding to get endgame gear due to extremely low drop rates which by the time you get it will be outdated anyway. You will be forced to spend money and find less than admirable ways to acquire the gear for you to be considered relevant (lots of P2W in Vindi). On that topic you will also find yourself in a community with a rather heavy elitist attitude to it, many are not newbie friendly and if you dont have endgame gear will get kicked frequently from boats later in the game which increases the difficulty of getting endgame gear even more.\n\nPvP is an absolute joke and was shackled on later in the games life and it shows as there is little reason to actually do it outside of it being forced in order to get certain items. This game has lots of potential, and the combat is great, but nexon has not done anything to really keep the player outside of plenty of TnA. The servers also have lots of issues and you will disconnect and lag ALOT. Once you reach that pinnacle of endgame gear and such there will be nothing left but to chat in lobby 1 and wait for the new raids with the "better" gear which wont come till they increase the level cap so there are large expanses with new content but only side grades of gear with different aesthetics.","January 27, 2015","false","242.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knightmachy/recommended/212160/","knightmachy","Knightmachy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knightmachy/","51 products in account","I've been playing this game on and off for several years (since the time they removed the limited boat boarding system), and I have to agree with most of the top reviews: Nexon looks like a ♥♥♥♥ company. Joining Steam has opened up the game to a much bigger and diverse gaming community, and I definitely appreciated the presence of new Steam players hopping on. Here are some pros & cons.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Excellent artistic style in characters, environment, boss fights, armor, and [most] cash shop outfits.\n+ Incredible boss fight music\n+ Thrilling gameplay that involves maneuvering around boss movements. [My FAVORITE aspect of this game!]\n+ Break off system that gives boss hunting a new meaning\n+ Very unique differences between each starting character's play style\n+ Breaking armor and revealing [cash-purchased] inner armor is mucho sexy.\n+ Community still has very nice people near the start of the game. Just very hard to find.\n+ Paladin & Dark Knight transformations are very epic to pull out in times of need.\n+ Dynamic environment - Barrels, crates, and other things break when struck or thrown.\n+ Erotic inner armor designs. (Con: They all cost money to permanently own.)\n+ Coloring armors and outfits. (Con: Costs money, again... & many people just make their armors look ridiculous with neon bright colors that step out of the game's original art style.)\n+ In-game marketplace is very dynamic (Con: takes weeks of waiting on selling at highs and buying at lows = ridiculous amount of time investment)\n+ Nice movesets and combos that give different methods of versatility during combat.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- They released a Sword Art Online Kirito outfit that still has a bug with the coat flapping and humping your leg. People who paid $35 for this outfit can't even put this thing on due to comments from other players. It seems that they are planning on moving on and ignoring this issue. (FINALLY fixed after more than a year!*)\n- Plenty of elitists.\n- Very buggy game. Lots of issues. Not very stable.\n- Lag becomes a big issue when timing precise and accurate dodge mechanics. The system does not give you the benefit of the doubt when you've begin a dodge but computer skips several frames of it.\n- Enhancement & Enchanting systems are batshit silly. Don't even try it. (see other reviews)\n- Outfit and armor appendages clip through the insides a lot, but may not irritate some players.\n- Someone is always looking at your equipment to make sure they are better than you. Then they act very happy on boats when they see that they've got no competition in racking up damage dealt to the boss. (Results screen reveals this)\n- Paladin & Dark Knight path levels take forever to level up. It becomes dismissed when a player finds out how much time it requires to reach the 2nd transformation.\n- Event exclusive items are mostly, if not all, timed crap. No joy in getting them.\n- When dying or coloring things in the Avatar shop, the light does NOT match the actual environment. Very possible to select an offset color that only looks good under strong light.\n- Community is filled with many naive people. Immature. Often sides with guild members and friends in ganging up and bullying other players.\n- Players who have been treated unfairly by Nexon customer service and pathetic compensation are left to fade away with no recognition of the event by other players.\n- The server screws everyone when an event attracts waves of Vindictus players to come back. Especially the quest dialogue reveals that it has a loading time. (Seriously... this is such an inefficient way of processing game information.)\n- Very limited end game armor options. All end game armors cost too much money and are excluded to only those that can grind enough money to get it. (again, ridiculous time investment that does not reward actual amount of time spent. depends on RNG -- with very low odds of getting rare drops)\n- There's even a site called vindictussnobs.something -- Highly invested players know that they are snobs? Okay.\n- ... This can keep going. The cons are abysmal as long as player satisfaction remains negative.\n\n\nI could go on all day talking about the Pros and Cons of the game; however, I hope this gives good info for what players will possibly deal with when picking this game up. It's one of those games that I can only play with a single friend or two. It is definitely not a game I can recommend to most people. Nexon's finance model is truly reflected in all of their hosted games. I can only continue to play this game by myself (and sometimes with a friend) because it is ultimately a very lonely experience for someone who is casual but still loves certain parts of this game.\n\nAfter reading a few of the top reviews: Hiding armors and other enjoyable features for cash shop promotions? Seriously? What a way to sink a company's reputation.","January 24, 2015","false","011.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is nothing to write home about, some of the characters are interesting, the questing is rather dull (and heavily RNG'd on the Side Quests) but my biggest problem in this game comes from the insane difficulty spikes in higher level content.\n\nI'm fine with tough fights.  I love a challenging encounter.  A fight with a boss that can one shot anyone, hit half the arena (and not even as a special attack, that's just one of many) with no possible angle of attack where you can't get annihilated by a random attack with a 0.5 second tell.  God help you if you ever lag.\n\nYou can suggest that I'm bad at games if you want, but the real reason for this is actually quite brilliant.  This Nexon game allows you to buy 'Extra Lives', so making the end game raid fights as punishing as possible is 'good' game design.\n\nI love this game's combat system.  It flows nicely, it's entertaining and the animation/sound effects really sells the strength of the hits.  It's only a shame that such a good game was given to Nexon to monitize.  This game system with a better publisher would have been amazing.\n\nAs it stands, if you want to romp around and just kill some grunts with a good combat system, it's good for that.  It's almost got a Dynasty Warriors feel to it, depending on the character you pick.  However, when you get to the late game there won't be anything for you but brutally punishing 'Raid' battles that stand between you and continuing the story.  I don't mean one or two, by the way.  The last DOZEN quests of Season 1 contain at least 9 Raids.  Hope you have a lot of friends, or like waiting for people to join your party so you can keep playing the game.\n\nFun for a quick romp, but look elsewhere if you want anything of substance.","January 17, 2015","false","300.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are games I've payed for that don't come close to this level of awesome.\n\nThe graphics are actually really good for a game with Dx9 and built on the source engine. The bosses are creative and sometimes irritatingly difficult (but then you just bring a bud and wipe the floor with'em).\n\nPvP? Couldn't tell ya how it is because I don't like to fight people on games like this... so I don't and it doesn't hinder the gaming experience on bit.\n\nThe music is good too and gets you pumped for fights\n\nThen there are the wide variety of classes to choose from. At the moment there is a character for nearly every playstyle. The only one they don't have is one that uses stealth as their primary form of defence.\n\nThe only down side I see to this game is the RNG is aweful and can ruin your character by destroying the only weapon you own and leaving you with no money left.

But if you can ignore the cash shop, ignore the uninspired special events and ignore your inability to progress through the leveling grind and the gear grind (as a result of ignoring the cash shop), you can actually enjoy this game for what it should have been and still kind of is under all the Nexon-crap, that being, a really fun and extremely epic action-combat monster-pummeling boss-battling epic fighting game of epicness!","June 23, 2012","true","921.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is an action MMO and probably the best of its kind.  There is no real world to explore and not a whole lot to do outside of dungeon crawling.  Also, be prepared for a very heavy grind and long farming sessions.  Also the company that runs the game kind of blows.  Also, the community is just so-so.  There are a lot of elitists in this game.  A lot.\n\nBut the game itself really isn't terrible at all and if you're a fan of Blade & Soul, Tera or any other action MMO you'll feel right at home.  But keep in mind that this game is very challenging and if you want to do any of the higher end-game content, you'll either have to spend hundreds of dollars in the cash shop or farm til your eyes bleed.  The amount of customization is great in this game and you can make your character look amazing, but again, it all comes down to how much money you want to throw into the cash shop.\n\nThe game isn't pay-to-win, however, and there's plenty of opportunity for glory to those who work hard enough.  Just enjoy the ride and find a nice guild to call home.  Know what you're getting into ahead of time and there won't be any surprises.","June 29, 2012","true","230.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Attack vs skill had more of a balance in the long ago past but the scale definitely favours your stats these days. The bosses have become closer to punching bags than enemies with little fulfillment outside the worthless e-peen of damage rankings in end results.\n\nI will still recommend it if you find a nice group of friends to play with since the game can also be a good social experience within guilds. And while it's harder to play casually, the option is still there (might get kicked for low stats). It will depend on what type of person you are and what you want. My funnest times were yelling at random people while wearing shorts and a bunny hat, and that's a successful casual experience in my book.

Being 'online' would not be unlike the contrast of being in the city and living in the suburbs. Like a city wide wireless connection. It also got me thinking into the viablity of free-to-play games. It's not just a design change or even a mechanical one for the end user. It's a whole paradigm shift. It's like you go to inhabit a world that exists regardless of your presence.

As soon as I fixed one launching error, another would pop up. I reinstalled the game twice and even after I had checked the file integrity immediatly after installing, it said there were issues. So I had to go through the game's files and delete random .avi files and rewrite dates in text files to be current. After finally getting into the main menu and excited to start playing, I can't even connect to a server. I tried all of the whopping 3 servers to try to play and none worked. The game looks fun to mess about with until you get to the endgame grind, but with the overwhelming amount of flaws with just launching and entering the game, coupled with many other people's frustrations with customer service (which you will be bound to run in to eventually) and game design revolving around in-game purchases, I can't recommend it in the least.","January 29, 2015","false","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This interpretation is centered around Korean anime people in either chain-mail lingerie or pots-and-pans armor wielding giant battle-scythes and tree trunks: so basically, everything you'd expect from 14th century pre-Christian Celtic folklore.\n\nIn this version, Pwyll is named "Lann", Pryderi is "Kai", Rhiannon is "Evie", Branwen is "Fiona", and Bendigeidfran is "Karok". Instead of the original episodic tales that feature the relationships between characters, their romances, conflicts, struggles and occasional deus ex machina magic, you just grind for levels, pay microtransactions and commit a lot of animal cruelty to dog people, vampires, blood jellies, golems and dragons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excaliburnina/recommended/212160/","excaliburnina","Fall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excaliburnina/","129 products in account","Vindictus has a really solid combat system, even down to the skill trees and characters. The problem with this game is quite literally everything else. After trudging through a ton of repetitive, boring areas to level 60, you are then presented with the fun endgame raid bosses. I'm not being sarcastic either, they are really fun. The problem is that, to fight these bosses, you need a certain amount of attack stat to even damage them properly. The result is a giant "gear wall", and this is almost entirely determined by the RNG. Since equipment does not drop in Vindictus, you can only rely on obtaining the rare materials needed to craft the equipment. While this isn't really a problem, the other materials can become exceedingly expensive as well, such as iron ores. Now, if you aren't going to try to rely on the RNG, you can succumb to the pay2win aspect of this game. Nexon manages this game horribly. So lets say you acquired some decent gear, but now you have to upgrade it to be anything useful which is fine and sometimes fun. In Vindictus, after +8, if you even manage to get it to that level without it resetting to +0 completely, your equipment now has a chance to be deleted. Yes, deleted. That weapon you tried so hard to acquire is now gone. Now it can be restored by spending incredibly large amounts of AP (months of grinding more or less), but that sets you back a long time. Most players stop at +10, the upgrade cap for equipment is +15, and the chances of getting +15 are disguistingly difficult, but also incredibly rewarding. So if your weapon is +8 and you want to get it to +10 without failing, what do you do? You buy Enhancement Runes. A cash shop item that protects your equipment from breaking. So now the gear wall has become a paywall. Wonderful. So you +10 your weapon, and its time to enchant it, give it some affixes with bonuses to different stats. You'll want to do this with your armor too, and even accessories. They are minor by themselves, but combined are a major bonus to your stats. Now, depending on the scroll, it can also...delete your gear! What can you do about this? Buy Enchantment Runes! More paywall! So the point I'm trying to make about this game is its nigh-impossible to play it without spending money. Its a pay2win game with terrible RNG, a dying community, laggy servers and awful customer support. If any other company ran this game It would, without a doubt be significantly better.","July 3, 2014","false","420.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","4"

It feels like an action game, everything is synced well between players, there's even physics-objects to smash to bits and throw your enemies into. This is what MMOs should be doing.\n- Large number of characters to try with varying fighting styles. You'll probably find one you like if you try them all.\n\nCons:\n- High difficulty. If you want to win, you will have to try HARD, and very likely get some friends to help you with the harder levels. Oh, and do not expect to solo late-game bosses. Ever.\n- If you're not interested in story (like me) there's a lot of dialogue to skip through, which can be annoying.\n- It gets grindy once you hit the wall that is level 60.\n- You will probably have to pay some real money to make your character look pretty.\n- Nexon. Need I say more?\n\nI know it looks like the cons outweigh the pros in this case, but keep this in mind: even if the game gets grindy, even if the difficulty is high, even if there's annoying quest dialogue, the base gameplay is FUN. Fun enough to make the game worth playing, at least in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr - It's not perfect, not by a longshot - but the combat is the best I've seen in an MMO.

Controls and Feels like Dynasty Warriors. Great to play in co-op with freinds.\n\nBeware of a few things: it uses a Class System with limited character customisation. You will have to leap past an initial pay-wall and buy a dazzel-em dead pack if you want a fully customized character. In fact just straight up beware of all the DLC, it's a free to play game and DLC costs a boatload, and much of  the actually useful stuff is upright temporary.\n\nAnd Also beware of the fact that the game's graphical, lighting, and gameplay quality will amp up as you progress through the game, and won't really begin to shine until halfway through season 1 of the game when you enter Rocheste. Nearly all the gameplay balances came in the form of Character updates, and the early levels have not been overhauled yet (but apparently character and armor textures are about to be updated to higher res, so you have something to look forwards to).\n\nOtherwise, it's a great game that is worth a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/APeanuts/recommended/212160/","APeanuts","Tumbleweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/APeanuts/","122 products in account","Vindictus is a hack n slash type game with a rich story (if you like reading through long text scenes).\n\nFirst off: If you're looking for a F2P MMO that you don't want to put money into: Turn away. Right now.\n\nPros:\nThe game itself is fun when you're playing with a group of friends and helping eachother out.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun, "open combat" (no targeting, free roam fighting) Think of something like Kingdom Hearts combat in a sense. With the lack of a lock on system, which isn't really needed for this type of game.\n\n(As of now) There are a nice diverse set of characters to play, and it is fun to try out each character for different styles of gameplay.\n\nThe leveling is very guided and easy to do, just follow the story and you'll pretty much level up from 1 to end game in at least a month or so of moderate play. If you play nothing but this game you could get to end game content within a few days.\n\nCons:\n\nHosting is a very rare ability which very few people can handle.\n\nThis game runs on only ONE core. The more cores you have, the possibly less stability you'll have with the game.\nDuo cores run this game like gods. (If you have around 3 to 3.5 Ghz)\n\nThe community in this game can be very unforgiving. Elite-ists make it hard for new players to enjoy the game (with "boat restrictions" requiring people to have a set amount of stats to join them). The community sets the bar high for most end game content, making it hard for new players to enjoy all the game as to offer, and learn how to play the game/fight, in terms of big raids and fights.\n--\n(Refering also to the comment above) The game requires a lot of "luck" and "time" to be able to play end game content. Even though now it is easy to meet bare minimum requirements with a certain Level 70 set, it is still hard to find accepting people. (Also the cap at the time of this review is level 80. Plans to raise the level cap are in the air apparently.)\n\nEnd game equipment is very hard to obtain, because the drops needed for End game equipment are very rare. When these do end up dropping, the more wise decision is to sell it (for casual play that is). It is not impossible, but it is very time consuming and tedious to collect all of the neccesarry materials for end game items.\n--\n(Follow up) "End" end game equipment, items previous to the "now" end game equipment, is actually obtainable through literally just playing the game. These "end" end game equipments are helpful in meeting newer boat requirements but are also tedious to work towards (Ex: Apoc sets you need "Blue tears" to make 3 out of 5 parts of the set. The tear can be bought in a "seal shop" for roughly 334 seals. To get these seals you need to run one-a-day raids. You can obtain up to 12 seals a day. If you dedicate yourself, you can get one tear after 28 days of straight raids. If you have no luck in buying a tear, or if you never get a drop to use toward the set, that is 84 days of Raid grinding for a Level 70 set. Brutal sounding, right?)\n\n\n\n\nOverall, after my four or five years of playing this game (since release) I'd have to say:\n\nIf you're looking to play with a group of friends diligently, this is a good game to play.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to casually play by yourself, it could be fun at first, and then very frustrating toward end game.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to play hardcore in and out, prepare your ♥♥♥♥ for the hardships you may encounter. Find a guild to join or something.\n\nIf you want to just play this game because you think it looks good, Don't stick to it you might get disappointed by end game community.\n\n\nSEASON 3 UPDATE:\n\nSeason 3 has made the game much more forgiving, but not to the point of handing you the game. It is much easier for players to build end game gear without making impossible leaps of luck. Rare materials are easily accessible through the revamped Seal Shop and it is much easier to make the gears needed to progress through the game.\n\nThis does not mean you will not hit a point where spending money will never be a need. This game still, almost requires, some amount of money to be put into it. How much you spend is really up to you.","August 8, 2014","true","288.9"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

However, as you get to endgame the game violently shifts to pay to live...  Meaning, you will have to spend real money on health pots, goddess graces, and other items to keep you alive because if you attempt to to use the free itmes you will get hit, and when you get hit you will lose more hp than you would of gained drinking the potion.\n\nAdditionally, you will need a beefy computer and internet connection to host games because this game is Peer to Peer connections ... meaning Lag is an issue.  Combat at endgame is all about twitch combat and if your connection sucks you will be eating the ground before you know it.\n\nThere is no function support for this game.  Meaning Nexon the publisher and Devcat the developer both suck at their jobs and do not respond to support tickets.\n\nEndgame hurts ... Ive been paying for years and have only gotten about 10 endgame gear drops ... so you have to grind and sell items on the Market Place to make money to buy the rare drops.\n\nYou need stupidly high dps for endgame as bosses have a defense limit you have to break or you will be doing effectivly no dps ... so this leads to elitiest boats.\n\nThere is no balance in the game.  I have a Hammer Fiona ... I do stupidly low dps in endgame because thats just how things work now .... I refuse to switch because I love hammers and unless Devcat rebalances the clas or adds new abilities thats the way it goes.\n\nKai's are OP as all getout ... their mobility and ranged dps means they can avoid most boss spam and continue high dps, so if you are looking for a fun class ... they are your money ticket.\n\nThere are in game purchases ... and they are overpiced.\n\n\nThey key to surviving in this game is 2 things... find good friends and a good social guild.... you need to have fun or this game will rub you the wrong way hard.","October 10, 2014","true","693.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","17","33","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiiromun/recommended/212160/","kiiromun","The Gabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiiromun/","23 products in account","I've played Vindictus since the start of OBT. I've played the game for many hours throughout these few years, and I must say that this game is by far the most addictive game I've ever come across with.\n\nWith that said, here are my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nHack and Slash - This game is unique in game-play with it's hack and slash mechanics. I have played many hack and slash games, and I can say none of them compete well with Vindictus. It's battle system has kept me playing for years. It's combos gave me a rush of dopamine from the get-go. I got hooked, and it felt good.\n\nCharacter Diversity - Each character has it's unique play-style. Currently, you can play as 8 characters. Lann, Fiona, Evie, Karok, Kai, Vella, Hurk, Lynn, and soon Arisha. Each character is unique in battle. Even while Vella and Lann share the same weapon (Twin Swords), they feel very much different from one another. I've tried each character, and can see similarities among them, but they stand out on their own.\n\nThe Abundance of Channels - Each Server has a total of 200 channels. Whether you want to interact, or play alone, channels provide a spot for everyone.\n\nThe Story - The story is beautiful. I will not explain it, I don't like giving story spoilers. I will say, this game would be an amazing anime.\n\nCons:\n\n\nRNG - Of course, this will be my first con to list. The RNG (Random Number Generator) of this game is very broken. You want to gear up, and enhance as best as you can?\nGear enhancement can be very, very risky.\nAfter +6, you will risk the enhancement to 0, and after +8, you risk breaking.\n\nSome people have a lot of luck, and could possibly go from +0 to +15 in one go, but that's extremely rare.\nA lot of players resort to buying NX to buy Enhancement Runes to protect their arsenal.\nOver all, the RNG seems really unfair to everyone.\n\n\nDrop Rate - This goes along with the RNG. The drop rate sucks in this game, even with VIP, or VVIP services (which range from 10$ to 20$ a month) most of the drops end up being garbage.\n\nServer Stability - (Peer to Peer) - More times than not, I stay away from 24-man raids, and leave boats where the host only has 1 bar. Peer to Peer works great in Korea, but face it... North America is much more vast than South Korea.\n\nBots - This game is infested with bots. These bots also inflate the economy, making things harder to earn.\n\nDepot Shop/Avatar Shop Pricing - The prices tend to be high up there. Though, you do not have to buy anything from these shops, people prefer to buy to look good, or gear up better. The game can have it's ugly pay2win moments.\n\nRecycled Dungeons - Perilous Ruins, Ruins of Sanctity, and Hilder Forest are the same maps. After a while, everything looks familiar, and dull. Prairie Entrance and Fomorian Base are purposely the same location. (Fobellow Prairie). That includes Ainle, and The Catacombs. (Night time, and Day time)\n\nCommunity - The community of this game can either be amazingly awesome, or terribly annoying.\nIt ranges from down to earth people who actually play this game, to sorry people who try to tell you how to play the game, and act like they are a better person than you based on their numbers. Though, this is in every game, it's something one must learn to endure in MMORPGs.\n\n\n\nMy Rating:\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nServer Stability: 5/10\nCommunity: 4/10\nDungeons: 6/10\nPremium Shops: 6/10\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10.\n\nNOTE: Despite of my review and rating, I recommend this game. You should try it for yourself before you make any conclusions.","August 22, 2014","true","402.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","0"

The freedom it gave you was limited. For example, the Megaman inspired stage system got somewhat repetitive. It turns out that it's necessary to play the same level 4, 5, 6, and sometimes up to 10 times simply to gain bigger amounts of EXP. To put it simply, it's a fun game after level 50, and that level takes repetition of the SAME stages, OVER and OVER!

The cash shop isn't pay2win, and the females practically need the purchased underwear to actually look good in some of their armor.\n\nNo guys, unfortunately the armor is NOT Tera style...

The last missions CANNOT be solo'd and in fact require a full party (6 people) to defeat.  Solo players will not be getting far unless they are very skilled or overleveled (which is very easy, since you can buy AP caps in the cash shop and just max out all your skills).  Also, good luck finding people to help in the later missions, as most missions have little inthe way of rewards to encourage people to replay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043411863/recommended/212160/","76561198043411863","ALL OF THE HOMO","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043411863/","51 products in account","Let me start off with one of my most common comment about this game, "Vindictus, is like playing a 60 dollar RPG game, but you can use the 60 dollars for asthetics". I've played this game since it was in closed beta, and I still remember the old days playing with my old group, dungeon crawling, figuring out how to strategize against bosses, and continously scream at Blood Lord. This game is a great MMO, especially for the crowds that are trying to get into them. I say this especially because there are other MMOs that people try to get into and absolutely lose faith in them afterwards. They usually fall under 3 major causes, difficulty, complexity, and graphics.\nDifficulty is pretty straight forward, and some games completely screw over the player. By trying to constantly challenge the player at the beginning of the game, players will eventually lose faith and stop. Making a game too easy, will also make the game less appealing. Vindictus finds a nice way to easily situate the player, get them used to their characters, and begin to show them their true potential through skills like Gliding Fury, Counter Attack, Clash, or Cross Stance/Cut.\nComplexity is really how complex the gameplay can be. You don't want a game that makes everything too simple to the player. A constant click click click, and you beat the game, is really not the best way to allure players.  On the other extreme, people don't want a game that will have them alternating several keys at once in order to just attack. In games such as vindictus, it's imperial to make sure the player is having fun, not always on edge because he/she is constantly panicking during "basic" fights. Vindictus is basic enough to keep a player at attention, and at the same time is complex and very fun. Nothing makes me happier than to grab a kobold or gnoll and slaying them in multiple fashions.\nGraphics is one of the most debated topics in my time of playing games. One one side, it's great to have good graphics because it makes it seem realistic and provides a surreal environment. On the other hand, you don't one graphic or else only those with high definition graphic cards could play it. Vindictus is a perfect example of games who found an equilibrium, as the realistic models and stunning graphics make it seem all too real to be true.\nVindictus overall is a great game, and I hope that it gets as much love as I have for it. It may have it's flaws but it does make up for it in several departments. One major concern is always the Nexon Depot, as you can buy things using real life money. However all of that is trivial, and does not get in the way of you beating the game, unlike other games that require you to spend 5 dollars to unlock their membership mode. I say yet again, it's like a 60 dollar MMO, but free.","February 16, 2014","true","469.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are many character types to choose from, each offering a different playstyle. Along with great gameplay, this game also offers good graphics, and a somewhat destructable environment which u can take to your advantage during some enemy encounters. With that said however this game does have its drawbacks. The majority of the player base is focused towards the later part of the game, which would be fine, but this leaves those at earlier stages left to fend forthemselves, making progrssion lonely, and boring at times. Once you do get to the later parts of the game you soon realise that attaining certain armor and weapons almost impposible as extremely poor drop rates, and insanely high prices means only a lucky few will aquire said items. But don't be discouraged, because even with deacent gear, and sharpened skills you can still play and enjoy every aspect of this game.\n\nTo conclude, this game certainly isnt perfect, however, if you find a good guild and make some new friends, you will have a great time slashing and bashing monesters and look good doing it. The gameplay will keep you coming back, and there will always be more improvements to make to the characters you play.\n\nIf your at least curious about this game I highly recomend you try it, you might be pleasantly surprised. I'll see you in there. :)\n","June 25, 2014","true","000.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnCable/recommended/212160/","CapnCable","Lagurcrs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnCable/","64 products in account","This game really caught my eye for one reason.  It was actually Free to Play, unlike every other MMO known to mankind.  The only things you actually have to pay for aren't necessary for completion of the game.  I haven't actually paid for anything yet in the game.  There's also offers to earn NX, the ingame currency.  So, if you want, you could complete the entire game without touching your wallet.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, yet addictive.  While some runs may need to be repeated to reach the next level(and unlock the next quest), the boss battles can be challenging, and good fun.  Along with these are "Oaths of Honor", which are small challenges to make the run more difficult(Example, complete the quest under a set time, or use no potions).  You can jump into battle with one of the six characters in the game.  Do you want to charge in swords-a-blazing?  Snipe your foes with a longbow?  Crush everyone with a Cestus?  The choice is yours.\n\nAnyway, I hope this review has helped you decide on this game(And hopefully, I got it accurate xD).","May 3, 2013","true","251.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In a lot of free games you almost HAVE to buy "optional" stuff in order to play, not in this one. Most of the shop items are for looks, or little boosts that you can get in the game anyway. The game itself is kind of like a Monster Hunter game. The fact that this is done on the Source Engine is really astonishing...it looks and feels like something done on a mainstream engine, such as Havok. When I got this I was expecting some clunky rpg to burn spare time on and then toss in a couple weeks after a good game came along, but this is actually a very well done game.\n\nPros:\n-It's not the kind of f2p where you have to spend real money in their shop in order to play it.\n-It looks good and feels good, like a mid-level game done out of a big studio (like Capcom).\n\nCons:\n-It's an mmo, so no single player offline, of course.\n-There has been a bit of lag, likely due to all the new Steam traffic (but it should die down after the casuals get bored with it).","June 26, 2012","true","81.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Everyone worked as a team. The grinding was was not tedious.THE COMBAT WAS SO AMAZING! Every move was precise and the physics were just out standing.  .And I say this because every battle was different. The crafting was also worth the time. All and all back then...I would have giving it a 9/10.\n\nFast Forward today.\n\nNo, I can not reccomend this game. I decided to get back into it and see whats changed. And to be honest...it sucks.\nI got spammed with bots and people weren't very nice anymore. NO one worked as a team in my experience.\nThis game had a lot of potential. And I feel like some of it..isnt there anymore. Combat is still decent. But what annoys me is the damage indicators... That really annoys me. Because before. You hit an enemy and it's like.. Damn, I must've hit him hard. And made you wanna hit this enemy more. Now with damage indicators its like... 20 damage... Well damn. I dont feel that immersed anymore.

Even when renting the prices are rarely under $7 for a week.\n-Ads for you to purchase in-game items everywhere.\n-Absolutely no exploration at all. You never really get to go anywhere. Just tiny town with 4 buildings, to a boat, to a series of rooms where you hit things until they die.\n-Assets are overused for enemies and levels, making the whole thing feel very lazily made.\n\nThe only reason I play this is because I can't get my friends to play anything else yet.","November 11, 2014","false","32.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Vindictus is very well balanced, and not even slightly pay-to-win.  Though the economy is a bit difficult to wrap your brain around at first, but just take a look at a guide or two and it's easy as pie to get LOTS of money REALLY fast.\nGameplay is simple, yet satisfying in a way; though you will have to go on the occasional grind for mission completion.  Good leveling system and unique skills to unlock, it's really easy to figure out and play.  I'd definitely encourage anyone to play this game!\n\nEdit:  It has come to my attention that I am not nearly as experienced enough in this game as I thought I was.  The above description really only applies until some of the later levels (about lvl 60), and the economy begins to  crash on you:  weapons and equipment are over priced, not enough people are selling/buying resources to craft higher level equipment for cheaper, way too much grinding, and whatnot until you have to result to using real money to progress through the game.\n\nBasically, this game is only worth playing if you like grinding and probably giving up later in the game.

It has one of the most fully-developed physics engines of any MMO I've ever seen.  The four characters (I remember when it was only three, and it may be five soon) all played very differently and honestly, the only one I couldn't really get into playing was Lann (the dual swordsman).  Lastly, a very good story for an MMO.\n\nI feel that its only major flaw is that it's of the hub-and-mission style of MMOs - probably done so they can ensure the physics engine is handled correctly.  However, that flaw is tremendous in a scenario where the 'hub' is an actual area where the players gather, because the lag gets horrendous.\n\nUnfortunately this is one of those games that's marred by the company that holds it - Nexon.  Nexon has NO idea how to deal with any kind of customer support and is notorious for pay-to-win problems.  The latter doesn't actually rear its head NEARLY as much as it did in DFO, but there are still shades of it.\n\nOverall, my bad experiences with Nexon are the main thing preventing me from recommending this.","June 28, 2012","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is a lobby game that provides a market, PVE, and PVP, yet you can't join other people's PVE stages in-session like Warframe and you're not even allowed to do something productive as your PVE party forms like in Dungeon Fighter Online. In Vindictus, as you form your party, you are confined in an instanced area that provides nothing productive other than a punching dummy, a general vendor, and a mailbox. You end up getting people who don't want to form parties hence people who can't get parties.\n\nFor comparision, imagine being forced to do nothing in WoW as you queue up: you can't work on professions, browse the auction house, go do other quests, or even travel. How often would the WoW's community queue with such an absurd confinement?\n\nWarframe was pretty shallow when I played it and DFO Internaltional was shutdown, yet they at least didn't waste your time as you queued for parties.","March 28, 2014","false","20.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game takes aspects from two of my favorite genres. It has skills and classes from a typical MMORPG, but then in the combat it takes on aspects of a live-action MOBA (non-rts) style. I would highly recommend this to both casual and hardcore gamers due to its high  potential and tactics when fighting harder enemies. The beginning of the games is slow though, enemies are easy, no one has any troubles, and typically it feels like a grind-fest. However once you get further in the game and get a more in depth touch, you really get engaged in the fast paced, high action, and VERY difficult boss fights.","February 14, 2014","true","72.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palebomb/recommended/212160/","palebomb","Palebomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palebomb/","49 products in account","I find that what really matters about this game is the fact that you can just sit around at a campfire, relax, and just forget about all the harshness of the dreaded Nexon service, all the harshness of the high level "18K att" boats.  Sometimes people don't see the true value of this game, how it mimics real life and turns it into something that goes on everyone's screen.  There wouldn't be time for worrying if relaxing was the main point.  But no, everyone strives to become the best at everything in this game, it's a simple human quality.\n\nI'll go right into the main value of this game.  It is the idea of wanting to become stronger, and fighting enemies that are massive and may never be defeated.  It is the simple risk of always being on the brink of death, yet always coming back by the use of a phoenix feather, that drives us to keep on fighting.  We upgrade our equipment and wail in the painful days of grinding dungeons for that one enchant scroll.  And when we have maxed out our character, it seems as if there is no purpose after that, seeing as the low levels hold a bias against the high levels and vice versa.  We want to help others, but it seems as if the low levels deny us that permission.  We always constantly want everything, to max out to +15, all of that stuff.\n\nAll in all, hack and slashing is extremely entertaining to partake in, but in the end it's just going to lead up to the feared question of "what should I do next?".\n\n\nThe main plotline of this game is to fight for the hope of achieveing "Utopia" for ridding the fomors of the human land.  Since the goddess has forsaken all humans, and they are left to fight, this makes it seem as if all hope is lost.  This game teaches a great lesson such that Utopia will never be achieved from playing this game.  It is for the purpose of escaping from reality, but this game will always make you feel empty once you reach level 60+.  The game becomes hell in a way, as all there is to do is raid and / or help others that are lower level.  The main point of the game becomes a game of chance and the need for gold.  But the lesson of this game, in my own words, is to teach the player that sometimes sitting at a simple campfire and having friends to converse with is the best Utopia even when in a time of needing the best equipment and armor.","July 2, 2014","true","467.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game takes aspects from two of my favorite genres. It has skills and classes from a typical MMORPG, but then in the combat it takes on aspects of a live-action MOBA (non-rts) style. I would highly recommend this to both casual and hardcore gamers due to its high  potential and tactics when fighting harder enemies. The beginning of the games is slow though, enemies are easy, no one has any troubles, and typically it feels like a grind-fest. However once you get further in the game and get a more in depth touch, you really get engaged in the fast paced, high action, and VERY difficult boss fights.","February 14, 2014","true","72.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has been steadily losing population for the last year and Nexon doesn't feel like fixing the game since that doesn't bring in money. They are more focused on releasing Inner Armor for the females so people can clothe their waifus in bikinis. There is nothing in the game for low levels and grouping with your peers at low levels is basically non existant. What end game they have is a grind fest, and by that I mean it takes weeks to get a certain piece you need to improve your gear, and there is a good chance you will lose that piece of gear in the process.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palebomb/recommended/212160/","palebomb","Palebomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palebomb/","49 products in account","I find that what really matters about this game is the fact that you can just sit around at a campfire, relax, and just forget about all the harshness of the dreaded Nexon service, all the harshness of the high level "18K att" boats.  Sometimes people don't see the true value of this game, how it mimics real life and turns it into something that goes on everyone's screen.  There wouldn't be time for worrying if relaxing was the main point.  But no, everyone strives to become the best at everything in this game, it's a simple human quality.\n\nI'll go right into the main value of this game.  It is the idea of wanting to become stronger, and fighting enemies that are massive and may never be defeated.  It is the simple risk of always being on the brink of death, yet always coming back by the use of a phoenix feather, that drives us to keep on fighting.  We upgrade our equipment and wail in the painful days of grinding dungeons for that one enchant scroll.  And when we have maxed out our character, it seems as if there is no purpose after that, seeing as the low levels hold a bias against the high levels and vice versa.  We want to help others, but it seems as if the low levels deny us that permission.  We always constantly want everything, to max out to +15, all of that stuff.\n\nAll in all, hack and slashing is extremely entertaining to partake in, but in the end it's just going to lead up to the feared question of "what should I do next?".\n\n\nThe main plotline of this game is to fight for the hope of achieveing "Utopia" for ridding the fomors of the human land.  Since the goddess has forsaken all humans, and they are left to fight, this makes it seem as if all hope is lost.  This game teaches a great lesson such that Utopia will never be achieved from playing this game.  It is for the purpose of escaping from reality, but this game will always make you feel empty once you reach level 60+.  The game becomes hell in a way, as all there is to do is raid and / or help others that are lower level.  The main point of the game becomes a game of chance and the need for gold.  But the lesson of this game, in my own words, is to teach the player that sometimes sitting at a simple campfire and having friends to converse with is the best Utopia even when in a time of needing the best equipment and armor.","July 2, 2014","true","467.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most MMOs I find boring due to the similarities in auto attacking and endless quests that seem to relate little to the storyline. Vindictus is allows the player to appreciate farming and lvling since the characters are controlled by you and the combat is free movement meaning there is no auto aiming. You have to have the skill and practice to fight well. Character customization is fairly good with a good variety of cash items in the game. It is a free game with the options of a cash shop.

Just click until it's over. The wellness of your soul is a stake.\n\nIf you came for the gameplay, it's pretty decent. Some of the characters are unique enough to be interesting, but the levels are repetitive and clearing the way to a boss is boringly easy. On top of that, the late game feels sloppy and unbalanced. The easiest way around that is to hand Nexon tons of money. They love money.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for me is that the nighmarishly slow server lag over the past few months (Yes.

The combat is a hack n slash style which is easy in the begining and requires you to use more skill as the game advances.

You have to have the skill and practice to fight well. Character customization is fairly good with a good variety of cash items in the game. It is a free game with the options of a cash shop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/menacingsmiles/recommended/212160/","menacingsmiles","Anticlimactic Harmony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/menacingsmiles/","138 products in account","I've been playing this game for like four years now, and it's still one of my favorite Free-to-Play games on Steam. It's one of the few games out that lets you play through the entire game without paying a cent. It's becoming kind of a shame more people aren't playing it, because it could use the love.\n\nThis game plays pretty much like a "hack and slash" game. The combat is probably the greatest thing about this game, it smooth and it just works. I'm surprised there isn't a whole lot of other MMOs that use combat like this. There is ten characters right now, nexon releases a new one every year, all of them have there own little play styles that's fun in one aspect or another.\n\nThe game essentially plays like this: You run missions through a linear dungeon, fight enemys, and there's a boss at the end. A lot of the emphasize in this game is the Bosses. I like to compare some aspects of the boss fights to the "Monster Hunter" games since there is a lot of dodging and attacking if you don't know how the boss is going to move. At first though your probably just going to beat the heck out of the early bosses and leave. The game doesn't really ramp-up difficulty that much til around level 50 or 60ish, which really doesn't take that long to get a character to level 60 if your enjoying the game.\n\nThe people who still play the game mostly seem to focus on higher level raids, which you can still find a party decently if you need one. We could really use more players though, but I suppose since this game is five years old you can only expect it to die off a little. Most of the major problems with the game is from the occasional bug nexon doesn't seems to know how to fix, or the lack of players when you want to specfic raid.\n\nHere's the fast version:\n\nPROs:\n+Great hack and slash combat\n+Unique characters that all have different interesting play styles\n+You can play all the content of the game without paying a cent\n+Pretty fun bosses\n+Lots of good replayable raids\n+Has a pretty good story if you bother to read the dialogue.\n+Level progression is pretty fast until around level 70ish\n+Pretty decent looking armor and weapons\n+Great character customization if you bother to put the time or money into it.\n\nCONs:\n-Somewhat of a lack of people for raids at times\n-The occasional bug shows up every once in a while (since Nexon doesn't seems to be able fix stuff very often).\n-After you finish all the missions there really isn't a whole lot to do except repay raids, and other missions.\n-Can be repeatitive at times if you don't like re-runing missions\n-A lot of the people who do the main high level raids sometimes have ridiculous attack requirements, which can be a bummer for people who don't want to put a lot of time at the end-game phase.\n-If you want anything customizable outside of what they give you, your probably going to have to pay for it.\n-Nexon "seems" to care about the community, but doesn't really seem to do a whole lot. They at least keep the game working alright.\n-Some of the weapon/armor enhancing, and enchantment scolls can become kind of stupid at higher ranks cus you can break your gear, which at high levels can cost you a lot of gold if your not prepared.","December 29, 2015","true","035.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ex_coil/recommended/212160/","ex_coil","Excoil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ex_coil/","66 products in account","I really want to give this game a negative review but I can undoubtedly say it has the best combat system out of any MMO available in The West right now. All your combos feel fluid and each button press flows into the next almost seamlessly while maintaining an actual sense of "fast-pace action" requiring the player to remain alert during the fight.  Other games advertise "fast-pace" only to deliver a snail-like, choppy, and overall disappointing experience.  This is the only aspect of the game that keeps me coming back to it, wanting to play more.\n\nThere's not much to say about the story. It's subpar and often confusing. The town hubs are annoying as some quests  will send you back and forth from different buildings for pieces of dialog you may or may not care about. Let's be honest, if you're playing Vindictus, you probably just want to get back to the action as soon as possible after completing a mission.\n\nThat being said, here are my biggest problems with this game:\n\n-The community is atrocious.\nUnless you have a regular group of friends  or a guild you can play with, you're going to be joining or hosting random groups from time to time. Early on, this is no problem, but the end-game players are some of the worst elitists I have ever seen. It's difficult to play, advance, and enjoy the biggest feature of this game (that being the combat) when an overwhelming majority of these end-game players expect you to meet some arbitrary stat requirement they themselves set, otherwise immediately kicking you from their party without a single word.  Visting the Vindictus official forum, sometimes you may find a post or two about this very issue with the solutions given varying from "Git Gud" to "Host the party yourself" and "Just join a guild." I have more to add to this in my next issue with this game.\n\n-This game IS PayToWin\nIt is unbelievable how many people will defend this game by saying it isn't PayToWin or just Pay -for-convenience or some other variation  of that nonsense. There are cosmetic items to buy, which is completely acceptable,  random item boxes that may rarely give out end-game gear, which is pushing the limit already, and a couple other items that aren't a big deal. The biggest offenders  are protective runes so that players may upgrade their weapons and armor without fear of permanently losing them. You'd think, "That's no big deal, I don't mind being a little weaker than the paying players to save me from pulling out my credit card." However, remember when I said I had a little more to add on my previous gripe? The only way for you to meet those arbitrary stat requirements set by the "Elite" is to have a decent set of gear by upgrading it, usually way past the point where there is a risk of your gear being deleted due to bad  luck.  How can you say this game isn't PayToWin when whether or not you can even play the game with other people depends on a random chance of your weapon  getting to that fancy "+10" tier where it MIGHT be enough to satisfy someone enough to let you remain in their party.  If you constantly shell out US$ 10 every time you fail the upgrade process, you can safely and immediately get your desired weapon, Howver, if you opt out of paying for it and your luck turns sour, you lose what might be your only weapon and now have to start the process of getting a weapon again. It's not a convenience to immediately get boosted to where you need to be to play the game with others instead of spending possibly weeks or month just to get there. It is literally paying to win... look at that. Sometimes you might find yourself grinding raids that have nothing to do with the materials you need for the weapon you want in an effort to make enough money to buy those materials because the raid that gives the materials you need for that weapon you can't even get into a party for because you don't have X amount of attack or Y amount of Critical Hit Rate. Then can you actually have a chance to join that raid and enjoy the fresh new combat mechanics that boss might offer until having to repeat the process. I see winning in Vindictus as being able to enjoy the beautiful combat system mentioned before. Whether or not you pay to get your amazing gear and still end up not being a great player is a differrent story. Others will argue that "The gear doesn't make the player since the game is skill-based." At least those players are actually getting to play the game in the long run.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I'll spend a little on this game every now and then and in no way mean to bash players to spend heavily on it. In fact, I encourage them. It's a great game once you get to the actual gameplay. Do what you need to  to enjoy it, but don't try to defend this game as not a PayToWin title.","November 13, 2015","true","153.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

We are towards the end game now, and holy crap FORGET exquisite iron ore. Most armor sets or weapons require an extraordinary amount of how high level ore. Iron comes from speckled turds in the instanced dungeons. One or two spawn. In season 2, u have a chance at getting lowest tier, second tier, third, or low chance at exquisite ores. Usually second tier drops. It requires 4 third tiers to craft exquisite.\nThese sets require a total of 150 damn exquisite ores, among 20 count drops from raid bosses that are only dailies. Then their is the horrible enhance and enchant system. It's recommended to get a weapon to plus 8 to be any kind of viable. From +5-+8, the percent of success goes to 50%, to 40%. Failure resets rank to 0 and lowers durability, and takes the stones (more grind) you used. Buuut if u buy nexon cash, you can get runes that prevent those effects upon failure. No way to get nexon in game like Warframe btw. No discounts either. Enchants of a good rank only have 50% to 40% of success, but u can increase that by buying ♥♥♥♥. Failure lowers durability and can break weapon for the good enchants. But guess what, u can buy a rune (nexon obviously) that saves your ♥♥♥. Vindictus' gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, but the system built around it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and promotes pay2win.\nAt least you can get the parts for a frame in a day, at least formas and potatoes have NO failure chance, and at least you can get plat and resources BY PLAYING THE DAMN GAME.","March 26","false","157.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

The game is epic. In Korea.\n\nThe issue comes in more of the MMO aspects of Vindictus. Notice the DLC for 40 dollars that actually gives you nothing...seriously don't buy it...\n\nAlso there are 9 characters, 7 released, and you have 5 character slots for free. It takes a week to delete one of your old characters but don't worry you can buy more character slots for 10 dollars...\n\nIt's also pretty sad when one of the worst things Nexon did was banning all the botters. If you play the game for a long time you'll notice the price for your gear getting exponentially higher. I've seen the crazy fluctuations in the player economy since 2010.\n\nI've also seen Nexon slowly drop fun events in favor of sales...10% OFF ON REVIVES!!!\n\nThe game can only be enjoyed in two ways. Playing for a few hours or playing for a few hundred hours. There's barely a middle zone for it and that's why there is an overwhelming amount of positive reviews. The first few hours of the game will be some of the best hours you will get out of any video game.\n\nAnother thing that comes up is the elitist community. Yes it is pretty elitist and I'm actually part of it. The game is pretty difficult and challenging so it makes sense the community isn't very noob friendly. Try not to take this the wrong the issue is that new players can't establish end game gear because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drop rates, infuriating upgrades and difficult gameplay but don't worry just donate to Nexon and you'll be fine. Also don't say skill>gear because Vindictus is actually skill<=gear which is unfortunate because a game like this really shouldn't be like that.\n\nI have established above average end game gear and I am part of the very elitist community. I have to say the end game is actually amazingly fun and once you get to know the community it's great. That said I really can't recommend Vindictus solely because of Nexon. Vindictus is the perfect example of why Nexon is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThat really was as quick of a summary as I could give on Vindictus.\n\nThanks for reading and don't play Vindictus.","November 26, 2014","false","329.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My initial thoughts of this game were pretty negative.  There are some things that I do not like about the game, but the positives far outway the negatives.  I'll start with the negatives. I'm not a fan of the way the story progression is set up. It's like a flashback to an old school RPG before character animations and voice acting was implemented.  I don't like having to read the dialogue from a tiny box next to a portrait of an anime character.  It can be pretty boring... which is why I have almost no idea what the storyline is about. It just doesn't keep my attention, so I end up skipping a lot of the dialogue.  Also, the character customization is extremely basic.  I expected quite a bit more, but was disappointed. It is possible to get better hair cuts, costumes, dyes, and armor, but it will cost you quite a bit of real life money. Needless to say, I'm not interested in paying money for in game underwear.  Lastly, I don't much care for the way the quests are set up.  It's not open world, which is kind of lame, so questing is different in this game. Each battle (this is what the quests/missions are called in game) is like a mini-dungeon that is replayable. It's replayable because each battle has a list of achievement-like side quests.  These reward you with gold and experience when you complete them.  So this is a completionists worst nightmare, or wet dream... I could see an argument for both.  None of the battles are too tough, even on hard mode, to finish alone, but the raids require a little more muscle.  So the positives.  The game looks decent enough. The graphics aren't spectacular, but they did a good job on the characters' looks. Especially the female characters. They look pretty damn great. The female characters' costumes would fit perfectly into every nerdy teenage boy's hentai fantasy.  The combat is pretty cool.  It took a little getting used to initially, but once I got it down, I liked it. It's a little big buggy at times when it comes to the dodging and parrying against enemies, but still a lot of fun. It sort of reminds me of Dynasty Warriors back in the day.  You know, before they made 57 remakes.  Overall, it is a pretty fun game. Definitely worth trying if you're even a little bit interested. Plus, its free. How the hell can you pass up trying a free game?  GET THIS GAME.","February 20, 2015","true","26.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Second, the game is Free-to-play!!!\n\nThe graphics are wonderful, (even though it's been quite a while since its first release). Gameplay is detailed, deep, sophisticated yet simple enough for any newcomer to easily learn and adjust. The story is pretty interesting, nothing too breath-taking, but a good story nonetheless (Still in progress on my end).\n\n6 different characters to choose from, all gender locked, but each being very unique and specialized for certain gamestyles. Each character has 2 unique classes that doesn't require the player to be limited to choosing one of the two. The player can level up both of the character classes with no penalties whatsoever(aside from spending the gold they earn from quests).\n\nThe characters can be easily customized without overdoing the options of what can be done(face/nose/cheeks/chin/etc), but the downside is that the variety of the customizations are limited unless a purchase(with real money) was made to be given access to the extra variety. This doesn't mean the player must do make a purchase, it's simply a choice of how far will the player go to give their character "the look" that they are going for. Only the customization variety is limited including equipment color changes, no equipment is limited exclusively to pay-to-get. Any item someone has, you can obtain through luck, determination, and having the materials needed to craft the item in game.\n\nOverall, great game, and even what's even better is that it's FREE! Wonderful game to experience, it isn't bug free, no game is. The boss fights are intense and sometimes call for having a group to help deal with it. Game difficulty can also be adjusted before each quest(at the docks/questboard). Chances are you won't regret trying this game out.","February 24, 2014","true","118.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scoriumtheva/recommended/212160/","scoriumtheva","Sc0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scoriumtheva/","161 products in account","I defintely recommend this game if you like infinite dungeon crawling, epic action-y fighting, and fine tuned character skill development!\n\nVindictus caught my attention because of it's physics system, as you can pick up objects in your environment and throw them at enemies, or pick up enemies themselves in some cases and throw -them-! Almost everything and anything can be picked up and used as a weapon (no exaggeration there), and in the hands of a capible warrior, even a BROOM becomes the doom of some poor monster! You won't be disappointed in the dungeons themselves, as traversing destructible environments, traps, and finding secret treasures will keep you excited (until you realize that the dungeon batches are pretty much copy-paste) and the enemies know and use this environment to their advantage (archers will shoot the supports to bridges to make you fall, enemies will attack destructible pillars to make them fall on you, etc). The game is made with the Source Engine, so it really hits home how diverse this software can be when used in game development (it surprized me that a company could use the SE like this)!\n\nEach dungeon has a "batch" of levels that look the same pretty much every time, and the enemies in these batches are pretty much copy-paste but with different colors and sizes. That's kind of the story with most MMORPGS, but in most cases you won't notice as you're mowing down a crowd of them with your sword, spells, arrows, or large blugeoning instrument of your choice. The monsters are pretty much straight forward in most cases, but the bosses are a big highlight of this game. Most of the time they're massive, deadly, and faster than you are. If you don't keep on your toes, dodge, and attack at the right moments, then you're toast. It's intense and epic when going against those bosses!\n\nUnlike other Free-To-Play games, Vindictus has a VERY in-depth character skill system, where AP (Action Points) are used to level certain skills and in-game gold is used to buy new skills (no real money required at all). While choosing a class confines you to what kind of skills you can unlock, that's where the confinement ends. From there, you can level skills at your choosing, and really define your character. You'll just have to see for yourself just how many passive and active skills you can level up, because I can't list them all!\n\nTo go against these tough enemies, you gotta have the right gear. Vidictus has a fully-fledged Market and Crafting system for just that. Crafting is pretty straight-forward (ingredients + other stuff= Product), but the Marketplace is really polished to serve the players the best it can. I can't quite remember how it's done, but the Market will make sure that no one can buy-up all of a certain item and resell it at an outragious price, so it makes sure that everything is balanced and fair (just like in a real economy). Making gold in dungeons is really well-balanced, and if you look under every pot and destroy everything in sight, gold will start falling out of the cracks! If you're really economically-minded, then making your first million in this game should be a breeze. Of course, there are options to buy weapons, gold, and other bonuses within the game with REAL money, but it's all completely optional. What's better, is that some of these items are given away to the player periodically by the game itself (holidays, special event prizes, etc) but will usually expire quickly. The fact that you can have access to these items occasionally, however, is pretty generous (if not a marketing ploy to get us to buy something). However, again, it's completely optional. I've played this game for a long while, had tons of fun, and not spent a dime!\n\nIt's a Koren-made game, so there are some cultural references that you might not get if you're from another country, but the story and life of this game world will keep you chuckling, while at the same time drawing you deeper into mythos. You won't be disappointed if you're a gamer who values a great storyline as well as great gameplay mechanics!\n\n\nBIG recommendation from me! This game rocks!","December 31, 2013","true","76.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudes2011/recommended/212160/","dudes2011","OMIGAT~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudes2011/","127 products in account","I’ve been experimenting with the MMO genre lately. Most games I tried would procure a couple hours of fun after which I would quit. The reason for this: I felt like I was wasting my time. Contrarily to popular belief, Video games don’t usually give me that feeling. I needed something better than your typical MMORPG with a failed plot and little replay value. I needed a game that felt... I don’t know, like more than just a game. I found it. If the title didn’t give it away, I’m talking about Vindictus.\n\nVindictus is an MMO that combines your typical RPG experience with a hack n slash feel, impressive visuals, lush and varied environments, a good story and an insane replay value only to name a few aspects. The community is amazing and the huge 18 player team battles with make this game seem unreal. In short, Vindictus is exactly what I was looking for. Vindictus is more than just a game.\n\nVindictus runs on Valve’s source engine. Nexon (the studio behind the game) probably picked this engine to allow extreme interaction between the player and the world. Past games like Half-Life 2 and Portal can testify to the awesomeness of this engine. Needless to say Nexon made a great choice. Contrarily to most online multiplayer games, the world behind Vindictus actually feels alive. Picking up, throwing and smashing objects around feels perfect. When I throw a wooden barrel into the ocean, the barrel sinks then resurfaces and floats. IT DOESN’T DISAPPEAR. The physics engine is out of this world.\n\nThe story is interesting enough. There are a couple cut scenes coupled with dialogue that may or may not entice you to read more of it. I have to say that the dialogue is actually pretty good and I often find myself wondering what’s going to happen. This is one of the rare aspects that Vindictus does not excel in. Moving on to the online part of the game, it‘s crazy how fun this game is to play with friends. Before starting it, I suggest you find 2 or 3 friends and start it all together, because all 3 of you will have a blast. Everything in this game can be done in teams, and as I said earlier the big team battles against seemingly invincible bosses are something you will be talking about in the morning.\n\nEarlier I mentioned the environments. They’re epic. I mean really epic. You go from fighting vampires in a pillaged town to fighting mummies on desert dunes only to end up with reapers in a dark crypt. Jungles, deserted plains, tropical islands, ancient ruins; this game has it all. The monsters themselves have amazing sprites that could easily be compared to a triple A game such as Skyrim. Each mission ends with a boss fight, usually a great boss fight. Beating bosses is easy once you understand their attack pattern, at least early on. All you Sword Art Online fans will feel right at home, but let’s not get into that.\n\nNow I think it’s time we talk about the combat. There are about 8 different characters in Vindictus, each one having a unique and interesting combat style. Whether you want to shoot from a distance, cast fireballs, or leap into the fray with a giant pillar, there’s a combat style for you. My first character was Vella. A girl that dual wields either swords or chain blades. The former allows you to slice n dice from close range while the latter allows you to rip through enemies from far away. Every character has 2 weapons like this. Considering this, we can safely confirm that you can fight through this game in 16 different ways. I used twin blades with Vella. Once you’ve chosen a weapon. You can unlock abilities both passive and active as you progress through the game. For instance, when you start playing, the shift button activates a dash. Level up enough and you can unlock the Slipaway ability, letting you jump back while cutting anyone around you for some very handsome damage. Double tapping shift will activate this and pressing it a third time will throw in a dash to the combo. Very useful for escapes, making Vella an agile fighter if need be (extremely useful against bosses). Other abilities, such as Cross Cut will let you run right through an enemy attack if timed perfectly.\n\nCharacter customization is always important in an RPG. Vindictus once again makes me drool with insane skins and armour, making this dark themed, possibly depressing concept into something quite enjoyable to look at. This being said, many decorative aspects of the game require that you pay, but its player versus monster nature makes these things not an issue.\n\nThere is PVP, although you will have to play for a while before experiencing it. All I can say for now is that I have noticed a rock paper scissor effect between certain characters. If you’re looking for a PVP heavy game, Vindictus is not what you’re looking for.\n\nContinuing on a sour note, you need a computer with dedicated graphics and a broadband internet connection to pull this game off. Or else the lag will probably kill it for you. Reflecting on this, anyone who doesn’t have dedicated graphics should probably not be on Steam, although you can play Vindictus without a Steam account.\nI haven’t covered everything, because that would take forever, but I feel as I’ve given you enough that you can decide whether or not to give this game a shot. Good luck!\n","February 22, 2014","true","175.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So you have the privilege to be humored by another one of my famous game recommendations. Awwwww Vindictus this game starts off with a very Games of Thrones feeling in the sense, that  it is not frowned upon to have an intimate relationship with a giant spider or other monsterous creatures, or as in Game of Thrones with your own family members. Once out of the tutorial you find yourself in a small sea port village which will now forever be your home. This town is similar to Animal Farm in the sense that animals for the most part run the economy of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HerpDerpMaximus/recommended/212160/","HerpDerpMaximus","Derp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HerpDerpMaximus/","44 products in account","Vindictus is a game sort of like Warframe if you've played the game, you would already know the feel of a third person action RPG. While Warframe is set in the future, Vindictus is set in medieval times. It has a varierty of characters for different people with different tastes, there's a tank named Karok who can protect his team and also has a decent amount of burst damage, a mage named Evie who can both do insane damage with a scythe & offensive magic while also helping the team with buffs and revives, then for those who prefer a mix of both defensive and offensive there's Fiona, a wielder of sword and shield who can block the enemy's attacks and send forth her own counter attacks to deal out decent burst damage, then comes Kai, an archer who prefers kiting the enemy rather than going ham who wields both rapidfire Crossbow like gun, and a slower but more hard hitting bow which can be transformed in the middle of combat from a longbow to a shortbow whether you need better fire rate or more range and can find the enemy's weakpoint and use it to temporarily stun them and deal bonus damage. Then there is Lann and Vella, while both wield dual swords, Lann can wield dual spears, while Vella can wield dual Chainblades (the damn thing has HUGE range) and both can offer different skills while still offer speedy gameplay. Finally there is Hurk, the beserker, he focuses on constant AOE while also using skills to attack endlessly, ignore CC, restore health, and if you have good timing, you can even deflect the boss's attacks and counter attack to CC the boss and deal huge damage. Now some of you may be thinking of the community, but don't fret the community is both funny and helpful by helping new players finish missions which would normally be too difficult to overcome. While others may be too lazy to bother leveling up at such a slow pace, do not even worry about it. You'll get into mid game faster than you will think. The only problem I've had with this game is the constant upgrading of gear and finding the right build paths to maximize overall effctiveness throughout the game as well as the rather ludicrous pricing on premium items as well as the 2x exp VIP bonuses. Overall, I've had a lot of fun in this game and I recommend this for anyone who likes RPG's and can deal with a slow start for a faster paced and challenging mid-late game where personal player skills will be tested.","June 20, 2014","true","82.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You choose a character from 5 or 6 different "classes" and immediately venture into the prologue. After the prologue is complete, you can then customise your character. Yes, some of the aesthetic customisations cost real money, but so far I am yet to say this game is "pay to win". The story is interesting (if you actually bother to read the dialog) and you can craft items and sell them on an auction house. I really enjoy the combat in this game. The layout of each class has a primary weapon/s and then a secondary throwing weapon. There are lots of different items in "battles" that you can pick up and throw at enemies as well. There are Australian servers too, which is also a big plus. It is quite an easy game to pick up if you are an MMO fan. Best of all, it is free to play and well worth the download.","March 16, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oakslee/recommended/212160/","oakslee","Oak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oakslee/","85 products in account","Even though hosted by Nexon, this game is still a must play. The gameplay is almost like no other I have seen in an RPG, and I'm not sure I can really think of a way to explain it very well. It's a real-time RPG with motion controls based on timing, some skill, and extremely enjoyable. The combat ALONE could be a reason to play this game. Not only that, but if you want, there is a port for xbox controllers/etc, so you can play with what you want if mouse and keyboard isn't your preference. It's one of my favorite games. It's pretty easy to get into and get lost in for hours on end.\n\n(I also want to say that I only have low hours on steam, because I played this game from the original launcher before it was on steam.\n\n-NOTE-\nAs I stated (and as you will see in other reviews), it is a game coming from Nexon. There are bound to be issues found with just that, and there are many bugs, and hackers running amuck. Even though there are hackers, the chance of you being in a  mission with one or even to some extent being hacked yourself, is very low. I don't consider this game pay to win at all, and most of the money you would put into the game would go towards vanity. Of course there are boosters, but as goes with all free to play games, there is almost a guarantee to find some.\n\nTry it out, the only reason I see anyone not atleast enjoying this game some, is if it's not your game style. Even "casual" gamers can like this, there are different difficulties on every mission, and bonus stats as needed for difficulty variations.\nHave fun!","July 6, 2014","true","29.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Potato4232/recommended/212160/","Potato4232","Potato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Potato4232/","106 products in account","This game.  It has been out since 2010, I was a closed beta "early bird" access member.  I remember browsing mmo sites to the end looking for something that was click to attack and wasn't purely pvp like "rakion" when I had the chance to play it.\n\nThe story in this game is fairly decent.  Everything comes together no matter how messed up the timeline may be.\nThe game is heading in a good direction by trying to attract more players.  I look forward to what is to come.  They finally got their ♥♥♥ in gear and I'm right behind them with a game I can't seem to put down.  I've quit many times over these last four years myself.  I've been through all the phases of the game and if I haven't it means something new is out.  I have tried recruiting all of my friends in real life to come join me because the end game is much friendlier with friends.\n\nThe combat system is based around normal attacks and smashes.  Each character as their own unique specials and everyone will eventually have two full weapon styles to play around with.  They are gender locked though.  Each character has their own backstory but everyone goes through the same thing.  Gear progression might not be so forgiving as you will either have to farm for it, or pay for it with in-game money.\n\nIf you have spare time. Vindictus is something you should consider yourself playing.  I want to see this game become something it should have already been.","July 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Elegant. Over-Powered. Those are the three words I would choose to describe this amazing game. There is nothing more satisfying than grabbing some random object lying around and proceeding to throw down on a room full of baddies with nothing more than a piece of pottery and your winning smile. When you're finished decimating the basic mobs with stone-ware, you can grab your primary weapon and wipe out a wave of middle-management in a flash.\n\nVindictus is co-developed and published by Valve, Nexon, and Neko. I consider it T for Teen or PEGI 16.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe action is the main thing that makes this game fun and complex. The attacks look as though there is force put in to it, and it shows when they hit an enemy, with a satisfying crunch, thud, or smack.\n\nOther parts that make it good, is the stable player turnover rate, community, look, and hardware inclusivity:\n\nThe game has different towns/cities that cater to the different level tiers. This keeps newcomers (and the server) from drowning in a sea of Lv. 50-100 players that have been there since opening day. The game has been slowing down in growth since opening, but such is the life of MMOs. It still has new players joining in, so please don't be too discouraged by the amount of old vs. new players.\n\nEvery player I've met through the game is either behaves professionally (which can get annoying for all involved if you just want to kick a Fomor around and they're already at the end of the stage) or they are there to have fun and sometimes you will wind up in a Gnoll-kicking fest that finishes with a new addition to your friend list.\n\nIf you didn't look at the trailers, or you just glanced over them, look again. That is how this free game looks. I am not kidding. It looks like that. All the enviroments, be it ruins like the pyramids in "The Mummy" or jungles like Skull Island from the newer King Kong film, it's there and it's pretty and scary as all get out.\n\nBy hardware inclusivity, I mean that the settings on this game allow for a fairly wide demographic of players to run the game well. I have played this game on a laptop. It ran on low and fast settings, but it ran without lag. I have seen it on high, where it doesn't play on my laptop. but it looks great. It still looks good, but it's like PS2 high end graphics vs. PS3 high end graphics. There is a difference.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAlright, I've covered the good points, the charming smile of the game. Now it's time to inspect the sweaty, shirt-staining armpit.\n\nThere are four major bad points to this game: The waiting/dedication, the crashes, the customer support, and the character creation.\n\nWaiting kills a fast-paced action game like swimming backwards kills a shark. It's confusing and no one knows quite what happened, but the shark is sure as heck dead. Action games, especially well-made ones, are filled with inertia. Having a long wait time to enter the game, I can be okay with that. I don't particularly like staring at a screen and having to focus on what I'm not doing or what I could be doing, but I'm okay with it at the start-up. Having a long wait time inbetween NPC interactions, or travelling between two connected zones? That's a problem. And this waiting creates another issue, dedication requirement. You need to set aside time for this game, nothing less than an hour to feel any kind of worth for the long loading times. And that's a sensation that drives me away.\n\nThe crashes come out of nowhere and are as violent as they are fast. I've had the game crash in the middle of town, after pressing "start game", while in a boss fight, while in an empty dungeon, while entering the game proper, etc. All that time waiting and loading and BAM. You're out faster than you can say Vindictus. I am not sure if this is a common occurence to players everywhere, but it has consistently happened to me regardless of internet strength.\n\nThe customer service is terrible. If you report these crashes, you don't get a response and sometimes the support site itself is down, giving you only an email address to throw your plaintive cries towards. Any response to customer dissatisfaction is to throw in-game baubles, sweet loot, or exp boosters. It might have a bit more sentiment attached if Nexon didn't shell out these packages like a drunk guy shelling out dollar bills at an exotic dance club, giving you all these things if you were kicked off the game for no reason, or you haven't been back in a while, like most people who get frustrated with a frequently crashing game. It feels at best like a bad Oprah therapy session, where you're still depressed, but now you have a brand new Toyota. At its worst, it feels like hush money or a desperate plea to give the game just one more chance.\n\nThe character creation looks really expansive until you realize that most of the options are hidden behind the glass wall of pay-to-win. All the buyables in the game are limited to cosmetics and boosters, but the game dangles them in front of you straight from the get-go. And, as in all of Nexon's games, the class choices are fairly varied, but you can't change gender in any of them. Luckily, there have been baby steps towards fixing this, namely by making two seperate classes that are basically the same (Lan and Vella as examples).\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn summary, though it has some fairly major bad points, the game is still free, and if you can get it to work, it's insanely fun.\n\nFor a similar, but not as flawed experience, check out Dragon Nest, which I consider the E10+ (or PEGI 12) version of Vindictus.","January 13, 2014","true","75.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't like the whole go into the market but the market is just a picture with more pictures.  If it were an open world game that would be great. but it feels small. the character creation is very lack luster. I love the combat, but it gets dull. Graphics are pretty good but i think that's the highest compliment i can give in this review. the armours are confusing, like usually you get more armour as you level up and it makes you feel awesome, with this you can get armour off the bat in the trading post. There's no level system i think so it gets more weird. crafting is weird too, you get different coloured armor each time? wtf? anyway, I don't get the gaining of weapons either. usually like i said, you have a few weapons you can't use because you don't have the level for it, but i think most of the weapons you just have to buy them. I'm also the kind of guy who thinks games that are too japanese-y or anime'ish sucks and is quite annoying. I really hate the stupid cheesy child like actions and it just really bothers me. I want a mature game that has nice armour, nice weapons, good graphics good gameplay, open world, no pictures when i go into a damn market, the npcs are not pictures either. so far my only hope is black desert but that's korean so of course every character is gonna look like every single asian person out there that has been plastically altered. and the hair is really weird too i have never seen so much glowing things before. and most of the character animations looks like it came straight out of power rangers. game is not optimized either, i have a pretty beefy pc and the game just kind of sucks with using what is given it. OH also, the freaking hair styles and ♥♥♥♥ you have to buy? wtf? i don't want my character to look like a ♥♥♥♥ing girly dude, so i have to buy hair styles. okay, sometimes that's fine, but what am i supposed to do with a character that looks like 12 years old but has the hair style of someone more mature? seriously, and the kai character is freaking cool because i love archery and archers are my favourite, it's by far my favourite class but why do i have to look like a mix of aragorn and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag.\n\nending comment:\ngood combat, okay graphics\nbut confusing game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character models and really stupid animations and over all just confusing and annoying game. not open world so it feels super small like c9 but c9's combat is far more enjoyable than vindictus. I wouldn't play this game unless i had seriously no other game to play than this. i mean like, i could have the most boring game out there and i would play that. or maybe not that far but. yeah. i really don't understand why asian people are so obbessed with teens and childish bull ♥♥♥♥. grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and make a mature game. and if it's not asian devs then seriously get your ♥♥♥♥ together.","April 13, 2014","false","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The first couple of levels are a cake walk. You start out with the basic skills and equipment and as you further move along the game, you gain more points for skills, random weapon/equipment drops fit for your current level, and in-game money for future spending. This stage of the game is easy and can be finished, solo with little effort. However, as the levels get harder and the bosses get bigger (polar bears to trolls to wolves to dragons to demons), more effort is needed to continue further. Solo is pretty much gone unless you're a high enough level and have high tier equipment. But at this stage, team work and the in-game market come into play. You will need other people to play with to complete the oncoming barrage of difficult levels and the Market in-game is needed to get more powerful and resilient equipment (in-game money used). So if communication and grinding aren't your thing, Vindictus' mid-late and late game will not be for you. However, with enough hard work and dedication, you can be a hulking image in Vindictus with no real life money spent whatsoever. Vindictus trully is a game for the dedicated and skilled.\n\n-Yumi","October 11, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spreadicus/recommended/212160/","spreadicus","Spreadicus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spreadicus/","86 products in account","I decided to try this game on a whim because of some of the reviews but upon further inspection i realize I may be late to this party. I rolled on the US East server, there were 3 choices, US East, US West, and Aus i think? Well here has been my experience playing to level 20.\n\nThe thing that got me playing at all was the character cuztomization, This is a decent system and i like the diferent looks and possibilities however. Each class is gender locked which to me seems sounter productive. So if I want to play as a sorceress i must choose "evie" who is female. I can then alter her look however i wish. My question is why gender lock the roles? Now this doens't bother me as i like sorcerers and female avatars but i know some people would be put off by this. Such as if you wish to play the ranger class you must pick a male avatar. etc etc.  Pro: You can alter your character to look pretty much any way you desire, Con: Gender locking classes\n\nRedundancy.\nIn order to do quests you have to get them from npcs of course then you must locate the battle board to select a dungeon you wish to do.  Then you either join a part who is waiting in the staging area. A rarity i am sure, or create your own party and invite whoever you like. Then you board the boat and see the same dramatic heroic scene reminiscent of soul calibur and off you go , each area has dungeons that look exactly the same. You may go through 10 dungeons that all are nearly identical but rearranged to fight red name bosses and win the day. then back to town. Rinse and repeat. This has become.. redundant.\n\nPopulation, Seems very low. The starting area "colhen" looks populated but that's as far as it goes. If you decide to venture out to the other few areas of the game where high level players should be doing their thing you'll find a ghost town. This is a shame because now i feel put off form bothering. It appears that everyone just hangs out on colhen. There isn;t a whol elot to ehis game.\n\n\nRaids. Seems easy to be called raids. I did a raid on the first available raid dungeon with two friends. They died relatively fast but i managed ot finish the boss by myself. Wasn't too difficult even on hard mode. Rewards weren't great either. I imagine these do get harder as you progress if you do that is.\n\nAll in all i am not ready to quit the game as of yet so I will keep leveling and seeing what else the game has to offer. mainly because i have nothing better to do these days. Going to recommend the game so more people play it because it seems the only major thing lacking is population. Seems to be a big trend with mmos these days. Shame really. Will update this again another time.","September 20, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For people like me, I had to revert my Windows back to 8.1 to play, and I know that this sounds insane just to play 1 game. The only reason I did this was I had very high hopes for this game. Was it worth it? Well you probably know the answer to that just by the rating of this review. This game has a lot to offer and I am barely so far scratching the surface for this game. This game feels like a game I would be willing to pay retail price for, but of course it is free. The number one question people always ask though is "Is it P2W?" My answer to this is no. The only thing I would recommend paying for is the .99 starter pack for it is one hell of a deal and makes low level leveling easier if you are by yourself. Other then that you can pay for cosmetics and let me just say the cosemetics range from really scimpy or cute to full blown f*cking awesome! So unless you want to pay for some of the costumes this game is fair and balanced in combat. Combat is awesome because I have never met a game where you can just grab a enemy and use the enviroment to kill him. These kills range from Sparta kicking some one of a cliff to body slamming them on a pile of rubble. Think of this game as a beat them up with very hard but rewarding boss fights. The only thing I could say that has been annoying so far is the random bots who stand in town and advertise their account stealing websites. Do not trust these sights because they just hijack your account. These bots are always being activley banned, but not quick enough. Other then that this game is a blast and there is NO reason you shouldn't give it a try! Also last thing is this game is optimized REALLY well.

I have played this game since it first came out, and when I heard it was on steam, I downloaded it here so I could keep track of how many hours I have sunk into this game. I caution anyone that downloads this game, prepare to invest an insane amount of time into it, because it will suck you in and never let go!\n\nAnyone who is tired of TAB Targeting MMO RPG's need look no further. Vindictus provides TRUE ACTION (not that TERA "true" action) But Legit, True - DODGE, BLOCK, I-Frames, Special moves, ACTION ORIENTED Combat. And the best thing that seperates this game from TERA, and those "would be" action MMO's? Vindictus does it with the most FLUID combat system on and online action RPG.\n\nVindictus doesnt stop there, it just begins with the amazing combat, it continues with insanely good graphics. The beasts, bosses, and HUGE Raid monsters are so amazingly detailed it a damn wonder how this game is free. This could easily be a triple AAA $60 US Dollar game, hands down.\n\nI will end off with the most amazing thing about Vindictus aside from everything above. Vindictus rewards TRUE SKILL, and not your deep wallet. Any boss, any dungen, any 6-8 man raid can be soloed if you know what your doing. Throw in a few equally skilled friends, and you have yourself a 200 hours co-op campaign and thats only brushing the surface!\n\nI cant recommend this game enough, and I cant believe other games have not mirrored this TRUE COMBAT system, because it is a clear success.\n\nStop Reading the Reviews.

Most of what I stated before is still somewhat the same, but....\n\nNexon has once again practically ruined a game. Though Vindictus itself is still a load of fun and very skill oriented, Nexon has made some incredibly confusing and worrisome decisions. For one, they totally removed Jumping from the game. Now, Jumping in itself wasn't very well implemented. But instead of fixing it, they opted to delete it completely...which means all of the Season 2 maps that incorporated jumping mechanics, as well as Season 2 enemies that forced you to use Jumping to either kill them or dodge their attacks, have been totally reworked and, quite frankly, boring-ified. Now every enemy, though with different tactics and timing, all are dumbed down and simplified from before. Definitely a bad, bad change in my opinion.\n\nAlso, as for this game not being Pay2Win... It's slowly but surely becoming exactly that. You can buy cash accesories that give notable bonuses to stats, pets that do the same, and if you want to succeed in very high level play, you're definitely going to need to use a huge amount of ingame currency to strengthen your weapons, and then buy Runes to + them past +6. Infact, you're going to want +10 or higher weapons to be helpful in a group.\n\nAnyway, that's my update. This game will forever hold a candle in my heart, but...*sigh* Nexon. Nexon strikes again. I still recommend it, but going higher than level 70 will be...very frustrating for most players.\n\nThere's a review by v0!dsnak3 that points out other problems perfectly, and ALL not due to the game itself, but because of Nexon being the way they are. Money grubbing event tactics, horrible events in general that focus more on cash players than free players...The list goes on. I suggest reading his/her review, as they nailed it on the head. (They gave Vin a thumbs down, which I have to say I agree with)\n\nI'll keep my original review here as well. -------------------------------------------\n\nBeen playing this game ever since it was released a good 2 or so years ago. It's ALOT of fun, but needs more exposure and advertising! Thankfully they finally brought it here to Steam for more people to enjoy.\n\nThis Free2Play is centered mostly around dungeons instances. It's one of the rare few F2P games that is NOT Pay2Win!! It's more Pay4Convienience and Pay4Customization. Most of the money you'll probably spend on this game is for "Inner Armors" or underwear that give no extra stats, but makes your character look good. There's also hairstyles, tattoos, makeup, facial hair, etc. Admittedly without paying, you will only be able to pick hairstyles, skin color (a large palette), hair color, eye color, and eyebrow color. Still, not bad for a FREE game when it comes to customization.\n\nThis game, like I said before, is NOT pay2win. It focuses on Skill2Win and Gear2Win. You actually need to learn how your enemies attack, and get a feel for your character. Seriously, try this game out!!","June 22, 2012","true","085.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But nexon. Released on January 21, 2010, Vindictus was a promising game. Featuring many elements that appealed to the players and possible customers, saddly leading to a over hyped creation. Basically many players quit the game because vindictus slowly requred players to buy NX to enhance your items and get all your gear to +10 or farm for months just to get rare drops, and this slowly made vindictus a pay to win system. At high level raids you're going to get kicked from raids because you do not meet the quotas placed. Even then the actual level grind is just horrible. And when I say horrible, I mean horrible. You have to replay most of the time the same map over and over again with recycled Ai that use the same exact moves usually in the same exact spawns. It's so linear and repetetive while you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ recycled quests as well, this is such a major issue because if the base of the game is about grinding your way to the top but the gameplay it self is so boring and found as a drag it ruins the whole fundimental of the general idea. Besides the maps being lazy the interface is also very sloppy and feels cluttered espically in stuff like the skills. Keep in mind I played this game back when Lann and Fiona were the only ones off steam; expecting major updates after alpha/beta I had high hopes only too see this game "Finish" after all its money support, legit all they did was just release new GENDER LOCKED classes with few new items. I'm honestly so upset because the combat system was done wonderful, it's fast paced and action packed, but all this garbage is slapped onto and it's not enough. Leave it to nexon always to ruin a good game.","April 9","false","61.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But i was immediately put off by a couple of things.\n\nCons: Story Progression is done in a way most MMORPG players are not used to, as in the dialogue boxes and chat with npc's is very different from a traditional MMORPG. This is a detail that i think the veteran MMO players would find slightly frustrating, but maybe they would have the patience to let it grow on them. I however, found it very off putting.\n\nSome weapons / classes are only available to certain genders. You pick a base character / hero at the very beginning, and you can tweak them later as far as physical appearance is concerned, and your name of course. But all of them use only one type of weapon, so if you want to use a glaive for instance, you are FORCED to play as a female character. Or if you want to use a great sword, you are FORCED to play a male character. Again, this may not matter for some, but to me  as a Veteran MMORPG player again this was off putting. I havn't even made it past character creation and my freedom is already being restricted? Not a good development choice.\n\nCharacter creation is a bit lacking, there are some features that you can only use by acquiring items from the in game cash shop, and other features are just badly implimented (The sliders for fat/muscle imparticular feel bad / inaccurate)\n\nPros:\nThe game looks beautiful\nCombat seems pretty fluid","April 9","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would reccommend playing if you have a group of friends that you want to play a MMORPG and build a guild with.","April 28","true","25.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have a great expensive computer just for playing these kinds of games, but it doesn't really matter in vindictus. You can have a 3,000 dollar comp & still lag from other players no matter what. oh & CRASH a LOT!! for no reason!!!\n\nI would say recommend if it was a newer game but the fact that these problems still exist in such an old mmo is just trouble. There are still such little things that could have been fixed 100000000 years ago, like the loot bouncing all over the screen & out of the map & into the ceilings.... that is just ridiculous!! the fact that you can't grab your loot after the report screen pops up so you miss everything...\n\nThey introduce you to the cash shops after like the 5th mission & they give you this default under armor that is - lets be honest- terrible looking with a lot of gear, so it makes you want to buy new under armor. it sucks!!! sure they let you pick a free hairstyle but only for 7 days. you even have to buy your face setup!! so unless you want to look like an asian teenager you have to spend some money on a new face/makeup.\n\nI give this game like a 5/10 for now but it could use some work that won't be done. im guessing ever.

Its nothing like the video describes. The graphics look good but, it looks like they tried to build a game with a low budget, all purpose, graphics engine and it wasn't opitmized at all. The game play wasnt all that captivating either. The quest menu, character menus and NPC interfaces need to be dumbed down to match the simplicity of the actual game mechanics. In the end you get a quest, go to some bulleten board, load up a crappy instanced sailboat. Then you launch into a 10 minute map where you hack slash some generic monsters from an early 90s quake 2 type game and get some loot.

Vindictus is amazing in almost every sence of the word, featuring high intesnity battles and increasingly difficult yet fun boss raids, what's not to love? The first half of the game is very much a solo experience, as the battles and bosses are well balanced and simple to defeat. However, as you approach higher levels you are forced to work with others to take down the threats, allowing for an incredibly fun co-op experience. Character and class progression is good as the player chooses how to to level their skills, not the game. My only criticism is that co-op has no servers, save for major raid bosses. So if you want to co-op a normal battle quest you're relying on a p2p conection, which can be a huge problem for people playing with friends interstate.","February 16, 2014","true","697.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love how Nexon added as much individualization to their character creation as they did. The only way they could really add to it would be making characters be either gender. I'm not sure where people are getting the Pay to Win style from because with the number of free cash shop items Nexon had given out, I got to level 60 without spending a dime. after that, I only bought cosmetic stuff(inner armor, tattoos, etc) until I hit about lever 65 at which point I bought 1 enhancement rune to try to get a weapon to +10(turned out I didn't need it, so I used it for another weapon).I think the community on this game(or at least 99% of it) is very pleasant. Sure you get trolls and irritating people, but find me any multiplayer game that doesn't have that. I thoroughly enjoy the raids offered, and the graphics definitely don't hurt that. That being said, the lag on here is slightly less than perfect, but that's forgiveable with the graphics and all the other stuff going on. Past the character and skills, the customization is nearly limitless. there are hundreds of armor sets and when combined, leave you with thousands, maybe millions, of combinations to give your character the look you want.If you're on the fence about trying this game, do yourself a favor and go for it. The beginning is a little slow, but that's the way all games are... you have to have time to learn the combat system and all the other stuff before you can take down a dragon with it, after all. On the note of combat system and controls, you can choose between keyboard, mouse, or gamepad(works with PS3/XBOX360 or later controllers) modes. Once you select the one you like most, you can fine-tune it to your ideal setup. My ratings for this game are...\nCommunity: 4.75/5\nGraphics:4-5/5(based on graphics settings, but even lowest are still quite wonderful)\nConnection:3.75-5/5(depending on host and your individual settings along with device capabilities)\nStory/Plot: 5/5\nCharacter Customization/Skills: 4.75/5\nEase of use(to get started): 5/5(starts slow, but you learn all the in's and out's of the game)\nOverall rating:4.5-4.9/5","February 13, 2014","true","504.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
