"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/299840/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Metal Planet is a MP shooter in the vain of the classic Unreal Tournament games. Players are split into two teams and dropped into a map, with the goal of capturing all the spawn points and killing off the other team until they can no longer spawn back. For all it takes from the classic Unreal games however, it loses absolutely all the polish, balance, and addictive quality that made those such timeless shooters, leaving you with a buggy and confusing menagerie of incomplete mechanics and unpolished design.\n\nThe largest issue with Metal Planet is how absolutely unintuitive everything about it manages to be. The simple task of firing weapons and using abilities are never explained or even hinted at, leaving you to fumble about on the keyboard hitting buttons in the hope they do something (the outcome of which is even more confounding). Should you figure out what the various skills do, matches quickly divulge into a completely unbalanced back and forth of who can stun the other person first. It's frustrating and dull at the best of times, and completely destroys any hope of an even match.\n\nI would like to say there's some hidden quality, some element of Metal Planet that keeps it a flawed but sometimes enjoyable gem, but there really isn't. Every aspect of the game is entirely ripped from other games, then melted down into an almost unrecognizable mess of broken and unenjoyable mechanics (not to mention the obnoxious visuals and single audio track). If I hadn't been playing with a group of friends I doubt I would have lasted more than a few minutes with this pile of rubbish (not that I could have, given the community is entirely dead), and would advise you to give it the widest of berths.","June 17, 2014","false","2.9"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/299840/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","This game is a very clearly low-budget affair, with poor translations (I believe from Russian) and a less-than-polished UI. Graphics are nothing special, but they will probably run on just about anything when turned down all the way at least, and the aesthetic isn't offensively bad or anything. The game technically features AI if you want to play in single player, but even as someone who normally likes playing against AI I found it mind-numbingly boring. The mechanics are barely interesting. Kindly put they'd be described as functional, less kindly as soulless.\n\nI could overlook all the little flaws at a low price if it weren't for the fact that no one is playing this. Without real people to play with I can't really recommend this at any price. According to SteamCharts the most people playing at once ever is a grand total of three, not even enough to fill a single game. The game is just not fun enough by yourself to be worth a purchase, and there's little chance that the player population will improve. It may be more fun if the player population picks up, so should that happen it may be worth your time and money to give it a try.","June 5, 2014","false","0.3"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","33","49","0","6"

Developer does not respond to forum posts. There are no servers offered for this multiplayer only game. It's strictly trading cards only. At that, even at the time of this post, it's $1.49, and that's at 75% off. You would never make $1.49 off the trading cards.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying, just don't. Spend your money elsewhere. This game is going nowhere. If you got it as part of a bundle, scrutinize the bundle providers, as clearly they either didn't do their research, or they don't mind selling you dead games.\n\nGood day.","November 28, 2015","false","11.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This is where games should be just as they are starting early access.  The problem is that this game is not early access.\n\nI should say I started with Mechs back in the early 1980s .... wait that's nearly 35 years ago.  Holy crap!\nThese are not mechs like I know them, giant customizable robots.  This is more Halo meets DOTA, and that's the best I can come up with.\n\nPro:\nIt has robot like things\nIt's kinda DOTA like, if that's a good thing for you.\nCo-Op / Multi player\n\nCon:\nDead game\nI doubt this will ever get from alpha release grade to beta, so forget this being a real game (which is kinda a shame)\nI'm not sure the controls actually count as controls\nAI is brain damaged\n\n\nOverall:\nIf I had 50 buddies who wanted to spend 200 hours trying to figure out how to play this game and they all got the game for free, then maybe.  As it stands now, not even as a free game.  Which is a shame since the premise of the game is good, it's just not a good game.","May 18, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I tried hitting different keys, that did nothing.  This is truely a POS game.","September 11, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
