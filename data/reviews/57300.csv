What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer. Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game.\n\nThe first of the two Amnesia games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010. It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the Penumbra games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous. With the hype around the upcoming release of Soma, yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue.\n\nActually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear. I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with Amnesia: The Dark Descent this kind of approach just looked impossible. The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover.\n\nThis may seem like exaggerated, but it's not. This game is by far the scariest I've ever played. Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods. As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me. But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary. It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings.\n\nThe game is by far the darkest I've ever played. Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern. Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible. There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought. For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death. The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!\n\nIt's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics. I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me. I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening. The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it. It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped.\n\nVery highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients","September 20, 2015","true","16.0"," 197 of 207 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","197","207","15","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/recommended/57300/","GopherGaming","Gopher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/","352 products in account","A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged.\n\nAmnesia is an old school horror experience where it is what you can't quite see that terrifies you more than what you can see. It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.\n\nThe story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do.\n\nAnd no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.\n\nEverything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.\n\nIf you like horror games this is a must have. And I dare you to play it at night, with the lights off and headphones one :)\n\nI recorded my full play through and you can watch it here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQyIjLHJg70&list=PL5204B6DA22162CC3&index=1\n\n","January 20, 2015","true","0.3"," 160 of 164 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","160","164","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reece82/recommended/57300/","reece82","Reece","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reece82/","332 products in account","Similar to the Penumbra games, Amnesia: TDD is all about atmosphere and storytelling.  The biggest difference between the two series is that Amnesia does include more of the classic horror induced moments of being chased and hunted.  Not that Penumbra didn't have a bit of that, but I'd say in Amnesia, there were specific moments designed to inject some action.\n\nOverall however, the game is paced similarly.  I could wander about, sip some coffee, read my notes and mementos and take in my surroundings.\nThis may sound casual but what Amnesia succeeds in doing is creating a sense of dread.  Brennenburg Castle is a miserable place and rarely do you find yourself feeling too comfortable. When an enemy does discover you and then gives chase, it is probably one of the more scary moments I've experienced in a game.  The music, the blurriness of your view, the sound of the monster chasing you...not to mention, when you do finally get behind a closed door and find a hiding spot, you then get to watch as the door is violently brought down into pieces. All you can do is hope you're not spotted as you stare at the wall (there is a "sanity" element if you're new to these games).  IRL, I am guilty of some audible "gasping" during these moments.  During one particular chase I couldn't find an adequate path to get away from my pursuer and let out a frightened yelp that I am ashamed to even admit. Though, it is important to mention that I allowed the game to get under my skin purely because it was better that way.  I could have played it and completely steeled myself from letting it get to me (e.g. left the lights on, lowered the sound, casually approached the objectives), but what's fun about that?  For me, nothing.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, I felt compelled to move forward to find the next clue.  I could feel a bit of excitement (or perhaps it's better described as relief) every time I saw a new note to read or completed a puzzle.  Naturally I won't reveal any spoilers just in case someone does read this review.\n\nI must emphasize that this is not a game full of jump scares and over the top gore.  With that being said, there are some very disturbing scenes that you come across.  I walk away from this game still thinking about some of what I experienced. Not just from the imagery but the story in general. Per the recommendation from the developers when you first start the game, play with the lights off, don't worry about saving and allow the story to drive you forward.","October 26, 2014","true","8.2"," 160 of 172 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","160","172","3","0"

Decaying and crumbling from within - your initial encounter with this hide-away-for-hell is akin to almost every lonely cabin or castle in the woods that pepper many a horror story. Ramshackle rooms will lead you from one area to the next, bookshelves will be covered with dust, dinner tables will almost always be covered in grime and decay as the food left on them begins to rot, windows will be cracked or outright smashed and an eerie wind will almost always be blowing through: finding its resting place in long, deep and dark cavernous hallways. One glance at the place should immediately tell you something very bad once happened here and another glance that it ain't over yet! Amnesia takes place in the early nineteenth century where you take on the role of a man named Daniel, a young man from London, who wakes up in Castle Brennenburg with little or no memory of his past except for his name. All the player is armed with at the onset of the game is a simple note – descend into the inner sanctum of the castle and find and kill a Baron that goes by the name of Alexander. Players soon realize that all is not well within the confines of Daniels mind. Events from the past – slowly revealed through letters and notes strewn across the castle – begin to paint a disturbing picture of how the evil in all of us can be accessed and then exploited by others for their own selfish gain.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174679839\nEmploying a rather genius mechanic of not actually being able to fight back at the various terrors encountered within the walls of the castle, Daniel needs to literally rely on running ahead and hiding in the shadows to avoid being caught or seen. This act, however, is a bit of a double edged sword. Not only is Daniel’s mind fast unraveling but his sanity too. The only way to keep Daniel from flipping out completely (which results in the entire screen dissolving in a dizzy flow of wavy lines with cockroaches running up and down its borders) is to keep Daniel within the confines of a light source. Fleeing from the terrors held within the castle and into a darkness so oppressive you can almost feel the weight of it falling out of your monitor is one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever encountered in any medium that uses horror to tell its story. Looking for a suitable hiding place as your eyes scramble to make out objects all while dealing with the onset of going totally insane by having your vision blur is the stuff nightmares are made of.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=175838383\nAt its heart Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an adventure game. Puzzles are strewn about the place, requiring solving before any advancement can be made. The puzzles themselves are not too hard to figure out but some of them do border on the obtuse and you get the feeling the developers are doing nothing more than padding out their title. Graphically the game looked outdated even upon its initial release but we have to remember that the game has been created without the AAA Budget of some big publisher and for an Indie it works. What the game lacks in graphical beauty it makes up in audio which really enhances this stark and grim world. There are many times throughout the game where it literally becomes a heart-stopping affair. I won’t lie – the game can be relentless in its efforts to scare the bejesus out of you. While games like Dead Space and Resident Evil are quite happy to rely on trigger-happy scares to thrill their audiences, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is more happy to tie you up and then hang you upside down all whilst it slowly, very slowly hacks at your groin with a hack-saw with the intent to slice your buttocks open - doing all this while laughing manically. In other words – if you love horror, you should love this!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 9, 2014","true","14.4"," 196 of 232 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","196","232","0","0"

At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.\n\nThe Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.\n\nif you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by.

If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.\n\nThere are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.\n\n5/5, by any means.

It's not that I'm indecisive it's just, I can't find the proper words to ever describe this game. You couldn't possibly understand what this game means to me. You might like it and the horror genre would say it's a great game but to me it's more. This game single handedly restored my faith in horror games and got me playing them again. After Resident Evil 5/6 and after Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour I stopped. Stopped playing, stopped reading up on, stopped caring about horror games. Resident Evil I saw coming but Silent Hill too? This mass appeal mindless action bullsh*t needs to stop. Survival horror was the genre that got me into gaming and then I saw the genre just up and leave us fans for more sales from the Call of Duty players. Action is where it's at? As the head developer for Resi 6 said "Survival Horror games are no longer popular, we needed a new direction and new ideas" well guess what... Amnesia proved Survival Horror still has plenty of new ideas to bring to the genre and proved that the genre is not dead.\n\nAmnesia is art.... it's artwork crafted by brilliant minds. Look past all the fun scary chases and the jumpscares, just look at the game. A first person game that doesn't have weapons? Yeah imagine that. You hide and run from monsters, much like people would do in real life. But if you break down the level design, the choice of imagery, the methodically detailed environments. You will see true beauty within. If I may quote some negative reviews here "water monster wasn't all that great of an enemy, he doesn't even have a character design. It's lazy...." yes they had limited resources however this isn't lazy design choices. The fact that you cannot see the water monster is more terrifying than any other creature in the game. It plays off your imagination, the fear of the unknown. Your mind subconsciously filled the blank with your worst fear which gave this monster so much memorability. The water monster is one of the most memorable moments, everyone talks about it and that's the reason.\n\nAfter such a horrifying experience with the water monster, what happens? You walk into a well light room with a fountain that supplies the calming sound of running water, a hole in the ceiling with light seeping through (one of the first times you see the light of day in this game), beautiful music plays softly in the background and the room has a tint of blue in the air. This is no randomly designed room, no this is a reward. This is saying "Hey you made it through that horrible experience, breathe relax a bit. You deserve it" and that is something I haven't seen before. No stupid achievement unlocked, no legendary loot, no high score and no misspelled CONGRADURATIONS. In a game that plays on your fear and emotions, they reward with such. They made you crap your pants, now they're making you feel relaxed. And that means more than any achievement.\n\nThe story is rich and it plays along with the tension in the game. The enemies aren't scary on the level of a jumpscare but rather the fear of being chased. Jumpscares are cheap thrills, true fear is much harder to achieve in a gamer and much more satisfying for the gamer. They accomplish this in many ways. Never knowing what danger lurks beyond the glow of your lamp, the dark abyss continuously hunts you down, the monsters are not just some scary looking monsters for the sake of "boo look at me I'm scary" they're people you tortured and sacrificed for your own safety against the darkness, their disfigured bodies are representations of the guilt you bare in the deepest parts of your conscious despite suffering Amnesia you still feel it, led astray by someone you thought you could trust, no escape or easy way out the only path is down and it's bathed in darkness as you descend slowly into your past with each step you lost sanity, walls are shaking, the crackling sound of your own mind is louder than your beating heart as you're chased by a horrifying disfigured creature you created, the sound of screeching can be heard when they're getting closer letting you know how close you are to death.\n\nOh... jeez I... I can go on and on about this game. Hell I want too... but if this gets any longer it will be considered a novel. The best thing I can say about this game? Play it... please. I beg you if you're a fan of horror games, if you like being scared, if you like a good story or immersion or hell if you just want to play a damn good game; play this game!\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The favorite game, not one of. That's hard to say, but it's true. I never game 10 out of 10. I always made fun of other reviewers who did, saying no game is perfect. 10 out of 10 is saying it's the masterpiece of all gaming and cannot be improved in any way, shape or form. However, I've seen my mistake. You don't give it a 10 based on some score that means nothing to anyone else other than you. You're giving it a 10 based on the experience the game gave you. And based on that, Amnesia The Dark Decent was given my very first 10 out of 10.","October 6, 2014","true","39.1"," 108 of 117 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","108","117","0","9"

In those notes, you urge yourself to descend deeper and deeper into the castle, and while you do so, you learn the horrible truth of what is going on... slowly... slowly learn... equipped with an oil lamp and nothing more. The atmosphere is very creepy, and you have to care for your physical and mental health during the whole game. If you run out of light, you run out of sanity.\n\nThere are many puzzles in the game to be solved, collecting objects spread around to unlock a door, and so on. They would be silly in a regular setting, but here you think "Oh horror, do I have to go AGAIN in that dark, dark, dark room?!?!" There are NO JUMP SCARES. You can usually "feel the horror coming" (and after coming; refer to item 3) and then you look... there it is... or nope, there is nothing. Or wait, there is. What was that noise? Where was that? Behind me? No, that things wasn't there before. DAMMIT I'M RUNNING OUT OF OIL IN MY LAMP!\n\nThis game does a great job at making the player afraid of exploring some areas, just because you learn it could mean "trouble".

But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit.\n\n... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.\n\nIt's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.","December 1, 2013","true","6.6"," 78 of 82 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","78","82","0","8"

Daniel is trying to discover hints about his past through reading notes that he apparently left for himself and searching through old diary entries and random scraps of paper. Hints are also provided by flashbacks that regularly pop up out of nowhere.\nIn Amnesia there are no weapons. The only assistance you get is an oil lamp, some matches and if prefered the hints the game gives you. Also a nice and fearsome feature is your insanity. As you make your progress through the game you have to keep an eye on your sanity. If a monster gets close or you stay in the dark for too long, your character gets insane. The game also features some nice puzzles.\nMost part of the game takes place in dark areas or with some small lighting effects. The effects when your vision is blurred are nicely done.\nThe sound is one of the games greatest aspects. The soundtrack ranges from ambient tunes to haunting sound effects like moaning or wind breezes. Or you hear footsteps and then suddenly some cockroaches are under your feet.\nAmnesia is a perfect horror game to play in the dark, alone and with headphones.\nIf you are a fan of the horror genre you should buy this game.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","September 10, 2013","true","9.0"," 130 of 160 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","130","160","0","1"

Have that sense of adreline when you are faced by something that can easily overpower you if caught?\n\nI would recommend amensia to anyone who enjoys a good horror game that is geared towards making you scream.\n\nSummary\n+Great Atmosphere (Great music, Graphics, and theme)\n+Great Pacing\n+Great Mechanics\n+Good Puzzles\n\nFear Itself\nIt is so well focused on all the elements on horror that you are unable to even fight back at the enemy. Forever doomed to listen and feel terror down your spine as you try to find cover or some place to take shelter from the sight of the enemy.\n\nAnother feature of this game to note is the idea of looking at your enemy makes you panic is quite genius. This allows for more realistic scare tactics such as quick glimpses of the enemy, and constantly trying to avoid its attention.\n\nIssues\nWhile Amnesia is a good horror game there are some glaring faults with the overall game that could makes  the game lose the effectiveness of its horror. Continue reading at your own risk.\n\nPredictability\nThe issue stems from the predictability of the monsters spawning right after puzzles. Once you realize you're safe doing a puzzle you lose the tension and prepare even beforehand for the enemy to spawns by memorizing some closet locations. When a player sees the pattern the threat itself ceases to be horrifying.\n\nConfrontation\nThe other issue is simply when players choose to confront enemies. Seeing the enemy also takes away to the mystery of what they look like and actually brings down the scare factor. Once they figure out how to trick the AI in more ways or simply stop being so afraid. The game design choices have been good to avoid this happening except for the fact that randomized monsters poof once you confront/die to them and you are pretty much safe till next puzzle.\n\nFlashbacks\nFlashbacks do not restructure the place to how it would look like before the guy had amnesia. It would be a better visual comparison to see how much the place suffered structurally as a result.\n\nTaking Control away\nTaking control away from the player to demonstrate how the character feels at the moment I feel was a mistake. They do this a few times in the game instead of letting the player himself/herself react. For example in the start of the game when you hear noises above you, your character will fall to the ground with his face near it. I found this really overdramatic and not needed for the already well established atmosphere in this game.\n\nConclusion\nOverall Amensia despite all the flaws that can occur, is a great horror game that tries its best to put fear in you and prolong the scare with smart tactics that are not blatent jump scares.","November 27, 2013","true","17.3"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","75","86","0","2"

It's not because of the amount of monsters, either not the jump scares (Fortunately they don't exist in that game). You wanna know what one thing making this game a true masterpiece? I'll tell you, imagination.\n\nMost of the times we are scared, because of things that are simply happening, like for example self-opening doors, windows, creepy screams from the basements of the castle etc. In that situation you immediately think that there is monster nearby, but you just realised that was a false alarm. You can also hear monster's scream, but that doesn't mean that you'll even spot him. Of course all those "warnings" aren't always fake alarms, so player have to be prepared in every moment! It's also a great survival game, you have to looking for items like oil to your lamp, tinderboxes to set fire to torches for example and other items that will help you complete this adventure!\n\nSoundtrack is great, it fit in game perfectly. In my opinion soundtrack in every games HAVE to be good, especially in horror games. I recommend check some tracks on YouTube.\n\nGame has also an option that allow you put some custom stories created by fans (There are a lot of cool maps to play). Also remember that some of the custom stories were making "for fun" and they aren't scary at all, but still worth to play a couple of them, no doubht about it. So if you completed the main game and You still looking for some cool, scary/fun stories to play, go ahead.\n\nI should also say about the physics in this game. You can pickup almost every items you spot, chairs, boxes, bags etc. You can compare that to Half-Life 2, but in Amnesia this one is more advanced.\n\nYou should complete this game in 6-8 hours on the first playthrough in my opinion. I recommend looking for as many items as you can spot, since the inventory is unlimited. There is also one small addon called Amnesia: Justine, it's very short (1 hour) but in my opinion still worth to complete.\n\nI rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), not 9/10 because it's scripted game and you won't have same fun playing this game second time since you'll remember a lot of things.\n\nI didn't say about everything, story in game and other things, but this is my first "big" review. Also my english may be not perfect, but I did my best and i'll improve myself in future for sure!\n\nBuy it!","January 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","51","52","0","1"

You learn by dying and by reading, listening and experimenting with objects.\n\nCONS:\n- As you can only interact with objects I would have liked to had seen more of them, some rooms feel repetitive and if they were to be more dense it could have only added more character.\n- A tiny complaint here are the loading screens, as you enter certain areas there are loading screens, they are overly long but as you play more there become more. On a positive note it doesn't distract too much away from immersion as its all just one big place too explore.\n\nVERDICT?\nA very tense experience, not for the feint hearted nor the impatient but a rewarding and intriguing game.","September 8, 2015","true","14.3"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","49","52","4","0"

Roosevelt***As a small disclaimer toward this review, though I do not have many recorded hours through Steam for this game, I typically had played it offline and have progressed much further than my online hours would anticipate. Also, I would like to give thanks to Demo_187 and Brother Tasty for proofreading this for me.\nHorror game fanatics of many generations know this title to be one of the most influential in the genre. Amnesia: The Dark Descent -commonly referred to as, simply, Amnesia-is a first-person psychological thriller set in an aged castle-like structure. The player ventures through the massive compound without memory of previous events with the hope of departing said area, never to return. This title is certainly becoming dated, but frets revealing this with its unique exploration approach to gameplay, as well as the ominous theme that persists.\nHere are a few points of interest in this engaging title:\n\nAtmosphere - Amnesia, unlike other recent horror titles, utilizes much more sophisticated means of psychological disturbances in comparison to the usual mirage demonstrated by jump-scares. As expected, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is quite dark, to the point that extended exposure to dimly lit rooms drains Daniel’s-the protagonist-sanity; this causes the player to expend light sources such as the portable lantern and tinderboxes to illuminate the area. Violent screams and ominous groaning aide in this title’s atmosphere, as these auricle displays may or may not contribute to the actual game experience in ways other than overall feel; whether or not such sounds are relevant can only be determined through play. There are few disruptive sequenced events since each offers context to the game’s illusive story, and Daniel has created a few “Note to Self’s” for the player to find that only add to the unsettling unknown.\n\nStory - As stated, this title’s opening entails the protagonist awakening in a seemingly uninhabited structure with no prior memory of interactions within. From here the player must quest through the house to uncover its secrets. This title-fittingly-is very psychological, maddening even, as the tale is surfaced only by exploring the massive home to horror. Just the right amount of information is revealed through playable scripted events and texts, but the full story remains outside of the player’s reach unless portions of this illusion are pieced together; even so, some questions remain unanswered to service some ambiguity. So as to not reveal anything of major importance, I will halt this segment with these final words: search well.\n\nTrivial Gameplay - Combat-apart from flailing chairs and other loose objects at unmentionable daemons-is nonexistent. Amnesia advocates primarily as a puzzle mystery game in which player must resolve encounters with cunning rather than physical prowess. Challenges are crafted well enough to accommodate Dungeons & Dragons  campaigns while retaining a similar theme to a remainder of the game. As for the controls, players maneuver with the standard W, A, S, and D key layout while also adding giving simple commands for lifting objects, illuminating wall- and table-mounted torches, accessing in-game menus, and equipping items such as the lantern; it is a simple system, but this sort of title requires no such complexity in having to remember an obscene amount of button combinations.\n\nTL:DR - Challenges range in difficulty from moderate to complex, with an intense atmosphere throughout. Amnesia is best presented in a dark room while playing alone and utilizing a decent sound system. Uncovering journals, I realized how much I did not know, but also that this most frightening revelations could possibly be recurrent or relevant to the current protagonist’s stride; this game truly knows how to disturb the player. I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys explorative mystery, puzzle, or horror titles from the first-person perspective. In my honest opinion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a legend in the horror genre, so I would not pass on this title. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.\n\n10/10 - Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!\n\n\nJokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.\n\nThe sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet.\n\nWhy the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face-to-face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you.\n\nThere is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore.\n\nWhile avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling.\n\nOf course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.\n\nWho is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!\n\nEventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.\n\nThe only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing "e" to interact, one needs to press "use" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.","September 18, 2015","true","7.9"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","33","34","14","2"

Well, you don’t need to look further; Amnesia: The Dark Descent is that game. This game is truly horrifying, unlike most horror games out there, Amnesia isn’t a horror game that is full of cheap jump scares. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn’t be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia’s scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what’s called Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nIs the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it? Don't think that you're done yet, because the horror doesn’t end there. You can go online and download custom stories, made by users to scare other users and to make the Amnesia experience a better one.\n\n10/10\nDefinitely worth the purchase for you horror game players","June 3, 2014","true","10.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/57300/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Your enjoyment of Amnesia: The Dark Descent hinges almost entirely on what you expect to get out of it.\n\nAs a horror game, certainly what it’s advertised and probably considered by most to be, it shockingly comes across as rather...uninteresting. It does an amazing job setting a tense, foreboding atmosphere, layering on copious amounts of disturbing exposition and twisted imagery. And then sort of throws it away when it attempts to bring it all to boiling point and scare you out of your wits, relying on a sluggish, rather dimwitted monster which is rather less than frightening and scare tactics which all too quickly become  predictable.\n\nThe sense of dread I felt when I first awoke in the mysterious castle that makes up Amnesia, was lost after just a few hours, as it became dreadfully easy to guess exactly when and how the game would attempt to scare me, no matter how much I kept hoping that it would reject my expectations. Picking up key items, opening a particularly unappealing door, or finding a note; Amnesia’s list of triggers is short and used liberally, making for an experience that quite frankly left me a bit annoyed at how little it managed to get to me. I was practically begging to be scared by the end, but aside from a few very brief standout sections Amnesia almost does more to set you at ease than it does to freak you out.\n\nI say all this, and yet, Amnesia is still immensely compelling as something completely atypical of what I would have guessed: a traditional adventure game. Behind the gruesome imagery and very effective atmosphere, the excellent puzzle designs and exploration were what kept me intrigued and wanting to come back to the game. Though they’re often simple in design, there’s a rewarding logic to each puzzle that makes them unexpectedly enjoyable to solve. Frictional Games manages to make blind exploration and continual backtracking interesting and continually stimulating, with each area you visit being visually distinct and engaging, and often holding within contextual exposition that creates a great sense of place and causes the castle to feel far larger than just the areas you explore.\n\nWhen you’re not solving puzzles, the disorganized narrative compels you forward, leaving you vague notes that give just enough information to make you want to learn more while rarely telling you the whole story until the very end. Finding the details of this plot are often disturbing and thoroughly unpleasant, leaving me feeling rather mixed about my protagonists actions but nonetheless complacent as I couldn’t leave this story unfinished. The flashbacks/hallucinations that your character often witnesses gives a look into how the castle used to operate, horribly inhumane and driven by some mysterious supernatural element, but all the same a place I wanted to learn more about if only so I could make sense of my character’s madness.\n\nThis madness is perhaps the game’s strongest achievement, distorting the world around you and causing you to see things that may very well not be there. Staying too long in the dark wears on your sanity, requiring you to ransack every room you come across so you can be sure to have enough oil for your lantern and tinderboxes to light candles and torches. I was a bit disappointed that these resources came in such large supply, as it made darkness less of a threat and more of an occasional hindrance to your view, but the mechanic was still engaging enough to cause me to pay more attention to the environment and as a result find things I may otherwise have missed.\n\nIt’s a little funny to me that despite being let down by the aspect that I expected would have prevented me from even finishing the game, what I found underneath it proved more than enough to push me through the game. If you’re hoping Amnesia will leave you terrified and sleeping with the lights on, you’ll most likely be let down by the underdeveloped, somewhat lazy frights found here. But if you can appreciate the game without those prerequisites, there’s an eerie and twisted adventure game waiting to swallow you whole into its brilliantly realized darkness.","November 17, 2014","true","7.8"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","48","62","3","0"

The puzzle dynamics are a little quirky in places and can be misleading but overall they are straightforward and easy to solve. There’s no combat so all you can do when confronted with an adversary is to run and/or hide but it serves to heighten the effect of how helpless you are when subject to these supernatural forces beyond your grasp. The audio and art design are well suited to one another and deliver an excellent environment for feeling the dread of the unknown as you thread further into the depths where your destiny awaits. So fear or no fear… this game deserves mustering enough chutzpah, guts, gumption and whatever else you got to spare in order to play.","June 9, 2012","true","19.0"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

They complement each other well, as the places you wander through get gradually more terrifying, the fairly unconvoluted riddles help you ease the tension that can become almost unbearable at times. This is where this game shines, the pace is skillfully mastered, even if you have difficulties persisting in horror games you might very well finish this one. The design is tighly knot around exploration, lightening candles and torches to ward off the darkness, finding the scattered pieces of the story and a death mechanic inconsequential to your progress. The game manages to fill you both with a sense of curiosity as you descent further into the abyss to unravel its mysteries, and a sense of dread to what awaits you in its darkest recesses. You won't be disappointed by its climax.\n\nAmnesia : The Dark Descent is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, yet a highly unpleasant one, reaching that difficult balance each horror game aims to find. It lasts 7 to 8 hours, and there is the possibility to play custom stories, which I might review here as I go through them.","October 29, 2014","true","25.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

It is all about the atmosphere, ambience and the story. The way that Frictional Games keep pumping the tension during the game is just brilliant. The game is really immersive and if you get into it, you get into the story, get into the feeling of the main character, you'll be fully immersed and will feel all the horrors and fears that awaits behind every corner. That's what happened to me. Being adult, I have never been so frightened by any of the media content: either it is a movie or a game. But the Amnesia: The Dark Descent literally made me be afraid and really swet because of the tension.\n\nAnd there are no cheap techniques like so-called "jump scares" or anything I can remember of. All the scary feelings are invoked by the game's atmosphere built by amaizing art and graphics, brilliant ambient and sound effects, intriguing story and gameplay elements. It is your mind which, upon this all, will build inside the conclusions of the upcoming danger, which will may or may not happen. But you'll never know what is it this time: true danger or you're deluding yourself.\n\nWorth to mention that gameplay is built upon the idea, that you can't fight and directly resist your enemies with weapon. Therea are no weapond, no direct fights, no health bar, no danget indicators. And me personally like this idea and gameplay philosophy of Frictional Games, which they evolved from the great Penumbra series (in the first game you actually could fight, but avoiding it was the best option all the time). And alongside the dark atmosphere and unknown danger, when you don't know what is happening, who you may face with, and what it will cost you, the best idea that you would come up with in such situation in real life - is try to hide, or somehow avoid the danger, or run as fast as you can. You wouldn't stop to check out whether that butcher is gonna slaughter you or give you a hug.\n\nIf you liked what I have described, you should definitely grab and play this game (it's free right now)! There is much more! And I'm sure that upcoming SOMA will be another horror masterpiece.

And I mean it. I remember when this game came and peolple were like: "This is too scary, I can't play it more than couple of minutes" or "I'm gonna never play this game again". I've been playing the orginal story trough and before it I had watched many gameplays and walktrhougs from it. Even after them I was really afraid when I played it. I knowed well enough where monsters appears, but nevertheless they scared me.\nThe basic idea of the game is survive in dark castle and escape from monsters. You can't fight to monsters, you can only escape or hide. You must also collect the pages of your diary, because you haven't memories from past. Them tell you about the story. The game isn't just running and hiding. There's also many puzzles what give such good a change.\nIt's not just scare because of terrible and ugly monsters (sometimes it's even quite funny to play with them), the real horror is made by absolutely great atmosphere. And what make this atmosphere, they are sounds and musics.\nFirstly I must praise musics. From peaceful and mystical ambiences to terrible and oppressive themes. In different places you hear variable musics and also every events and monsters have it's own themes.\nThe storytelling is made by foundable diary pages and sounds what you here in flashbacks.

By that I mean not playing it surrounded with natural and/or artificial light and plenty of people around who may or may not have played this before. This is the kind of title that asks for you to be alone in the dark with stereo headphones on. This is how you properly set the gamma the first time you play the game. You have to properly set the mood in order for you to get the best possible horror experience out of Amnesia - The Dark Descent.\n\nOverall: Amnesia the Dark Descent is an enjoyable title with a refreshing twist on the survival horror genre. But as stated the re-playability is limited, but is at least worth the 20 bucks just so as long you enjoy this type of experience.

It's full of dark places, your light is limited, and there are monsters around you, which you can only free from. The lack of light makes you feel scared and insecure, expecially for your "brain health": if there's no sufficient light or if you are looking to a monster for too much time, the brain health will go down and strange visions and effects will appear on the screen. I think it's one of the best aspects of this game. The sound has a great quality as same, making you feel inside the game, and there are many puzzles and hard parts that will keep your mind working for long time.

Evading the enemies is fairly stressful (as it should be) but is never frustrating or annoying. ATDD is all about atmosphere, which it has by the bucketload, and story, which it has in some depth. Much of what has to be done in the game, by way of solving puzzles, will be familiar to anyone who has played adventure games before but here again ATDD gets the formula just right. This is the first survival horror game I’ve played that has no combat (I’ve played plenty that do) and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it performs in both the survival and the horror aspects. Graphically it’s pretty good but not outstanding. There are some nice touches of interactivity: you have to pull and push at doors and drawers in order to open and close them. And the sound design is also very atmospheric. It’s a fairly short game but it packs quite a lot into 10–15 hours of gameplay and is recommended if you like the horror genre. 4/5","April 24","true","12.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","4"

This game is incredible and has amazing atmosphere and creepy jump scares, well, for the custom stories that is. The story goes like this. Your name is Daniel and you enter a creepy castle and have to try and kill someone named Alexander of Brennenberg and this game is all about the stealth! Yes, STEALTH! You can't kill any enemies you just have to simply hide and wait, or just run away from them or, you can troll them and try to kill them which I don't know what's the fun in that but that's my opinion. Anyways this game is just so much fun and Frictional Games also made a DLC called Justine which is pretty difficult, if you die you have to start all over again and you also get to choose if you wanna save the prisoner's or kill them, which I always like to be evil. Also I highly suggest you play the game with your headphones and full blast and in a dark room cause that just makes it even more possible for you to get very scared. Frictional Games made another series before this called Penumbra which is very good I've seen Markiplier play it and I wanna play it myself but it won't let me (which makes me VERY sad), and there's 3 games, there's Overture, Black Plague and Requim which is just kinda like a DLC which a LOT ofth very hard puzzles (from what I've heard). Frictional has also FINALLY made the sequel to Amnesia called A Machine For Pigs which, I will make a review on that, not going to say anything on that subject *shudders* but yea that's pretty much all I can think of. This is my first review and I'm terrible at doing them I hope you can bare with me on that. So if you haven't played the game I hope this will tempt you to go and buy it and get scared as hell cause, a lot of the custom stories are VERY scary (coming from a guy who doesn't get scared at all)! Well there ya have it, that's all I've got on my noggin so I'll see ya guys next time for my next review and, have a great day all and one last thing to say, you'd better have a lot of pants!

Amnesia: The Dark Descent was not scary enough to keep my interest to finish the game. I kept playing to try and finish it all in one sitting, however, I stopped after 9 hours because I realized Amnesia was just not my kind of horror.  On a good note, it did stray away from the action and guns-blazing direction that some horror series seem to be going down.\n\nOf course, not everyone has the same idea of horror so I’ll further elaborate in the next sections to help anyone who may be indecisive…\n\nPros:\n+ Some interesting grotesque designs and haunting atmosphere\n+ Impressive graphics, lighting and physics\n+ Great immersive soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Not many scary moments\n- Tedious, repetitive and predictable\n- Lacks the “struggle aspect” in survival horror (in terms of game-play, for the PLAYER)\n- Daniel’s reactions took away from the experience (and made me feel like the bigger man)\n\n\n“WILL IT BE SCARY FOR ME?”\n[Not Recommended]\nIf you…  Believe that being startled or nervous is not the equivalent to being scared.\nPrefer horror titles to include a game-play challenge to stay alive (e.g. careful management, risk vs reward, fight vs flight decisions, etc).\nUsually figure out the “formula” or “pattern” in video games. (This may remove the immersion and dampen the horror for you.)\nThink that keeping the protagonist calm and from fainting sounds like babysitting rather than a sanity mechanic.\n[Recommended]\nIf you…  Prefer a "casual" or “theme park” sense of horror where the emphasis is on exploration, imagery and atmosphere.\nBelieve the aesthetic presentation is more important than game-play to make an effective horror title (e.g. imagery, sounds, visual design, etc.).\nAgree that challenging game-play makes a horror title frustrating rather than scary or it is not preferred.\nDon’t get tired from playing a cat and mouse game for 9+ hours.\nLike H.P. Lovecraft inspired themes and/or psychological horror.\n\nTHE SCARY FACTOR - FURTHER ANALYSIS\nThe game attempts to provide a horror experience through atmosphere based on the fear of what cannot be seen (in the wait of physical danger), psychological horror (hence "amnesia" and the horrors uncovered from the protagonist's psyche), imagery to disturb the player, very few jump-scares, and providing the feeling of defenselessness by having no weapon option. My experience, however, lacked horror most of the time because the game’s predictability allowed me to be confident in my ability to run and hide rather than testing my courage or facing my fears head-on. For the most part you walk around, collect stuff, solve a puzzle, run from easy enemy AI, hide, and repeat. I was able to figure out the pattern of the game early; I knew that for the most part I was safe, had a good idea on what would trigger the encounters and what to do when that happened. I was prepared and ready. -Because of this, most of the game felt like filler for the sake of having a pattern or to make the game longer. I would have preferred a short game compressed of clever horror events (such as evolving the mechanics) rather than a drawn out experience of the same thing repeated.\n\nAnother problem was that this game didn't have the sense of struggle that survival horror usually provides to accomplish horror. Amnesia’s experience felt effortless to succeed compared to other survival horror titles I've played (e.g. Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Rule of Rose, etc.); as a result, I never felt in any real danger. There weren't any good portrayals of careful management of resources, a high risk vs. reward or anything like that. Limited lamp oil was a good start, but the 60 tinderboxes (cylinders?) in my inventory were too large of a safety net. The sanity meter was another attempt to make you manage your light sources, but Daniel’s reaction to everything that happens takes away from the experience. He’ll gasp, breathe heavily and faint to indicate his lowering sanity from occurrences; as a result, I got annoyed and couldn't help but to roll my eyes at the fact the game had to point out what’s “scary” through Daniel.\n\nAlthough there were some moments I did like (no spoilers, just vague descriptions). The water level and prison hallways provided a different change of pace. The water part was a good example on how the game-play could be dynamic, yet still use the same simple mechanics in order to provide uncertainty and invade the player’s comfort without the use of combat or completely seeing the enemy. The prison hallways provided a claustrophobic feeling in the narrow hallways with a great contrast between the vulnerability of the unknown within the darkness and the exposure to be seen in the light. There were no “obvious” hiding places, such as a closet, instead you had to rely on anything you could in your environment, (e.g. dark corner, hiding behind furniture etc.) which made the fear and game-play feel more “natural” in these sections.","June 1, 2014","false","39.7"," 95 of 174 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","95","174","2","5"

I'll keep them to a minimum though.\n\nI first heard about Amnesia: The Dark Descent when some of my friends were talking about it. They didn't tell much but it seemed interesting enough to have a look at it. I always had some really creepy games in my "Best games I've ever played"-list, but I had not played anything like Amnesia before.\n\nSo what is it about? Your name is Daniel and you're from London, Mayfair. That's all you know when you wake up from being unconscious. You are in a medieval-looking castle and have no idea how you got there. Nobody is around so you wander around the castle looking for answers. Eventually you find a note that is addressed to you and was written by - yourself. The information in this note is the only clue you have while wandering the castle of Brennenburg, in a desperate search for answers while trying to get away from whatever is trying to hunt you down.\n\nUnlike many other titles that are labeled horror, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is not a hybrid type game like a horror shooter or a horror-RPG. You cannot simply blast your way through the castle using fancy weapons or magic. Daniel hasn't got any kind of weapon and - surprise - he will never find one. Still there are enemies within the castle, and they are not the ones to be reasoned with. Your only means of self-defense are running and hiding. In most situations the latter one is preferable. Dark places are great if you don't want to be seen but hiding in the dark also exposes Daniel to the horrors within his own mind. You find yourself constantly wondering if you should light the candles in a room to avoid going crazy while being at risk of being found.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is all about immersion. There is no HUD and your two most important resources - health and sanity - aren't represented by definite numbers. You have to keep both in mind, though. The game physics highly contributes to the immersive experience. If you want to open a drawer you don't simply click it. Instead you grab it using your mouse and draw it towards you. That also makes it possible to either open doors slowly and with great care or to slam them shut.\n\nAmnesia not your generic horror-ish game, it's the real deal. It is not about fighting your way through hordes of enemies or being the hero who saves the world. The whole game is about nothing but atmosphere. If you can appreciate that Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a definitive must-buy.\n\nMore reviews here","April 30, 2013","true","46.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Well my friends, Amnesia is here and your bowels are about to betray you. The game sets you in a horrifying, dark world, eliminating the comforting heft of any weapons and pitting you against deadly enemies you must sneak around and hide from to survive, all the while solving puzzles and keeping your sanity in check to progress.  The game is a short one, well around 5 - 6 hours, but it took me a week to beat based entirely on the fact that I kept fearquitting, or bringing up the Steam web browser to watch stupid crap on YouTube to get my nerves back.  The story and three alternate endings have a chance to confuse a bit and it may take some paying hard attention to fully understand the story, but it's a good one nonetheless.

The game includes a lot of puzzles which aren't insanely complex but still require a mediocre amount of intelligence to complete. Personally I think the story is great, lots of information is scattered around the halls of Brennenburg in the form of notes. These notes are often accompanied by the great dialogue that makes an appearance in the game every so often. The voice acting is brilliant but unfortunately it's not featured as much as I would like it to be, simply because there is a small amount of characters. And of course the monsters... The monsters play a huge role in the game. As if the terrifying atmosphere wasn't enough you will also be filled with paranoia knowing that there could be a monster waiting behind every door you open, every corner you peek around. Arguably the best thing about the game is "Custom stories", there are thousands of levels to download online that are made by the community so that you can keep playing even after you have completed the main story! If you want a horror game that will keep you constantly frightened, but also curious to discover what will happen next then you should definitely try out Amnesia.\n\nOverview\n\nPros\n- Absolutely terrifying atmosphere (better than cliché jumpscares, imo)\n- Great story\n- Awesome voice acting\n- Community made levels, often have amazing stories.\nCons\n- Puzzles sometimes become tedious\n- No combat (This boils down to preference)","October 5, 2014","true","10.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Yes\nMakes you jump out of your seat? Yes\nBecome afraid of water? Yes\n\nThese are just some of what happened in the game. Basically, in case you've never seen/heard of it, its an atmospheric horror game, set in the days before electricity, and you're in the dark, gloomy places you wish never existed. You have a lantern, and a limited amount of tinder that you can find. And you're trying to survive everything that is thrown at you.\n\nSome parts are quiet, and then you hear a roar, and as its in the dark and you've run out of oil, you stumble to try and find a corner to hide in, and prey it doesn't see you.\n\nOverall, its a great game. I actually played this in the dark, no lights etc. My keyboard is black, and there are no lights on it, so I immersed myself into the game.\n\nPlaying with headphones on (as I was recording for Let's Play), when you're out of a light source for too long, your sanity starts to go, and you hear scratching noises. Headphones on, feels like its at the back of your own skull.\n\nRecommend to anyone that like a scare, some puzzles are annoying but the overall game is fantastic!!\n\n10/10","April 17","true","16.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/punanitsunami69/recommended/57300/","punanitsunami69","PunaniTsunami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/punanitsunami69/","407 products in account","With everything you've already heard about Amnesia, know this - you can only take its hype so far. Yes, it's a delightfully scary game with a real sense of accomplishment after every puzzle you complete and monster you run from. But it's not so scary that you should immediately dismiss it if it's "not your genre" or you're "too scared".\n\nAny adult gamer owes it to themselves to pick up this game up if only for how well it is able to create a believable atmosphere with simplistic visuals, conveying information through text (an obvious limitation), and one of the best-sounding indie games of its time. AAA titles and indie games that want to venture into horror game making can take something out of this from a sound design standpoint.\n\n\nVisually, it's delicious. The textures and effects work to display an ominous ancient castle in the 1880s with a steampunk aesthetic for its puzzle elements. The use of props, mechanics, and an inventory system works. It doesn't fare against today's AAAs, but it's going to look damn good on whatever you're playing it on. If you also play it on the correct brightness level (you'd only be cheating yourself), it adds another level of immersion.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics are great, but can get needlessly redundant and complex if you don't read some of the lore. If the papers are in the Notes section, they're worth reading. Sprinting mechanics and how the controls work when you're going insane felt strangely natural. Monsters spooked. The pick up, throw, and move object controls were also relieving - sometimes you just wanted to hurl a chair, a skull, or a body of other props in the air for no good reason other than to see it fly away.\n\nThe only way you could tell this was a budgeted game was through its use of limited narration in its story texts. Most information is conveyed through what's written down on pieces of paper, and a limited voiceover from a few characters on a few documents (not all are voiced over) made me lose interest. But there were times in the journey where the your world would slow so that the protagonist could remember moments that were mostly delivered only through dialogue and sound. Those moments more than balanced out the chunks of text that were both spoken and unspoken.\n\nWith its limited scope and mechanics for it being a budgeted title, the length felt right. It has 3 types of endings, which fit within its lofty lore that surrounds it. The checkpoint system was forgiving, and I wouldn't have had that any other way. Another gripe was that once you died or initially encountered the same few monsters, it felt less spooker than I anticipated. But the scores and sound cues that accompanied their presence hooked me back into it.\n\nTL:DR\n\n++ P H E N O M E N A L  sound design in every step in the process, whether you're using on board audio or a top-notch sound card.\n+ Short, but sweet game w/ interesting puzzles\n+ Fresh spin on old environments with great visuals\n+ Simple mechanics in a complex world\n+/- Most information delivered through text, can feel a bit like a visual novel at points\n- Characters not as memorable as the setting, which I found to be a missed opportunity\n- Monster interactions got tedious and boring at points\n\n8.5/10 - A great game for anyone coming from any genre background. This game also has a semi-active modding community on modDB that can provide tens of hours of new stories and campaign that reaches from Amnesia's rich backstory. One of my best Humble Bundle fringe purchases to this date.","April 29","true","8.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While other games offer you cheap thrills accompanied by arsenals of weapons, Amnesia offers a different alternative. you are unable to resort to fighting back,  you must escape and figure out what is going on. Why have you been put in this position? What looms in the dark?\n\nAmnesia is a fantastic first person horror survival game that I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good scare and a good story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lightning_Ravager/recommended/57300/","Lightning_Ravager","NOMAC 1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lightning_Ravager/","315 products in account","I'll start by putting the pieces in one by one on how GREAT this game is.\n\nFirst off is the story. You know, a lot of game developers don't make "amnesia" a good cliche. On fact, when game devs have amnesia, it usually has that character never remember anything at all in the end of a game and leaves gamers with more questions than answers. Other games have characters remember things until the very end of the game (not going to name games in case of spoilers). But this game starts with a man named Daniel, who wakes up with no memory inside of a castle. He finds a note to the Daniel that remembers. Daniel starts to constantly find notes to himself and starts to remember who he really is. While he is trying to find out who he is, Daniel is on a quest to do what the first note said. To kill a man named Alexander. As Daniel treks through the humongous castle, his sanity starts to fall down and he starts finding strange phenomena like a monster stalking his every move. Daniel must kill Alexander... before his sanity kills himself. This dark story will have you scared to go in the dark, and what the darkness might hold for you.\nNext up, the gameplay. The gameplay takes the same of a survival horror genre. You need a lanter to light up your way AND to not lose your sanity, for sanity is the key to how much monster encounters you will get. While being "hunted", you are forced to decide wether to run or hide. Hiding is a great option when there are props everywhere to hide yourself in. If you have no place to hide, well ♥♥♥♥. You can try to crouch your way around the monster, or you can YOLO and sprint but have to remember that he can hear footsteps. When you are at these spots where the monster can be around every corner, you will be in corridors, light or dark, with very dark, distorted, music. Leaving what horror is supposed to be about. The suspense. The suspense this game gives you is nerve-wracking. I was in so much suspense playing this game, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when someone made a Skype call. What part I love about the gameplay is that they will have rooms that are for puzzles and gaining your sanity back so you can go back in and get scared again. Kind of reminds me of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.\nNext, the graphics. Who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the graphics?\nThe last part will be the custom stories. SOME people can make GREAT custom stories. I have played a lot of custom stories and all of them are unique in their own way, either making it for a great story, made to scare people, or just to have some fun with you and your friends. Some custom stories were even more scary than the original story. Want to play Amnesia but don't want to play the real story? No problem just slap a custom story in your files and play away! For those who want to play a custom but do not know how to install them, this video should help you. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXvRzHxngE\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a great game for so many reasons. This game is a great game to buy when on sale and it is on sale a lot. Close this review, get on the store and buy a copy of Amnesia right away........

Right when the game makes you think you are safe, it throws a enemy around the corner or near you so when you walk around collecting tinder boxes you suddenly come up to a beautiful (Sarcasm) chap with a huge mouth and a claw that says "This is going to hurt". You cannot defend yourself which adds to the fear factor and you have to use the darkness itself to hide from your enemies, not many video games can say they are scary, but Amnesia can say it with Pride.\n\nAmnesia is one of the only games that actually made me vomit with fear.","December 10, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I stand by that assessment. I tried to play through it two years ago; I got an hour into the game, saw one of the monsters, and hid in a closet (in the game) until it went away. I decided to take a break and come back to the game a little later. Two years later I finally came back to the game and I have finished it!\n\nAmnesia is scary not through jump scares and carefully scripted events, but through the oppressive and tense atmosphere that is constantly pressing in on you. This is the kind of scary that really affects me, because I tend to psyche myself up more than any scripted events will. It also means that you will only be scared if you let yourself become immersed in the environment; this is why I played in a dark room, alone, with headphones on whenever possible.\n\nYou play as Daniel, who wakes up in an old Prussian castle with no memories of who he is. You soon find a note to yourself that kind of explains the situation. Apparently there is a bad man named Alexander in the bowels of the castle, and you have to go down there and kill him. There is also a Shadow hunting you, breaking down reality; you cannot fight it, your only choice is to run and hide.\n\nLighting plays a critical role in this game. Not only does it determine how far you can see, but if you spend too much time in the darkness Daniel will start to lose his sanity, and then you can't trust the things he sees. To combat this you can light candles in the environment with tinderboxes and you can use your lantern. You have to be careful not to use too many tinderboxes or oil though, which adds another layer of tension.\n\nYou can get sanity back by solving puzzles and progressing through the game. Most of the puzzles force you to explore and find items in areas that you would probably rather avoid.\n\nIt took me seven and a half hours to complete the game. I am glad that it wasn't longer, because by the end I was starting to recognize the mechanics underlying the puzzles and monsters, and I was having trouble immersing myself as much as I had in the beginning.\n\nObviously if you don't enjoy scary movies you won't want to pick this game up, but if you do I highly recommend Amnesia: the Dark Descent. It is well worth the $20 price tag.","September 15, 2013","true","15.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Hiding is a good strategy. Darkness is your best friend, but also your biggest threat.\n\nAlright, these were a few out-of-review sentences, now something about the game itself:\n\nAmnesia doesn't have a really epic graphic, but it really makes out for the atmosphere, wchich is by far purely amazing. The well-made audio cover also adds to the horror-style.\nGame uses the mechanic of "Sanity meter" - if you lose it all, you'll fall on the ground and will be unable to move for a few seconds. Standing in darkness for too long or looking at monsters will make your sanity drop pretty fast. There's also a health meter. Your main light source will be a lantern and tinderboxes.\nOur horror runs perfectly without any problems, but I encountered a few glitches (falling through the floor, missing models), although these aren't really annoying and won't happen too often. The monsters' AI is good, but not perfect. They sometimes bug on doors / walls or ignore all sounds. The storyline can be a little bit confusing, but if you collect all the puzzles and match them, then you'll understand it.\nThere is also an option to play custom stories (fan-made bonus stories, you can download them on Mod DB, for example), which really extends the fun of playing.\n\nNow everything what I said in short words.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing atmosphere\n-Scary monsters\n-Good storyline\n-Well-made audio cover\n-Neverending fun (Including main story and fan-made custom stories)\n\nCons:\n-Bugs 'n' glitches\n-Can be too confusing in a few times\n-Not everyone may like this concept of game\n\nPersonal rating: A great classical horror, which should be in every horror lover's library.\nTraditional rating: 9/10, greatly recommended","January 28, 2015","true","42.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

A worthy successor to Frictional Game's stellar Penumbra series, Amnesia keeps you watching your back and questioning yourself every time you go to open a door.  The gameplay is entertaining with its puzzles yet frightening as you play as our hero, Daniel, with no means of self defense.  The story is intriguing and keeps you motivated to solve puzzles and keep your sanity as you venture further into the deep walls of the Castle Brennenburg.\n\nExtra Content:\nNot only did the team at Frictional Games create a free expansion for Amnesia called Amnesia: Justine, but the game contains a Custom Story function. This allows you to play countless community-made Amnesia Stories once you've installed them through Steam, Desura, or manually from ModDB.  The gameplay value is huge.\n\nConclusion:\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is one of my personal favorite Horror Games of all time.  From the beautifully detailed castle environments to the immersive atmosphere and story, this is one game that horror fans won't want to pass up.","August 13, 2015","true","34.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualex/recommended/57300/","Qualex","Qualex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualex/","63 products in account","Okay. Where to begin? First of all, this game is scary. VERY scary. But not the sort of scary that you see in modern horror like when you turn around and the monster's appeared right behind you and a loud noise plays sort of scary. It relies more on stealth, and the fear comes from the anticipation of being found by the monster(s). Also, add in that if you hide in the darkness too long you start going mad and hallucinating all sorts of awful things, it becomes just that much more tense. Second of all, the story is AMAZING. It's not like the sort of story where you walk down straight corridors and it's explained to you in cutscenes. Oh no. You have to look around the castle for notes that explain the story, but not in order. You will find one note that explains the nature of your friendship with Alexander in Castle Brenenburg, then you will find a note some levels afterward that explains why you went to castle Brenenburg in the first place. Oh, and if you avoid hunting down the notes, you will be very confused towards the end. And as incentive to hunt down these notes, they restore the player's sanity (if I remember correctly). Thirdly, the graphics. While they may not be the highest resolution or highest poly, the castle and everything in it looks damn good. The best part of all was the lighting. The devs clearly knew how different forms of lighting affects the human mind, making a simple shower room look like a gateway into hell. That is, until you bring up your lantern or use a tinderbox. All in all, this is probably the best horror game. Ever. Better than F.E.A.R., or Slender: The Eight Pages, or any of those countless horror flash games on the web. While in those games, you simply walk from point A to B and watch jumpscares happen in cutscenes, in Amnesia, you will feel like you are Daniel, and you will understand his motivations and his many flaws, and you will feel in peril during the entire game. 10/10","March 16, 2014","true","21.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But instead buckle in with your kids for a fun-filled family shooting game in the vein of Wii Sports and Mario Kart. You play as Daniel, a man who is lost in the castle looking for his Princess, Alexander. This game is definitely taking gay rights and marriage equality to new heights by introducing young children to this matter. Unfortunately, your princess is in another castle (or sanctum) and so you have to defeat Bowsers new plucky goons, the Duckfaces, along with the Creakarms in order to find him. There are various fun puzzles you have to complete, such as redirecting water in the sewer to get a silly man to stay quiet and stop disturbing the eco-system. All in all it teaches kids fantastic modern values and is not only ahead of its time in terms of content but also in gameplay.\n\nIt is the first family game since Freddi Fish to allow users to make their own custom stories. Maybe you need to teach your kids the value of honesty and kindness? Valve is way ahead of you with its custom story Justine, but you can design your own with the knowledge of scripting and programming! Forget robots, Amnesia is the future.\n\nI was personally disappointed with the lack of female characters but understandably, Ubisoft is to blame.\n\n11/10 game, definitely start with your kids young.","August 25, 2014","true","59.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","6","8","9","0"

The phantom screams and creaking could get to you, yet after a while you realized there was nothing there. So, imo it is a sespencful puzzle game with a very good story, that is not given to you directly.

These days, games that carry the title are much less about horror and more about things jumping out at you for a cheap scare. Even the survival aspect is often pushed to the back burner in favor of making an easier game accessible to a more general audience. As a result survival-horror fans are getting action games with a few scary moments shoved down their throats. Amnesia isn't like that. Amnesia focuses on three things: atmosphere, survival, and, above all else, horror. Before players start the game, a warning is given that the game should not be played to win. It should be played to allow one's self to be absorbed into the world of Amnesia. Those that follow this advice will be in for the ride of their life. From the very beginning of the game, Amnesia's immersive and completely unsettling world will have you questioning if that sound is something moving, or if you're just going insane. You'll be afraid to go around the next corner, lest something horrifying is there. But you won't be able to stop.With the recent release of the same development tool kit that the creators used to make the game, players can make their own stories. With a bit of creativity and just a bit of that sadistic love of horror, we'll be seeing good things come from Amnesia for a time to come.","January 27, 2014","true","12.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is still a stand alone masterpiece in the horror genre. When people think of horror games, Amnesia has never ceased to come to mind. This title has remained number one for years and with hardly any competition.\nThose whom try to mimic Amnesia's success need to understand that this games most effective feature in inducing fear are not the monsters, but the atmosphere. The way in which sound and darkness are combined is simply brilliant. Without it, the monsters would seem like they do in any other B grade survival horror title.\nThe game isn't all about running for your life, it has puzzle and exploration elements to keep you immersed in the eerie story.\nI am yet to see any game match Amnesia.

And it has just the right dosage of each trait because you keep wanting to play even though you get scared.

I managed it once, felt really good)!\n\nA testament of the game's scariness is in the fact that this is one of the very few games I played with a walkthrough open for almost the total duration of it, in order to anticipate the monsters' attacks (never did it before on games like Doom 3, Dead Space etc., where you could always blast any monster away with your super guns), such is the feeling of fear Amnesia emanates (the Prison level has to be one of the most scary and dark levels ever!).\n\nAssisting this scary feature is also the game's darkness, a darkness unlike any other you have ever seen (tops even the one in Doom 3, though only by a little, since the protagonist's eyes adjust to the darkness when you are left with no light at all, much like it would happen in real life, quite an awesome feature) and which makes you really value the oil lamp and tinderboxes you are provided!\n\nEven your sanity is measured in the game, aside from your health, which increases the more you meet monsters and stay in the darkness!\n\nAs the game progresses and the pile of bricks amasses, you learn more and more about the castle's story and what happened to the protagonist in the way a true H.P. Lovecraft tribute should be, while (some of) your choices affect the game and can bring you up to 4 different endings!\n\nAs a final note, don't miss the game's free DLC, Amnesia: Justine, which features a 19th century "Saw"-like story. Seriously, it has everything to remind you of that: an abducted character that wakes up in a cell with no idea of when and what, a recorded phonograph with instructions from the abductor for his "game", the choice to save other abducted prisoners and alter your ending and a final great twist.\nOf course the horrid monsters that can chase and kill you on the spot are present, with still no (direct) means to kill them and, to make things more tense, there is also no way to save your progress in this DLC, but it's lifespan is short anyways.\n\nTo complete your experience, read the Amnesia: Remember short stories as well, also given for free with the game in a pdf file.\n\nI'll be sure to play the game's sequel someday, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, though I'll let quite some time pass first, to have the experience sink a bit more.\n\nFinal verdict: totally recommended for survival horror fans, especially those that want to try something different in the genre!","March 28, 2015","true","24.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

Instead of running through creepy environments with pistols and melee weapons, you're stuck with nothing but a lantern in Amnesia: the Dark Descent. This game forces you to be defenseless against the many horrific creatures within the Castle Brennenburg and because of this, you must utilize stealth-like strategies in order to bypass the monsters. On paper, the gameplay is bare-boned and easy, but what really hits the player hard is the looming fear of the unknown. Unless you've watched youtube videos or seen someone else play this game, you are going in unprepared for an environment that is unfamiliar. You are more likely to fear that which you do not see rather than what is evident.\n- The story is somewhat clever, however your only connection to the story is through multiple notes you find throughout the levels and several scripted flashbacks.\n- The game's strongest point is its emphasis on a consistently claustrophobic and dark atmosphere. This is also strengthened by the quality of sounds used within this game as they are top-notch and  fit perfectly within the stone-walled and echoey castle. Along with this, the soundtrack is absolutely fear-inducing and befitting for the environment presented.\n- The game's weakest point is some of the puzzle mechanics. Most of the puzzles do not require much thought to figure out, however, some can take longer than others and have a tendency to frustrate the player and draw them out of game's intended experience/atmosphere. There have been moments where I'd spend large amounts of time backtracking to find something that I may have missed.\n\nI purchased this game a long while back around when it first came out and have played through it multiple times along with player-made mods (some of which are even scarier) both solo and with groups. What I have found this game to be is the bar at which other survival horrors must meet in order to emphasize true quality in the genre. This is one game that I can always bring up in a conversation about video games since it really blurs the line between fantasy and reality.","January 15, 2014","true","54.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are no guns or other weapons of any kind. It's just you, locked in a creepy castle, doing whatever you can to survive to the end... which usually involves hiding and trying not to soil your pants too much. As a fan of old-school adventure games from the dawn of the genre, I very much appreciated this new modern take on things. The game has gotten lots of buzz since its release, and all of the praise is well-deserved, especially for such a small developer. If you like horror, mysteries and/or adventure games (and don't mind being scared out of your wits too much), Amnesia is a no-brainer.

What is scarier than running around and fighting the hordes of hell or zomies, with a big gun? I'll tell you. Running around with no weapons and no way to fight back in a decrepit castle with monsters chasing you as you unravel a past so horrible your character drank a drink to forget it all. THAT is scary. Ok now seriously, this is a thrilling game. The atmosphere of the castle is awesome, getting darker and creepier the further you go. I'm not going to ruin the story, but lets just say you never see the twist coming. This game is literally a dark descent as you go from the main floor of a castle and travel deeper and lower into a nightmarish experience. Another dynamic is that you have to stay sane while making your poor character go through all this. From the makers of the Penumbra series (don't worry I'll review that soon, good game) this is a HUGE leap forward in terms of story and scares.

We all know that this one is an eerie and scary adventure but playing through it completely (yes, finally I was that brave) I realized that  what makes this title so great and special is it's immersion. There are few as immersive titles on the market as this one. Visually as well as audio wise, this one is hard to match as it manages to absorb the player in it's world and story. Looking back however, Amnesia is a linear adventure which gives the illusion of freedom by letting one explore areas at the pace one sees fit.","December 20, 2012","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It has some of that, but the real scares are pretty varied and unpredictable, and the bulk of the game is actually progressed with puzzles. Overall I'd rate it a solid 4.5/5.

We all know that this one is an eerie and scary adventure but playing through it completely (yes, finally I was that brave) I realized that  what makes this title so great and special is it's immersion. There are few as immersive titles on the market as this one. Visually as well as audio wise, this one is hard to match as it manages to absorb the player in it's world and story.

The insanity meter and monster evasion tactics necessary to survive make the game truly terrifying when trapped in a tight spot, though the monster variety and frequency of the main game I feel could have improved a bit. The addition of custom stories and smaller additional campaigns, however, solves this issue by adding a ton variety with numerous different scenarios to the to the mix.

That there is no combat further reinforces the player's vulnerability and encourages you to play intelligently to survive. Play it with friends for a fun time.

Squeamish players should not, I repeat SHOULD NOT read all of the books and notes inside the torture chambers.  Human beings are horrifying creatures, and the game references actual historical torture practices and devices.  While none of the acts are shown on-screen, all of the "pre-recorded" sounds are there alongside the in-depth descriptions of what was done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkeymaster/recommended/57300/","funkeymaster","smol fluttering bug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkeymaster/","80 products in account","So, a lot of people call this game "the scariest game they've ever played", and go on and on about the scariness, but I am evidence that it is totally possible to play this game without really being scared! Most of the "horror" of this game is just gross things (read: fleshy things) in dark rooms, which isn't really horrifying, it's just... gross stuff in dark rooms, and if that's not something that bothers you, then you'll be just fine in this game. Honestly, Daniel (the main character) is much, much more freaked out than I am! If you play this with the idea that it's a video game, and play it the same way you'd play any other video game, then it's more fun than scary! It has a cool back story and very interesting puzzles, and interesting mechanics involving keeping Daniel's mental health from deteriorating by keeping him out of the dark (which he seems to be very afraid of), and from observing disturbing events. So this is not a game where you can just run from point a to point b, you really have to think and strategize about your movements and where you go/stand to keep Daniel in a functional state. It's pretty cool and I've not played anything quite like it before! Also, rather than fighting monsters, you have to make them go away, which is also quite interesting (though there were no monsters for the entire first hour of the game and that was a bit disappointing to me), by hiding in the dark, no less! And either action, getting too close to a monster, or hanging out in the dark, will lower Daniel's sanity, so it requires some careful planning and knowing when it will be okay to come out. As briefly mentioned earlier, the story is presented in a very cool way, Daniel gave himself amnesia at the beginning and you basically have it right along with him, as you obviously don't know anything that he used to know. And as the story unfolds its like unravelling a mystery. Very cool! I also found the game a bit educational, as it takes place in the 1800's and is faithful to the time period, so I was able to look up some of the objects that are in the game and learn about what they were. All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience for me, so I give it a full recommendation! I didn't find it as scary as most people seem to, but I enjoy the gameplay and find it to be a very unique experience. I've had a lot of fun!","September 18, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The scariest, in fact, that I have come across. You play as Daniel in this Survival Horror game, who wakes up in a castle with no memory of how he got there (bing! title!).\n\nUnlike horror games such as F.E.A.R, where you can defend yourself against monsters; here, you have no means of fighting back. It's a frightening game of hide-and-seek. And the fear trickles in, it doesn't reveal everything straight away, so the anticipation of running into a monster really eats away at you.\n\nIt's not just your health that you have to keep track of, but your sanity. If you remain in the dark too long, or look at something that doesn't make any rational sense, your sanity starts to deplete. This makes your screen blurry, and your controls less responsive, making for a harder experience. Thankfully, you've got a lantern and can find oil and tinderboxes along the way to keep you in the light.\n\nThe story is actually compelling, the gothic artstyle is perhaps outdated now, but fits the game perfectly. You may quit due to fear and frustration from the few puzzles you come across, but this is definitely worth pushing through to reach the end, where there are some rather confronting torture chambers.","May 17, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is decent as well.\n\nOverall I would recommend the Amnesia games if you enjoy horror, mystery and adventure.  There is definately a time to be had in any Amnesia game, mod or spinoff.","September 15, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I give it an 8.5 out of 10 I would rate it higher but there is a lack of monster types and the endings give this a lower score.","February 8, 2014","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nowadays there are a lot games that are as scary or scarier than Amnesia The Dark Descent.\n\nEven though (or maybe because) Amnesia uses an older engine it creates a pretty eerie environment. Because you can't fight creatures and only uses a lantern (with limited light), the story and narration is pretty well done. The game is filled with weird sounds and torture devices, also your character will get scared if it's either too dark or ghouls are near. Because of this the game keeps you on edge the entire time\n\nReally recommended for the horror lovers out there.","October 3, 2011","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkeymaster/recommended/57300/","funkeymaster","smol fluttering bug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkeymaster/","80 products in account","So, a lot of people call this game "the scariest game they've ever played", and go on and on about the scariness, but I am evidence that it is totally possible to play this game without really being scared! Most of the "horror" of this game is just gross things (read: fleshy things) in dark rooms, which isn't really horrifying, it's just... gross stuff in dark rooms, and if that's not something that bothers you, then you'll be just fine in this game. Honestly, Daniel (the main character) is much, much more freaked out than I am! If you play this with the idea that it's a video game, and play it the same way you'd play any other video game, then it's more fun than scary! It has a cool back story and very interesting puzzles, and interesting mechanics involving keeping Daniel's mental health from deteriorating by keeping him out of the dark (which he seems to be very afraid of), and from observing disturbing events. So this is not a game where you can just run from point a to point b, you really have to think and strategize about your movements and where you go/stand to keep Daniel in a functional state. It's pretty cool and I've not played anything quite like it before! Also, rather than fighting monsters, you have to make them go away, which is also quite interesting (though there were no monsters for the entire first hour of the game and that was a bit disappointing to me), by hiding in the dark, no less! And either action, getting too close to a monster, or hanging out in the dark, will lower Daniel's sanity, so it requires some careful planning and knowing when it will be okay to come out. As briefly mentioned earlier, the story is presented in a very cool way, Daniel gave himself amnesia at the beginning and you basically have it right along with him, as you obviously don't know anything that he used to know. And as the story unfolds its like unravelling a mystery. Very cool! I also found the game a bit educational, as it takes place in the 1800's and is faithful to the time period, so I was able to look up some of the objects that are in the game and learn about what they were. All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience for me, so I give it a full recommendation! I didn't find it as scary as most people seem to, but I enjoy the gameplay and find it to be a very unique experience. I've had a lot of fun!","September 18, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

And this game is good!\n\nI don't scare or startle from games and this game was no different but it was still an extremely immersive experience. I had no idea what to expect going in and that actually added to the fun. The effects and simple yet smooth graphics are enough to pull you in visually. The sound is superb. And the gameplay brings it all together perfectly. Just a great atmosphere altogether. When enjoyed in the dark with a headset with no clue what you're doing this game can certainly get your heart racing.\n\nYou're stuck in an abandoned castle with nothing but a lantern with limited oil to burn and a few welcoming tips such as how the sanity system works and that the rare light sources in the game are your friend. The narrative unfolds through startled memories triggered by interactions with certain items, entering certain rooms, and notes found throughout the castle. The voice work is top notch and adds feeling to the story. Progression is made by doing some basic puzzles, exploring for items, and of course running away as fast as you can the second anything makes a noise or moves! There's a good sense of involvement finding the clues and making old machines work to progress to the next area.\n\nPlaying fairly cautiously I only died 3 or 4 times that I remember (one was scripted to advance the story) and finished the game quicker than I would have liked. I thought there were some clever puzzles but never anything overly challenging. Then I was quite disappointed in the anti-climatic ending, that while presented some ending options, did not present a challenge of any kind. I think this game could have used one last puzzle challenge to make it feel a little more rewarding.\n\nBut regardless of any minor negatives this was a fun little game that I got in a Humble Bundle somewhere along the line so it was absolutely worth it. Though I will say I was surprised to just look up and see a $19.99US regular price. Wait for a discount for sure, but do take it for a whirl.","December 10, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mowry as Alexander)\n+ The well-developed physics engine allows for some entertaining puzzles and interaction with the environment\n+ Some good lighting effects help to punctuate the necessity of keeping out of the dark.\n\n\nNegative\n- Some poor gameplay mechanics: most notably the sanity system, which only sets out to hinder your progress rather than immerse you into the game; and even when I liberally used the lantern throughout the game, I was never close to running out of oil nor tinderboxes\n- While the game does manage to retain a fearful atmosphere for the most part, in actuality there are only around 5 or so enemies that can actually harm/kill you, which makes the possibility of death inconsequential and reduces the overall ‘scariness’ of the game\n\n\nVerdict\n“Amnesia: The Dark Descent does manage to effectively replicate a scary atmosphere and tell a good story, which many gamers have recognised. However, the game would have been much better suited in another format (most notably a book), as it seems that--in its current form--it is more of an interactive story than an actual game. Nevertheless, the overwhelmingly unnerving experience alone is worth a playthrough.”\n\n7/10 TJBs","January 24, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/57300/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary – Amnesia is an “immersive horror” game with emphasis on creepy atmosphere and puzzle solving. Don’t go in expecting an action packed fight for survival. If you don’t enjoy running from enemies and sneaking around in the dark, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nYou play a man named Daniel in the 1800’s who has chosen to erase his own memory, and wake up in an unfamiliar deserted castle, looking for a way out. Unfortunately, the only way out is to descend into the cursed innards of the castle as your sanity slowly drains away. As you progress, you find notes and diary pages detailing some of the events which have led to your current circumstances. The darkness is not your only enemy.\n\nThe game is played in first person perspective and while this is familiar to most gamers, keep in mind that you cannot fight enemies. All you can do is run and hide if you run into a monstrosity in the halls. To make matters worse you don’t just have limited health, you also have limited sanity, which is drained by witnessing disturbing events (objects moving on their own or unworldly environments) or by standing too long in the darkness. When you are unfortunate enough to run into a monster, don’t just run and hide, don’t even look at it. The more you look at a monster the more likely it is to become aware of your presence. Yeah, the monsters aren’t really roaming the halls chasing after intruders, but if they notice you, they’ll definitely squash you.\n\nAs mentioned before, a large part of the game is puzzle solving, such as trying to unlock new areas to advance by manipulating levers or mixing ingredients together in your limited inventory. If you’re used to games spelling out mission objectives or quests, you’re going to have a hard time.\n\nPros:\n+Immersive game story with some genuinely tense and terrifying sequences (water monster…)\n+Some challenging puzzles to get your brain working\n\nCons:\n-The game can be frustrating since the solutions to a lot of the puzzles are not obvious, and you have the added pressure of working in the darkness under threat from monsters.\n\nOverall, the game is not for everyone but if you like games such as Outlast, you should enjoy the horror element of Amnesia. Just bear in mind that the puzzle solving can be a real pain for first time players.\n","December 30, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Atmosphere - The atmosphere is very tense. The game takes place in dark old castle, which appears empty (oh it is not :D). Authors made the sounds very frightening and whole game makes you feel like something is following you - you may just get very paranoid.\n2. The Unknown - Why am i here? Who... or what is after me? WTF WAS THAT SOUND? thats the questions that will be very slowly answered.\n3. Defenslessness - You just have no way to fight back, your only option is to hide. Enemies are uncommon in this game, which just makes their encounter surprising and scary and relies on your quick reaction.\n\nWorth a try, but note, that this game is focused on story. Reading long notes is big part of the game - some takes you to flashback and some will hint you the solution to some puzzles, you will find along the way. There are no weapons, you will not be killing anyone in this game. They, however, may kill you :P.\n\n8/10, you will never visit any castles ever again.","September 14, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/57300/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Why am I writing this up? It's Amnesia. It's the game that everyone points to first when someone asks "What's a scary game?" People that have never played it recommend it to people who will buy it and never play it. What am I even doing here?\n\nThe truth is, I needed a reason to revisit this one. I'm a terribly jumpy person and genuinely scary games can wear me out good. The first time I played Amnesia, I never even made it to a monster. I knew I needed to give it another go and this was the perfect time to do it. And while I was playing, a thought occurred to me. Amnesia's been around for years at this point. How does it hold up in a post-Alien: Isolation world?\n\nAmnesia casts you, unsurprisingly, as an amnesiac in a drafty old castle back in the 1800s. You soon find a missive from yourself, assuring you that you didn't want those memories anyway and there's someone in the castle you really ought to kill. As you begin exploring the darkened, crumbling halls, you find that there are other residents of the castle that are none too pleased to see you. There's no fighting in this one, it's pure stealth or fleeing. The cornerstone of Amnesia's gameplay, much like Penumbra before it, is sanity. Looking at monsters, seeing freaky things happening, and being in the dark make you lose sanity. Of course, if you stand there in front of a torch, the things that want to turn your insides into outsides will have an easy time spotting you. Encounters with monsters are all about balancing your stealthy skulking against your dwindling sanity, which is only restored by progressing through the game. It's a finite resource system like food in Lone Survivor, and works to layer urgency on top of your horror. I must admit it's a bit of a bother here though, because it puts some irritating visual effects on you when it gets terribly low.\n\nThe sanity effects are about the only misstep in the aesthetics, though. The graphics still hold up and manage to be rich and varied while still maintaining the dark, oppressive atmosphere. The level design is simple but effective, sending you through lavish halls and crumbling cellars and stranger places still, pacing out the frights and creatures. The big standout here though is the sound design. There is a lot more going on here than in most games, with your character making all sorts of breathing sounds and whimpers, footsteps for everyone being accurate to the surface that produces them, and even light sources making their own realistic ambient sounds. The castle itself is full of creepy sounds as well, most being apropos of nothing, but that just makes it all the more effective when it DOES signal something.\n\nI was very pleased with the pacing of the game, and found it had little to no contrivances to get you where it wanted you to be. Enemy encounters are infrequent enough to keep you on edge when they're not around, and absolutely terrify you when they are. Dealing with them is obviously less involved than in Alien: Isolation but much more free-form than, say, Outlast. I could see some of the terror being lost if you have to repeat certain sections a few times, but the game is balanced well enough with pacing and items that it shouldn't be a concern unless you're really trying to pull back the curtain for yourself.\n\nTo my surprise, I found myself getting scared more often with this than in Alien. For me, Alien is much more about constant tension and the battle of wits with the xenomorph, whereas Amnesia is more about the terror of being helpless and confused. Not many games have managed to pull off the powerless protagonist angle without it becoming grating, but Amnesia owns it. Simple sounds and sudden visual effects will chill you to the bone, not as cheap jump scares but as payoffs to the incredible atmosphere the game maintains at all times. I feel confident in saying that no matter how far the genre progresses, Amnesia will always have a place of honor among the games that truly terrify.","September 15, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Gameplay involves solving puzzles, exploring, avoiding monsters and other obstacles. The game is in first-person perspective and with the lighting and soundtrack gives you a constant sense of foreboding. The plot is pretty intersting, though slow to unfold and the game has a Custom Story gamemode, which looks interesting. I played the original story mode and as the game suggested, I turned the lights down and put on a set of headphones, which enhanced the immersiveness in the game. There are DLC packs for this game, some of them are fan-made. Visually, while creepy it does look like a 5-year-old game, so if you are expecting state of the art graphics you will be disappointed, still it is well done and fun to play, worth the low price.","September 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I say this because I can't really think of many other games that are so masterfully atmospheric. Yes the game is scary, hur da dur everyone knows that. What I love so much about Dark Descent is that its scares are not just cheap jump scares and sensationalist set pieces. It is intelligent in how it goes about scaring you, resorting to audio and a dynamic between light and dark to really bring you in. Amnesia will make you feel terror in a very raw sense that few other games can come close to. Amnesia is a hallmark of the horror genre and arguable a hallmark of video games alltogether.","October 11, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole dark atmosphere and the fact that there is always something lurking around the corner is very paranoia inducing. There is also the fact that there is absolutely NO way to defend yourself; running away and hiding is the only key to survival. Keeping your sanity, as well as your health, is a big factor in gameplay. Your character suffers from nyctophobia (the fear of darkness) which, as a result, causes your character to go insane when staying in the darkness for a prolonged amount of time. This sets a new difficulty for playing the game as you are easier to detect and movement becomes much harder while in this state. However, staying in light sources will make it easier for them to find you...\n\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrill, alone or with friends. I also suggest playing in darkness with a headset on for maximum effects.

I really loved Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has "Horror-Survival" are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead (even if I love this game too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that's all. In Amnesia, you run and hide, the only answer to the encounter between you and a monster is to escape. The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy. This is one of the game I will remember all my life as a game of quality.\n\nThe game worths more than it's original price.

These are just some of the numerous bugs and glitches found in this game.\n\nThe options menu is kinda good and it runs decent on bad computers. But one problem is that the gamma settings are for the entire system which means that if you have 2 monitors and put the gamma on the highest setting, the other monitor will look terrible.\n\nBut the bugs aside this is about the best survival horror game you can find as I'm typing this. The first person view and making you not be able to fight back make this game really tense and scary if you are in a situation where the monster spots you and you must run. The environment, ambience and of course the soundtrack is mostly what makes the game scary. It's not actually the monster itself that is so scary, it's the premonition of him being around every corner you see that makes the game scary.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game to people that liked Outlast because of the similarities and also to people that just enjoy being scared.","June 22, 2012","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A collection of five short stories set in the world of Amnesia, written by Mikael Hedberg and illustrated by the game's concept artists, was also made available.\nIn addition, the game's soundtrack is available for purchase and a free content expansion called "Justine" has been released as well as many fan-made expansions and stories.\n\nGameplay:\nIn a similar vein to the developer's previous games, Amnesia is an adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The game retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery.\nFew in-game objects are operated by toggle; to open a door, for instance, the player must hold down a mouse button and then push (or pull) the mouse. This gives the player stealth, allowing them to peek out a barely-opened door or open it slowly to sneak away, but also adds to the player's sense of helplessness, as it is now entirely possible to attempt to push open a "pull" door whilst danger approaches from behind.\nIn addition to a health indicator, the player's sanity must be managed.\nBeing in darkness too long, witnessing unsettling events, or staring at monsters will reduce their sanity, causing visual and auditory hallucinations and drawing the attention of monsters. Light sources help restore sanity, and if none are available the player may use tinderboxes to ignite candles in wall sconces and candelabra, or deploy an oil-burning lantern found near the beginning of the game.\nHowever, the number of tinderboxes and the amount of oil available are both limited, and standing in a light source also makes the player more noticeable to monsters. The player must balance the amount of time they spends in light and shadow. Sanity is fully restored once the player completes an objective or progresses the game's story.\n\nIf a monster spots the player, it will chase it until it's out of sight. If spotted, the player must flee, as Amnesia does not give the player access to weapons. The player must then find hiding places or barricade doors with rocks, chairs and other obstacles; however, monsters are capable of tearing down doors in their path and kicking obstacles out of the way, and move extremely fast once they have spotted their prey.\nMonsters who lose sight of the player will search for them for a time, but will eventually leave and vanish.Players can also choose to hide in the shadows, at cost of sanity, since the main character ironically enough suffers from Nyctophobia (severe fear of the dark).\n\nStory:\nIn late August 1839, Daniel, a young man from London, awakens in the dark halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with little to no memory about himself or his past.\nAll he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair and that something is hunting him. Shortly after awakening, Daniel discovers a note written to himself, from which he learns that he has deliberately erased his own memory, and that he needs to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle. There he must kill the baron, a man named Alexander.\nThe exploration of the dark depths of the castle (following a trail of pink liquid that he seems to have left for himself) is also a journey into his own erased past, as he discovers not only notes and his own journal entries, but experiences visions of past events that took place within the castle's countless chambers - including memories that are not his own.\nWhile Daniel unravels the mysteries of Brennenburg Castle, he also finds himself hunted by a dangerous unearthly presence that manifests itself as a corruption that is slowly covering the castle in fleshy, acidic growths.\nAs if this was not enough, baron Alexander has sent out his minions to find Daniel - bizarre, zombie-like monsters that are relentlessly hunting him.\nDaniel's only hope is to as quickly as possible reach the Sanctum, before he succumbs to either the monstrosities or his own damaged mind...\n\nMy opinions:\n\nI was first introduced to this game a couple of years ago, by a classmate who had downloaded it.\nHe was passing the time by playing it on a break in school and I was watching.\nAt the time I didn't think much of it and had not yet been introduced properly to the genre of horror-games.\nWhat I do remember, however, is that Amnesia: The Dark Descent was scary to play even whilst sitting in a fully lit room.\nMy friend - who was a bit of a coward - even hightened the gamma setting in the game, making it lighter (something I would not recommend unless you're a cheater). But even though he had hightened the lighting, we still got scared off our arses when the first jump-scares started to show up.\nBesides "Outlast" - which is another brilliant game available here on Steam - Amnesia: The Dark Descent remains in my top five of all horror-games I have ever played. Sure, it was developed with a much smaller budget and by an indie-studio, but that doesn't make it any less of a horrifying experience.\n\nI don't really have that much more to say about this game, except these simple guidelines:\n1. Buy it and download it.\n2. Play at night, preferably alone and using headphones.\n3. Turn off all lights and get ready to get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...","August 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in the 19th century Amnesia finds you journeying into the darkest recesses of a medieval castle without the aid of a firearm and punishes your character's very mind, making it difficult to navigate, if you stray a little too far from the light.","July 30, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole dark atmosphere and the fact that there is always something lurking around the corner is very paranoia inducing. There is also the fact that there is absolutely NO way to defend yourself; running away and hiding is the only key to survival. Keeping your sanity, as well as your health, is a big factor in gameplay. Your character suffers from nyctophobia (the fear of darkness) which, as a result, causes your character to go insane when staying in the darkness for a prolonged amount of time. This sets a new difficulty for playing the game as you are easier to detect and movement becomes much harder while in this state. However, staying in light sources will make it easier for them to find you...\n\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrill, alone or with friends. I also suggest playing in darkness with a headset on for maximum effects.

A collection of five short stories set in the world of Amnesia, written by Mikael Hedberg and illustrated by the game's concept artists, was also made available.\nIn addition, the game's soundtrack is available for purchase and a free content expansion called "Justine" has been released as well as many fan-made expansions and stories.\n\nGameplay:\nIn a similar vein to the developer's previous games, Amnesia is an adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The game retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery.\nFew in-game objects are operated by toggle; to open a door, for instance, the player must hold down a mouse button and then push (or pull) the mouse. This gives the player stealth, allowing them to peek out a barely-opened door or open it slowly to sneak away, but also adds to the player's sense of helplessness, as it is now entirely possible to attempt to push open a "pull" door whilst danger approaches from behind.\nIn addition to a health indicator, the player's sanity must be managed.\nBeing in darkness too long, witnessing unsettling events, or staring at monsters will reduce their sanity, causing visual and auditory hallucinations and drawing the attention of monsters. Light sources help restore sanity, and if none are available the player may use tinderboxes to ignite candles in wall sconces and candelabra, or deploy an oil-burning lantern found near the beginning of the game.\nHowever, the number of tinderboxes and the amount of oil available are both limited, and standing in a light source also makes the player more noticeable to monsters. The player must balance the amount of time they spends in light and shadow. Sanity is fully restored once the player completes an objective or progresses the game's story.\n\nIf a monster spots the player, it will chase it until it's out of sight. If spotted, the player must flee, as Amnesia does not give the player access to weapons. The player must then find hiding places or barricade doors with rocks, chairs and other obstacles; however, monsters are capable of tearing down doors in their path and kicking obstacles out of the way, and move extremely fast once they have spotted their prey.\nMonsters who lose sight of the player will search for them for a time, but will eventually leave and vanish.Players can also choose to hide in the shadows, at cost of sanity, since the main character ironically enough suffers from Nyctophobia (severe fear of the dark).\n\nStory:\nIn late August 1839, Daniel, a young man from London, awakens in the dark halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with little to no memory about himself or his past.\nAll he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair and that something is hunting him. Shortly after awakening, Daniel discovers a note written to himself, from which he learns that he has deliberately erased his own memory, and that he needs to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle. There he must kill the baron, a man named Alexander.\nThe exploration of the dark depths of the castle (following a trail of pink liquid that he seems to have left for himself) is also a journey into his own erased past, as he discovers not only notes and his own journal entries, but experiences visions of past events that took place within the castle's countless chambers - including memories that are not his own.\nWhile Daniel unravels the mysteries of Brennenburg Castle, he also finds himself hunted by a dangerous unearthly presence that manifests itself as a corruption that is slowly covering the castle in fleshy, acidic growths.\nAs if this was not enough, baron Alexander has sent out his minions to find Daniel - bizarre, zombie-like monsters that are relentlessly hunting him.\nDaniel's only hope is to as quickly as possible reach the Sanctum, before he succumbs to either the monstrosities or his own damaged mind...\n\nMy opinions:\n\nI was first introduced to this game a couple of years ago, by a classmate who had downloaded it.\nHe was passing the time by playing it on a break in school and I was watching.\nAt the time I didn't think much of it and had not yet been introduced properly to the genre of horror-games.\nWhat I do remember, however, is that Amnesia: The Dark Descent was scary to play even whilst sitting in a fully lit room.\nMy friend - who was a bit of a coward - even hightened the gamma setting in the game, making it lighter (something I would not recommend unless you're a cheater). But even though he had hightened the lighting, we still got scared off our arses when the first jump-scares started to show up.\nBesides "Outlast" - which is another brilliant game available here on Steam - Amnesia: The Dark Descent remains in my top five of all horror-games I have ever played. Sure, it was developed with a much smaller budget and by an indie-studio, but that doesn't make it any less of a horrifying experience.\n\nI don't really have that much more to say about this game, except these simple guidelines:\n1. Buy it and download it.\n2. Play at night, preferably alone and using headphones.\n3. Turn off all lights and get ready to get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...","August 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maddoggamer/recommended/57300/","maddoggamer","Phoenix Witch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maddoggamer/","8 products in account","This is an amazing horror game that builds up tension like Slender, has jump scares like Outlast, and an amazing story line such as The Last of Us. The game is actually based off of true legends of Castle Brennenburg in Poland, the setting of the game. Amnesia is deep, and has recently been labeled as one of the top horror games ever made.\nThe environment in this game is very fitting, and you can manipulate objects to your advantage. The monsters are creative and unique and the ambience is unbeatable. As you walk through castle Brennenburg, you can automatically tell that this was perfect for a horror story.\nThis game is not straight forward all of the time though. There are puzzles designed to challenge the player, while panicking in fear of the next monster. Each part of the game can be taken at the gamer's own pace, depending on if you are a cautious player, or the run-in-head-first player.\nAnother thing that is great about this game is that it does not shove plot into your face. You can choose to pick up the notes that are scattered around the castle, or ignore them to complete the game. There are bits though, that are crucial to the end of the game that are forced upon you. There is a total of two cut scenes, at the beginning and the end of the game; that is if you do not count the times you regain your memory. These are short, although quite frankly annoying and tedious.\nThe game in itself has removed most of the problems, but can get glitchy at some points. Occasionally, one of the monsters will get stuck in a wall or you will have troubles with some of the items, but are easy to ignore. Over all this game is perfect for any horror gamer, but should be avoided if you do not enjoy puzzles. The ending is not one you should miss, and will bring you about 10 hours of nerve-wracking gametime.","February 12, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say this because I can't really think of many other games that are so masterfully atmospheric. Yes the game is scary, hur da dur everyone knows that. What I love so much about Dark Descent is that its scares are not just cheap jump scares and sensationalist set pieces. It is intelligent in how it goes about scaring you, resorting to audio and a dynamic between light and dark to really bring you in. Amnesia will make you feel terror in a very raw sense that few other games can come close to.

The atmosphere in this game is amazing, from the castle setting to the superb audio and the constant fear of what you'll see around the next corner. I made sure to play this game mainly after dark with headphones and I am glad I did. It took me something like a year of on and off playing to finish the game, as playing the game  was mentally unsettling at times and difficult to garner the willpower to keep playing. That's OK though because that is exactly what I want from a horror game. There were many times when I squealed out loud in terror and even developed a bit of a sweat. I highly recommend this game and recommend playing at night with headphones for an optimal experience. This game makes me truely concerned of how horror games in VR are going to affect people.

Hiding for the sake of your life and sanity is the playstyle here during enemy encounters instead of shootin' 'em up like a bad motha*****.  You're  goin' get terrified, and your heart's goin' race at times...no exceptions. I thought the developers were sadistic with the way they were toying with my expectations and making me feel paranoid nearly the entire game...truth is, they're just competent.\n\nThe only downside to this game were the puzzles. For a survival horror game, the puzzles were pretty weak in the sense that they were fairly easy to figure out instead offering a good intellectual challenge. There was also nothing disturbing or terrifying about them. Thus, I found that the puzzles were interrupting the flow of the game. Examples of great puzzles done in horror games can be found in Silent Hill. You had to decipher hard, disturbing riddles written in blood for example. Compare that to tinkering with levers and engines in Amnesia. Yeah...\n\nThe story while not great, is servicable. It's fed to you in bits as you pick up notes and as the protaganist experiences flashbacks.  You also have multiple endings here as typical in survival horror games and, again, they're servicable but don't leave an impact on you after it's all over. At least it didn't for me.\n\nFortunately, the good by far outweighs the bad in Amnesia. When you play, follow the game's advice and concentrate on immersing yourself within the atmosphere because that is the main selling point of the game.\n\nI recommend this game to survival horror fans and gamers who want a thrilling, terrifying experience that doesn't rely on predictable, cheesy jump scares.","June 13, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As in you have to use your intelligence and quick thinking to beat the game. Mainly from running away from the enemies in the game. The game is weird, yet I enjoyed it. I don't have any issues with this game or any disappointments either.\n\nStory: The game is about a guy named Daniel, who has suffered from Amnesia and doesn't remember who he is or where he is. As you explore the mansion or castle, you discover weird secrets(notes) left behind by yourself. You encounter weird enemies and things throughout the game as you try to find your way out(I believe).","August 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole dark atmosphere and the fact that there is always something lurking around the corner is very paranoia inducing. There is also the fact that there is absolutely NO way to defend yourself; running away and hiding is the only key to survival. Keeping your sanity, as well as your health, is a big factor in gameplay. Your character suffers from nyctophobia (the fear of darkness) which, as a result, causes your character to go insane when staying in the darkness for a prolonged amount of time. This sets a new difficulty for playing the game as you are easier to detect and movement becomes much harder while in this state. However, staying in light sources will make it easier for them to find you...\n\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrill, alone or with friends. I also suggest playing in darkness with a headset on for maximum effects.

Venturing through the eerie dungeons gives you a sense of wonder and the urge to continue along the course. The game is scary but the storyline keeps pulling you back in, not allowing you to stop playing for more than a few hours.\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is special because of the fact that it does not give you great power. You can simply run and hide from any kind of creature that you encounter. You cannot fight back when being attacked, you merely die, and must come up with a way to outsmart your "opponent".  This game also affects "Daniel" the Character you are playing as. After the game carries on he begins to become insane, making it harder to perform simple tasks and in the process striking fear in your soul!\nI will say that this game is not like any others before it; in fact it will inspire the Horror Survival Genre forever. This is nearly the pinnacle of Horror games because it gives the gamer a sense of curiosity and does not allow itself to be forgotten very easily in your mind.\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the adrenaline rush of being scared and to anyone who loves a great mysterious story.\n","June 30, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A collection of five short stories set in the world of Amnesia, written by Mikael Hedberg and illustrated by the game's concept artists, was also made available.\nIn addition, the game's soundtrack is available for purchase and a free content expansion called "Justine" has been released as well as many fan-made expansions and stories.\n\nGameplay:\nIn a similar vein to the developer's previous games, Amnesia is an adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The game retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery.\nFew in-game objects are operated by toggle; to open a door, for instance, the player must hold down a mouse button and then push (or pull) the mouse. This gives the player stealth, allowing them to peek out a barely-opened door or open it slowly to sneak away, but also adds to the player's sense of helplessness, as it is now entirely possible to attempt to push open a "pull" door whilst danger approaches from behind.\nIn addition to a health indicator, the player's sanity must be managed.\nBeing in darkness too long, witnessing unsettling events, or staring at monsters will reduce their sanity, causing visual and auditory hallucinations and drawing the attention of monsters. Light sources help restore sanity, and if none are available the player may use tinderboxes to ignite candles in wall sconces and candelabra, or deploy an oil-burning lantern found near the beginning of the game.\nHowever, the number of tinderboxes and the amount of oil available are both limited, and standing in a light source also makes the player more noticeable to monsters. The player must balance the amount of time they spends in light and shadow. Sanity is fully restored once the player completes an objective or progresses the game's story.\n\nIf a monster spots the player, it will chase it until it's out of sight. If spotted, the player must flee, as Amnesia does not give the player access to weapons. The player must then find hiding places or barricade doors with rocks, chairs and other obstacles; however, monsters are capable of tearing down doors in their path and kicking obstacles out of the way, and move extremely fast once they have spotted their prey.\nMonsters who lose sight of the player will search for them for a time, but will eventually leave and vanish.Players can also choose to hide in the shadows, at cost of sanity, since the main character ironically enough suffers from Nyctophobia (severe fear of the dark).\n\nStory:\nIn late August 1839, Daniel, a young man from London, awakens in the dark halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with little to no memory about himself or his past.\nAll he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair and that something is hunting him. Shortly after awakening, Daniel discovers a note written to himself, from which he learns that he has deliberately erased his own memory, and that he needs to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle. There he must kill the baron, a man named Alexander.\nThe exploration of the dark depths of the castle (following a trail of pink liquid that he seems to have left for himself) is also a journey into his own erased past, as he discovers not only notes and his own journal entries, but experiences visions of past events that took place within the castle's countless chambers - including memories that are not his own.\nWhile Daniel unravels the mysteries of Brennenburg Castle, he also finds himself hunted by a dangerous unearthly presence that manifests itself as a corruption that is slowly covering the castle in fleshy, acidic growths.\nAs if this was not enough, baron Alexander has sent out his minions to find Daniel - bizarre, zombie-like monsters that are relentlessly hunting him.\nDaniel's only hope is to as quickly as possible reach the Sanctum, before he succumbs to either the monstrosities or his own damaged mind...\n\nMy opinions:\n\nI was first introduced to this game a couple of years ago, by a classmate who had downloaded it.\nHe was passing the time by playing it on a break in school and I was watching.\nAt the time I didn't think much of it and had not yet been introduced properly to the genre of horror-games.\nWhat I do remember, however, is that Amnesia: The Dark Descent was scary to play even whilst sitting in a fully lit room.\nMy friend - who was a bit of a coward - even hightened the gamma setting in the game, making it lighter (something I would not recommend unless you're a cheater). But even though he had hightened the lighting, we still got scared off our arses when the first jump-scares started to show up.\nBesides "Outlast" - which is another brilliant game available here on Steam - Amnesia: The Dark Descent remains in my top five of all horror-games I have ever played. Sure, it was developed with a much smaller budget and by an indie-studio, but that doesn't make it any less of a horrifying experience.\n\nI don't really have that much more to say about this game, except these simple guidelines:\n1. Buy it and download it.\n2. Play at night, preferably alone and using headphones.\n3. Turn off all lights and get ready to get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...","August 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in the 19th century Amnesia finds you journeying into the darkest recesses of a medieval castle without the aid of a firearm and punishes your character's very mind, making it difficult to navigate, if you stray a little too far from the light.","July 30, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games like Resident Evil are a lot of fun, but barely manage to scare me. Also, what's up with Slender being like the standard for a good horror game. Slender is scary once, the first time you see Slenderman. After that you're just wandering through the woods while the same guy chases you. It's good for a free horror game, yet some people think it's the scariest game ever, but it doesn't come close to Amnesia. Anyway, Amnesia scares you in so many ways. Not only are the enemies chasing you incredibly disturbing, there are lots of kind of less obvious, but incredibly scary, moments. Once I went into a room, saw a cage with a dead body in it hanging from the ceiling, and later when I returned to the room it was gone... The story is also very creepy if you pay attention to the notes you find. If you don't use an online guide, like me, the game will take you somewhere from 8-10 hours, but if you do use a guide then it shouldn't take longer than 5 or so. I actually liked their previous games, The Penumbra series, better than Amnesia in terms of gameplay, but Amnesia is much scarier.","January 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a grand story meant to be immersed in. It creates a decent immersion of psychological horror in tandem with an impressive artistic display. This is not something for people to "brave through, beat, and brag about". It even tells you in the opening screens. I see a lot of hate coming down on this game as well as praise. And I just see a sea of people who missed the point.\n\nFor those who liked it and missed the point, I suppose as long as you had fun I can't really argue. But at the same time you are singing the wrong praises. "Scariest game ever" is not what I would use to describe this.\n\nFor those who disliked it and missed the point, I see a lot of "I didn't even beat it" comments followed or preceded by "it wasn't even that scary". Once again I will refer you to the opening scene where it blatantly tells you it is not meant to be played to complete. And you also can't really be upset about buying it because even the description reads "A game about immersion, discovery and living through a nightmare".\n\nThose who DID get the point, whether they liked or disliked it, understood and either did or did not enjoy the story. And they have very valid arguments.\n\nNow for those who are looking into this game / have not played it, I would remind you to take great heed that this game is NOT meant to be the scariest game ever. It is meant to be a chilling but greatly immersive story. If you are looking for a great story where you can live through and make decisions of survival for the sake of learning what happens next, not knowing or even remotely caring when it will end. This is definitely the game for you.\n\nHowever if you came here looking for "THE SCARIEST GAME EVAR DOOD ZOMG !!!!1!1!!!1 I'M GONNA BEAT IT SO FAST BRO" Then you should probably just move along.","January 7, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An unshakeable feeling of being chased and even in the dingiest corners being constantly out in the open and exposed to danger. Hiding from monsters that more often than not aren't there, abusing every inch of your imagination, and when they are there delivering terrifying sequences of frantic escape slamming doors behind you and terrified hiding cowering into walls desperately trying not to be seen, having to balance attempts at avoiding them with your dwindling sanity in the dark. Leaping from box to box in a flooded room avoiding the invisible creature that waits in the water, and the panicked rush to safety when you inevitably slip and hear the splashing rapidly approaching behind you. Lighting, sanity and "flight not fight" mechanics that have impacted so much in the five years since its release, making it hard to imagine the horror landscape of the 2010s without it.

Even when you know that sound you heard in one room is nothing, but that corner that is silent is most likely more dangerous, you still get a bit nervous. Honestly, this is probably one of the best and scariest horror games out there. Most people love this game, and it is easy to see why. You will spend most of the gameplay solving puzzles, and half way through the game you will find yourself hiding from monsters a lot. Even so, there are a few curve balls thrown into the game to make it feel fresh. One of my favorite disturbing moments in the game was when I had to try to get away from an invisible water creature by throwing remains acrossed the room hoping that it would go after that instead of me. This game is disturbing, frightening, and chilling, with a great story to boot. Fans of the horror genre will love this game.","March 26, 2013","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Turning corners and opening doors become terrifying things. And I'm not scared that easily. This game was a lot of fun for me. I became addicted and played every night until I beat it.

The only way I could possibly describe the game once I finished was... Wow... Just wow... The game is probobly the example of what a horror game should be for all the indie creators and AAA developers out there. However, what does this game achieve in?\n\nTo start off, we must discuss the story. The story is what makes up a game for me as a gamer. Game has bad story, its a bad game. There has only been a handful of games that go against this, but even still, those handful don't match the rest. However, Amnesia's story is phenomenal and a lot darker then you anticipate. When I entered, I thought this game was going to have a very gothic story (which it did) but did not see the grisly scenes of torture coming up on the plot. Even if this is all told in flashbacks and distrubing hallucinations, it does not take away from the fact the story is messed up. YOU WILL REGRET TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU FORGOT. Daniel says to himself in the very beginning "I choose to forget" and you'll see why sure enough. To put it simply, do not doubt for a moment this game's story will get to you.\n\nOnto Gameplay, it's a straight through adventure with puzzles and terror thrown in the mix. The game is actually pretty open believe it or not, not Minecraft kind of open but a open where some of the rooms have little purpose but to be there. (Which is what I believe Amnesia: Machine for Pigs I lacking, but that's not the point). The castle is a fun place to explore and the puzzles why can have little things you might miss, truly are not frustrating. If you want a frustrating horror puzzle game, go to Anna:Extended Edition. While that was not a bad game at all, the puzzles get very annoying. Amnesia however masters the right balance of puzzles and terror and really make a good game out of it. Part of the gameplay as well, is as you might expect hiding, running, and screaming. I did not die much during the game, which is a good thing, but the moments I ran and hid sent chills rushing through my spine and got the adreniline pumping. However, I'll discuss that in scariness\n\nThe game is scary, every moment is scary, this game is the scariest game out there. You will not know what to expect, and some of the areas will truly scare you. I got scared several times and panicked at little and big things, the game's atmopshere really prepares you for this game. If you don't believe me, do the "immersion" the game discusses at the beginning and do just that. You will surely have a heart attack... (I suggest calling 911 before playing the game, so in the eight minutes that it takes for them to arrive, you'll have to wait little)\n\nThe last thing I need to discuss is the Audio and Graphics. The graphics look great, I have to say, maybe not what everyone else seems to find "great" these days but they are good. There were only two moments where I got a buggy graphic or thought "They could have made this better" but truly its good. The game was also made in 2010 when we still were just starting to improve graphics, so I have no complaints. The Audio however is what is really important to discuss, the Audio is what makes the game scary. The whole game I played with headphones, though it made me cower in fear and suffer serious mental issues, I don't regret a thing. There is a certain thing that the game does with it's audio, that just makes it so good. You don't even need a screen for some of the audio to send shivers down your spine. It sticks with you far after the game is done and when you hear that Grunt or Brute's cry of anger you will fear for your life.\n\nOverall, the game is excellent. Do not miss out on this game. It is one of the best game I have ever played in my life and sure as heck the best horror game.\n\nStory 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nScariness 10/10\nGraphic & Audio 9/10\nOverall: 9/10","June 28, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptical about the mechanics (no weapons? what!?) but they are the key to the terror of this game. In any other scary game, you can just whip out a plasma cannon to destroy the things that scare you. In this game, all you can do is cower in fear and hide. This key mechanic, whereby you are rewarded for hiding raises the fear levels unlike anything I have ever played. When you round a corner in some dank, dark castle sub-floor and hear an inhuman growl, I guarantee you will soil your pants. The game itself oozes atmosphere, and it even encourages you to play in the dark with headphones on. This game is absolute ART that will TERRIFY you. I tell people all the time, "Amnesia makes Dead Space feel like a walk through a sunny, butterfly-filled meadow." There were literally moments where I had to step away from it to gather myself, it is THAT SCARY.

In fact, I'm doing a series of highlights videos on my Youtube channel where I'm playing through this pretty much completely blind. I'm not picking up any notes or journals or diaries; I'm not reading anything, and I'm still having a blast with it when I'm wandering around not knowing what to do. I guess that's just another great thing about this game; they managed to make a coherent story using only flashbacks, so that even without reading any of the important stuff I still kind of know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm even looking forward to finishing this first playthrough so I can go back on my own and read everything up, pick up all the details I missed and see how much that changes the story.\n\nThis is the first part of my series if you want to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp4ucw3dOaw","April 10, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games like Resident Evil are a lot of fun, but barely manage to scare me. Also, what's up with Slender being like the standard for a good horror game. Slender is scary once, the first time you see Slenderman. After that you're just wandering through the woods while the same guy chases you. It's good for a free horror game, yet some people think it's the scariest game ever, but it doesn't come close to Amnesia. Anyway, Amnesia scares you in so many ways. Not only are the enemies chasing you incredibly disturbing, there are lots of kind of less obvious, but incredibly scary, moments. Once I went into a room, saw a cage with a dead body in it hanging from the ceiling, and later when I returned to the room it was gone... The story is also very creepy if you pay attention to the notes you find. If you don't use an online guide, like me, the game will take you somewhere from 8-10 hours, but if you do use a guide then it shouldn't take longer than 5 or so. I actually liked their previous games, The Penumbra series, better than Amnesia in terms of gameplay, but Amnesia is much scarier.","January 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it may not be the most frigheting game ever, it is true that this game can be a bit hard to play alone and in the dark! Your heart will be racing the entire time as you explore a castle set in 1839 in the lonely mountains of Prussia. Your objective: to delve deeper into the depths of the castle in order to understand why you have woken up in the monument only to forget everything up to that point. The game is surrounded by mystery and frightful awe; every second is spent conserving much needed lantern oil and peeking around corners in a rightfully performed paranoid fashion, all in order to avoid the haunting nightmare that roams the dark, dusty halls of Brennenburg Castle. You are weaponless, lost, confused, and alone. Your dark descent does not get any less dark, and the game throws you into the nightmare right at the beginning.\n\nRecommended for fans of Silent Hill, System Shock, Theif, and Penumbra.\nGenre: 5/5\nGameplay & Mechanics: 4/5\nReplay: 3/5\nThrill & Fun: 5/5\nAtmosphere: 5/5\n\nOverall: 83%","January 4, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bei Amnesia erkundet man aus der Ego-Sicht eine Welt im Traum des Protagonisten, eine riesige Burg mit vielen dunklen und gruseligen Geheimnissen.

Man hat einfach Angst! Dabei findet man keinerlei Waffen oder Gegenstände, mit welchen man sich wehren könnte. Ein völlig neues Spielgefühl entsteht, wenn man panisch vor einem Monster wegläuft, Türen hintersich verschließt, durch welche man ebenfalls verfolgt wird, nur um weiter im Stress das Weite zu suchen und dem Geheimnis dieser Traumwelt auf die Spur zu kommen.

It's as simple as that. The graphics are a bit better, though. Frictional improved their engine a fair bit in the meantime. However, one thing I don't like about this latest title is checkpoints/autosaves. If you want to manually save your game, you can only save and exit. You can't just save and continue on. They force you to quit the game. I take it this was done to discourage constant saving and reloading. But I'm still not pleased with this change.\n\nThe conscensus seems to be that Amnesia is possibly the scariest game yet made. I disagree. It is creepy, yes. No doubt about it.\n\nI can't go into further details without spoiling the game, but Amnesia is not as frightening as it's made out to be. I actually prefer the previous Penumbra titles to this one. Amnesia is good, yes. But I felt Penumbra had the better narrative and was a more memorable experience.","January 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Play through the whole thing alone in the dark with headphones on, and you're a braver man than I.\n\nThis title was the follow up to Frictional's Penumbra series, and continues the same style of play. However, unlike Penumbra where the darkness was your friend, it's an ever-present threat in Amnesia. Staying in the dark for too long will slowly scratch away at your sanity, causing you to see and hear things that aren't there. Insanity causes your character to behave erratically, essentially turning you into walking monster pheromone.\n\nSeeing as lantern oil and tinderboxes are in limited supply, this serves to drive the player forward through the game.\n\nThe sound design is really fantastic, the graphics are admirable and the environment and monsters are diabolically nightmarish. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect horror title are some simple gameplay exploits.","December 8, 2011","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No weapons, no way to fight or defend, nothing... how could that be entertaining?...\nI was so wrong that I've had to reevaluate how I look at everything.  Starting Amnesia I immediately felt a sense of uneasiness and bit of paranoia creeping through my body.  At first I thought, "Oh, its only cause it's dark and the sounds are atonal and creepy.. Get over it you wimp."  But the story continued to disturb me more and more and as I crept through the cold walls of Brennenburg Caslte, listening to the pathetic moans of some poor unknown souls trapped god knows where,  I actually started to panic a little bit.  I haven't felt that since I played Silent Hill as a child.  The rush of fear, the paralyzing feeling of your blood pumping furiously between your parts with abandon, unchecked and unbalanced...   This is not a game, It's an experience and so few games deliver such an immersion as to leave you physically shaking Never did I exepect to be brought back to the feeling that hiding under my blanket from the monsters in the dark brought me.

These are just some of the numerous bugs and glitches found in this game.\n\nThe options menu is kinda good and it runs decent on bad computers. But one problem is that the gamma settings are for the entire system which means that if you have 2 monitors and put the gamma on the highest setting, the other monitor will look terrible.\n\nBut the bugs aside this is about the best survival horror game you can find as I'm typing this. The first person view and making you not be able to fight back make this game really tense and scary if you are in a situation where the monster spots you and you must run. The environment, ambience and of course the soundtrack is mostly what makes the game scary. It's not actually the monster itself that is so scary, it's the premonition of him being around every corner you see that makes the game scary.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game to people that liked Outlast because of the similarities and also to people that just enjoy being scared.","June 22, 2012","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rather than attempt to quantify what makes Amnesia one of the most popular horror games to date, I'll just say that if you're looking for scares that are actually scary, look no further.\n\nAmnesia is a horror game with inventory puzzles and an odd little sanity mechanic I like to call "hide and go soil yourself". While my experience with other horror games has been limited, I can say without a doubt that Amnesia may provide one of the most visceral experiences you have ever gone through in a video game.\n\nAmnesia is an absolute joy to play with your friends. If you can manage the time, play through it once on your own, then invite your friends to play it watch them experience it for the first time. Amnesia is the only game that I have found able to inspire such a feeling of well-meaning spite towards your friends. The kind of spite where you want them to go through the same horrors you did just to see who has better bladder control.\n\nWhen you're done with Amnesia, and you've plumbed the depths of any of the interesting custom levels made by the community, the previous, though unrelated story-wise, Penumbra series by the same developers can wring out a few more decent scares.
