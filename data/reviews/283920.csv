"http://steamcommunity.com/id/m00sh/recommended/283920/","m00sh","Moosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/m00sh/","951 products in account","If George Orwell's 1984 was encapsulated within the confines of the videogame medium, I believe it would resemble something very akin to Putt Putt enters the Parade. In terms of sheer oppression, fear mongering and propaganda to enslave it's citizens, this game excels.\n\nOur Story begins with the sun rising over a seemingly serene landscape, this source of light and life is humanised with a beaming face shining down upon the denizens of this world, clearly being our Big Brother figure of the eye in the sky. This world is devoid of religious imagery, so we as the player must assume the inhabitants of this world subscribe to more primitive methods of Sun Worship, only more worrying as his face smiles unblinking down upon his world. Shortly we are introduced to our protagonist.\n\nI am aware of nothing in popular fiction that's forced into such a twisted and horrific form as our titular character Putt-Putt. While on the surface he may seem rather sanguine about his situation, upon closer inspection of his unmoving eyes the tone of this experience becomes somewhat unnerving. His features contorted into a permanent smile, he very much resembles Canio; our laughing clown must overcome his trials and tribulations while keeping his sadness suppressed lest his plight truly horrify us. Within his own body his internal radio informs him of the daily mission, thus begins the overarching themes that ties Enters the Parades narrative: "conformity"\n\nWe have no choice to not enrol in the Parade, we are given no reasoning behind why we must join the others. We as players may question this but our protagonist begins his assigned task without hesitation. Since we as players have no choice, does that also confirm Putt-Putt himself has no say in the matter? I personally took the parade as either a method of propaganda, or a ritual to appease the Sun God. Before we collect our thoughts on this matter we face our first road block on our path to appease our Deity.\n\nShortly through the game we come across a Cow, this docile animal bars your progress and show's us (the player) what happens to non-conformists in this dystopian landscape. Putt-Putt cannot continue further until he honks his horn, the single most aggressive act he has at his disposal. The personification of his horn also twists shapes, from a recognisably happy face to one that looks as if shouting... clearly demonstrating his innate pent up aggression with the current state of the landscape.\n\nWe arrive in a large Hub where a larger more aggressively coloured character "Smokey" beckons us over. He informs us that we simply cannot enter the race, in order to do so we must perform a number of menial minimum-wage vocations in order to pay our entry fee. I have a hard time judging Smokey's intentions... I'm reminded of the idiom, "no smoke without fire"and clearly as he hands us a lawn mower he is a supporter, proliferator and profiteer of child labour.\n\nBack in the Hub world I notice our fuel gauge is drastically low "I think I need some Gas!" our protagonist speaks on further inspection, his voice slightly wavering towards the end. One must wonder the implications of Fuel within the world of Putt-Putt. As a side note: In our home, we can consume Oil on our cornflakes yet this does nothing to increase our fuel, meaning not only do the cars within this universe require sustenance... but their very lifeblood is a finite resource... Essentially giving their entire population a shelf life; thankfully our main character isn't charged for this transfusion, which allows us to progress northward.\n\nArriving at a stop sign we can thankfully see there is a semblance of order within this world, that said the other road users manically drive across the crossing with little regard for one another, we see the direction Smoky pointed us in and begin our journey down the red road. Not a second later my worst fears about Smokey are proven, a laid trap of nails bursts Putt-Putts tyres and he's stranded alone in the road. A toot of the horn later and Chuck comes to help us... by forcing his phallic metallic tool down our lead characters throat before parading him back through the town like a sexual trophy.\n\nThis was personally the one scene I found most disturbing, not only because  since after clearly being a victim of sexual abuse, Putt-Putt thanks Chuck for his service.. with a smile no less.\n\nAfter such a horrific ordeal we guide our lead character into the nearby toy store in an attempt to salvage whatever remaining childish innocence we can muster. There we find from the Irish shopkeeper that Putt-Putt has misplaced a magnet, something seemingly so key to his survival with the hazards of nails strewn across the streets.\n\nFinally on track, our protagonist finds a group of numbered houses, upon arrival we see they can barely contain the cars held within. Clearly these are more cells that domestic homes as their exterior would lead us to believe. One man comes out, wearing garish pink addressed by our main character as "Mr. Fender Bender".\n\nDue to his colour scheme and offensive name I'm assuming this is the developers attempts at "humor" or "satire" having a clearly gay character called "Bender". I personally found this offensive and would like to call for a petition to be made to hopefully change his name to something more representative... like frank or something... but I digress...\n\nAfter deftly guiding our little motorised hero through several gardens and unearthing a bone. We return to "frank". After thanking our main characters hard work he hands us a measly dollar and retreats, reversing once more into the void within his cell. Being once again allowed to explore the confines of this world I immediately attempted to find a means of escape.\n\nComing across a Cave, I hoped this would be some form of surveillance blind spot, yet I was undone as our overwatcher had placed some form of guard dog there. My radio beeped up once again... maybe the signal is great even underground... I don't know, but it told me I needed that dog for the parade... which brings me into another very large minefield of controversial events:Forced adoption.\n\nClearly a car is not best suited to take care of a small animal, usually when you combine the two you're left with no small animal and a slightly dented car. Yet my end goal requires me to have dominion over this Dog, the bone from the gardens worked and he seemed happy enough.\n\nUpon returning back to the Hub, I'd like to share with you one of the most progressive choices this game allows you. One of the areas available to visit is the colour shop, this fantastic section of the game allows us as the player to choose Putt-Putts racial identity. As I chose green in an attempt to blend in with my surroundings if chance for an escape arose.\n\nAs the machine began changing my genetic makeup I couldn't help but mull over what the implications are of this service within the world of Putt-Putt. If people could choose their own race on a whim.. would that affect diversity within the work place? Would there be a certain number of allocated cars that could only be one colour and you may be forced into a colour you particularly dislike in an attempt to conform?\n\nUpon the rebirth of our protagonist as a strong confident Green Car I was quickly assailed by Smokey, his comments about me looking handsome were so loaded I was close to triggering, yet thankfully I managed to get a quick reprieve courtesy of the Parade starting.\n\nWe see other members of this world in their forced march, each with an animal ruining their interior... One in particular was infested with spiders. Clearly all the animals looked terrified during this high speed convoy, one could only assume the purpose, perhaps they were to be sacrifices. Our story finally ends with the sun setting on the Convoy, appeased he grins an uncanny smile as darkness sets over the land.\n\nTL;DR You're a ♥♥♥♥ing car and you go into a parade and ♥♥♥♥. 10/10","August 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 140 of 150 people (93%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","93","140","150","28","4"

I remember this being a very innocent game, but how wrong I was. For starters the depiction of some of the characters in this game are racially insensitive, an example being the car at the grocery store with his stereotipical italian mustache and his mario type accent. At one Point you have to find a dog to enter the parade. In order to do that you have to find a bone and once you do you lure the dog into the car with it, the equivelent to me luring a child into a van with candy. I do however praise the game for its realistic depictions of neighborhoods. Red street is the equivilent to living in Richmond, CA. House #2 has a ♥♥♥♥ shack of a house that is damaged and has a cracked window. When the car came out to greet Putt-Putt it seemed like he was tweaking and even called me Pitt-Pitt before correcting himself. Green street and blue street however are more upscale like Oakland Hills. With all these problems in the game I cant deny my childhood.

It starts off slow the main hero is at home merely enjoying some breakfast it is just any other day but then things begin to get out of hand when Putt-Putt is invited to the best ♥♥♥♥ing festival of all time. This is where the challenge begins, everyone knows you cannot leave the house without brushing your teath but what do you do when theres no oil in your cereal that is what truly sets this apart from lucas games "attempts" at the genre. Personally I wouldn't recommend this putt-putt adventure for those of the faint of heart, it has violence and strife but teaches a valuable lesson as even though you are in the darkest corner of the world there is always a puppy that is scareder than you. You should buy the Putt-Putt Complete Pack because only then can you call yourself the Putt-Putt champion and everyone knows the Putt-Putt Champion gets all the babes on the beach. Some might say this game is too short but do you really need all the filler you will find in your modern shooter game, personally i enjoy experiences that remain thrilling from start to end thats just not something you get nowadays am i right?\n\nI think the review speaks for itself. It was the best of times, It was the worst of times. IT WAS beyond thunderdome. Stay Fresh. Im really feeling it. It's over anakin I have the high ground. War, War never changes. War has changed.\n\nShadow Moses Island: XX•ZXX'N , XX•ZXX'W. Even the local fishermen rarely venture to this outcropping of land. Yet the incident of all incidents took place on this remote isle, north of Alaska's Fox Islands. A number of confirmed facts undermine the U.S. govern- ment's denial of the entire affair. Among those are the sudden appearance of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Discovery off Shadow Moses, far away from its designated position, and an official record that shows that a squadron of six fully-armed F117 Nighthawks departed from Galena Air Force base for Alaska a scant sixteen hours later. In another possibly related event, an E-3C AWACS on emergency deployment to the Alaska area is said to have had none other than the then- National Security Advisor Jim Houseman as its on-board VIP.\nWhat exactly happened on Shadow Moses? There was no lack of rumors to account for this series of unusual military activities: an armed incursion, a coup attempt by a branch of the military and other theories made its way to the public table. I can state unequivocally that none of them came close to the truth. What actually took place was the single greatest terrorist incident in modern history. It was an act of political violence on a scale the world had never seen, a blow that threatened to send the Damocles' sword of nuclear warfare into a free-fall. Most significant of all, the attack stemmed from several so-called 'Black Projects' which the U.S. government had been conducting in top secret, away from public scrutiny. I have in my hand two optical discs. One contains the entire record of events that took place on Shadow Moses Island that fateful day: the takeover of a nuclear weapons disposal plant by an armed group.\nOther key points of this incredible record are: - The identification of the perpetrators as the government's own genetically-enhanced next-generation commandos and a covert special forces squad, FOXHOUND, with a long dark history of secret intervention - The existence of one Metal Gear REX, a bipedal nuclear-capable tank whose development was one of the most classified projects of all time - The discovery of a massive government conspiracy - The activities of a former FOXHOUND operative who single-handedly took on this daunting situation and averted the crisis, a man who is known only by his code name: Solid Snake The other remaining disc holds the details of Project FOXDIE, a massive cover-up, which the U.S. government planned and executed in order to prevent exposure. There are, after all, forces within the U.S. government who seek to maintain the military power structure established in the last century, and will not hesitate to resuscitate the terror of nuclear arms in order to achieve that end.\nMy intent is to expose their activity, and the entirety of the Shadow Moses Affair, through this book. Only then can we hope to free the coming generations from the damnosa hereditas of the 20th-century nuclear arms race. I looked up from the mass of documents at the sound of the doorbell. On the monitor in front of me was a half-finished status report on the resurgence of nuclear arms development in a certain Middle Eastern state. The UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission) had officially requested a survey by the UN weapons inspectors, and had been refused entry; tensions were once again running high in the Gulf. As a military analyst whose specialty was nuclear arms, I was under contract from a think tank to produce a study of the situation. It was due the day after the next, and interruptions were definitely not welcome. I ground out my cigarette in the ashtray and stepped out of the study. All visitors to my house are checked via a surveillance camera and then let in through the heavy gate. The property itself is surrounded by a high wall.\nIt may seem like overkill for a beach community, but security is a necessity in greater Los Angeles, if only to keep out the legion of swimsuit-clad tourists. However, there was nobody to be seen at the gate. It was either a prank, or the camera was malfunctioning. Reluctant to investigate but feeling unsettled nevertheless, I headed back to the study and sat back down at the computer to continue my work. Just then, someone spoke behind me. "You always were a little careless." I spun around, kicking my chair over. There was a man standing at the entrance of the study, slouching in a well-tailored suit. "Richard!" He caught my eye and grinned. Ignoring my surprise, he strolled into the room, gazing around at the pile of books and papers. "And still as disorganized as ever." He shrugged his shoulders in a familiar gesture, triggering a wave of memories laced with bitterness\n\nRichard Ames and I were married, once upon a time. We were both young, and working for the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). We spent much of our brief marriage in disagreement over virtually every issue, and just as I came to realize that our union was a mistake, he disappeared from my life. A while later, I received the paperwork for divorce from his lawyer. There was a generous alimony offer involved, which I refused. Not only did I find the thought of owing him anything intolerable, I also wanted to prove that he was not the only one who could walk away without an explanation. The divorce was finalized without us ever meeting face-to-face, and we were legally strangers once again. In the five years since, I quit the DIA and became a freelance analyst. I had not seen Richard at all, nor even heard of his whereabouts. "How did you get in here?" I demanded.\nAfter all, attempting to scale the wall or force the front door would immediately trigger the security system. But he refused to be ruffled.

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child's first venture into PC gaming.\n\nPutt-Putt Joins the Parade is where it all began. This game started a legacy of incredible, educational point and click adventures for children. I remember specifically that this game inspired me to work out in the yard in real life in order to make money to buy myself a Lego set I wanted. I honestly believe that my development in life would have been very different without the Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and Buzzy.","December 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

They are pretty old but hey, “classic point and clicks” actually seem to be a thing at the moment.\n\nAs far as I am aware there is a whole series of these. I have only played one and it was fairly short and easy to get through. If you are looking to buy a game for your little one or something along those lines, I would recommend maybe getting the whole series. Although somewhat expensive, It wasn’t a half bad game for kids and I’m sure they would enjoy having various different ones to play totalling to a fair bit of game play then just the one that lasts less then an hour.\n\nAs sad as it is, I’m 21 and I enjoyed it. It’s cute, it’s random and it’s a light hearted little thing to pass the time.\n\n\nTL;DR : A pretty hardcore game not for the feint hearted. It’s pretty intense and takes a fair bit of skill. Despite the insane difficulty, it’s hyper realistic graphics and fast paced action sequences will more than make up for the fact this game will destroy your life.","May 19","true","0.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","2"

Putt putt is a mmo rpg with a 3D twist. A really cool easter egg is the tree covered in blood with a kite in it, its next to the cave (if you dont see it try going in and out of the cave) and a quick tip for beginners: the dog has a 1% chance of being found with rabies, really rare but if you play enough he'll be there, you need the nails from the road on red street and all you have to do is feed him the nails. Wait about 20 minutes and he will be fine. Also, I wouldnt recommend trying multiplayer until you've mastered putt putts charming oil slick.\nOne last tip, to avoid your party dying around act 3, try using the shadow key before going into the church.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealEverything/recommended/283920/","TheRealEverything","The Real™ Gorgak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealEverything/","152 products in account","Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.\n\nCAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):\n\nThe campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n\nSPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):\n\nThe Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in Putt-Putt. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.\n\nThe Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Putt-Putt. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close putt-putt. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.\n\nConclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale in the future. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer, but it is of course entirely your decision.\n\nThings to be aware of -\n\nThere is no controller support for this game.\n\nIf you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players that 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find very few (if any) games on there.\n\nPutt-Putt Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you\n\nThis game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.\n\nAt the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.\n","July 13, 2014","true","1.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

They breathe through feather-like gills and are found in bodies of water. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is fresh water running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as Procambarus clarkii are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants.\n\nThe name "crayfish" comes from the Old French word escrevisse (Modern French écrevisse). The word has been modified to "crayfish" by association with "fish" (folk etymology). The largely American variant "crawfish" is similarly derived.\n\nSome kinds of crayfish are known locally as lobsters, crawdads, mudbugs, and yabbies. In the Eastern United States, "crayfish" is more common in the north, while "crawdad" is heard more in central and southwestern regions, and "crawfish" further south, although there are considerable overlaps.\n\nThe study of crayfish is called astacology.\n\nIn Australia (on the eastern seaboard), New Zealand and South Africa, the term crayfish or cray generally refers to a saltwater spiny lobster, of the genus Jasus that is indigenous to much of southern Oceania, while the freshwater species are usually called yabby or kōura, from the indigenous Australian and Māori names for the animal respectively, or by other names specific to each species. Exceptions included Western Rock Lobster of the Palinuridae family found on the west coast of Australia; from the Parastacidae family Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish found only in Tasmania, and the Murray crayfish found on Australia's Murray River.\n\nIn Singapore, the term crayfish typically refers to Thenus orientalis, a seawater crustacean from the slipper lobster family. True crayfish are not native to Singapore, but are commonly found as pets, or as an invasive species (Cherax quadricarinatus) in the many water catchment areas, and are alternatively known as freshwater lobsters.","June 17, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Putt-Putt's endeavors to enter said parade offer a reflection of our own mortal wants and desires: Greed, nepotism, a need for acceptance in the face of adversity, how the color of your skin effects others opinion of you, surving in a capitalist society, working for mimimum wage, and generally understanding the value of a dollar. Putt-Putt has all sorts of valuable lessons to dole out upon unworthy ears willing to shell out a gold coin or two just to listen through a rusty keyhole.

It was 100% worth it for that price but I'd definitely wait for a sale (even 50% off) since there is such little playtime and 0 replayability.*\n\nI have to give it a thumbs up for nostalgia reasons alone, the Putt-Putt games were the first computer games I ever played. I was 3 or 4 years old, funnily enough my dad immediately upgraded me to Super Mario 64 when I was 4/5, CLEARLY I was too mature and mlg pro for Putt-Putt.\n\nThis game takes about 30 minutes to complete (the rest was afk-time) and I freaking burst out laughing when the game said "The End".

Maybe it's just that nostalgia feel or the adorable factor, I’m a sucker for cartoony silliness and cuteness.\n\nAll in all a very short, silly, easy (I mean, it'd intended for kids after all) and enjoyable game, at least it was for me. My rating on this game itself would be a bit biased due to the series itself being one of my cherished childhood game memories~  12/10! game of the 22 years ago I warned you didn't I? But seriously, the game is worth a look, as well as similar ones like Pajama Sam. Cute, easy point and clicks, maybe for when you are playing a point and click that is unimaginably hard and you just want to feel smart again and unwind\n\nFinal conclusion... A game that will now be played every time I feel gloomy or depressed. Because as we know, dancing flowers, riddle loving toy animals (I think?) that are oddly lifelike, a multitude of easily clicked objects that do nothing aside from a short cute animation (The best kind of stuff, because not having it means not screwing you over later in game~) and Putt-Putt's consistent bright outlook and willingness to do the jobs of the adults.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my first horribly planed and executed review~ <3\nAnd thanks to Humongous entertainment and it's subsidiaries for bringing us kids games that actually let kids think for themselves and did not hold their hand though every single stage.","July 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeorgeBush911/recommended/283920/","GeorgeBush911","Ealdwine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeorgeBush911/","167 products in account","There are some things that only videogames can do. For me, Putt-Putt® Joins the Parade was emblematic of all of them. Where most games do their best to be something else – to tell a story like a novel, to impress with cinematic techniques like a film – Putt-Putt is pure game, a complete and darkly fascinating vision that makes no concessions to the modern conception of how games should be. Instead, it was an exploration of how games could be; how bleak, how twisted, how focused and – most famously – how challenging. Most developers take pains to protect you from failure. Humongous Entertainment turns it into an artform.\n\nPutt-Putt® Joins the Parade is a brutal and demanding point and click action-RPG set in a world full of monstrous, disturbing things that are trying their hardest to end your life as quickly as possible. Using whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, buy or forge, the challenge is to inch your way through this damned and deadly place, now and then coming across gigantic bosses that take especial valor and tenacity to kill. The eventual aim is to make it out alive, but there are about 50-60 hours of creative cruelty between you and that goal.\n\nYou will die, a lot. You will die on the end of a sword, on the edge of an axe, crushed by a boulder, impaled on fangs; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Putt-Putt. It's education, it's progress, it's the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in gaming – it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Exactly because your chances of success are so slim, each victory feels monumental.\n\nThe reviewer's job is difficult when it comes to a game like Putt-Putt. I simply can't unreservedly recommend that you buy it. It's not a game that you play to relax. It doesn't care in the slightest about whether you're enjoying yourself, and it doesn't give a fig for your notions of entertainment or your mental well-being. If you just play games for fun, this isn't for you, and no amount of insistence on my part is going to change that.\n\nBut if you're interested in the limits of the videogame form – to see just how focused, how pure and how uncompromising in its vision a game can be – Putt-Putt is unmissable. If you take the time get into Putt-Putt's mindset, to begin to understand the twisted way in which it operates and taste the rewards behind its cruellest challenges, this is one of the most thrilling, most fascinating and most completely absorbing experiences in gaming.","December 25, 2014","true","11.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

When you finally earn enough money to get that car wash, Putt-Putt® reveals that he never have been to a car wash before. I think this is a commentary on how dyfunctional capitalism can be.\nBesides working you also have to fulfill Putt-Putt®'s daily needs, like brushing his teeth, make him eat breakfast and fuel him up from time to time. It's a very advanced needs system for it's time and I am simply starstrucked by it.\n\nThis game also had incredible fish AI and a dog like 21 years before Call of Duty: Ghosts. It's like the Proto-Ghosts, but instead of being a bad murder simulator, it's good.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, all genders and all ages..

There's a bit of interesting interface use but aside from that, not much worth anything here.

Not because they are bad games, but simply because they are much more kid-oriented than Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, or Spy Fox.  Unfortunately, Putt-Putt Joins the Parade is no exception.  It really just doesn't have that much to it.  You do mindless chores to earn money so that you can join the parade.  That's basically it.\n\nIf you have a small child, they might like it.  Maybe.  Other than that, there's really no reason to pick this one up.  Almost every Putt-Putt game is better than this one, and almost every HE series is better than Putt-Putt.  So this one sits pretty low in the rankings.","August 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","9"

You can click on just about anything to see a little animation happen, you can mow other peoples' lawns, you can deliver groceries, you can do a lot.

Before Pixar made their Cars movies, this was just among the "talking car" genre. Putt-Putt is a purple putt-putt car who wants to be part of Car Town's parade that was being held today. In order for Putt-Putt to join he must do various errands to be in top shape and find a balloon and pet dog in order to be qualified. This was the very first Humungous game so it does show it's age as oppose to their later games. The game was intended for young kids so the gameplay isn't that long plus this was their first attempt to create a computer game so give them mercy as their later games do get better. This game is worth buying for your kids and also only worth playing for die hard Humungous Game fans.","October 24, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
