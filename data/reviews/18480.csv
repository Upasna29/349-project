It's different than the average point-and-click adventure game in that the decisions made by the player will change how the story unfolds.  Which, in turn, affects your scoring at games end.  You play as Mata Hari and are recruited as a spy.  As story progresses, you end up becoming a double agent.  As with point-and-click adventure games, it is somewhat linear.  However ... the key is to strategize.  You're a spy.  Stop and think.  Even though some characters may suggest you go to one country, try going a different route via a different country first.  There are side 'missions' that are at play while completing primary missions at hand. With my first playthrough, I pretty much did what I thought I was 'supposed' to do per the character interactions to get what I needed to further the story.  My score was pretty sad at games end and I didn't understand why.  On my second playthrough, I took more time, chose different routes than suggested by characters, tried to avoid interaction with certain characters until necessary, and was delightfully surprised that I could do much more than I thought.  Any adventure gamer will really enjoy this game!!!!\n(I would love to see achievements and cards added to this game!!!!)","December 7, 2013","true","90.7"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","54","58","0","2"

It does have a charm to it--where else can one drug a man to sleep and steal his secrets while dressed in a nightie and high heels? The problem lies not in the story but in the game play. First, there is A LOT of traveling between countires and while the attempt to turn this into a minigame might have meant well it quickly becomes tedious. Second, I thought the the difficulty of the minigames ramped up quickly, espeically the dance one. I know you don't have to be a dancer to finish the game but I hate it when not having great twitch reflexes gets in the way of playing the game how I want to play it--frustration is not equal to fun. Some people are going to love this game but I didn't. The story and the setting simply couldn't overcome what I experienced as poor game play.","June 14, 2014","false","4.5"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","44","52","0","0"

The game has a particular charme: it's set in the first two decades of 1900, you travel in 4 countries of Europe, you meet some historical characters, and the main character is Mata Hari. That's probably the only good thing about this game. If you like the adventure genre and you have nothing else to play, and you find this game for a few bucks (like I did), give it a shot, but you better know that this isn't one of the best point'n'click adventure games out there: the puzzles are boring and too easy - most of the gameplay will be spent traveling from city to city to speak to someone (couldn't she use a phone?). The story isn't very addictive either, but there's something about this game that give you a good feeling. The setting is perfect, the puzzles are useless. Too bad, it could have been a great game, but it isn't.","May 2, 2014","true","8.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","3"

Playing as the legendary spy who was actually a dancer by profession means you will be doing some fliriting, object-combination and item fetching throughout. Mata's mission are varied and interesting, even though the actual story progression is happening at a decent pacing.\nOverall this one is a recommendable adventure game with some replayability as there are different endings to get, depending on three values (Wealth, Spycraft, Skills).","December 1, 2011","true","8.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Very repetitive backtracking towards the end and you may find yourself skipping the train minigame like I did. Just about all the puzzles in the game save for the last one are very easy and the seduction options are really only a matter of trial and error.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/recommended/18480/","Gyumaou","Gyumaou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/","2510 products in account","Quite an interesting adventure game with some good art. The location design is colourful and vibrant, but still easy on the eye. The character details are pretty high as well, especially Mata's during the dancing routines.\n\nThe story is quite intriguing, it shows Mata Hari as a brilliant dancer turned spy against her will -- fortunately, her womanly wiles and quick thinking help her overcome every obstacle. However, once you're a spy "the only way out is death" and so Mata is dragged into even more dangerous missions. Her determination to prevent a war is the only* thing that keeps her going.\n\nGameplay is a simple point-and-click and goes quite smooth in the beginning. Tasks are easy and dialogues and cutscenes build up a great foundation to the tale of Mata Hari. Further in the tasks become more challenging, requiring some clever thinking and problem solving. Minigames also start to appear after the first mission to spice things up -- these range from a catch-me-not train ride through block-swapping puzzles to decoding encrypted messages. These are also easy to learn and simple to solve at first, but get more demanding as the game goes on.\n\nThe dancing minigame deserves a special mention, it's what makes the game stand out. Mata Hari is a great dancer, and it is also up to the player to take care of this aspect of her life through finding inspiration for new dance moves and actually guiding her movements on stage. The minigame is a simple rhythm game where notes appear from 4 points on screen and have to be touched with the mouse cursor when they're in the centre of one of 4 circles. Sounds simple, initially is, but with each dance the number, speed, and variation of notes increases to match Mata's ever-better dance routines.\n\nOverall rather easy, requires about 5 hours for 100% clear for players well familiar with adventure games - newcomers may find some tasks difficult to work out. About the only downside is the crazy amount of travelling between locations in the second half of the game - nearly every step in solving a task takes place in a different city, and travelling between them (even using the safe trains) can be very repetitive and dull.","February 26, 2013","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

World famous spy from one hundred years ago mind-♥♥♥♥s and bangs dudes to manipulate them into giving up state secrets. There's way too much emphasis on lame mini-games involving traveling between train stations trying to elude other spies and they even found a way to make her burlesque show boring.  Thankfully, they can be skipped if you don't want to rack up points and just play the adventure part. I got it for $5 and took me a little over five hours to beat. This game is geared more toward the casual crowd.

I don't usually play games all the way to the end if I'm not recording them (I hate boss fights and give up pretty fast if I don't get a puzzle), but this is one of the few games which I have actually played until the end on my own.\n\nI love the story, Mata Hari's character, the characters she meets and the environments. Sadly cannot say much for the audio since I do not pay as much attention to that as I should. There is a lot of travelling back and forth between scenes/places however, as others have pointed out. I personally have no problem with all the travelling back and forth throughout the game, though the mini-game for it (if you choose/have to play it) does become difficult quite fast. I also enjoyed the dancing mini-game, though that one might not be the easiest or smoothest in terms of game play.\n\nI personally recommend the game for what it is, especially since it's pretty low priced, but be prepared for a lot of back and forth travelling, and not always the best game play for mini games","January 1","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/recommended/18480/","vecturin","АlphaWhelp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/","1028 products in account","Thumbs down was given based purely on the fact that the amount of thumbs up was slightly higher than the amount of thumbs down.\n\nSeriously, though, I do really feel neutral about this game.  The point and click part of it was pretty cool. There are some great secrets to find worth exploring for that you'll miss if you head straight to the objective every time.  It's based on the real life Mata Hari who was accused of being a spy purely on the fact that she used a lot of international trains and they found invisible ink in her room, with no other evidence.  Historians generally agree she wasn't actually a spy, but this game plays with the idea that she was.\n\nThe thing I don't like is that you're forced to grind the stupid train and dancing minigames for imaginary points that do nothing except change the quality of the ending.  The train minigame in particular gets pretty hard and I don't have time to spend hours on the same stupid puzzle.\n\nIf you're okay with that, or okay with getting kind of a poor ending, then go for it.  If these sorts of things are deal breakers for you, I suggest maybe looking at a different adventure game.","March 7","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play Mata Hari, seductive, desired, curious and suspicious as she is meant to be.

You have a huge amount of discussions, repetitive OST, repetitive puzzles, impossible dance mini game (another repetitive puzzle) and a bit too much of going between towns.\nThe good side is, you can turn on the panic button for mini games, including the dancing one.
