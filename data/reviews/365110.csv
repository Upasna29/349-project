Pretty unbelievable.\n\nThe game is short (about an hour long), but I don't count that against it. I actually rather like short games. The content within is what I take issue with. I also don't mind the use of stock RPG Maker assets. The game is a mere dollar at full price, so that's fine.\n\nBut it's clear everything was done in a slapdash manner. That Photoshop filter used to give the game a more unique look? Clearly done via some kind of batch processing without individually inspecting each asset to make sure they crop and animate cleanly. Every ability and monster in the game has received seemingly zero touch-ups to make any kind of unique encounters or combat. I mean, I get the point that the main character is super OP, but why have him still gain levels and acquire skills? Why leave all those abilities left in the game? All I needed was Cleave and basic attack. And why can I remove the limiter multiple times and get a temporary buff for doing so? It makes no narrative sense. The obvious explanation as that all these things unchanged once they were found to be basically functional.\n\nAnother problem with the shortness is that it still feels the need to pad out its time with a ridiculously high encounter rate throughout the whole game. It only seems to get higher with each new area!\n\nReally, though. Regardless of all these issues, there just isn't enough of a story. I get that people really like bad puns/humor and pop culture references, but those should be like easter eggs and not the meat of the interactions. Unless it was meant as a way to discourage me from talking to random NPC's and interacting with things. If so, mission accomplished. Aside from that, the story has little to offer. A confusing moral (don't ever move away from your hometown?) is shoved in your face while the premise of "what happens after you beat the big bad" is told via summary. And then there's a slight twist at the end. But none of the execution actually bothers to explore the idea. I guess I expected something like Rocky II, which is about what happens to that smalltown hero when given massive success and fame (which happens in Rocky I). Not that I expected this game to be as good as an Oscar-winning movie franchise, just that I wanted there to be a STORY not a summary.\n\nSo my conclusion is that this game is kind of a scam. It doesn't run unless you fix it yourself and the effort is so low that I have to believe the dev doesn't care. He's got his money so he's good to go.","December 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

For 1.09$ you'd think it couldn't be so bad, but the game was just a somewhat intersesting storywith the backdrop of oversimplified jrpg gameplay. I won't go into much detail about the problems trying to even get the game to work, but I'll just say that I invested an equal if not greater amount of time playing versus trying to get it to work. There are much better rpgmaker games, that are more than worth their price, but sadly this isn't. Try playing one of the Lilly and Sasha games, or something by Labyrinthine. You can usually find them for less than .50$ apiece during sale times. If I had paid .08$ for this like I did for Cruse of the Immortals, maybe I could recommend it. This is just overpriced and underdeveloped.","March 14","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First up, the game didn't install correctly. The "Play" button only launched an installer for the game and created a sub-folder that I had to run the executable within in order to play the game, so if you're thinking of buying this do be aware of that. Due to the "Play" button only launching the installer, the five minutes registered for my playtime is actually just the time spent installing and waiting for the review window to open up. A better estimate of my playtime is somewhere on the order of an hour (probably somewhat less), in which time I played the game to completion.\n\nRegardless, the game itself was quite nice for a $0.99 impulse buy. The story did exactly what it set out to do - provide the sort of denouement that RPGs so often lack, addressing the question of what, exactly, a band of heroes strong enough to save the world where armies couldn't would do once they were done.\n\nWhich isn't to say it doesn't have its problems, of course. Graphical glitches abound, with tiles often being outlined in black for no discernible reason, especially when animating. The random encounter system is also somewhat underdeveloped - perhaps half a dozen times I found myself finishing an encounter only to get another literally the next step I took, and a more typical fight every five to ten steps isn't much better. Most grievously, however, the game is locked to a very tiny resolution and immediately halts in every way but musically while unfocused. The former is slightly understandable with fixed-width graphical elements, but the latter is really quite irksome.\n\nAlso unfortunate is how the "limiter" mechanic (wherein the hero purposefully limits himself in order to "challenge himself" but also to drive home story elements) is implemented - you can choose to take it off right after you put it on and become the strongest thing in the game by far. Yet even if you do this, those aforementioned story elements still act as if you had the thing on, which is rather jarring. I'd advise leaving the thing on the whole game, especially since you don't really need it too much in the first place - the game's definitely on the easy side of the spectrum. And if the developer's reading this, I'd advise just taking out the ability to remove it outside of cutscenes.","April 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","21","42","0","23"

Turns out I like the story. None of the typical story lines you would come to expect. There is a video done by a fellow gamer on how to set this up. If the developer would fix this they would get more sales and better reviews. I'm feeling nice so i'm going to recommend this game. I give the developer one week to fix it or i will change my review.","November 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
