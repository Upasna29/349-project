I like racing games, and I seem to recall maybe being vaguely excited for Carnage Racing years ago when I saw it on Gametrailers? I wasn't sure.\n\nBut outside of the Free Weekend it was on sale for $2.50, so rather than wait like a sensible human being, I bought it sight unseen.\n\nAnd, boy, I learned a lesson today.\n\nThe game itself feels like it fell off of the iPhone in the worst way possible. The music is super uninspired, the sounds are limp and wimpy, the art is kind of questionable (what is up with that dude's proportions?), the cars are sluggish, and the weapons don't feel good (not only that, but you are totally, 100% defenseless in first place).\n\nOn top of that, the game informs you that you can use any USB gamepad to play the game, but does not offer any control customization options. I tried my Dualshock controller first (as I find it to be the most comfortable) but the only button that would respond was R2 - which Carnage Racing interpreted as the pause button. To get it to recognize my wired 360 controller, I had to quit out of the game and relaunch it, too. Kind of a nitpick, but still silly.\n\nThe game similarly doesn't provide any graphics customization options, with a single slider for "Quality" that goes between High, Normal, Low and Lowest. I did not notice any immediate change to the game's performance switching between these options, and driving retained sort of a jittery feeling throughout.\n\nCarnage Racing's primary conceit is a teleportation meter that fills up, and once you pop it, you can drive through portals that warp you to an alternate path. It's kind of a cute idea but isn't utilized very well (your meter fills up so slowly that you can only use the warp once per lap, and almost always in the same spot). On top of that, warping is a little disorienting - you don't teleport in "logical space". It's literally a portal to some unrelated section of the track. It makes it hard to keep a bead on where your opponents are because even if somebody's on your left, when you warp, you could suddenly be on the opposite side of the track, above them. There's absolutely a feeling of "Okay, where even am I in relation to anything, now?" There's no immediately recognizable benefit to using it, it just looks cool.\n\nBut I could probably put up with that. I've played lackluster racing games before and gotten some amount of enjoyment from them. The real problem with Carnage Racing is that it kind of doesn't want me to play it at all.\n\nAfter a certain point, tracks just... stop loading. Me and all the CPU racers will spawn in the sky and fall for an eternity. Sometimes, dumping out to the menu and re-loading back in to a race will fix it, but most of the time, it doesn't. It makes it 100% unplayable in any degree whatsoever.\n\nOn the plus side, I'm only out $2.50, and bizarrely one of the Steam trading cards I got from the game is selling for an average of $0.84, so I may yet even make my money back.\n\nIf only I could actually play it, maybe it wouldn't be such a steaming pile.","July 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 207 of 253 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","207","253","5","7"

I have no idea why this game was released on a PC. It will be probably an acceptable game to entertain yourself while waiting for something, but PC definitely has much more interesting games to play.\n\nThe game is made badly and has a lot of bugs and imperfections, many players experiencing them, what you can see on a screenshots. It starts from wrong pop-up messages on buttons and inability to change sound volume and ends with rendering bugs and unstable multiplayer.\n\nPlaying a career is not so fun, bots are quite stupid, but playing a multiplayer is much more entertaining. However, sometimes I was winning a lot of games in a row with almost no competition. Background music is represented by the single annoying looped track.\n\nThe game definitely doesn't worth its current price. Its real cost is 2.5 times less.\n\n\nThis game is based on ideas of two great games of late 90's - early 00's — Re-Volt[en.wikipedia.org] and Stunt GP — with a little changes and additions.\nPlaying Re-Volt always was and still much more entertaining and competitive for me, even with bots in career. Even after 15 years from release this game is still alive!!!\n\nSo, what Re-Volt can offer to you:\nthe game is officially abandoned, and can be downloaded and played for free;\nthe game has a build-in track editor;\nthe game has a lot of beautiful user-made tracks and cars;\nthe community is still releasing updates (occasionally);\nmany people are playing online every day and online championships are held every month;\nnew user-made tracks and cars are released every so often...With all of this you will never be bored!!\n\nIf you became interested in playing Re-Volt, then there are some things for you to know:\nCurrent game versions used by the community[z3.invisionfree.com];\nRVR — online racing community[revoltrace.net]. Information about how to play online, current and upcoming championships;\nRVZ — storage of all the tracks and cars[revoltzone.net];\nMost loved user-made tracks[www.kajeuter.com].I hope after all of the above you will prefer to play Re-Volt rather than this game.

Well it has a little lack in sense of speed but if you are more about shooting your oponents or doing stunts this is totaly for you! Also later in the game you unlock the "Speedstar" class which gives you a sense of speed! There is no drifting or nitro, its only you, you car, and your weapons. There is a huge upgrade system for every car and it actually will take you a little while to get your first car fully upgraded, but as soon as you got your first car on its best, you will feel the need to play with friends and make them angry becausey in my case, I rapitly fire stuff at them ^^ Its worth the price and you will have fun with it. Only bad thing is, that the maps are not realy creative. there are just 7 or 8 maps and the othere 14 or somewhat about that are just a mix of the 7 or 8.

This game went on sale for dirt cheap during the 2013 holiday sale. I purchased the 4 player pack and gave them out to some friends as gifts. I knew it featured 8 player Multiplayer so I figured, its a racing game, 8 player MP and cheap. how bad can it be?\n\nCarnage Racing is not what I expected, it was more, way more. It has physics that are completely un realistic and un natural, the pace is slow and dragging, the stunts suck and the points you get really don’t matter. But after the end of each race I'm laughing, competitive, happy and craving the next race!\n\nThere is something about a game that plays simple, is low key and just does the bare minimum. Micro transactions are gone, pay to win is gone and you get the full game with your initial purchase. The game play is fun and easy to pick up and play no matter your skill level. "Phase Shifting" allows you to warp ahead of other players here and there, and the selection of weapons is limited to 4-5 types, so its not confusing. At the end of the race, you may be a good driver but if you know how to use weapons correctly, you can smack that 1st place outta there!\n\nI love Carnage Racing, its probably some of the best laughs I've had with my homies playing online, please get it and let me know so you can join us!","March 5, 2014","true","20.3"," 69 of 128 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","69","128","0","4"

This is that, but in your house, with better music, with multiplayer mode, more cars, more achievements, and more fun. I've had it for two days, and I've already played it for 10 hours.\n\nCarnage Racing is unpredictable and fun. That's the bottom line. You can pick up weapons throughout the race course, and you never know whether somebody will slow you down, bomb you, portal up next to you... Or maybe you'll do the same to them. It truly is carnage. I also appreciate the pun in the title, which is a pretty big plus. As expected from Jagex, always slipping little jokes into their games.\n\nThere are a few downsides, of course. The campaign is pretty easy. There aren't any instances when you're on a hairpin's breadth, trying to beat an AI. It only took me about five hours to get all the achievements and fully upgrade a few cars (with some EPIC paint jobs, I might add.) The AIs are a bit stupid, often crashing into you at the start, but after that things straighten out and get fun. The maps are a bit blurry. I'm often lagging when I enter a new game zone. 'Game zones' - the entire game is made up of maybe seven different map sections, lasting thirty seconds or so each. Each map is a little boring, because it's just a new combination of a zone or two. That's about it, though. I've read about other people having glitches, but I haven't, so I don't care.\n\nLooking past some of the downsides, once again, this game is fun. The cars handle well, the weapons are pretty epic, and what it loses in refined content, it makes up for in raw imagination. As someone who's played a lot of Jagex sidescrollers and other games - Arcanists, Armies of Gieleinor, Runescape, you name it - this fits among the rest of them quite well. It's up to you whether you like that or not. I do!\n\nThanks, Jagex!","July 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It was really cheap, yes, but not worth it. I would like to start this review by saying this was not only an mobile game once, but also a facebook game. Yeah, you heard it right. Even the developers know this was a bad idea.\nThe game started fun, i played some time with my friends and we were having fun, the problem was, that the game is completely unbalanced. Think of Mario Kart, now focus on the unfair things, like the freakin Blue Shell, now think that if you play more than everybody you will have an oportunity to upgrade the blue shell in a way that it multiplies and hits every other player. Now forget all of that, because this game is even more unfair. You have an item that simply teleports you to the nearest player in front of you no matter how far you are, and you can upgrade it after grinding some money in the game. When you do upgrade this teleport to the maximum (like i did), you can teleport to 3 players ahead of you. So if you are playing it with 2-3 friends (like me), you will always appear right next to the first place. This game do not reward your skills, it rewards your luck. Also, if you play more than your friends, you can upgrade all your items to the max and make the game impossible for the ones who have less time or are busy playing actual well-made games.\nBut that is not the worst part, when playing multiplayer (even though the game was repetitive as hell and had a lack of maps) i actually had some kind of fun. What really made me come here to write this negative review was the singleplayer.\nAfter my friends left the game i decided to play the campaing alone so i could unlock the other cars (no, you can't freakin unlock them multiplayer). The AI wasn't a big deal, the challengs were not that hard. The problem is that when i got through a part of the game, completed all challenges in all the missions i played, and when i was trying to restart a race the game crashed. Ok, normal. I opened it again and... my save was gone! Simple as that, all the upgrades i had, all my stars, everything was gone.\nMaybe you are thinking i only wrote this review because i was angry, but the game is actually really unbalanced and repetitive. Also, i have all my reasons to be angry, i lost my frekin save.\n\nPros:\n+Kind of fun multiplayer.\n+Ok graphics.\n+Good sensation when exploding someone.\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive.\n-Unbalanced.\n-Rewarding the wrong players.\n-Unsafe save file.\n-SinglePlayer sucks.\n-Steam port of a Mobile-Facebook game.\n\nConclusion\nDon't buy this game, if you want a arena racing game to play with friends, go buy Post Apocalyptic Mayhem or Zero Gear.","August 4, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

SInce the biggest appeal to the game is multiplayer, there is very little replay value once you have completed the courses.\n\nGranted quite a lot of maps, but most look somewhat similar to each other and provide very little in the form of variety. The game and racing mechanics and strategy needed to win here by juggling weapon usage and upgrades, portal jumping and skilled driving is quite good. But Ai in itself is relatively easy to beat and so again without multiplayer there really is no need to buy.\n\nDevelopers rarely ever offer customer support, and it seems to be an abandoned game, promising no new content in the way of maps, cars or any other dlc.\n\nI was a big fan of Jag Ex only to find that their delivering of development promises ran out of petrol way too quick. In a nutshell the way this game has been left decomposing and there will soon be nothing left of it other than a fossil fuel. Having said that its funny as hell when you see some one about to enter a portal gate and so you zap them of their energy and instead see them drive straight into a brickwall at high speeds. Oh the memories and the fun times you have given me. RIP Carnage Racing. I've said my prayers and lay a boquet of oil sludge on your tombstone.\n\nPS achievement hunters beware there are a lot of achievements which are multiplayer which are no longer possible meaning 100% pass rate is now impossible. Also there is an achievement where you have to log in for 20 days straight you know how hard that is!!! Took me 3 years too accomplish.","December 27, 2013","false","40.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

If you are using a controller then you need to let go and use the mouse to exit the popups, afterwards it goes right back to the game and you lose speed because your hand was on the mouse not the gas.\nOne of the biggest issues it seems is small time (and sadly some big time) devs don't include enough options to set. One such option I would like to turn of is the motion blur applied to the scenery as you drive by. It looks stupid and seems to cause the appearance of micro stutter.\n\nThe devs also seem to have gotten lazy on optimizing the core mechanics. Steering feels awkward, the warp portal things don't seem to work all the time and sometimes attacking through the big warpgate does nothing.\n\nThis game isn't worth the sale price of $2.50 USD let alone the normal price of $10.00 USD. Don't waste your money on it.\n\n\nMessage to the devs, if you want to port/make a game for PC make sure you revamp the UI and add audio/video/general options in detail and add UI navigation for mouse, keyboard and controller. If you patch in the fixes and add in the PC specific bits this could be a decent $5.00 USD game.\n\n\n","July 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The warping is a nice mechanic, but the portals are barely bigger than your car, so its really easy to get pushed sideways into halfway hitting the solid wall next to it. Since the portals are only open for a few seconds, by the time the car manages to get all 4 tires back on the ground, its gone and you are now in last place when you were in first place.\n\nIn short, this is very similar to the Facebook version of the game. It has a more advanced (meaing buggier) physics engine, prettier textures, a less cash-flow-oriented upgrade tree, and is an overall ho-hum combat racing game. If you still want to play, just get on Facebook and save yourself $10.","December 31, 2013","false","9.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It is a multiplayer focused kart racing game featuring lots of weapons, big jumps, stunts and a unique mechanic in racing games – portals. Yes this is probably the only racing game where you can warp around the track. These can be used to take shortcuts and reach places other drivers cannot.\n\nThere is a short single player championship against somewhat dodgy AI cars and each race has a set number of challenges to complete. These range from simply finishing in first place, performing jumps, blasting a set number of cars etc. Unfortunately the intelligence of the other drivers is...well...they are stupid! Carnage Racing has the sort of drivers that are single minded and will just do whatever they want and ignore you, usually just trying to drive straight through your vehicle.\n\nControls aren't that great either. When playing with a controller the left stick is used for both steering and those stunts which sounds OK, but just doesn't work in practice. For example a double press left or right causes you car to flip over, but sometimes you need to straighten up for a landing (you can steer in mid air) and when you try to do this you flip over without meaning to as if there's some invisible gremlin taking control. The stunt controls are also quite unresponsive so even if you really want to flip or spin you don't and end up just hitting left or right waiting for it to do something.\n\nHaving said that when it all comes together the game can be great fun. The problem is that these moments are too few and far between. Add to this a number of bugs and glitches and many faults in the game design and what you get is an annoying, frustrating, unfair mess of a game.\n\nThe single player is very easy though which goes some way to make up for the problems. In fact the challenge does not come from the actual racing, but from trying to complete those challenges. Some of which are easier to get once you upgrade your vehicles or buy a new one.\n\nTaking the game online does make things better. Human opponents play much better the the computer and when you have a full roster you can see what the developers were trying to achieve. Having said that there are too few cars and tracks meaning that you will see everything the game has to offer in a short space of time.\n\nIf you can live with it's problems and have a few friends who like to play then there is a semi-decent game buried here, if not then you are probably better of spending your hard earned elsewhere.","June 27, 2014","false","55.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I don't generally like racing games as they are simply bording and no fun. CR may have questionable cartoon like graphics, but its a old game, I actually prefer cartoon graphics over real world graphics.  Problem with most racing games is while the graphics are good, it bores the hell out of me as its like driving home from work half the time.\n\nThis game does have some odd bugs but generally they are few and far between.  I only play on the keyboard, it has very limited options but for me its not a problem anyway.\n\nThe game starts slow when you first install it, but this is good as you can get used to the tracks and gameplay. As you win more races and do the challanges you can buy faster engines and update your car. You can do stunts, go flying over ledges and ramps, blow other cars up with a range of weapons, definatly a good old fun game to play.  If you are a fan of F1 type games then you will probably hate CR.  If you want something which is fun to play without huge headaches of learning lots of keys, then CR is definatly worth a try.\n\nI wish the developers would update the game.  oh, and you also need some friends to play as the online gameplay seems to have long since gone.   You can play on your own vs PC cars, which you have to do anyway when you first start playing.\n\n","October 26, 2015","true","164.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","2"

Sadly, I cannot recommend spending more than perhaps 2 or 3 Euro for it. I spent 5 and do somewhat regret it. Nice as it is.\n\n\n[h2]More detail:[/h2]\n\nThe music is OK, but nothing grand - I feel the game could profit immensely if they'd licensed fitting music. As it is, the in-game music is rather repetitive and makes it feel even more like a well-made flash game. (I'm thinking of Nail'D as comparison - without the music that would be only half as good.)\n\nControls are somewhat weird, IMO. It took a while for me to get used to them.\n\nThe tutorial could explain some things better - took me a while to realize what those "collect 2 weapon hit" goals were. (Higher upgrades allow up to three charges - hence the collect 2).\nI'm still not sure how to complete some of the stunt goals - likely I need a different car for that.\n\nSome weapon upgrades allow for interesting gameplay - you can "drop" weapons, making traps out of them. Quite useful to get rid of the rest of the gang when you're the first and want to keep it that way.\nAlso, definitely get the phase shift upgrade first - being able to store 2 shifts instead of just 1 is very helpful - a shift can cut away quite a part of the track, or help get rid of an annoying bomb someone attached to your car.\n\nThe tracks are sometimes rather confusing - due to the phase shifting there are often multiple ways to get across them, and you don't get a complete map of them, so you'll have to memorize the best routes.","January 5, 2014","true","35.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

In that, it seems to belong to a different era of gaming. The price is obviously exaggerated. This game should be at most 1 euro for a single copy of the game. And that's if there were a workshop, to at least allow the community to improve on the game. A very simplistic game, attempting to be some sort of Mario Kart. Simplistic cars, simplistic mechanics, simplistic graphics (and it still experiences fps drops on a i5 quad core, with a GT640, 2GB card), overall a very simple yet overpriced game.

Considering it's a racer, it' also quite slow and doesn't have great handling.\n\nIt is, however, pretty good fun. I'd recommend giving it a go for the online races and the time trial competitions.\n\nThe cars are split into three classes specialising in weapon strength, speed or tricks. In terms of singleplayer, each course has a number of goals you need to achieve such as bashing a number of opponents or performing a number of aerial moves. You level up aspects of your cars through winning races and fulfilling these criertia, along with competiing in online races.\n\n£6 is a reasonable price I would say, but those who are unsure might be best to wait for a sale. At least this way the online lobbies will be a little busier.","December 8, 2013","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm not long in to the game and just playing single player at the moment but with cross platform multiplayer it's offering something other similar racing games on steam do not\n\nIit may not be worth full price but then who the hell pays full price for any game on steam anymore?","July 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Between this game and an old VCR, I'd rather pic the VCR, because at least the VCR is useful, for parts. My advice? RUN; RUN AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE RIP-OFF! Play something better; heck, even "Need for Speed: Carbon" for the Wii made more sense than this; and it had a better soundtrack, too! This game is just boring GARBAGE.

The game has some VERY odd polygon fragmentation going on unless you lower your settings, but the game looks about the same regardless... if you like to get drunk, or high, & play slower moving kart type games, the few bucks spent on this (esp. if on sale) won't disapoint you... works great with an X360 pad too","June 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Carnage Racing is not a bad game, its actually rather fun, it is just so, so very forgettable. The visuals are stylized and cartoony, and the gameplay is extremely average, There is nothing that makes this game stand out. It almost feels like a mobile port from IOS or Android, Overall though I think you should play this game on the condition that you get it super cheap, or even free. Carnage Racing in my opinion is not worth more than 1 to 3 dollars if you are looking for a not very serious racing game.","July 25, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You can fill up a meter which allows you to create portals at certain points that allow you to take a bit of a shortcut by dropping you further along the track or by putting you on a different path of the track all together. It actually makes for quite an interesting and suprisingly fluid gameplay a you can jump through the track quite quickly.\n\nNext to that you have your missiles, bombs and other equipment to deal with your opponents including another type of portal device that will pull you straight behind an opponent ahead of you. This means that unlike, say MarioKart, there is no need for handicap racing where the lead racer slows down and the ones behind speed up simply because there are enough ways to catch up in otherways.\n\nThe game has a comprehensive tutorial which is worth going through, especially the tricks section as performing tricks allows you to load up your meter a bit faster.\nOnline gameplay seems fairly smooth allowing you to jump in to games easily enough and personally I haven't ran in to many big issues other than ending up stuck after a weird portal jump but that has only happened once in over 20 odd hours of play.\n\nSo far the good bits, now on to the bad.\n\nThe sound is rubbish. I've heard better car sounds from an RC toy car, it is that bad. Weapon sounds are pretty mediocre as well and the music is the same loop again and again and it is uninspired to say the least. Turn off the music and just play your own is my advice. Though it isn't intrusive, it just becomes elevator music.\n\nThe tracks are limited there are realistically only 5 tracks namely beach, town, lava, hangar and temple. However with the portal technique they stitch them together like frankenstein's monster and to be fair it does work quite well, but not well enough as all the tracks start to literally blend together.\n\nThe handling of the cars also leaves much to be desired. The turning circle is awful, while you are racing this isn't an issue you can take the turns of the track at full speed without slowing down anywhere, but if you get knocked around due to flying explosives or other, and you end up facing the wrong way it is infuriatingly difficult to turn around. The easiest way I have found is to roll with it and drive against the flow. The game will then eventually turn you around on its own.\nIt is also rather inconsistent. Sometimes the game will rapidly put you back upright on the track if you find yourself upside down and othertimes you end up waiting for ages before the game decides you are allowed to play once more.\n\nThe cars are rather uninspired, not a lot of variety, and if you have gone through the trouble of unlocking the speedsters you will have an advantage over the other two types negating the need to drive anything else for any reason.\n\nFurthermore once you have upgraded your car with all the bells and whistles, there is no use for any of the cash that just piles up. Yes you can do a bit of pain customisation but it is lacklustre and costs pennies while you have nearly a million accrued.\n\nAll in all the game has a nice idea, and had it been given a bit more polish and a bit more of everything it could have been very good. Instead it is solidly mediocre and in my opinion isn't worth the asking price, there are far better racers out there\n\nHowever that is not to say I'm not having fun with this game. I am, quite a lot infact. racing online or with friends is incredibly good fun, the races only last a few minutes and can be quite a frantic affair so if you see it cheaply (and I mean very cheaply) and are in the mood for some low effort, high entertainment then I do recommend it.","August 5, 2014","true","113.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not amazing and you shouldn't expect it to be for under two dollars with the four pack (current sale price we got it for). However, it's worth the money. Play it with some friends and have a blast. Many laughs to be had. The people reviewing this saying the Microsoft 360 controller does not work are NOT correct. Or maybe it is THEIR controller that doesn't work correctly. I can confirm that my Xbox One controller works perfectly and I played with four friends who were all using Xbox 360 controllers (both wired and wireless). The only thing that doesn't work is you have to use a mouse to navigate through the menus. Can that be annoying? Sure. But we're already on the PC anyway. It's right there in front of you. It's really not that big of a deal.\n\nIf you have friends to play it with give it a try. To each is their own but I honestly enjoy it and I know the four I played with enjoyed themselves as well. 8 player multiplayer is nice if you play on a regular basis with larger groups. Normally we have to have a person sit out or rotate in since most co-op games are 2-4 players so having up to 8 online is a nice touch. I did notice we had a few issues hosting games. Not everyone had to option to choose a level to host when they went into multiplayer so we had to switch off. We did not try to open any ports however so I do not know if that would have fixed the issue for us. We had one race out of 20 something where two people disconnected but other than that everything went smoothly.\n\nPhasing is a neat addition and managing your meter or having it drained by an opponent right before going through a portal and slamming into a wall creates some hilarious moments. The trick system seems a bit hit or miss between choosing front/back flips or spins/rolls. Either way, there is fun to be had. I would not grab this at full price but for a couple dollars, go for it. I have also played the single player and enjoy it as well. I like the challenge system to earn stars to unlock more vehicles as it adds to the replay value. The levels are fun but I do admit a few of them are similar or the same track raced backwards. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a good one!","July 26, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite addictive, considering I am not a racing gamer, admittedly, the the ability to use weapons and buy upgrades for them makes this game much more appealing.","July 28, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
