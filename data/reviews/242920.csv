The little town of Aviono, 20k food, 78 adults, around 12 children, and 15 years in. When the 16th year came around, it all went to hell. A fire started, burning one of the three storage barns stocked with food. I tried to get my little people to fight the fire with the wells nearby. They failed miserably and the other two barns caught fire, (this is about the time I realized putting all my food storages close together was a mistake). The fire started to spread to the wooden houses nearby, so I paused the game and looked up how to fight the damn fire. I figured out prioritizing the fire would help, so I did it and it did the trick. After the fire was put out, I checked out the damage. All my food gone and 5-6 houses destroyed. I knew my first priority should be to get my food back up to support my ever growing population of little people. This is where I realised I had made another mistake. Over 70% of my food was coming from potato farms, and guess what? All of my farms were right next to each other and an infestation started. Farm after farm were getting infected and loosing crops and I had no idea how to stop it. (I'm not one to go back and load and earlier save) So I paused it and looked it up, I couldn't find out how to stop it this time and I let it run it's course. Now the starvation began, and the graveyard began to fill up with little people's grave stones. It was too late to plant crops to get enough food to feed them all, so I basically gave up and watched everyone die a horrible death. I closed my eyes, mourning the loss of the little people that I had led around for so long. Then...I opened my eyes. I had three people still living! One 19 year old male and one 22 year old mother with her 6 year old male child. I had another chance to fix the broken city and save Aviono. This female was my last hope, unless I could get her with a female child, all was lost. So I set them to work tearing down the now unoccupied houses of the original Aviono, since I was almost completely out of materials.  I got them to live close to eachother and waited paitently untill....success! A female child was born. Life was good again. I set my new couple to tearing down everything not needed for materials and the future growth or Aviono. In the end, I had two stone houses, one of every type of resource production buildings, a town hall, and a cemetery (to remind me of the past mistakes). I got my population back up to 16 little people, and I sat back and sighed with relief. I had saved a town.\n\n\nThen I realised that the new towns folk were all inbred children from the three survivors....","March 1, 2015","true","18.5"," 3,156 of 3,219 people (98%) found this review helpful 3,581 people found this review funny","98","156","3","581","51"

Some people have described it as being "zen" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You will build up a large, bustling, seemingly succesfull town only for a small disaster to bring your whole population to it's knees. But when you do succeed, it is oh so satisfying.\n\nThis is the city builder you've been waiting for.\n\nAn example of what can easily happen: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=229238351","February 17, 2014","true","50.6"," 2,739 of 2,877 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","739","2","0","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/recommended/242920/","praxis666","Praxis-[CE]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/","1529 products in account","Banished is the best city builder I've ever played (and I've played a lot, having been a fan of the genre since the original Sim City and the old Sierra historical builder games). The game is deceptively simple, you start with a few settlers and minimal supplies and you build a thriving settlement. Sounds easy enough, but it's probably one of the most challenging games I've played.\n\nThere are a variety of crops, animals, and natural resources. Your setttlers will plant and gather and use these to build a rustic town. Steel tools and stone houses represent the pinnacle of your settlement's technological advancement. You can barter goods with a few visiting tradesmen and some nomads may periodically ask to join your settlement, but that's the limit of your outside contact. Peace reigns, you won't need any military (or even police) here. The only hostile forces you will encounter in Banished are tornadoes, fires, diseases, starvation, and cold. And you will encounter them, a lot.\n\nAlthough the game is relaxing to play, it can at times be incredibly difficult. Your settlement might be going along nicely for 100 years, with plenty of food and lots of citizens available to fill all the jobs that need to be done, and suddenly everyone has cholera and you're closing down the schoolhouse to free up some child laborers to expand your cemetary. Banished is brutal that way. But it's also beautiful. The music and graphics and effects are really appealing, and the immersion factor is high. It's definitely one of those games you can sit down to in the early afternoon and play for hours and hours and then be surprised to find your stomach growling and oh hey when did it get so dark outside?\n\nThe developer is very active and involved in the community, and new features are added often. Now the game offers modding capability and Steam Workshop. So far the community has responded with some amazing tweaks and additions which only make the game even better (also a little easier, if you find the challenge a bit much).\n\nI can't wait to see how Banished continues to evolve, which it seems to do in much the same way that my tiny settlements grow and evolve, with all of the little details coming together to make something really satisfying and enjoyable.","October 24, 2014","true","34.7"," 1,419 of 1,483 people (96%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","96","419","1","25","21"

I found that if I devoted my entire town to be a plumb nation so to speak, nothing could stop me. I dedicated all my time to plumb manufacturing. I set up a trading post and traded my vast abundance of plumbs for clothing and materials. After my brief time on this game I really feel I discovered the true value of plumbs in todays society and will never take them for granted again.\nFor example for 10 years in a row I found my population to be stagnant and it hovered around the 66 citisen mark (not including children) for these 10 years. My solution to this was simple, I set up plumb farms all across the coast, from what I can gather with my basic understanding of immigration, traders come into my city on canoes and see the plumbs, they then return to their families after trading their iron and coal for my nations plumbs, they tell their families tales of he great plumb nation, then they tell friends and co-workers. This all led to the great population inflation of 18AD.\nAfter 10 years of 66 citisens I grew to 88, many historians argue this was due to a better education system and advancements in stone houses and such. But these people are heretics and should be shakled and plumbed to death. Of course the real reason was due to plumb based immigration. Unfortunately the great mine collapse of 18AD saw the death of 15 good miners, so this countered the growth, I decided to close all mines and quarries and focus solely on plumbs and the occasional gatherer for berries.\n\nAll in all I would give plumb simulator 2014 a 9/10 would deffo play again.","November 9, 2014","true","44.6"," 1,447 of 1,552 people (93%) found this review helpful 1,282 people found this review funny","93","447","1","282","35"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/242920/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Banished is a distillation of what a lot of city-building fans missed from newer SimCity games.  It’s a smart, fun twist on the concept -- instead of ruling over a metropolis through a mayor’s lens, you play a more intricate role in the development of a small colony.  Every citizen is somebody you can see and control (though not directly), and your role is to see that your citizens are well-fed, happy, and warm through the long winters.  The result is a more nuanced and satisfying game than the EA flagship franchise which inspired it.\n\nEvery Banished game starts on a randomly generated map, where you control a small band of settlers (about 10 adults and 10 children) who have ostensibly been banished from wherever they came from.  You have nothing but the minimal supplies they carried with them, and the resources of the land around you.  Your first objective is to survive the coming winter, which you can do by building houses, creating a source of food (a fishing dock or gatherer’s hut would do), and a source of heat for winter (firewood).  All of these things require resources such as lumber, stone, and iron, which your citizens can scrounge from the land around them.\n\nAfter the first winter, your options explode.  The basic idea is to increase the population of your town by building homes, while balancing the basic needs of the citizens with the resources required for those needs.  Every citizen in your town is a resource as well; the player personally assigns jobs to accomplish every task, and must make sure their labor force is well balanced and not spread too thin.  Should the population dip and you no longer have enough farmers, for instance, the consequences can be dire.\n\nAll of this may sound a little daunting, and it can be, but Banished provides a helpful tutorial at the outset to ease the difficulty curve a bit.  I was able to get rolling with my city and survive my first winter with its help.  The mechanics are satisfying and relatively deep, although after 20 hours or so I found myself finding a groove and more or less following a formula for increasing the population of my town.  It was still fun to see my town sprawl across the map (which can be sizeable), but the gameplay got a bit tired.\n\nBanished does come with robust mod support and for those who find themselves growing tired of the gameplay, there is an extensive library of mods which breathe new life into the game.  Colonial Charter is a large mod which adds an incredible amount of new content and greatly extends the life of Banished.  It’s great to see mod support for a game like this, and it’s a shining example of why we should see more mod support for games going forward.\n\nOverall, I’d recommend Banished to anyone pursuing that city simulation itch, but finding themselves disappointed with recent EA offerings.  Populations of your city won’t rocket into the millions, but the level of control and visibility into the workings of the simulation is very satisfying.  It’s a game which, while probably inspired by games like SimCity, does plenty to establish itself in this genre with new ideas.","January 25, 2015","true","20.7"," 437 of 446 people (98%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","98","437","446","17","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattsie/recommended/242920/","mattsie","Mutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattsie/","123 products in account","After over 100 hours of playing it is definitely time that I write a review for this game.\nI bought Banished on a whim during the summer sales, I played lots of Sim City 2000 during my childhood and I was after another game like that but of course at the time Cities Skylines was out of my budget, so after a bit of YouTube research I added this to my games collection.\n\nWhen I started my first village I was completely lost, in fact my first four or five villages were complete failures. This game had a lot to balance up, a constant battle for resources that I always seemed to lose, it was very frustrating at first and I almost abandoned the game with about five hours playtime. I took to YouTube again and learnt the basics of making it through winter and keeping up with farming and eventually I made it past the usual three year mark and got a village that was actually growing and moving forward. With the town in full swing I was able to expand further and further, making smaller communities that would join with marketplaces and eventually with trading ports to bring animals, all leading up to the town hall which is great for prediciting resource consumption, housing needs and allowing the entry of nomads.\n\nAt this point I was spending almost entire days just tending to my village, I built a huge bridge spanning across a lake to connect up two distant communities and made both self reliant, with each year adding more houses, schools, forester lodges and so on. The problem is that if you don't maintain just one element of your village, the collapse is VERY sudden. One year my sheep got sick and this affected the whole herd, meaning I had to kill them all; in tern this meant that my tailor couldn't make the highest quality coats and since I didn't change the settings to a lower material, I had no coats stockpiled for winter, leading to many of my villagers freezing to death.\n\nMy newest village is going strong with around 280 citizens but everything lies in the balance, the further you get the more you have to keep track of, but it feels very rewarding to make it through a year without someone starving to death. I have to juggle my farmers around so that once a harvest is finished they are then pushed into the mines and quarries to retrieve resources until spring comes again, if I forget to change that option in time then that causes a huge drop in my food production, so yeah you need to stay on top of everything. My screen is usually covered with all my building objectives that need to be filled and the town hall stats that will show where to put my labourers.\n\nThat all being said, Banished isn't going to be a game you will return to every week, I could play for days on end at first but now its a bit intimidating returning to my town, that could be because of the stress of it all. The music can get quite repetitive but overall I did really enjoy the soundtrack, very appropriate for the theme of the game, but when you hear the music on start up everytime it can just get you out of the mood of playing, i'd put a playlist of your own on standby if you're going to play for more than two or so hours. I have been lucky to avoid most of the in game disasters unlike other players but that can be toggled to your preference. I agree with some players that there could have been a few more build options on top of what there is, more types of housing is something I would have enjoyed, but i've been playing without any mods so far and haven't felt the need (yet) to go in search for them.\n\nOnce you get your first successful town, the game is very cosy and its great to have the different map seeds with flat land or valleys to spice things up. You are going to need patience at first that is for sure, look up guides if you get caught in the lag of the first few years and that will help move things forward. The art style is quite detailed for such a small game and the camera feature that lets you cut back and forth to far apart settlements is so useful, in fact many of the shortcuts available make management of the game a lot less stressful as you go along.\n\nBanished is a game I would definitely recommend to anyone I know. While it has difficulty options available to you, I would say this game is for people in that middle zone with it being a bit challenging for casual players and maybe lacking that complexity a more hardcore simulator player would prefer. Go watch some videos and add it to your wishlist!\n\n","September 17, 2015","true","111.7"," 361 of 374 people (97%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","97","361","374","19","1"

However, six fishermen in a village of seven people was not enough, and I quickly learned this as I watched all my young adults starve once more. I still had two people left.

Well let me help you out with that. First take the time to look at these two youtubers, Start with TotalBiscuit's WTF is ... Banished, still interested? Now take the time to watch quill18's "Let's play : Banished" it has 18 videos of game play for you to sink your mind into.\nNow that you've taken the time to watch the video's take this into consideration. This game was devoloped by a one man show , Luke Hordorowicz. (Shining Rock Software) He started making this game in Aug. 2011 and in 3 years has made something I have been really enjoying. This game isn't really a city/town builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading hordes, ninja's, bandits or jabba-walkies, but to me it's not needed. Micro managing your town is plenty, for now. There is going to be mod support for this and with the talent I've seen out there I'm sure new buildings and other things you might miss will surely be added.\nThe game itsself does start at a slow pace like most building games. (there is the ability to increase the speed x2, x5, x10) but that can change pretty fast. My first two towns ended up ghost towns from thinking I could afk for 10 mins. Lesson learned. Starvation, disease, fire, etc. will make short work of your town if not ready for it and it willl happen. There is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader. Exchanging items your town has crafted for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, placing a bunch of houses down and not having food for your new rapid growing town will end poorly.\nThis game isn't meant to be rushed, take time to pause the game and look at your map and plan ahead. There is no winning in Banished only failing. You either find the right groove and keep getting bigger or watch your little towns people turn into compost. Three dificulty levels, I find medium or hard a lot more fun. Random map generator which is nice to see. 3 different map sizes, plus a choice of valleys or mountains. Weather and seasons, and plenty more.\nIn closing I'd like to say the game is worth 19.99$ and honestly I find any game I can spend hours playing on the first day well worth my money. I've bought 60$ games from the big AAA companies and either have them beat in 5-6 hours or lose interest in 30 minutes. This game is going on my favorites list for sure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/242920/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Banished strips the complexities of the city-building genre to their essentials. Shining Rock Software has rolled the genre back to the middle ages. There's no sewer system to manage, no power grid to maintain. Just a group of settlers pushing into the wilderness, and a wilderness that pushes back.This simplicity creates a focused game in Banished. It starts as an intimate simulation and grows to be a taut, strategic experience.\n\nBanished feels more like a survival simulation than a traditional city builder. I was plopped into the middle of the wilderness with a dozen people and some supplies, which they immediately began consuming. The race was on to clear enough land to plant crops and build houses before winter.\n\nEach step in this arduous process is shown off by delicate animations that give life to the individual tasks. And each of those animations has a one-to-one relation to the city's production. Ask a citizen to fell a tree, and watch as they chop it down, carry back and deposit a single wood resource into the town's storage. Banished's towns look like a busy little ant colonies from afar, but all the activity is something more. The game rewards careful study, and those rewards made me begin to care about my little citizens.\n\nAt the expense of making laborers anonymous, Banished provides an enormous amount of control over their virtual lives. The game's mechanics are closely tied to the cycle of the seasons, so in the spring and early summer I shifted everyone into the fields for planting. In the autumn I pulled laborers out of the mines to bring in the harvest. With such high-level strategy driving my decisions, I felt like a leader, not just a deity pushing at abstracted levers. While I couldn't get to know my citizens as individuals, I had control over their lives.\n\nThis worked perfectly until the mid-game, where the simulation gets tedious. Once I pushed the population over 50 workers it became less about dictating the free time of each individual and more about the careful accounting of performance of the population as a whole. But at this level of gameplay, Banished struggles with giving players solid feedback on their actions. For instance, a gatherer will roam the area around town and carry back little baskets of roots and berries. But when the forest has been picked clean they just mutely wander. You have to zoom in, below the trees, and check to see if their hands are full. When you're tracking a small population of workers on a one-to-one basis, this is fine. When the population has ballooned, it becomes a major frustration.\n\nThe struggle for information makes Banished especially difficult at points. As I swung wildly from feast to famine and back again, lots of people were left cold and hungry. Entire towns died off before I had an understanding of how to cycle through methods of generating food in order to reliably collect enough to make it through each winter. And even then it was more guesswork than fact; let's try hunting more this year, fishing more the next. While future towns benefitted from my experience, Banished put me through an emotional wringer to earn any pride I felt for my little ant farm.\n\nMy only comfort during these tough times was to zoom into the gorgeous fully 3D world. Banished looks phenomenal, and it ran without a hitch at maximum settings, even in the late game when my town of nearly 200 began to sprawl across several screens. At such a large scale Banished resembles a little clockwork machine with hundreds of tiny parts. And as the movement began to slow, the complexity of the simulation allowed me to easily pull off the gears and reassemble them in clever ways. When a disaster, say an infestation of insects, began to attack the crops, I pulled workers from the quarry to quickly bring in the harvest. At the same time I repositioned workers from the coal mine to clear more land for fast-growing, alternative crops. It was a joy to find that sometimes my improvised solutions even worked.\n\nBanished demands your attention. It's a game that shows instead of tells, and at times I wish it had told me more. I failed over and over again as I got my bearings. But the grand scale of those failures just made my improvements feel all the more genuine. Past the steep learning curve and trial-and-error gameplay of Banished lies a methodically crafted labor of love that is as precise as it is thrilling.","November 16, 2015","true","116.4"," 226 of 239 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","226","239","8","0"

I've played multiple games, with my best reaching a population of approx 900 people before the wheels fell off. I've played easy, medium and hard. I've read all of the guides  on the wiki, the forums, and even Reddit. I really, really wanted to love this game. I waited for it to come out for what felt like *ages*, stalking this guy's FB page for update info. And I am just so sad that I can't love it.\n\nWhy? The inconsistencies. I am a creature of habit. I place all my buildings  in a predictable pattern, and I'm a hoarder by nature so I'm very careful about pathing to ensure maximum efficiency of the workers. And yet, despite my consistency in behavior and detail, there is no consistency in output. In one game, 2 woodcutters will provide enough firewood for a population of 120 with firewood to spare. In another game, 14 woodcutters cannot keep the same population afloat, despite over 4k backlog in wood. Woodcutters placed directly beside stockpile containing 2k logs. Woodcutter (A) will cut 42 logs in a season, while Woodcutter (B) will cut 298 logs in the same season, and Woodcutter (C) might cut 3 logs that season. All three are educated, and are situated in homes very close by. Their food is supplied by the gatherer and hunter that are always paired with foresters on my maps. They want for nothing, but they do not work.\n\nThis is a problem that I find repeatedly throughout the game. You want a field of about 40x40 cleared, so you free up  100 or so laborers, prioritize that field and wait for them to get to work! And you wait.... and you wait.... and you wait. You re-prioritize the field. You de-select everything else on the map for clearing. You wait..... 8 seasons have passed, and your field is not cleared. 8 seasons of 100 laborers that could have been doing any number of other things.\n\nThis is a randomly occurring problem within the game. You could go 50 seasons without a hitch, before you get a spike of random unproductiveness. Whole fields can produce less than 50 food per year, woodcutters that just dont show up for work, miners that idle the entire season away in the Cemetary.\n\nOh! And for funsies, when you get a disease outbreak, and the diseased persons refuse to go to any of your multiple, fully staffed hospitals for treatment! They just wander the map, going about their business like Typhoid Mary from Hell. Every town center I make gets a hospital, and the sick folks generally find their way to them in short order. However, every now and then, you will get a Typhoid Mary who will inflict their disease on 100+ of your population before they finally die.\n\nYeah, inconsistent.\n\n","October 18, 2014","false","148.2"," 1,822 of 2,330 people (78%) found this review helpful 134 people found this review funny","78","822","2","134","113"

From humble beginnings - just a few families exiled from their past lives and a handful of supplies - you will have the opportunity to build up a thriving community.\n\nWhile Banished has all the footprints of a typical city-building game, it sets itself apart from the rest by including a diverse pool of resources to manage, each with impacts on your villagers’ happiness, health, and productivity. Each citizen adds to your total consumption, meaning you cannot afford to be complacent; you must always be planning ahead lest famine or disease wipe out most of your population. You must also manage your labor force (working adults), and should do so as efficiently as possible in order to minimize their struggle to survive.\n\nThe setting and the art-style compliment the survival theme quite well. There is never any doubt that you are building a barebones medieval-era town - all the buildings are made from wood and stone and the whole thing feels very quaint. The seasons change, which has both a visual effect as well as creating a growth cycle for plants and crops (can’t farm during the winter!).\n\nAs the years progress, your population ages, has children, and eventually passes away leaving the newer generations to repeat the circle of life... that is if they haven’t suffered any misfortunes along the way. Merchants will periodically visit and trade crop seeds, farm animals, and all kinds of goods once you’ve built a trading post. Wandering nomads may choose to settle in your town if you allow them.\n\nThere is a healthy variety of crops and buildings, and there is also Workshop/mod support. Although the modkit for Banished is only fresh out of beta, there is already a significant amount of additional content that improves the base game immensely. For example, the Colonial Charter mod provides a complete overhaul of the game with tons of new resources, buildings, and production chains.\n\nIf city-building games are something you enjoy, I cannot recommend Banished enough. This was one of my most anticipated releases of 2014 and it has definitely lived up to my expectations (and then some). A word of caution though, there are many hardships ahead; this is in no way an "easy" game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=335650501","November 4, 2014","true","93.2"," 171 of 192 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","171","192","0","2"

I've played for 10 hours and I've basically seen everything this game has to offer, I've maintained a population of around 190 people, built all the buildings in the game, expanded a far distance across a large map, and kept my whole population 4.5/5 happy and healthy for the entire duration of my playtime, the only thing left me to do is just build more houses.... in turn building more food->wood->woodcutter infrastructures to help maintain this.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed this game, the graphics, the design, the art, the mechanics, the game is extremely short and lacking in more... I don't know stuff. I know that it is only a 1 man team, and for that He's done something amazing. I just can't help but feel this game could be one of the best city-building games out there, if there were more things to do, maybe an advancement in technology (not like, pewpew-lazers), or perhaps the option to build larger houses, or more entertainment facilities, or just more buildings in general. Basically the game turned into the same, repeat infrastructure too fast and to soon in, where-as similiar games had a lot more longevity to them, such as Anno 2070 just to put as an example.\n\nIn closing, I would say this game was really fun to play, I am just saddened that it has nothing left to offer me after only 10 hours of play, I really want to play more, but there is literally nothing to do, just build more wood gatherers, and more food... and then more woodcutters to supply the demand, thats it........ It's too easy to keep your people happy/healthy and in turn disaters came few and far between, and once you get into the big population numbers random deaths don't have any impact when your playing around with a standing work force of 15-20 larbourers at any given time.\n\nRegards\n","February 19, 2014","false","27.6"," 1,027 of 1,353 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","027","1","0","55"

Set in the era of middle ages/horse and cart/pilgrims this is a very pretty game with a very simple to learn playstyle. There are no goals except for achievements and it's what makes this fascinating.\n\nA plodding "city" builder with a balancing act like no other. The skills, the knowledge and the subtle finesse needed to make a city survive past a few hundred is nothing short of a miracle on some maps. Errors in planning are usually not detected until well into a game and are usually the result of something you did a long time ago. You will then either suffer "Aha" moments or pound your keyboard in frustration when you realise what you were *supposed* to do.\n\nFrom hero to zero in minutes.\n\nThe balance in this is superb. Everything suffers cause and effect. Too many sheep creating too much wool that fills the barns that prevents the harvest that causes the people to starve is just one example. SO just build more barns yeah? Then wood becomes scarce and the toolmaker runs out. So no tools are made and you run out and nobody can do anything. Including the toolmaker! Scrambling around grabbing every bit of iron and wood to make tools so you can harvest so the people don't starve. Or freeze to death!\n\nA wicked dev made this and he's a clever one. I've spent a long time looking for those little exploits that circumvents game logic and give me an "I win" button but I can't find one. Even the data that might give you clues to what is going wrong (or right) is cleverly hidden despite appearing to have lots of data at your disposal.  After many hours of losing your perfect cities, again and again, you will understand what I mean here.\n\nNot that it matters. There is an evil monster lurking in the background of every game.\n\nMeet "The Cascade".\n\nIt's that horrible nagging doubt in the back of your mind that the map you've just spent hours, even days on,  is doomed. Death for all is inevitable.  You *know* something is not right and you try to overcompensate but you cause supply problems elsewhere and create even more problems.\n\nAnd your whole town dies. Quickly.\n\nAs your cemetary fills up, you madly juggle the myriad of tasks each citizen must undertake until... NO... he/she died too!!  After the cascade crash of most of population, you may be left with enough to regrow but be careful now. You need to make the corrections to prevent it happening again. Can you? Will you?\n\nYou won't.  You will reseed another map and start all over again, ever the wiser. "I'll put the farms over there and the fishing huts here and the market here and the mine there and the church here and.... and.... and....."\n\nYou'll die anyway. It's unavoidable. It's inevitable.  Unsustainable growth will kill you. Every time.\n\nA lesson for us all perhaps?\n\ngg\n9/10\n\nPS: A few more hours after writing this review I finally pulled the 900 citizens achievement.

No real upgrades for the buildings, and even the stone houses burn to a cinder, costing lots of resources to even build it.\n\nThe Ai never amounted to anything, as the people moved in and out of buildings often times leaving an age 10 by themselves, or an age 60, even tho there are more than enough spaces to support 15 people. And they won't let anyone join them. The long house actually prevents the people from having children, tho in the Nordic times, The Vikings only lived in longhouses, raised the children as a community.\n\nWells on every corner, when a fire breaks out, and no one bothers to draw water and even try to put the fires out.\n\nNo in game rewards for accomplishing anything at all, make the people happy, keep them happy, eventually they all starve to death, cause they can't do anything after building on your city for so long.\n\nFarmers/hunter/gathers all starve cause they refuse to eat the food they are carriing when hungry, rather they go to the storage bin, unload, walk around and starve before going back to grab food to take home.\n\nEven after forcing specific people into particular homes close to where they are supposed to work and store food, after a short time, they had moved, and their job description changes on it's own.\n\nschools in the game are pointless, as they are supposed to be educated, yet they do not act like they are.\n\nHospitals in game are useless, sickness happens, and they all refuse to go see the doctor.\n\nUp till those points the game is relaxing and lazy for the most part, tho leaves lots open. Sure, your people have been bannished, from where, and why? Why does the incomming trader always insist on charging exortionist prices for an item? And why does the trader always come in on a boat? Where is the caravan traders? How does my chicken farmer get trampled to death? (must of just laid down with a bucket of grain on the other side, then as the chickens past, must of molted and dropped feathers in their mouth, but then that would be suffocation, not trampling... meh) Where are the wild animals that randomly attack the villagers that stray too far away? Or the child that wanders too close to the stream that drowns, cause the parents don't teach their child to swim? Passing down of knowlage from elder to child, as in the days of old? You were born and taught a craft by your parents in the eura the game is supposed to be set in.\n\nAt $5.00 this base game would be worth getting, for it's simplistic laziness, more than that, I would consider to be a waist of time and money. After waiting a year and a half for some sort of steam update, (to fix the bugs) and none happening, I finally removed it from my system. For the listed price, it is not worth paying for, even on sale it's not that great.\n\nIf you want true fixes, you have to turn to the modding community. Where their hard work and effort makes the game more enjoyable. (not even going to bother, as the maker of the game didn't even try do it themself)\n\nKnowing my post is negative, chances are it will be voted unhelpfull into oblivion... Would mention other games that the dev(s) are actually updating their product through steam even long after actual release dates.","February 22, 2015","false","55.1"," 618 of 849 people (73%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","73","618","849","48","28"

The developer deserves all the praises he can get.\n\nAAA quality game under 300 mb. Reminds of good ol' days of PC gaming when hardcore coders not artists / modders used to make games.\n\nYes its true that 'reinventing the wheel' is waste of resources. But it doesn't mean to forcefully fit the same wheel on every cart/car regardless of its purpose and size. When game are made from scratch with less reliance on generic ready made engines or recycled tools and more under the hood coding, they require less resources and run blazingly fast even on old hardware.\n\nAnd that is the first thing you will notice with Banished. You can feel the engine underneath while playing. It feels like you just need to press a hidden button to see everything in code Matrix style. It reminds me of the days playing Quake 3 Arena.  Very raw yet very crispy.\n\nBanished is developed by a lone coder so it doesn't have detailed tutorials, introductory videos and all other sorts of  babysitting that gamers of today have gotten used to. But for someone like me that just adds to its appeal of truly open ended sandbox game. The difficulty I had to stop letting my village starved to death was the best part of the game. And I think that is how the game should be played. Stop reading guides and experiment on your own. Because that is what the game is all about. There is no specific objectives in the game. How city building games should be. The way they are meant to be played.\n\nHaving said that, the game doesn't have a huge scope like that of Total War or Civilization games. So without multiplayer, it's not a game that you can keep on playing forever. So don't rush it. Enjoy the game and try different things.\n\nThis game will appeal to you if you are a gamer who likes to explore, experiment, decorate and set your own objectives. But if you are someone who likes hand holding, being told what to do while following scripted sequences one after another with specific objectives to accomplish than look elsewhere.\n\nHighly recommended!\n","November 8, 2015","true","98.2"," 120 of 142 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","120","142","4","1"

No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building. Remember when you paid $60 for Simcity and EA kicked you in the junk? This is the exact opposite of that.\n\nIt's an amazingly fun and intense game. Some people have described it as being "zen" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry.

The fact that instead of the generic cookie cutter city builder type game which largely revolves around money as the sole resource and currency of the game, the element of having to make sure you produce actual resources to support a community instead of just cash is one of my favorite features of the game.\n\nThey've put a lot of work in to this game since I initially bought it many moons ago when getting the Tenure achievement was nigh on impossible due to either A) crashing and losing your save on a semi regular basis after a certain point B) horrific priority designation on villagers who would always die to starvation every year because they lived on the complete other side of the map and despite passing barns and markets a plenty did not stop for food (I think I went hoarse once actually screaming at them because I lost like 60 in one winter alone) or C) you got blocked by resource production and trade capability in the tools area since after a certain point it's easier just to trade for tools rather than produce them and the trading posts were severly undercapped from where they needed to be and are now. Now all those things have been fixed and I just need to sit down and get the last couple achievments....\n\nNegatives I would have to say are the fact that population growth can be a royal pain and a half. Either you've for villagers not popping out babies fast enough and suddenly you've got only about 40 students when you've been operating for the last two hours with twelve fully loaded school houses. Or you can so easily overcompensate and just mass spam houses to the point where not long from then you've got a baby boom on your hands and whereas you once had over 100K food in every category you're now frantically trading with every merchant you can to just simply bulk up food reserves to survive again. It's a tricky balance to maintain as it's easy to forget until it's too late, but if you can master it then you'll thrive.\n\nOverall a game well worth the price and the time spent playing it.","October 27, 2014","true","337.2"," 123 of 147 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","123","147","0","0"

Let me tell you what you do in it:\n-Get banished from the kingdom of ?????? because you and the rest of the inhabitants did ????????\n-Grow crops\n-Dig giant holes in the ground\n-Dig giant implied holes in the side of a mountain\n-Have a family of two hog the first and only house in the village so far while everyone else freezes outside\n-Occasionally have a trader row (just row. there's no land trade to speak of so even if you're in a relatively flat area where you'd expect caravans you just get one ♥♥♥♥ in a row boat) and try to barter some beans with you\n-Make a church so the already insanely happy people are even happier\n-Make a tavern so the already insanely happy people are even happier, and drunk\n-Make a hospital so everyone doesn't die from the chicken pox or something\n-Make a town hall so you can get pretty graphs and detailed accounts on how many potatoes Joe Blow has stuffed in his kitchen cupboard\n\nAnd, well, that's pretty much it. Nothing wrong with that. It's a great start and I do enjoy what little there is. My issue comes with the "completed" status and the fact I've seen maybe one update since I bought the game several months ago (which as far as I can tell was mostly just bugfixes). There's simply not enough game here.\n\nLike I said, it's fun. I won't deny I enjoy watching my little lemming men run around, chop trees, and build roads so straight and villages so organized it'd send the Romans into a fit of envy. I'm just left wondering "what about all the other stuff?" Where are the wild animals that tear lonely loggers to shreds if they venture too far from town? The bandits and barbarians who threaten to raze the city if they don't get a tribute of food? As far as I can tell getting banished from ?????? for ?????? (It really doesn't fill you in on any of this. I'm sure someone will pass it off as "leaving it up to the player" but anyone with any idea of how to write things can tell you that's lazy writing) was more of a blessing than a curse, because if you don't make outright stupid decisions your village will be flourishing in a matter of years, and there's just not enough to threaten that prosperity. The winters mean less and less as your wooden buildings are turned to stone and your leather coats are lined with the wool from the sheep you traded six trillion beans for. Outbreaks are handled quickly and efficiently by the magical witch doctor that just rubs some plants on the afflicted's face until they're suddenly better. The only thing that will eventually theoretically threaten your village (assuming you play this long before getting bored) is running out of room for graveyards from all the people that eventually die from old age, and I'm sure even that could be avoided by keeping everyone happy enough they don't care Old Man Jenkins's carcass was thrown into the woods for the nonexistent wolves to tear apart.\nI'm not really angry. I'm just disappointed. There's too little game here where there should be, and I'm finding myself questioning the legitimacy of its "completedness". I'm sure I'll be Not Helpfulled into oblivion by the raving drones that insist it was money well spent and can't take a lick of criticism, but all I can say is welcome to the reviews section, kids.","October 9, 2014","false","23.3"," 876 of 1,238 people (71%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","71","876","1","71","32"

It blends city building and survival well... a little too well. Well enough for any goal to merge into one. This makes long playthroughs boring for there are barely any goals to achieve beyond building up your population, feeding your population, surviving a disaster or two, rinse, repeat. If the game were to have a larger array of feature then it'd be even better. So I give it a 75/100.\n\nMy ideas on how the game can be improved-\n-add another entity other than yourself in the world. It's a good single player game but it gets a little lonely. Maybe add various NPCs to the game.\n-NPC houses, towns, settlements etc. Places where the player has to connect a path to so that an exchange can be made. Maybe have specialastions varying from a farming town (sells crops over a period of a year for tools), mining town (sells iron and stone for food and other items) and a lumber town (sells wood and firewood for tools and food).\n-NPC raiders or equal threat. A disaster event: a group of hostiles temporarily take over your town, slowly draining 50% of your food. To get rid of you must build a police station of sorts and train militia to protect your town. After they have been defeated they have a lower percentage of coming back to your town, until the threat equals 0.\n-Multiplayer- build a seperate towns in seperate areas of a MASSIVE map. To trade, you either must build a trade port and assign people to be merchants and fill boats with materials, or build a road to their town and assign people to be caravans to begin trade. Caravans should have a chance of being raided so (from earlier) the police should be able to protect it.\n\nThose are my ideas, if anyone thinks this should be in the game then why not send messeges to the creater to get this in.

Full disclosure I used to work with Luke.\n\nThat being said, Banished is a lot of fun.  It's a tremendous balancing act, managing your town's growth while harvesting resources and not getting yourself stretched too thin.  As other reviewers have seen, you can cross the tipping point quickly and go from thriving town to ghost town in a matter of minutes.  In every game I played I always felt like I was on the razor's edge between success and failure and that my every action meaningfully tipped the scales.\n\nIt's fun theorizing about different strategies, from being heavily into farming or trying for one of the very difficult achievements.  The many layers to the game kept me coming back.  I find myself wanting to see if I can progress any further with my next town, or if I'm doomed to make the same mistakes that have brought my previous towns down.\n\nCongrats Luke for making an oustanding game.  I'm happy I've gotten to see your vision here and I'm unbelievably impressed with what you were able to accomplish.","February 18, 2014","true","103.6"," 95 of 119 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","95","119","0","1"

People start buring coal instead, which means you're no longer able to make Steel Tools, then everybody's productivity gets cut in half because there's a shortage of tools, then a bunch of people die from starvation, but because there are now so many empty houses, the survivors breed like rabbits and your city is flooded with hungry children that can't work.\n\nThe worst part is that there's no way to stop them from switching to coal. People will starve without the slightest objection even if they're currently tending an orchard full of fruit, but if they get a little cold, they'll happily destroy your entire supply chain and doom your civilization just for a few extra minutes of warmth.","June 21, 2015","false","17.0"," 88 of 112 people (79%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","79","88","112","37","4"

It's got the same kind of "one more turn" addictiveness that the Civ games are known for, without the megalomania.\n\nYou start with a bunch of villagers. If you started on Easy, you'll have a good amount of people with a storage barn, houses, crops and orchard seeds. Pick Hard and you'll have a smaller pool of people, no barn, no houses, no crops to plant, and no seeds. If your village spawns in a decent area where they can scrounge/hunt for food until they get traders coming in with seeds/livestock, they'll likely survive, albeit not very happily. If you spawn in some ♥♥♥♥ ass dip valley surrounded by mountains and only a tiny stream running nearby... well, good luck.\n\nWhy were these people banished? No reason is given, make your own. I like to think it's because they can potentially muddy the gene pool with stupidity.\n\nThe villagers have the same level of intelligence as Sims in Sims 2 - as in, they'll do the job you give them, but not necessarily in the best way (they'll take the longest route to get tools and deliver raw materials, for example). Sometimes they'll go hungry even as they're carrying crates of fruit to the barn, or freeze to death because they didn't pick up a new coat. If you leave your computer with this game running while you go do Real Life things, you might come back to DEATH.\n\nMy record so far is 4 deaths by starvation and 3 by dysentery in the time it takes to get myself some coffee.\n\n10/10 best coffee I've ever had.","January 2, 2015","true","33.9"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","96","46","48","46","1"

The only flaw is that the mechanics are limited. It would been perfect with the addition of a military component and increasing the realism, but that's another story ...\nI would absolutely recommend, but lacks the X factor to make it perfect.\nIt's a game that request initially attempts and experience, not recommended for casual players.

Just about everything in this game screams mediocrity, but it's a new(ish) game in a somewhat dead genre so, if this is something you find appealing but are on the fence, I say grab it at a steep discount (ten dollars is too much). You'll have some fun and for a few bucks you just can't go wrong. The reason I don't recommend the game is, when faced with the full asking price, the game's issues are too glaring for me to conscionably recommend. At the current ten dollar sale price as of me writing this review, I say you're far better off grabbing one of the Impressions Games classics off GOG. I first bought Pharoah with money I got for Christmas when I was nine years old, and I still boot that game up from time to time. It's disappointing to see issues present in Banished that weren't present in a game released 15 years ago and weighing in at 490 MB (with a content-packed expansion/spin-off game). The inability to give instructions to a specific villager was beyond frustrating in a modern game, and the random idling is off the charts. All of these games have citizen idling, but I've never seen it to such an extent, even on the easy setting, clueing you in that it's an issue with the design.\n\nIt's terrible to be expanding your population, with your food supply being constrained as a result, only to have people starve because your workers suddenly decide that they've had enough of harvesting, leaving upwards of 25% of your crop to rot. What's more is the remarkable inconsistence with food output, particularly if you don't mouse over a particular area for a little while. I'm decently positive the game simulates items not in view at a different speed than the one you've set, causing obvious issues if you don't constantly observe your entire city. But oftentimes, there's simply nothing to be done, your villagers plant a pumpkin patch, one of the quickest farms in the game and one that often is harvested before even the start of autumn, only this time for them to never finish planting the field for some unknown reason. Compounding this is the fact they may or may not get the crops in time before winter, regardless of what you do, where the storage buildings are located, or when harvest begins.\n\nAs I said, I enjoy this game, but I simply can't believe the developers would decide such a bare-bones (only two map styles!), buggy and downright flawed game was ready for release. Do yourself the favor and skip this unless there's a heavy discount and you're unwilling to play games from the 90s.","November 6, 2014","false","32.3"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","49","61","0","0"

Its well-made tutorial is probably worth the current £4.5 (~$6) price tag by itself.\n\nOh, the apprehension when the ground first turns white and the relief of surviving each of the first few winters. The feeling of hope and comfort when the first merchant boat arrives and you feel you're not isolated from the outside world any more. This game is beautiful and it invites beautiful emotions and feelings when you play it. Amazing.\n\nCons:\nThis is a (very) positive review but there are so many positive reviews out there I'll start with the cons just to contrast (in order of importance):\nNot that challenging for the veterans of the genre.\nA bit repetitive once your town has enough resources to keep going.\nA few very small interface quirks.\nLike not having proper diagonal roads or not being able to expand crops/orchards/stockpiles/etc. without removing and rebuilding, or even the possibility of non-rectangular buildings of these types.\nSounds can get annoying (try to keep your camera next to a quarry/mine/blacksmith for a while and a headache is likely).\nInformation about some mechanics could be more clear.\nWhat comes to mind now is the number of houses needed (do I have people who want a new house?) or which elements impact on the number of babies that are generated. But overall the amount of information is great, see "pros" below.\nReally, that's it. Despite what people say though, this is not really a very challenging game. It's just not very forgiving either, which are different things. It's fairly easy to not screw up completely if you think about what you are doing but the consequences of a screw-up can be harsh.\n\nFor reference, I'm fairly used to tycoon games and to playing the likes of OpenTTD in very stringent economic settings. After the tutorial I've started my first Banished town with all on Medium difficulty (I thought it'd be a challenge). All went well and smooth, no hiccups, the town is packed with resources and only growing. I can't wait for a hard game but I fear it won't be really hard.\n\nPros:On the other hand, the pros are many and quite convincing:\nBeautiful and believable story line.\nYou can sympathize with your people.\nVery pleasant graphics.\nOnly quirk is from very up close people "skate/moonwalk" a bit on the surface but nothing that impairs enjoyment. Lots of details on buildings and environment, seasons and weather look and sound great.\nBelievable and well-balanced "disasters".\nFrom crops' diseases to people's diseases it all mends well with the environment. I didn't even get annoyed went they stroke.\nManagement without excess of micro management. A very good balance.\nSounds are very life-like.\nFrom chickens to cows to market mumble it sounds really great. Only caveat is that some sounds can get annoying over time, as said in the "cons" above.\nMod-able.\nI haven't had time to try them out yet but some of them look more like true expansion packs. And I feel there's only more coming so it sure looks promising for re-playability.\nGood amount of available information about the game.\nThe tutorials are quite good and the wiki is somewhat complete so you don't need to wonder too much about what this or that does. There are only a couple of things missing, already mentioned in the cons above.\nVery small download size.\nAt only a couple hundred Mb! Very well optimized. You'll be playing in no-time and the footprint on your HD/SSD is minimal.\nPath-finding is rather good.\nPath-finding is the kind of thing that can break and kill a game like this. Thankfully your people will do a great job at finding good routes to carry on with their daily business. Very very rarely you'll end up wondering why the hell did this dude chose to carry this basket of fish through the woods into nowhere.\nMany hours of good fun!\nThis is the type of game you'll load up and get so entertained you'll wonder where did the time go when 2 or 3 hours have passed.\nFinal words:\nAn absolute must-have. If there's any chance you might like the genre and you haven't gotten this game yet, get it. Right now.\n\nThe 9/10 score is solely because of the lack of a proper challenge in the long run. Things I'd like to see are more consequences for the lack of a balanced diet (there's not that much incentive for diversification as it is), or things like a super harsh winter every 5 or 10 years that may get you off-guard, that kind of thing. Anything to get you off-guard, to throw you a curve ball to deal with every once in a while. Maybe the classic citizens becoming unhappy if the town is too big, or if they need to walk too much to stock their households (beyond the lower productivity "penalty"), I don't know. Just more mechanics to make the game interesting and challenging in the long run instead of "if you're producing a little more than you consume your are safe forever" current mechanic, which is a bit too easy to beat and a bit too stable/predictable.","February 25, 2015","true","31.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","34","38","5","1"

The controls are intuitive, the tutorials are thorough enough to get a solid grasp of the mechanics in a very short time, and the game world is quite pretty. There isn't, to my knowledge, anything else like this on the market. The game is worth the money and I do not regret purchasing it. I will continue to play it and hope that the development does not stop here -  that Shining Rock Software continues to improve on and build on the game.\n\nHowever, all of that being said, I am not going to recommend this game to the public overall, nor to my friends. It is very finicky and unforgiving, far too difficult even on the 'easy' setting, repetitive and frustrating. There are no indicators or popups other than 'low storage' messages when something goes very wrong with the economy. You are forced to build up very quickly. If you do not have at least 6 more families by the time year 15-20 rolls around your elders will die off and your population will not be salvagable because you will no longer bring in a fraction of the resources. I found no difference between the three climate settings. Don't get me wrong, I love high difficulty in a game and prefer to play most RTS/survival games on high difficulty for a challenge - but in those cases the enjoyment typically comes after I've finished a long map and have achieved something. There is none of that in Banished because of the mechanics of the priority system and the havoc it wreaks on resource management.\n\nAt this point I've played around ten maps and I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about; The furthest I got any of them was year 24. I had a stable economy, 6k food to spare, and plenty of resources. My population at that point was around 100. I squared off an area for people to harvest resources from - and my fishermen, farmers and most importantly my blacksmith left their posts to attend to it. Tools, for a short period of time, were not created. It resulted in a drop in productivity, which resulted in less food being gained. When that sort of spiral starts, there is no way to stop it - within five minutes my population had starved itself down to 5.\n\nSome more examples:\n- If you build a building that costs iron and you do not have an excess, you will not be able to make as many/any tools and your people will starve.\n- Your fishermen will starve even as they fish food for the village, and even if they are the only ones left alive they will refuse to eat the food they are harvesting. I saw this on a hard-valley map; Suffice it to say that it was over by year 3 when all but one villager had starved to death. The last four villagers to die were all fishermen, and these died on the docks gathering fish.\n- People carrying food to the food barn will starve to death.\n- Disease will end your population in the span of a few minutes even with stacks of herbs and a hospital.\n- In order to trade for seeds you need to sell thousands of things in one go. The problem with this is that surpluses are very difficult to get and every resource in the game is useful - sell too much of your iron stockpile and you will have the tool issue. Sell too much of your clothing and you will have people freezing. Sell wood and you have no firewood. Don't even think about selling your food.  Without seeds you lose access to the most dependable way of bringing in food.\n\nThese are not, in my opinion, elements of difficulty. Difficulty would be better attributed to colder/longer winters, harder soil to farm in, and more harsh starting conditions (less resources). Difficulty should not come in the form of a poor priority system that will send your fisherman out to gather wood instead of a less-needed role (labourer or woodcutter, for example) or in the form of a slight error (ie. building a trading post which uses some of your iron) that destroys an hours-long stable economy to where it can not be recovered.\n\nOverall, I give the game 6/10. It has amazing promise and potential, but in my opinion the mechanics are not allowing the game to deliver.","February 19, 2014","false","8.3"," 636 of 1,027 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","636","1","0","25"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nFor deaf/hoh gamers, I give this title 8/10!\n\nOverall GameplayBanished is a challenging civilization-building/survival game.  Rough around its edges, this game takes some getting used to before going right in to it.  Without looking at a guide to help get started, you will fail a few times before you incrementally start finding success.  I strongly encourage new players to go through the tutorials to grasp the basic mechanics of the game.\n\nIn truth, the formula for winning this game is relatively simple once you have it down, and it becomes a balancing act of population and resources.  If played right, it is not a significantly active, demanding game, but can be a fun way to pass the time.\n\nThe information windows are essential for playing this game effectively, but must be enabled when you start playing.  I'm not sure why that is except to provide a clean GUI for a new gamer.  It's a bit of a hassle to enable all of those windows each time you start a new game.\n\nIt's a simultaneously challenging and easy game, which can turn quickly to frustrate you or plod along predictably.  I rate gameplay a 7/10.\n\nGeneral AccessibilityThe game is a top-down style with great control over the camera.  Interaction with the game is in the form of WASD (pan), Q/E (rotate), Page Up/Down (tilt), and Insert/Delete (zoom).  Each function has a mouse alternative.\n\nIn order to build the facilities your banished people need to survive, you make use of menus on the bottom right of the screen via F1-F9.  Each F key brings up a corresponding sub-menu, where options are selected with the number keys 1-0.  Buildings can be rotated with R and T to fit surrounding areas and to align with roads.\n\nAll buttons are remappable for mobility-related issues.\n\n\nSubtitles & CaptionsSound options in the game are rather limited.  You can only alter the UI sounds, music, effects, and ambient volume with slider bars.  The absence of subtitles suggests this game has no spoken audio and the absence of captions suggests there are no particular audio cues indicative of emergency situations for you to take care of.\n\nWhether there are sounds associated with things or not, there are small popup notifications near your toolbar in the bottom right corner that let you know if a villager has died or people are going hungry/cold.  While these are helpful, I would suggest regularly checking your resource output vs resource consumption and ensuring that you either have sources established for each village or are able to redistribute resources across the entire habitated area.\n\nBecause I have encountered no situations where I am confused by events in the game (indicating audio-only warnings), I assume there are no major audio-only events.  For that, I give it a 10/10.\n\nChatting/CommunicatingBanished is single-player.\n\nNo rating.\n","December 19, 2014","true","11.5"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

What differiates the game from these titles is the real possibility of failure. Whereas in Anno, your economy may stall or crash which would require rebuilding a more sustainable city, in Banished, if you find yourself low on food, clothing, shelter or firewood, your citizens will rapidly die resulting in failure. This is an interesting change to what you may be used to in other city building games.\n\nSome other good stuff:\n\nGraphically the game is fairly low fidelity, but it has it's own kind of beauty. The environments feel alive and the visual changes across seasons result in some very aesthetically pleasing effects.\n\nThe way you can customise the user interface is great. If you dislike being overwhelmed by information, you can choose to only have certain information windows open at once. If you enjoy a deluge of info, then have them all open (you will need to lower the interface size - something the options provides).\n\nHowever, here are some of the problems. The first problem is down time. The game requires as awful amount of waiting, either for your citizens to build stuff or for your children to turn into adults. Even at 10x speed, it can feel like an age just waiting for that extra labourer. If you build a school, this down time becomes even longer. And it is down time. You have absolutely nothing to do. To make a comparison, Anno 2070 included all kinds of missions and projects you could do while waiting for populations to grow. There is nothing of the sort here, and you may quickly become frustrated, even at the highest speed, at staring at very little going on.\n\nSecond, but related problem: the lack of direction. In other city builder games there is either an overall victory state, or a set of tasks that can be achieved that act as kind of mini-win states. There is nothing like that here. So while staring at the screen with nothing to do, you may frequently find yourself asking "why bother?" Doing nothing in a game isn't fun full stop, never mind when it is a long time to go nowhere. There are achievements for the game but, if like me, you find achievement hunting rather pointless, then the existential nausea will quickly seep in.\n\nThe final problem, and one that isn't the single developers fault, is the way that other gamers have marketed the title - in particular to do with difficulty. The game may be more difficult than SimCity, but overall it is not a wholly challenging game. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this (the idea that games need to be hard to be good or better than their counterparts is a myth perpetuated by those who can find no other outlet for an inferiority complex) but don't buy the game if you are expecting a super challenge. Once you have grasped the basic mechanics of the game and gained some understanding of efficiently using the game mechanics, you can play the game on hard and within two or three hours can happily leave the game on 10x, grab a cup of tea and watch some T.V. while maybe having to do some minimum micromanagment.\n\nIt's still early days for Banished and with some adjustments made by the (single!!!) developer and/or with the introduction of some good mods, the game could be far better. For now I'd only recommend to die hard city builder fans who want to try something a little different. If you are any less than a die hard fan, I'd wait it out for a while.\n\nEdit: Some spelling and grammar mistakes cleaned up.","February 20, 2014","false","20.5"," 218 of 353 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","218","353","0","7"

While it is quite enjoyable, in my opinion, there's a fundamental design flaw. At its core, Banished is a fun, yet simple builder, survival game only made difficult by the "flaw". Toward the bottom of Maslow's heirarchy of needs are the physiological and safey needs of self. Yet, Banished violates this premise with its breeding model; the citizens will breed until all open houses are filled. This one, simple fact, makes it nearly impossible to recover from late game mistakes or natural disasters, making the game too finicky.\n\nAnectdotally (populatation graph in profile), in my fourth Banished game, this flaw occurred again. A tornado destroyed part of my town, nearly 500 strong. Even though the damage was small, it caused a chain reaction--a tool shortage, led to resource shortage (food and raw materials for tools and clothing), which led to 320 people dying before it recovered.\n\nImportant note: the town had housing for 500+ people.\n\nFood stores slowly began to recover, all the while the adults were still breeding, never slowing. With a 500-citizen occupancy on housing, they kept procreating, but the resources didn't exist and after reaching 400 citizens (270 adults), the population crashes again down to one, lone hunter.\n\nTL;DR. The breeding model is flawed, which is an exercise in frustration instead of an enjoyable challenge.  I can't recommend it at this time; I'll revist my review if a patch is released.","March 2, 2014","false","57.9"," 121 of 192 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","121","192","0","8"

Was wondering about purchasing myself. My village seemed to prosper the whole time while not having much food, I paid no attention. Everybody froze to death but my dear Stellamae. A beautiful sheila at the fresh age of 27, she work with her colleague, Kavia the stoneminer. Kavia died at 33, however Stellamae continued to persevere with her life, although it may have seemed bleak. With a mildly established infastructure to store her reapings, Stellamae continued with her daily routine for 50 years. At this time I had grown fond of her, and wished to counsel her for her trauma a half decade ago. We lived, we loved, we prospered. Years had gone by where we were what you could call "a thing", however, the lack of progress with the counseling failed to please me and eventually grew me ill towards the once beautiful Stellamae. At the ripe age of 73, I abondoned Stellamae in any form of love. Stellamae, a trooper, continued to persist. Alas, an exceptionally harsh winter storm froze the hardened Stellamae to death where I was then, in that moment, free to beseach the touch of another.","November 6, 2014","true","10.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","26","30","8","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/recommended/242920/","JosieKaylin","Josie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/","116 products in account","*Artwork/Animation 8/10\n-Artwork: The graphics in this game are basic. All the textures flow together nicely and I have not experienced any breaks or lines in the textures on any of the items in the game.  Over all pretty nice graphics, not much to complain about here.\n-Animation: Similar to the artwork, the animations are simple and standard. The people walk around, pick up things, put things down, build, etc. The animations are clean and I have not experienced any bugs thus far. The only thing I can honestly complain about for this is that they people with in your town do not recognize buildings. Therefore they do walk through things like pastures, farms, and when they pick up food to bring to their house sometimes half their body will be inside the wall. This isn't major flaw and doesn't take away from the game play, however, it was enough to make this topic lose two points because it could easily be fixed in an update if the devs decided to work on it.\n\n*Sounds/Music: 10/10\n-Sounds: The sounds in this game are detailed & very nice. You can hear trees that fall or get chopped down, you can hear the rain, and you even hear the livestock and birds chirping. Very nice quality and the sounds aren't loud or annoying.\n-Music: The music is on a soundtrack in a way. You'll go from hearing medieval themed music, to very slow casual music you barely notice, to no music at all then it repeats in that order. The music is nice and goes well with the game. Once you play for like 15 minutes you hardly notice the music. It's still a nice background sound though.\n\n*Hours to Complete: ~~~\nThis is a topic in all of my reviews so I decided to include it for the purpose of consistency. You can play this game indefinitely. Even with just one town that you are successful in and build every single thing available you can continue to play that single game until you get bored. The map is huge so expansion of your town can be indefinite.\n\n*Story Line: 9/10\nThe story line goes along with the title of the game. Basically, a group of people are banished from a civilization and forced to live on their own elsewhere. Working together, they can successfully create their own town plentiful of food, clothes, and hard working civilians. The story line is nice, I personally love survival games and games where you create your own town or civilization. The only reason it lost a point on this topic is because the actual game doesn't give you any back story whatsoever other than the title. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. It's good for the people that like to be imaginative and think of what happened to the group on their own or people that like to just play the game right away and don't care for back stories. This can be bad for the people that like to see the back story or actually wonder what the devs had in mind as to why they got banished. Either way it's a nice story line.\n\n*Game Play: 10/10\nThe is a very strategic and survival heavy game. It is a slower paced game so if you're expecting to be able to build everything within an hour or less you're going to get a big surprise. There's a lot of times you're just sitting there waiting for the children to turn into adults so you can continue and progress. If you're going to play this game I recommend having patience. The first few times you play you're just trying to figure out controls and the best way to survive. After you figure out how to get through the first year with out starving or freezing during the winter, the game is pretty self explanatory yet still challenging. There's a ton of different difficulty settings, things to customize your game play, and even map seeds (this just means the map is randomly generated every time you play. If you find a map you really enjoy playing on you can save the seed and use it for each game you start. Likewise if you see someone else play a really cool map they can give you the seed number and you can play a game on their map seed). There are tutorials if you get stuck and a banished wiki if you have questions as well as youtube walk throughs if you ever need any help or specific information. This game does offer 36 steam achievements.\n\n*Price: 10/10\nThe price today, 8/26/2015, is $19.99 I feel like $20 for this game is decent. You're getting unlimited game play and hours of challenging fun. I can see where this game is maybe not for everyone but it's still a decent price for what the game has to offer.\n\n*Over All:\nI honestly do really enjoy this game and I like almost everything about it.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who:\n-Enjoys slower paced games\n-Has patience\n-Likes survival/strategic games\n-Likes building cities or civilizations\n-Enjoys renaissance music","August 26, 2015","true","25.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","26","30","6","0"

It was very entertaining i expanded my village made farms and gathering huts, built bridges and houses. Keeping everyone well fed and warm was a challenge. My village was struck by a devestating famine due to my inexperience and poor city planning. My population was decimated and i was having a blast the whole time deeply immeresed in trying to pull my village out of the hole it was in. That first game lasted 20 hours and it was a pleasure. I then started a second game. I decided that the optimal strategy would be to build a large amount of farms and at all times (apart from winter of course) have roughly half my citizens working those farms. My population grew at a rapid rate and within 5 hours i had a relatively large bustling city and virtually no one had died from anything other than old age. When city builder games get to this point there in trouble, they have to have a way to keep you immersed and the immersion begins to fall apart when a simple strategy of having half your citizens working farms completely removes all challenge in the game. The situation got worse when i worked out that firewood was the optimal trading currency and that i could exchange it with the traders that came relatively often for pretty much anything. My city prospered and grew, constant exchanges of firewood for food with the traders and half of my citizen working the farms caused my food stockpiles to grow at a ridiculous rate and i eventually needed literally hundreds of barns to store it all. At this point one thing could of saved this game.\n\nRISKS AND DANGERS AND PROBLEMS EVERYWHEREEE!!!\n\n- where are those wild animals lurking in the forests ready to devour your citizens and the invasions of barbarians ready to wreck even the most prosperous villages. The disaster mechanic in banished could of served this purpose and made the game riveting . But they did nothing. In my 30 hours of play time i didnt see a single tornado, one or two fires sprouted up but they were quickly quenched by the 3 or 4 wells i had scattered around. The first time that a popup appeared telling me one of my farms was infested with crop ruining bugs i merely deleted said farm and built a new one. And the tiny loss of food meant nothing because of my ridiculous stockpiles of food. I got so excited when the popup saying two of my citizens were infected with some kind of disease appeared. But nothing happened they just went to one of my two hospitals and were cured. I got bored and moved on. If you look at the reviews for this game youl find that over 75 percent of them have less than 50 hours play time. This game will entertain you for one or two short games before you work out that having half your citizens working farms will solve alll your villages problems.\n\nIn summary the graphics are nice, the interface is smooth and it has that one more turn addictive feel you get from civ games. This game could easily have become my number no.1 most played steam title. So it is with a heavy heart that i rate this game unfinished and broken at the core. However if the game is on sale for 75 percent off then by all means buy it for that first glorious game.\n\nBUT ONLY IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT BREAKING YOUR HEART !!!","March 31, 2015","false","48.7"," 46 of 65 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","46","65","8","5"

The game thrives off of you failing. It's a game of trial and error. Cities get harder and harder to manage as the population climbs. If you're not comfortable spending hours on a city only to watch it crumble after a plague, this game may not be for you.\n\nThe way I think the game was designed to be played was for you to build it up to the point of your society collapsing so that you can say "okay, here were my mistakes, this is why it was unstable; I won't do that next time." In this sense, the game is immensely rewarding as you're constantly able to learn from your mistakes and get farther each time. That being said, this can make the game more frustrating than rewarding for some people. You're constantly faced with small and large failures that can make the game seem impossible. But, when losing is part of the game, you're not really losing.\n\nAnyway, if you want a city-building sim and you like them to challenging, complex, and deep, this is a great game and you'll probably spend a lot more hours on it than I did.","November 4, 2014","true","13.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Banished is one of the best simulation games out there.\n\nIn Banished you play to manage some people who were banished from their homeland because of something, it doesn't really matter because what you need to do is to do everything in your power to make sure these outcast can survive and build a new society of their own. Something like that I think. Either you become a great mayor of a great town, or you just simply build a small ghost town.\n\nBanished gameplay are so great, I can say it is quite so realistic as simulation games can get. You still can't do everything, but when you start playing Banished you're gonna realize that not everybody can be a Mayor. The citizen in Banished will age, they will grow old and die so expanding and balancing the population is important. Citizen can also die because of acccident too, for example a miner can die because of cave in or crushed by a rock, I even encounter one event where one of my citizen is murdered! Damn! Anyway, resources gathering in Banished is quite complex, there is no skill trees but production chains, and it is important to manage those production chains well or all hell break loose. To gather food we can build farms or pastures, do hunting or gathering some berries or roots in the forest, and even fishing. You can even replant the forest so you will never run out of woods. There is also trade, where you get most of your crop seeds and new pasture breeds. Then there's also disasters, a disease breakout (people will not turn into zombies however), or your own disasters because your people are starving or freezing to death. Lots can happen so keep on your toes.\n\nIn terms of graphics, Banished doesn't have very advanced graphics, but it's beautiful enough. The graphics is sufficient enough for you to enjoy Banished and forgot to check on the clock. Performances are also good, just keep in mind if you want to build a big-♥♥♥ town, you better have more RAM, just like any other simulation games.\n\nBanished also has a workshop support for mods. Yes MODS! There are couple of mods that adds even more production chains to Banished, even more building and even more resources to gather. Some even has decoration thing for your town. The best mod for Banished currently is the Colonial Charter mods, which add almost everything to Banished that sometimes it feels like an expansion pack. You can also make your own mods that fits your gameplay.\n\nOverall, Banished is a great simulation. If only they add at least a little combat gameplay it could be great, It doesn't have to be a war but something like repelling bandits attack, pirates, looters or something. But that's just my thought. I really recommend Banished for you all simulation gamers.\n\nRating 10/10","January 11","true","84.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","21","24","3","1"

I think the asking price is a bit much for a game that gets boring very soon after you have played about 20 hours. For a city builder, it's unique in that you have to manage a wide array of basic resources to survive. However, it's also very short for a city builder.\n\nOnce you attain a population of about 300 or more, there simply is no reason to play the game any longer. There needs to be a 'next-level' for players, after they've built past the survival stage, where grander buildings, regional conflicts (perhaps building an army for defense), or new villager specialist professions become available.\n\nI've been waiting for almost a year for updates in this game that would bring it to the next level, and offer a fuller building experience. I've held off writing my review in lieu of the developer's promise to improve the game. Yet, alas, it seems those promises were false.\n\nIf one has money to spend, and wants to try something different for a small amount of time, they maybe will feel ok spending the $20.00 on this game.

It will take you on an emotional journey and force you to confront the idea of meaning in the face of an indifferent universe.\n\nThe game is deceptively calming and Zen-like, with its peaceful music and pretty landscapes. But you can't play the game with a casual mindset, because things can go horribly wrong, horribly quickly. Starvation, fires, disease, and lack of resources are ever-present dangers. Things can be perfect for 50 years, and then collapse in a matter of weeks.\n\nEvery time I play, I undergo a drastic change in mentality. At first, I'm very emotionally attached to my villagers, watching them live their lives and raise their families. As my village grows, I become detached and cool -- I no longer know my villagers by name, and I no longer become concerned when one (or two, or twenty) are homeless or starving. "This must be what a god feels like," I think to myself as I roll my eyes at the death of a villager apparently too stupid to walk ten feet and grab some firewood from the marketplace.\n\nAs you can tell by the number of hours I've played BANISHED, I absolutely love this game. I'll go a few months without playing, and then find myself missing it and open it up to start a new game. Every time I do, it's the same lovely, immersive, sometimes frustrating but always satisfying experience. BANISHED scratches some sort of existential itch in my soul, and I know it's a game I will continue to turn to for years and years.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, I absolutely love that the villagers of BANISHED are "smart" enough to perform routine tasks without being told. If you want to build a house in a forest, you don't have to tell them to clear the forest, gather resources, and then build the house -- they will perform the necessary steps to achieve your ultimate goal. This alone makes the gameplay superb to most city-builders.\n\nI also enjoy playing this game with some of the many mods that other players have made. I love the new content and how easily it integrates into the basic game. But I think I'll always prefer to play it un-modded, because its very spareness is part of what makes it so real and so addictive.","October 25, 2014","true","177.4"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/242920/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","Banished is very unique in its play-style. I'm a huge fan of city-builder and strategy games, and so to find a game that really breaks the mold was very refreshing. No tech trees or restrictions is a nice touch, and the idea of being a challenging survival game blended with the usual city builder element is really great. I want to love this game. I want to say its the best city builder game to come out since Sim City 4, but there's a few crucial issues I have with the game.\n\nFor the record, I've only ever tried Hard difficulty setting.\n\nThe most significant issue in Banished is that I find myself staring at numbers and messages more than anything else. It's a constant game of moving around my profession numbers. What's worse is that for being such an interface-heavy game design, the UI itself is actually not very well-designed or thought out. The micromanagement in the game suffers from a serious lack of depth. Once you've planned out your city, which is a matter of ensuring your people don't have to walk too far to drop off supplies or get to their homes, you begin your journey of tediously shuffling around professions endlessly while staring at the event log, professions and resource tabs. You're watching a number (Like food or fuel) slowly go down while you frantically try keep that number up by doing anything you can -- but a lot of the time I feel like there's nothing I can do. If my people start dying from starvation, it's nearly impossible to fix it without losing a huge chunk of my population, because when people die -- the replacements take a long time to get settled into their new home and begin work.\n\nThe game is very punishing when you do something wrong. There's no wiggle room, no room for error. If I make one too many mistakes then I'm going to suffer a major consequence - hundreds will die. This doesn't make the game challenging, it just means that due to a simple mistake I now have to wait even longer to see my city become large and prosperous. The game feels like a tedious chore more often than a strategic city-planner. The only way to prevent a few mistakes from causing all your people to die is to wait a very long time while your city stockpiles resources (especially food). It's kind of like grinding in an RPG game; it guarantees that you'll be able to progress without issues, but its boring and totally kills the fun of risky advancements.\n\nAnd even when you are doing really well the game does not reward you. At the height of your success all you've managed to do was keep that illogical, arbitrary number afloat. There are no milestones in Banished. There's nothing to aspire to, nothing to accomplish except see your numbers slowly rise and build more of the same. Every building I make is just another bland-looking brown or grey construct and all it does is help the numbers move along in some way or another. Brewery improves happiness numbers. Chapel increases happiness numbers. It's a game of seemingly-meaningless numbers going up and down forever. There also seems to be a surprising lack of information pertaining to what these numbers actually represent. What exactly does 100 firewood equate to? I never feel like I'm actually planning things out, telling myself I need X amount of Y, but instead just trying to make sure I have a surplus of every resource for when that 1 extra civilian is the straw that breaks the camel's back and my economy is thrown out of balance.\n\nIf updated, Banished has potential to be amazing. Despite all of the drawbacks, I really enjoy the game, especially for its unusual survival/city-builder hybrid play-style. It was definitely worth my $20 bucks.\n\nRating: B+","March 4, 2014","true","61.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","2"

I really did.  As a big fan of both RTS and city-building games, the idea of survival being your primary obstacle really seemed like a fresh idea for both genres.  Unfortunately I cannot in good faith recommend anyone buy this game.  The problems are myriad, and I hardly know where to begin.  I guess I'll start by covering the good, since it's by far the shortest list.\n\nPROS\nCool gameplay concept\nLooks cool for an indie release\nCONS\nIt would be overly charitable to call the UI "clunky."  If you intend to have all of the relevant info tabs open (and you really should if you want to survive longer than ten minutes) anticipate them eating more than a third of your screen.  It really detracts from any visual enjoyment you might otherwise get from the game.\nThe learning curve is exceptionally steep.  At less than 100 total population the slightest change in resource allocation throws your entire village into chaos.  While I appreciate that a fine balance is necessary for a survival game, this game really misses the mark.  Convert a fisherman to a forester?  Everybody starves.  Have three births over the winter versus last season's two?  Everybody starves.  Admit two nomads into your village?  Everybody starves.  They should have just called the game 'Everybody Starves' as that's about the only achievable outcome short of OCD-like micromanagement of every single in-game metric.\nThere is nothing intuitive about the mechanics of this game.  There are tooltips, but they are vague and unhelpful, especially when taken in combination with the ultra-touchy resource allocation system.  I have played dozens of RTS titles and have never run up against a game that was so cagey about telling you what the ♥♥♥♥ it was doing (ie. how the game elements affect one another).\nAI in this game is a joke, and player control is nonexistent.  Sure, you can assign villagers to one of several dozen different job categories, but in some cases that seems entirely futile as they pretty much do whatever they want once assigned.  And of course, since you have no direct control over individual villagers, you're basically forced to watch them as they wile away the hours.  I've watched farmers nonchalantly gather wood during planting season, fail to make it to their assigned farm until halfway through summer, then wander off through the entirety of harvest time because they were cold.  If you lived alongside people like this in an actual subsistence village, you'd flog these farmers to death for constantly putting the lives of the entire town in jeopardy.\nAI is so garbage it deserves a second bullet point.  Builders cannot prioritize multiple tasks.  While there is a system in place to manage build priorities, it flat does not work.  I have consistently had buildings with zero assigned builders finish well before buildings which had my entire building crew assigned to them, because again: villagers do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they please, occasionally popping in to do 14 seconds of work at their "job" before wandering off because they're cold or hungry.  Why these morons can't dress and feed themselves before leaving the house for work is beyond me, but that's apparently how the developer intended for things to work.  The last thing I will say on the subject; because of their failure to prioritize the buildings you select, it's time-wasting and endlessly frustrating to queue more than maybe two buildings at a time.  Doing so causes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI to split your resources among all future building sites (even ones without assigned builders), ensuring you don't have enough resources to start building *any* of your projects.  It's one of the stupidest designs I've ever seen in a civilization builder-type game.  This also makes planning for the future of your settlement nearly impossible.  As a bonus, when food reserves are running low, people forget how to eat.  I've seen dozens of villagers die rather than make the trek across the street to the market (where there is food).  This is another ♥♥♥♥-poor piece of AI programming.  Apparently, villagers like to shop like they're at Costco.  If they can't obtain a six month supply of food in a single market visit, they refuse to eat at all.  They will, however, attempt to cross the entirety of the map trying to find food somewhere else, even if it's miles away from their workplace and home.  Spoiler alert: they starve.\nGiven what I've seen in my first couple dozen hours of play, I cannot see how this game would scale up in a fun and meaningful way.  I currently haven't made it much past ~100 villagers, at which point the game seemingly already requires autistic levels of attention.  Based on that, I can only imagine that a larger town would become an immediate and tedious grind.\n\nIn summary, I think this game concept had a ton of potential that was just impossible for a first-time developer to fully realize.  If you can get it for $2 and pile so many mods on top of it that it effectively becomes a different game, there might be some (fun) replay value there.  I've heard great things about the Colonial Charter mod, and am keeping my fingers crossed that it can save this game.  However, if you're expecting $20 worth of "fun" from the vanilla game, I believe you'll be sorely disappointed.  I'm sad to say I couldn't recommend this game at anything other than bargain basement prices.","January 14","false","42.6"," 46 of 72 people (64%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","64","46","72","10","5"

There isn’t a specific back story to the game; all you know is that you were banished (for an unknown reason) to a remote area and it is up to you to plan the city and keep your villagers alive.  It’s like a hybrid of Starcraft, SimCity, and the Civilization series.\n\nI've spent roughly 48 hours playing this game.  The first thing I noticed is how effing difficult this game is.  I started playing on medium difficulty, fair weather, and disasters enabled.  After a quick and painful death about 20 minutes into my adventure I had to switch to easy with mild weather.  I left disasters enabled because I couldn’t 100% cheat.\n\nStrategy is absolutely key in this game.  Villagers need to have enough food and firewood to make it through the winter.  Some clothes would be nice but my villagers quickly realized they can’t always get what they want.  Without depleting my resources too badly I was able to set up a woodcutter, fields, livestock pens, fishing dock, hunting lodge, and a house for people gathering materials (food, herbs, etc) in the woods.  Boom!  Everyone had a job and the town made it through the harsh winter with enough food and firewood.\n\nIt was about this time I realized the game also mocks you.  I was celebrating my victory over winter by looking for a place to build a marketplace and a trading post when I suddenly got alarms that villagers were dying.  First three villagers, then ten…What the ♥♥♥♥?  My boyfriend would dub this episode “The Spring of Death.”  It all started with the tornado that killed all but five villagers.  They started to rebuild their houses and stockpiles and just when it looked like they might bounce back…they ran out of food and died.\n\nOverall, the range of play is great.  The maps are large and plentiful.  Each map (I’ve only played three but there are many more) has a water supply for fishing docks and trading posts.  Some locations are easier to play than others.  The location where all my villagers were wiped out was particularly difficult because it was surrounded by water and trees with little room for movement immediately.  Hence the total destruction of everyone living within three feet of each other.\n\nUnlike many strategy games players have everything they need right from the start.  All players really need to be concerned with is hunting down raw materials like wood, iron, stone, and coal.  Otherwise all buildings, skills, occupations, livestock, seeds, etc. are immediately available for construction and use.  This may be off-putting for some gamers but I didn’t mind as it just made me think a bit more about strategy: Do I want a schoolhouse to teach children to be more efficient laborers or do I want the church to keep up village moral (unhappy villagers are not useful laborers)?\n\nThere is no story line which is great because I hate to play a plot based game.   Also it doesn’t appear to have a finish line either which is new to me. There is no way to “win”.  The whole purpose of the game is simply to survive and grow your town into a thriving medieval metropolis.  Occasionally things pop up where villagers might steal food and you have to decide how to handle that but there is no central plot based play.\n\nI loved this game.  Hardcore.  Even when I knew I wasn’t going to be able to survive a particular map I still gave it my all (I got a little involved) for the sake of the villagers.  I think that’s the thrill of the game: knowing that I could lose at any moment made the little victories that much sweeter.  Well worth the frustration and the money.","August 28, 2014","true","16.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Well, I think it is only 20% city-building. In my humble opinion, this is a "strategic survival of a town against nature". Things like collecting resources, building structures just the right way so your villagers can use the optimum route to their destination, planning village growth according to terrain, are what this game is all about. If you buy this game expecting a "city-building game", you will not like it. Actually half of the bad reviews are based on expectation of a "city-building game".\n\nGame's complexity is fair. It does not have hundreds of buildings, tools etc. There is only one "tool" which villagers use to collect resources and build structures. There are also a handful of structures each with a different purpose, from producing fuel to keeping villagers happy. Its complexity comes from learning what works best how and with what.\n\nGame does not have an end game goal. This may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on people's perspective. After you start a game and get the hang on basics, you put your own goal. For example mine was to grow to 600 citizens and got the achievement. It is not actually a sandbox game, but some people put some restrictions on themselves, like not building certain buildings. Some of these restrictions are also encouraged by achievements if you are into it.\n\nPros:+ Good graphics: Structures are very detailed, villagers are distinguishable, trees and nature look good enough.\n+ Excellent simulation: Every villager has a status based on their hunger, clothing etc. and distance between their house and work place makes real difference.\n+ Nice tutorial: Tutorial teaches the basics but doesn't give too much detail. For a survival game, learning optimum ways is part of the game.\n+ Works great: My system is considered high end, but should work great on medium level systems because its recommended system requirements are currently considered very low end.\n+ Workshop support\n\nCons:+ Slow paced: This is not necessarily a bad thing but it may make some people bored quickly.\n+ Wrong classification: Well, this game is about survival but classified as city-building strategy game. It makes expectations of new players different and most bad reviews are based on this.\n\nVerdict:I don't regret having this game and recommend it without a second thought. I hope developer (yes singular. afaik, it is developed by one person) considers making a sequel in the future.\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not.

Recommending it is easy enough, but recommending it to all and sundry is a different matter, this is a game for a specific audience, allow me to explain :\n\nBanished calls itself a city building strategy game....\n\nRight. That's akin to calling Dark Souls a light and cheerful romp through some ruins whilst a few slightly less than alive fellows duel you with rusty metal objects and you meet some not quite all there people on a quest of JOLLY CO-OPERATION.\n\nWhoever came up with the store description is clearly a master of either understatement or satire. I tip my hat to them, I do. Banished is superficially about building a village, yes, but that's merely the outer layer of this rather hefty onion of a game, and it's made of many interlocking layers that are all simulated. Each citizen is simulated properly, they go to their workplace, they get hungry, they get cold, they get old, they die.\n\nThey may have children, they may end up marrying someone half their age (oh, and by the way, I had a family who's father was the tender age of eleven, the poor kid's voice hadn't broke and already he was a dad, awesome!). These are people where you can see the interlocking mechanisms take place all the time, you can see them work, you can see them travel to and from, you can see them interact with the world around them.\n\nThe simulation doesn't stop at people, it simulates wildlife and nature, you cannot just plop down a forester and assume that's the end to your lumber woes, it doesn't work that way in the real world, it won't work that way in banished. It takes time for trees to grow and mature, time for your foresters to build up an efficient cycle of logging, planting, and treetending, and as a result, much like everything else within Banished, every change you make is rarely immediate in it's effect, but it -has- an effect, and it's cumulative in nature. If you ever wanted a perfect exemplar of "the butterfly effect", this game can teach you far better than many textbooks.\n\nAs a result this game requires a level of planning, thinking and pondering which extends far past most normal city builders, it puts it more on the plane of games like Gnomoria, and perhaps it could be seen as an intro to things like Dwarf Fortress (it's a lot less impenetrable than DF thank Armok), but make no mistake, much like such games, it's very capable of whipping around in the blink of an eye and sabotaging several hours of work if you do not take due dilligence when you plan out changes to your village (a single scuffed up plan of mine utterly wrecked what was a solid village of mine, back to the drawing board once more, but from that failure I learned).\n\nIn the world of banished, the changes -matter-, treat the village with a genuine level of respect and plan your changes with a slow, methodical hand, and the game will reward you with perhaps one of the most intricate and engaging simulations outside of the aforementioned DF. Play it like a straight city builder and you will fail, and then you'll wonder why. Read the manual, do the tutorials, do your research, this game deserves that much out of you if you purchase it.\n\nWith that, I recommend this game to those who are willing.","February 20, 2014","true","35.3"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","35","53","0","1"

That i have ever played. The game is extremely punishing to those who go in there thinking "Oh it's just like Sim City" lol. No, it isn't. This game is very detailed in almost every aspect to how your town is from the overall health of your citizens, happiness, and, how many jobs are there avaiable as well as citizens.\n\nI mean seriously this game has a graph to keep track of progress of every little thing from resources, to population, to supplies. This game is very well informative. Plus the tutorials are also a big help. The developers really put a lot of hard work into the game. Just make sure you keep your citizens happy and use critical thinking skills in applying to the needs of your citizens and you should be fine :)\n\nPlus this game has a modding community behind it. To make the game better or slightly easier for newcomers to the game.\n\nThe only downside to this game is the overall "disasters" In this game it's either natural (tornadoes, fires) or medicial (diseases, and such). With that being said, The game doesn't have any bandits, wolf attacks, or neighboring towns for you to take over. Lol, yes i know what your thinking "But um this is a building city simulation. Not some sort of RTS conquest" and yes i get that. However the disasters happen rarely. Sometimes not at all. This game is a great time killer. But that is actually the problem. Lol, i want to be more active with my village. Maybe trade it with other villages that I have created, or defending my town from bandits and wolves, or take over other towns that are randomly generated on the map. Perphaps share the world space with a friend who has the game as well?\n\nIf the developers are going to make a second Banished game. I sincerely hope they add more "disasters" in the game. It's a great start, plus the game overall should keep you busy. Not everyone will like this game because of these elements or lack of certain elements. But hey who knows maybe a modder will make something like this in the near future? So don't get your hopes up\n\nAll and all. If you like delicate city building simulations.

They own nothing but their coats, two dozen tools, a pile of firewood and potatoes that will last half a year. It is my responsibility to create a new society for them.\n\n"Banished" is an indie developed strategy game, a sort of hybrid between the simulator "Sim City" and "Settlers". Here it is neither about building a metropolis or to defend the village against hostile tribes. Here you have to get the little people to survive by allowing it to live in symbiosis with nature.\n\nIn "Banished" it's the village's inhabitants which is the greatest asset. They are the workers, and assigning them different kinds of jobs for the community to flourish. Collecting raw materials like stone and iron are essential, but equally important is to expand the food supply . Woodcutter shed and planting trees, but you need a wood-cutter to produce firewood. Fishermen, hunters and farmers in turn produces food. The commercial harbor, the only gateway to the rest of the world, offers the only opportunity to trade for seeds and livestock.\n\nAt the same time one has to take into account residents' most basic needs - like giving people shelter. Otherwise, the population does not grow and during the winter they will freeze to death.\n\nDeath is also ever-present . Residents dies sooner or later, and everytime someone dies, it is a huge blow to the community. Building a cemetery can actually make the villagers happier, because then they have a place to mourn their loved ones. It is both interesting and striking how well the population mortality integrated into the game.\n\nThe basis of the game mechanics are simple but cleverly designed. The challenge of "Banished" is to try to balance the needs of residents with society's expansion - resources and raw materials must always be in phase with each other or else the village will encounter an massive starvation. There will be a reward in itself to construct new buildings, plant new seeds or build infrastructure because it takes time and hard work to gather the raw materials for the proposed projects.\n\nThe clear and helpful tutorial makes the game easy to understand and engaging. The interface is excellent designed: informative without being overwhelming, with movable and dynamic windows. "Banished" looks very plain and lack the artistic variety, but it is an unusually accommodating strategy game.\n\nDespite it's ruthless thematics. "Banished" is rarely awfully difficult. Although uphill may be long on the highest difficulty level -  it becomes relatively easy when the population passed the hundred.\n\nBut it is a challenging and entertaining strategy - at least as long as there is something to fight for. My involvement decreases abruptly once I managed to construct any building, buy all the seeds and obtain any livestock. Then there is simply no more to strive for.\n\nStrategic basis is brilliant and well thought out, and while there are still things to build, it is difficult to tear oneself away from the screen. "Banished" has the potential to be even better, and I hope that the developer will continue adding content. It was after all, a long time ago that a citybuilding game as captivating as this one was released.","March 13, 2014","true","57.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

You start this game out as a small town just building from scratch, a couple houses (on easy setting) a storage barn and some settlers.  The goal is to build a thriving town that can sustain the needs of all its habitants.  They need to eat, rest, and be healthy.  Sounds easy on paper however the developers have designed the game is keep you on your toes the entire time.  You have to balance your population growth just perfectly to enable your new production buildings to have enough employees, however not too quickly that they run out of food during their first winter.\n\nThere are a decent amount of buildings in this game, from various vegetable farms, to fruit tree orchards, to live stock pens.  You can have stone quarries, and iron mines, hunter lodges and herb gatherers.  You also must build schools to teach your citizens how to be more productive at their jobs, and churches to provide happiness as well as graveyards so villagers can mourn the loss of loved ones.\n\nThe maps are very well done, and easily thousands and thousands of variations, some having large lakes which can make your town more focused on fishing, or large forested areas where hunters do the majority of food gathering.\n\nOverall this game is well worth the money.  As of right now I have over 20 hours played and still have not made a successful town that I am happy with.  However, each time I start a new one I get a bit further and closer to perfecting it.\n\nVery fun game, can't wait until more items and features are added.\n","June 18, 2015","true","27.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I do admit that initially I went in thinking it to be a city builder and thats how I treated it. I bit me back very hard and I was very displeased. But then I really thought about how I was playing. I cahnged it to a more "initally i'm screwed so husband your resources and educate your folks (so they do things more efficiently)", and once I started my games with that mentality the game itself became a true challenge and a blast. This is a very well done SURVIVAL game.\n\nThe Bad....\nIf you get a huge batch of nomads, it can throw you into a death spiral with food or plague (once of my nomad requests brought in almost 50 people, within 5 minutes those 50 added such a strain on my food that half of my city died to starvation).\nYou need to play very methodically. Build here, watch and see if it stabilizes, fix if it doesnt or leave it alone if it does. Rinse and repeat.\nGrowing your population. Holy christ this one can hurt. You basically need to be in a constant state of building new homes (which is rough because that adds more strain on your initially reduced resources). Thats the only way to populate the village/town/city.\nSometimes ya just get bad luck. The randomly generated map sometimes just gets ya in a stupid spot.\n\nThe Great\nDamn, this is a fun game. There is always something to fix, tweak or build to make your village/town/city more efficient.\nPlenty to build, plenty of ways to influence how your city looks and grows (with a forrester you can essentially make "parks".\nGreat mods. I recommend the terrains plus and the Banished plus. They both add difficulties and streamline the overall gameplay.\nTough as nails. This game was a great challenge to husband your resources and grow in a stable and healthy manner for your folks.\n\nConclusion\nIf you like to build vast cities off the bat with no challenge, dont buy it.\nIf you want to build a small village, work up to a bustling town, and finally grow to a massive city. But during each step of the way you encounter a good logistical struggle for stability. Buy this game. I cant tell you how much fun this was for me.

It's like an ant farm or a fish tank, you have a certain level of input, but from there you just watch nature take its course. Banished is a deceptively relaxing game, with its pastoral themes and gentle, lilting soundtrack. Beneath the inviting exterior however is a persistent test of your planning abilities, one that can have you sweating before you know it.\n\n"Banished" refers to the tiny group of country folk you start the game with, a group of exiles in a wild, untamed land. From a humble start you help them assemble food, shelter, and comfort for themselves against the harsh winters. This is a personal-level game, similar to Tropico or Children of the Nile, where you can follow each individual resident from their house to their work and back. You'll also find elements of the Anno games, with each home and structure having its own inventory of goods that must be balanced against the consumption of the ever-growing population.\n\nThis is where the game can make you panic, because I wasn't kidding about the harsh winters. Your people need food, firewood, clothes, tools, medicine, and other goods and services to survive and prosper, and their needs change by season. When winter comes you'll see a run on the food and firewood stores that can quickly leave people starving and freezing if you haven't adequately prepared. Shortfalls can be extremely hard to recover from, because farms are planted and harvested by seasons, orchards take years to grow from saplings, and your livestock ages as your residents do.\n\nOnce you master the balance of goods for your populace, the rest of the challenge is up to you. Banished gives you access to all the buildings right up front, only gating them behind required quantities of the basic building materials. You can have your people farming, fishing, herding, hunting, gathering, brewing, trading, and so on in just a few years, and then aside from the seeds and livestock you have to trade for, you'll have seen everything. From that point on the challenge is entirely in balancing your resources as your village expands indefinitely. The margins get thinner and thinner and curveballs like nomads joining your community en masse can throw off your plans, but the basic rules of expansion do not change.\n\nThe magic of the game is that you'll play for a few hours, set up a perfectly functional town with all the buildings and services, put it down... and then find yourself coming back to expand again and again. The quaint graphics and simple mechanics make it a delight to simply keep building out further and further. There are no scenarios or campaigns, just you and the random maps to fill, and even without anything pushing you forward to fill them you might find yourself inclined to do just that. Banished ended up being one of the more addictive city builders I've played, making up for simplicity with more than enough charm.","June 1","true","24.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jiiiiim/recommended/242920/","Jiiiiim","The Priiiiiize","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jiiiiim/","289 products in account","This game caught me a bit by surprise, with my purchase entirely decided by an intense longing to play Settlers 2 again, and that it looked very pretty. It's about making Medieval civilization in the wilderness, starting with a group of twenty hardened fiends who have been BANISHED (the game doesn't say what for but I think murders), and seeing how big you can get. There's no external military threats, it's just a question of if you can balance your expansion, production, transportation and all that other stuff that makes a town tick, without everyone dying. Pure sandbox, no aim in mind beyond what you want to set yourself.\n\nMy first few settlements predictably toppled over, when we ran out of food/firewood/clothes/all of the above, but eventually I settled into a nice, soothing rhythm of building and consolidating. Stuff takes time to happen, so you can't charge around building farms and smithies and whatnot, you get there gradually, and with planning. Secure basic food, fuel and shelter in the first year, scavenge materials, plant trees, open a smithy a few years in, maybe barter for some chickens, a few more houses, a bridge over a stream...seasons tick by at a leisurely pace while you think about what you want to do in the next decade, or how you're going to create enough food to support the next twenty people.\n\nIt's not frantic, and once you know what you're doing there's not much that can surprise you, but sometimes you just want to do that, build up your little decorative fishtank of farmers and quarrymen. I think what it sets out to do, it accomplishes excellently, but the lack of surprise and novelty will (I think) stop me playing in the long run. There's nothing grandiose to shoot for, like Pharaoh's monuments, there's no pressing reason to keep expanding. Beyond occasional gimmicky disasters, you're mostly going to be staring at the streets, weighing up whether a tunnel would be a good use of stone, and adjusting the worker distribution to pump out a few more iron tools.\n\nIt's relaxing, it's reasonably deep, it's pretty, just don't expect too much in the way of an epic saga and you won't be disappointed.","February 23, 2014","true","14.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

And maybe it will, once mod support is finally added. If it's actually added. Dear god, please just add it. It's going to lead to amazing things, I know it.\n\nSo what are we dealing with here? You've probably seen the words "city-builder", "survival" and "strategy" words getting tossed around. Imagine SimCity set in medieval times, but on a much lesser scale. Remember Stronghold 1? Take the economic aspect out of that. Add Children of the Nile to the mix, minus all the monkeys. Splice those suckers together. Bam! You get Banished.\n\nIf that sounds exciting to you, then by all means, go nab the game. But first be aware that:\n\n- There are no quests, no war, no enemies, no money, no research. It's pure and simple "build" and "survive", or "build to survive" in this case. Also trade weed for chickens! Exciting.\n- There are randomly occuring disasters to spice up the gameplay, but the rate at which they happen remains a complete mystery to  me. My last hard game had none occur during the 50 years span. My normal game before that had two tornadoes in a row. Ho hum.\n- All in all, this game doesn't have much to offer: if you're familiar/experienced with the genre, there's a good chance that it'll only take you a few playthroughs to figure out the game's mechanics and grow a large town, at which point it becomes a very tedious experience... Until you start anew.\n- Finally, there's no end and no goal. If you really MUST have that sense of "accomplishment", you're gonna have to resort to achievement hunting, or set your own goals.\n\nBUT!\n\n- There's STILL a considerable amount of depth in this game. The only way to truly succeed is through careful management, strong infrastructure and a wee bit of luck. Do you enjoy bossing tiny pixel people around? Then boy oh boy, is this the game for you.\n- It is ridiculously addicting, so you better get some coffee before tapping that play button. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n- The lack of a goal is not necessarily a bad thing. While it may sound off-putting, that's where your imagination comes to play. There's not much room for roleplaying here, but planning your village's layout and dealing with terrain obstacles on each newly generated map is fun and exciting, like in any sandbox game.\n- IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON, FOR GOD'S SAKE, so mad props for that!\n\nMy verdict? I certainly got my money's worth here. Good city sims are a rare sight nowadays, and the (hopefully) upcoming mod kit just might improve the game tenfold with the help of community. So good luck, and full speed ahead.","July 4, 2014","true","23.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/242920/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Welcome to the future of knights and merchants, without the fighting. Some may like the fact it doesn't have battles while some prefer it. If your looking for a game where NPC's look after themselves, this is it. If you're looking for that but with a little war involved, I suggest you go look at Knights and Merchants (for a relatively low on-sale price)!\n\nWhat is the goal? The goal is to keep your civilians alive as long as you can and expand your village as best as you can. Banished is a game in which you organize the village and the NPC's do as you say. They do not follow your orders directly as they cannot be selected (only for viewing/status purposes). As you head the village, you call the shots on who does what. Say you want to build a house. You will have civilians at your disposal to complete such a task. The trick is choosing the right amount of laborers to be trained civilians. This means you don't want to have all 12 of your competent laborers to be builders. Why? Well, the more of one particular class means less potential for others. I usually hover around having one or two builders at my disposal while very rarely having any free laborers. Other professions include farmer, herdsmen, gatherer, fisherman, hunter, woodcutter (for fire wood), forester, herbalist, blacksmith, brewer, tailor, vendor, trader, miner (for iron), stone cutter (for stone), teacher, physician and cleric. The trick is to properly balance out the professions of each individual.\n\nThe number one thing to focus on though is food and firewood. If you run out of either you'll start seeing civilians die quickly. Stone and iron can sort of be a rare commodity given how much you build. Your population will start to grow slowly and can sort of be pushed by building new houses. Problem is though, have too big of a population and watch your reserves drift away quite quickly. Before you know it, you'll have messages popping in at the bottom saying your civs are dying. There is a notification system in place by the tool bar (to the bottom right) that indicates if your full or have a shortage of supply. Some of these notifications also include a merchant, a disease or even nomads. Given you have built a trading post along the water, a merchant will appear every so often. New merchants will pop up offering different goods. You can choose to order every time this certain merchant comes to town, once or never. There is a bug in the game where if you kill off all your livestock, it's quite difficult to get them back again. I haven't quite grasped how to get more but I know there is one specialty merchant that will sell livestock to you.\n\nThere are times instead of taking the livestock to the fields, they will be taken in for raw meat. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a lack of laborers but I wanted to make my reader cognizant of the fact. Merchants also sell seeds and product (such as pears or ale). To combat a disease, one must have a physician and a hospital in the village. Nomads will occasionally show up to your village asking for asylum which is great if your population is low. Again, beware taking in more population as your reserves can deplete quickly. A graveyard can also be built to accommodate the dead and a church to gain followers. There is a catch to getting civilians become skilled tradesmen. You will need to build a school to educate your population. Additions to the game include dirt and stone roads, a town hall that tells you the status of your village and a marketplace. A marketplace evenly distributes reserves (from food to supplies) to your village. Without one, you may have a few needy villagers take most of the supply. Building is relatively easy in game and provides you with a decent amount of options (buildings can also be rotated as needed). You may upgrade wooden buildings to a stone building. Beware though, don't do it all at once. You may leave some citizens homeless!\n\nThe visuals tend to resemble city skylines almost identically at times. What you see is what you get. The animations themselves are relatively good and you may need to zoom in to see properly. You can get in pretty close and rotate the camera as you please. They're between a cross of realistic and cartoon graphics. The sounds are suitable to the environment. Not exactly diverse but good enough. The music is pretty good and sets the mood and setting appropriately.\n\nThis is a game where easily you can spend a few hours in without knowing the time. Overall, it's a pretty good game and provides a bit of a challenge trying to keep your citizens alive and well. On the other hand, there are a lot of other unexposed perks that could have been put into the game such as invaders.\n\n\nRATING : 7.3/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nThe start of something amazing\n\nArrows indicate that the production has reached it's limit whereas the octagon indicates no work is being done at that location\n\nThe merchants in town\n\nWhen nomads arrive, their fate is in your hands\n\nMy best yet\n\nLuckily, no one got really sick in my village","January 29","true","17.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Jeep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/555-555-1247/","129 products in account","Also known as Kino's Journey Simulator 2014.\n\nDon't Let The Idiots Live, Ever.\n\nBanished! You and your sect of friends, family, feeble, and rabble have been banished from your home kingdom/city-state/fuedal village for whatever closed-minded reason, and have decided to settle your own hamlet/city/empire.\n\nNow, Banished is an attractive, medeival-looking city building game where you construct a small town out of the landscape around you, and then watch it wither away into dust as the idiots fail to harvest their own fields stay in that simple stage until the Netherworld (read:hell) freezes over.\n\nSounds a bit boring, right? If not, go back to watchin' that paint dry.\n\nIf it does sound slightly... bland, that's because you've not heard the terrors provided by nature. Remember the Oregan Trail? Dysentery is going to look like gold once you're done being Banished.\n\nThe cold kills, diseases kill, idiots can't harvest enough crops to feed themselves, nomads will flood your town, the mines and quarries kill, mothers die in childbirth, there's a stabbing at the market! A fire!\n\nHope you built a hospital to quell that plague, or some wells to keep your wooden shacks from burning like the Cleveland river. The stabbings can't be helped, people are just evil, sometimes.\n\nThat's all just the general layout, too. Really, anything could kill the villagers - even themselves.\n\nBut, the game also gives you all sorts of chances and options to thrive. Most basic needs are easy to access, and come in that wonderfully stepped system of mine, build, die horribly, profit. And people are resilient and happy if they're given the right help, so build that school! Learn 'em up!\n\nAnd now, my personal experience with Banished:\n\nHad the luck to spawn on a large lake where a river emptied out, so fishing was a quick way to grab food. Forests all around, and not many mountains, so plenty of supplies at the ready for my town. Soon, was running a village of happy, healthy people and managed to have it grow beyond the lake and into the wilderness, with nearly sixty educated people.\nSeeing a large, flat stretch of land close by, I set farmland out and began growing a crop of pumpkin. Life was good.\n\nFor atleast five years, that system worked. Until, one day after building a long-awaited chapel and town hall, everything hit the fan with the full force of an atmoic detonation. I made the horrible, awful, absolutely terrible decision to close the school, believing it would benefit me for the time to produce faster rather than in larger yields.\n\nBad, bad move.\n\nThe now-moronic people of The Land of Equals couldn't create tools nearly as efficiently or quickly as their past relatives, and even with full fields from good weather, would not harvest enough to feed the nearly-120 person population. And the great decline into starvation began, until a decade later, when there were only 17 survivors who'd managed to stay alive and get through schooling.\n\nAnd, as I type, the educated remnants of that Banished pilgrimage are rebuilding with stunning succes thanks to their teaching. But the town hall's charts will forever show the great decline into Idiocy, and the impact it had upon The Land of Equals.\n\nSo, TL;DR short, Banished is amazing. It can be calming, or stressful. It can give you a warm feeling of care, or a cold feeling of despair. If you take the challenge, be prepared for anything. AND NOW THERE'S MODS! =D\n\n9.1247/10","October 2, 2014","true","75.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

But there's one game mechanic which just ruins everything . . . starvation. When you build a house and it becomes occupied, the people who move in will take whatever they need from your reserves of food and fuel and they will never ever share it.\n\nSo picture this, a house with a 75 year old person in it, fully stocked with firewood, coal and food. The house next door has a family of 6 and they freeze to death, the family next door to them has a family of 4 and they starve to death. With this game mechanic you will lose lots of people, over and over again when it is not necessary, and there is no mod to correct it.","November 29, 2015","false","92.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","5"

Building a town, furfilling the needs of my population, trading etc. After playing a few hours I just felt betrayed. There is no real enemy but the AI. Villagers do basicly what they want, even if you give them another order, people die of ridiculous reasons (my chicken sheperd got trampled to death...), plagues or tornados nearly have no effect on my population and even on the highest difficulty the game bored me. Why? Here are some reasons:\n\n- Most of the time I waited for the children to grow up, time I was forced to do nothing but watch the poorly animated people\n- There is absolutly no progress. Yes, your town grows. But unlocking technology through building schools? Nope. Getting better buildings because your builders get more experienced or receiving a better education? Nope.\n- Any competition against another AI? Nope. You are absolutly alone. Without any threat. So what's the point in building and enhancing your city?\n- It is too easy. Even without any alien danger, there could have been something. Maybe an economy you have to keep going (things like a currency for payments, work time, trading special rescources for happyness etc)  or citizens leaving your town to form a own community. There is enough potential in this game to furfill those things...\n\nThese are my main reasons why I don't recommend buying this game. If you are looking for a challenge, don't buy this game. If you just want to build a town without any difficulty, without any point and just wait for things to happen, then this game is really a thing.","October 31, 2014","false","43.5"," 69 of 120 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","69","120","0","5"

Think of the Anno series or Age of Empire series but have it more about survival from teh cold, food and natural disasters. The village you craft will be the new home for the banished people. Along the way you will build all kinds of things as you try to get a nice village made for you're people. Older people die, there kids get older and you have a new generation of people to deal with.\n\nIt is a very challenging game, but at the same time some how relaxing (like Anno is for me), highly reccomended. Great gameplay, nice art design, fantastic atmosphere, great immersion, good UI and its just a blast to play. Mix in survival elements into the city building genre and you have my personal favorite strategy game since Anno2070 and Total War Shogun2. It really is amazing that only one person made this game. You WILL fail at times but you will learn and improve and each time you start a new game things can and will go differently but you have some new designs and ideas from previous games that might help!\n\nGo buy this game right now if you want a survival game mixed with a city building game, fantastic indie game and a early MUST BUY for 2014.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/animalker/recommended/242920/","animalker","Animalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/animalker/","75 products in account","I like this game, but I can't recommend it at full price. There just isn't enough there.\n\nOn the whole, Banished is an exceptionally slow game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it gives you far more control over your village, but the player grows past the speed pretty fast, and then you're stuck staring at the screen waiting for the glacier to move.  Population is the biggest thing, as it crawls up so slowly creating new, necessary jobs to keep your town alive is difficult. Seasons pass without much fuss or difference. I never had a problem with starvation or disease or... well, anything, and I was playing on medium. It felt like easy. I went 20+ years in game time without a single disaster, although I had it turned on. If you're going to have a disaster system, you should have a disaster system. The trading system takes about five years to start even after you build your dock, and then they only trickle in once every two to three years if you're lucky, and they only ever bring one or two items. Better hope it's what you want. Ordering my sheep took well over ten after the traders started coming, although I was very excited when I finally got them. Excited over buying sheep- the citybuilder life.\n\nCitizens seem to constantly swap jobs around with no rhyme or reason. They almost basically refuse to move outside the town's radius to harvest resources, and as of such you find yourself running out. You can't prioritise what business gets the resources first, so it ends up being grabbed by whoever wants it over the business that actually needs it (logs & the woodcutter). The hunter AI is absolutely moronic- I watched one stroll casually through a herd of deer, then wander off, still apparently working. This was not an isolated incident. The tiny size of the hunter's radius is another big no- I would've expected it to be a great deal larger because surprise, animals move around the map. I liked they didn't hunt them to extinction though. Coupled with the hunter's terribad abilities is the lack of leather, which creates hide coats, which is a main trading chip along with firewood and iron tools. They also keep your citizens warm, but whatever, they're worth a lot at the trading post. #priorities\n\nThe music is beautiful, the graphics are nice, and I love the trees when they're mid way through growing (pine trees, but tiny. it's adorable). It's a charming game, and a decently relaxing one too (I do say this as someone who has never had a disaster, though. I imagine that raises the stress level). The controls are lovely, although in a game with micromanagement there needs to be... an easier way to do a couple of things? For instance, I should be able to stockpile items I don't want the town to use, I would've also liked the ability to move things from a storage unit to another- think Pharoah, and 'accept all/get maximum'. (to those of you who have never played Pharoah, do so ASAP. it's my favourite city builder by a longshot, and holds up extremely well despite how old it is... but set speed at 90%, not 100%).\n\nSo, in short. I guess I like Banished, It's enjoyable, but it's mind-numbingly slow, even for a citybuilder, which aren't exactly known for their high action gameplay. I think it's worth $5, but it's not worth $20, so buy it on sale and give it a go if you like games that are slow paced.","June 18, 2015","false","7.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Overall, this game is amazing.  It's got multiple (and I mean multiple) elements to consider in order for the player to achieve a healthy, happy, thriving community.  However, the basic mechanics are pretty easy to learn and the tutorials, while being somewhat bare minimum, are enough to at least get the player happily started on his own dreams of popuation building domination.  As I've played the game I've noticed:\n\n- Having auto-pause on tabbing out is wonderful.  Some people may be annoyed by this, but since the player's population can go from happily frolicking through fields full of plums and cherries to attempting to cut down trees or mine rocks with their bare hands, puking their guts out and then trying madly to find the nearest hospital while shivering from the cold... all in a few moments on 10x speed... yeah.  Hurray for auto-pause so the population doesn't die while the player decides to load up youtube and watch a 2 minute video.\n\n- Merchants in ships do not seem to use their spyglasses to look for supplies when deteriming which trading post to visit. When given the choice between a trading post full of workers and materials vs. a trading post with two lonely workers struggling to load 10 barrels of apples into an empty warehouse, guess which one the merchant picks fifty percent of the time? That's right!  He visits the seedy looking trading post with a few apples and completely bypasses the ten workers in the supply-laden trading post waving welcome signs and cheering. Sigh.\n\n- One basket of produce left in a farmer's field over the winter somehow magically prevents that farmer from planting seeds or harvesting crops from any of the rest of his field the next planting season.  I realize the basket probably does take up five feet of space, but Mr. Farmer, honestly, you can just walk around it. I promise. Or better yet, take it to the storehouse so it is actually useable.\n\n- All hunters in this game should be provided with a gps and a gun safety manual.  Hunters can produce an amazing amount of leather and venison in just one season.  Left to themselves, even alone in that huge mansion of a hunting lodge they get, one hunter can produce enough to feed a small army IF they are smart enough to find the deer standing outside the front door and not walk past them to aimlessly search for deer three miles away.  When they do eventually find a herd of deer, hunters seem to throw caution to the wind and take out as many of the cervine as they can, eventually hunting them to extinction and leaving no animals for the following several years.\n\n- Actions taken by the populace of each city give the player a sense of a helpful, industrious community bent on serving others and helping with daily tasks.  This is awesome and probably would be the ideal scenario for any group of people who were banished to a remote location and forced to rely on one another to survive.  I love that farmers will help carry supplies to build houses, miners will sacrifice time and energy to carry logs from the storage area to a build site, and the local brewmaster will even leave the pub to help someone down the road carry his basket of fish to the storehouse as soon as he has extra time.  However, this is hell when the player's wonderful generous workers decide to help the person waaaay on the other side of the map, or to help clear a group of trees approximately nine hundred miles away, leaving their own jobs to stagnate and become unproductive.  Upon realizing that nine hundred miles was probably slightly too far to walk in one season, they then try to return to their homes and jobs, only to become famished and cold since they apparently left without coats or a lunchbox...or a tractor trailer loaded with all the stuff they'd need to not die before they got back to town.\n\n- As it stands now, when building fields, orchards, and pastures, the player is unable to see how many workers will be required to serve at these locations once they are actually built.  While somewhat amusing, it is also pretty frustrating since this results in juggling workers back and forth unless the player has the size-to-worker ratio already memorized.\n\n- WTB: the ability to toggle trees, stone, iron, and other terrain features on and off in order to be able to see what is being built where, to be able to plan roads that actually go in a straight line, and to have better city planning ability in general.\n\n- Grats to the developer on coming up with some character names that made me laugh out loud several times.  I personally got kicks and giggles out of having three versions of the name "Orill" pairing up with "Colon" in the stone house I built for them and then surviving happily ever after presumably meeting each others needs quite well until their eighties.\n\n- Every once in a while, even the most robust woodcutter needs to see the herbalist for a remedy.  This works quite well, until the player realizes that their woodcutter should have gone much earlier, because even though his information tells the player that he is visiting the herbalist, he is hallucinating since the herbalist hut has not been built yet and said herbalist will not exist for the next two years.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after a very long commentary and review, there are quite a few small tweaks to gameplay that need to be ironed out, but for a 1.0 release this game is incredible and impressive not only graphically but in its ability to release (for the most part) without a hitch.  I look forward to Banished 1.0.1 and beyond!","March 23, 2014","true","315.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Call it a "civilization builder" and you're closer to it, because you don't just have to build them a place to live, provide them with resource and protect them from disasters, you also have to protect from themselves.\n\nYou're in control of some kind of communist-anarchist utopia where there is no money and everyone has "equal" (first come, first served) access to resources, but where everyone acts like a greedy consumerist! They'll take as many resources as they need/can from the public storage without any consideration for other people (they'll happily watch their neighbours starve while they have food for a full month) and will rather have their civilization collapse than regroup in houses during harsh times to save on fuel.\n\nThat said, it's an enjoyable (but very harsh) game that will reward your good planning skills by not screwing you at the first occasion and has some great potential with mods coming along in the next few weeks (depending on how much can be changed/added in these).\nBut it's also a very harsh game that might not very be enjoyable if you just want to place good looking buildings/roads all over the place (building diversity is at the bare minimum, as you'd expect from a small medieval community struggling to survive) for only the sake of making a good-looking city, buy SimCity, not Banished.\n\nAnd if all these points seem fine to you, then you should expect a lot of late nights spend building (and rebuilding) medieval villages and possibly a few "damn it's 3am already!"","February 20, 2014","true","50.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Caboose123/recommended/242920/","Caboose123","Caboose.exe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Caboose123/","478 products in account","This game takes city building in a different direction. It's not like the Sim City games (The GOOD ones, so definetly not SIm City 2013) or Cities XL, which I do not own but I've soon my friends who love city building games play it and it looks good and they say it's amazing. No Banished is different from traditional city builders where what you build is dependent on the money you have and what poeple want. In those games you're the mayor of your town of >insert name here< and you are there to serve the people that move in because that's government. In Tropico you are the dictator and you have a lot more freedom though the things you do may get you in trouble and it won't take long for you to figure out what to do to succeed (Still a fun game though with a great sence of humor). In Banished, there is no one to please, no income, no hand holding and no dumbing things down just because things should be simple.\n\nBanished adds survival and RTS elements to the city building genre. You start off with a few people, a few resourses and no real instructions (which would be nice for a few things.). It's like Minecraft, there is no shame in going online to look up information on what to do and you may end up failing many times before getting the hang of the game and even then you still need to be careful. What you end up doing is creating farms, houses, tailors, woodcutters and other jobs slowly and allocate the amount of people you want to work that job and you can even adjust the max number of people allowed to work on that location. And if your like me, at least early on, you'll find yourself constently re-allocating people depending on the season. That's another thing that this game has is the seasons which will affect things like crops. For instance, you can't grow crops when there's snow during late Autumn through Winter, so during this time you move people from growing crops to other jobs.\n\nNow one might think that since the player relies that much on the citizen's A.I.'s, if the game is glitchy then they're screwed. And they'd be right. HOWEVER, that is not the case here. Aside from one issue I had with crops that might be due to the A.I., I never had a problem and seem to be someone who gets glitches most gamers don't get. It's so well made that when I fail I have no one to blame but myself. The game did what I asked it to but I should have done something different. This game is so optimized I've never had a problem with frame rate and it takes up such a small amount of hard drive space! I find it amazing that this game was made by one person where games like Day One: Garry's Incedent are made by a group of people and fail on things like collision and even things that can be fixed by simply changing a number. (Seriously, why can't the gun in that game kill people who are wearing nothing but a piece of cloth?) Or even big dev teams with a big name company backing them releasing broken, incomplete games (Looking at you EA).\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building. This is a game that can end up taking a lot of time out of you day. I bought it on a Friday and Sunday night I realized that not only have I not reach year 100 yet but it's actually 1 in the morning Monday and I have homework I forgot to do. This is something that has never happened to me with any city building game. Here I really felt incharge and what I say I want my people to do they will and when I fail, it's not to a glitch or poor A.I. but to my own mistake. "I should have had more hunters and less fisherman." or "Should have made my sheep farm bigger." I'm not even really one to play these types of games because I always failed at Sim City as a child. This game has definitly held my interests and I would even say it might be worth getting when it's not on sale. (Which pretty much when I buy all my games)","May 18, 2014","true","29.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

If you love city building/management games it does not get any better than this.  THIS SHOULD REPLACE SIMCITY! There is no DRM or any cash store involved.

It takes time to get your village up and running but as soon as you do it feels great.\n\nPros: Great atmosphere, Good graphics, very balanced gameplay, ADDICTING gameplay, Very deep synergy between what you build and how it affects your people,  overall a very, very fun game\n\nCons: Sometimes the villagers just stand around or wont build a bridge if its the first thing you try and do (not sure if this is a game flaw or design)\n\nI give this game a 9/10.

There's no technology or development tree or anything, allowing the player to freely choose in what ways to progress in his or her town. The citizens have vague needs, so you can choose how to satisfy them. A town can be based on any and all production facilities, and so long as you have some form of surplus, you can trade to acquire things that you yourself are not producing. Finding balance in population expansion and resource production is still a challange, and a quite enjoyable one at that. The AI of the villagers is about average though, and there are still some things that need improved, such as the deer walking across lakes and rivers... or hunters dying of starvation when there are animals in their front yard.

Uneducated villagers for doctors, educated villagers for fishermen. Villager whose tools just broke become the new blacksmith and works in slow motion for a year or so...\n- You can't choose which resources to store where, so the things you need usually end up in the farthest storage. Nor can you move them in any controlled manner, you'll have to start tearing the building down which will transfer everything to the closest (?) storage.\n- The AI will typically try to take the shortest path, even if it means that the villagers walk one square beside the stone road (faster travel) you just built.\n- You can level large parts of a solid mountain wall by starting to build a certain building near the edge of the slope, but you can't level a small dirt mound preventing the placement of a regular building (without using this exploit).\n- The villagers will not necessarily do what they are supposed to, and there is little you can do to control it. There is a "work priority" button which may send a few villagers the right way, if you're lucky. It's not uncommon to have to abort ALL other tasks, to get some villagers to do what they are assigned to do before a whole year pass in game.\n\nI like hardcore games, but it's no fun when you are in a constant struggle with the broken AI.

To build a village, like one of those you see in the screenshots, you'll need ~3h.\nBut to be honest, you'll kill your settlers on the first try anyway:\n- Not enough wood to keep them warm in the winter?\n- Not enough food stored for the winter?\n- Your villagers are ill but you have no medicine?\n- Did you overuse your fields and the last harvest was complete ♥♥♥♥?\n- Did the bad weather destroy everything on your fields?\n\nYou don't have thousands of sims running around. Your village includes 20-100 people. You even recognize some of them by name because you were so happy when you realized that a new baby was born. Then you see him becoming a student, then a worker...until he freezes to death because you didn't provide enough clothing. ♥♥♥♥!\n\nThis game was developed by one guy, you can mod the game and the performance is great.

Banished is a highly polished and detailed little world ready for you and your people to inhabit. There is a real sense of achievement with everything that this game does. Whether it's balancing food with population or trying to balance the diets of your people- every building built is rewarding and actually has a use.

This game is elegant in its simplicity, and zooming in to watch your villagers carry about their daily tasks is one of the most serene things I've had the joy of experiencing in a video game.  Watching your first village come to life is utterly delightful.\n\nMy main gripes here are that the game is somewhat limited in its content and depth.  After awhile, you stablize and simply run out of things to do.  Sure, you can grow and expand your village, but at a certain point growth just becomes a process of repeating the same building orders across a map until eventually you cover the entire map.  The game also suffers from a reverse difficulty curve--the first few years are usually the hardest part of the game, and as you keep playing the game becomes easier and easier to the point where your village is stable enough that it can self-recover from any natural disaster.\n\nModding support is on the way, and with that will probably come more challenging scenarios and the like, but for the time being I feel like there's a finite amount of content to enjoy here.  Still, it's a great experience while it lasts.","February 20, 2014","true","33.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is an amazing game and piossibly the best strategy/survival sumulator I have played. I did enjoy it and wouldn't change anything, but would at least add things but I was forced to stop playing because after 15hrs of playing, I feel like that one person who actually ready that one shirt "How do yo keep an idiot busy? (see back of shirt). For me, the equivalent was spending hours on maps just to hit a brick wall when you reached a point where everyone died of stupidity, or at least the precipice of the programming.\n\nCons:\n-After 10 plus maps that I spent hours trying to sustain a population of 12+ and making a town, those 10+ games ended with people starving within an hour+ into the game. The one before last everybody was hungry, there was no food, even though I had 4 crop fields, two orchards, a hunting cabin, a fishing area, and a gatherer. My very last game made me quit, because I was building houses for my homeless people when they suddenly just stopped all building at 30% and walked around aimlessly. I used the priority tool, I made everyone builders, I needed another stock pile for everything they had (I even had a Market Place) yet they all idled all over the land, far from even where they were supposed to be working as farmers. In the end, the 12 people I ended with were content to share two houses when they needed warmth instead of building the 5 houses they were supposed to build and use just to wander around aimlessly with 'House' symbols over their head, giving up their jobs just to starve to death. Tell them to tear a tree down it's a mass exodus to fullfill that one order. After that, wander aimlessly, some even winding up roughly the equivalent of 300+ feet away from anything that was being built or farmed. I had built a school to teach how not to be stupid, but that remained undone at 10%.\n\nPros:\n-This is a wonderful game, the graphics are nice, it's really is beautiful, the controls are easy and I got the hang of it in no time, but this glitch or whatever it is that makes them stop, make it stop. I will continue to play this game, but I will use the Debug tool just so I can pop in more people that can just walk around aimlessly and not build a damn thing.\n\nSo to all reading, yet I have played this game for 15 hrs, yes I played multiple maps and started differently in every way, always created a food source and homes first, used the priority tool when needed. Only on my last two attempts did I create the Hunter's Cabin first instead of after the crops and it worked out wonderfully, untill everyone just stopped building, eating and caring. I wasted all this try trying so many thing to make this game work for me and trying to convince myself it was just this map or this save got corrupted, but after 15hrs of trying to convince yourself, I let go og the ghost and decided to walk away from the money and hours wasted and trying to revive a dying horse and just went to play with another one.\n\nThis game must have a bug because I am not the only one who has issues with this and had used attempts that others have suggested.\n\n\nNOTE: *This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall proffesional view if the game for general audience to use as a guide. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.\n\n\n*although this is based on actual gameplay and research done on others who have had same issues. My issue remains unsolved and unresolved.","December 7, 2014","false","59.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","4"

The dominant strategy for Banished is this\n\n1) build a gathering hut in a large forest, prioritize-build it while the others go gather wood, stone, and iron in ANOTHER forest, put four people in it after it's finished.\n2) build a forester lodge beside the hut when enough wood and stone are gathered, put four people in it after it's finished, switch laborers to focus on stone and iron\n3) build enough houses to house the families, construct woodcutters, then either a taylor or a blacksmith, depending on whether you need more clothing or tools.\n4) build other buildings as resources come in, but always leave a surplus of food of around 100xpopulation, 10xpopulation of firewood; 2xpopulation of clothing and tools is recommended if playing conservatively.\n5) priortize houses as they are important for growth. They are where babies are made, and 30-something siblings living with their 70-something parents ain't going to make kids.\n\nEven on small mountaineous map with harsh climate, on hard difficulty, presumably the hardest starting scenario, one can double the population by year 10 just by doing the above, and get to 50 by year 20 is not out of the question.  The dominant factor for this game is the availability of space for more housing, balance against the food production buildings and wooded areas for firewood.  Variables like education and chapels are merely cosmetics that increase the efficiency of space, but not necessarily needed to grow your town.  As for natural disasters, since your town is likely separated into several parts by bodies of water, and as far as I can tell fire doesn't go through water, and tornados don't wreck more than one part of town, if one has enough of a surplus, one can easily rebuild and those are not game-changing disasters.\n\nSo survival is simple.  If you like a game that you can play while playing another game on another computer, this is recommended.  This is a solved game; but people continue to play tic-tac-toe even though it's analytically uninteresting, so others may differ in opinion.\n\nEdit -- this is an evaluation of the vanilla game; perhaps with mods there will be enough complexity to make it less linear.","March 26, 2015","false","28.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

You can cut trees and produce firewood or use coal in order to stay warm. If you use trees either you wont be able to move your town towards forests or you will make the map a desert.  I've been cutting trees like Isengard and it wasnt enough. So you'll want to go with coal mines, right? 30 workers in a coal mine makes 7000 coal at max which is not enough. And each person eats 100 food per year so in big picture you exchange 30.000 food for 7.000 coal. And that's a lot of food.\n\nThis issue made me crazy so thats why i stopped playing.

Basically, we want to have fun, but we also want to experience an ideas in safe environment, without suffering the consequences. The thing that excites since the dawn of gaming industry are god/manager/tycoon games, games that let players experience what is it like to run something and to be alpha and omega behind the whole idea.\n\nComparison of indie wonder Banished with Simcity series might come in handy if we want to explain to someone what this game is about in the term of mechanics. Yes, it's a city builing-management game, but it is also much more than that. It is a war of nerves, fast decisions and perfect example of hard, but satisfying gameplay.\n\nYou start to build your city with certain number of families and objects, depending on starting difficulty. Terrain is random. You gather resources, handle building, give instructions to people. You'll need to provide shelter, gather wood, stone, iron, chop it to firewood to keep everyone warm. Gather berries, hunt and fish. As the game progresses, you'll start building schools to educate kids, mines and quarries to dig deeper in search for stone, coal and iron, you'll expand over rivers. Your city will be visited by traders from all around that will bring more seeds, more different trees, various cattle. But the traders will also bring diseases, your town will catch fire, there will be other disasters... The summers seem so short and winters so harsh. People will be born. People will grow up. People will die. Frozen. Starved. Or just of an old age. You'll see local cemetery growing every year and respect the sacred ground, knowing it is the final resting place to people who gave  everything for a growing city...\n\nGraphics and sounds of Banished are there to sooth you and to help you concentrate on numbers. Lot of green color will make your eyes relaxed and ready for long hours...\n\nBanished isn't an easy game. You will face numerous challenges, even with the help of guides and tutorials. You'll be on the brink of extinction, but the game is fair - so it is possible to fall down and rise to be powerful again. That's the most beautiful thing about Banished - it's rewarding and it makes you quit the game and go to bed happy and fulfilled - even when you lose everything, it makes you come back for more.\n\nAnd when the game does that - that's why we play it over and over again.\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","June 28, 2014","true","9.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Banished is marvelous, an absolute thrill to play. The in game economy is very complex and diverse and can quickly screw you if you aren't careful. The city building aspect is difficult, time consuming and very believable.\n\nIn order to survive, you need only provide houses for population growth, diverse food stores for consumption, clothing to keep the cold off, firewood to warm houses and tools to work with. With each new house, 2-4 children are born that need to be fed, clothed and educated (potentially). Each new citizen requires a rethink of food stores, clothing and tool supplies. If you build too many houses at one time, your people will risk starvation or dying from exposure. These things happen before you can even begin to consider a solution. If your people start dying, you will lose much needed workers. If you don't have enough farmers, even more people starve. If you choose to make all your tool makers farm for a season, you will run out of tools, resulting in extremely slow crop production and people will starve. If this wasn't bad enough, you also have to provide your citizens with a variety of food products to maintain ultimate health. People can't live on cabbage alone, they also need grains, protein and fruits to remain healthy.\n\nThis is by far my favorite city building game. It has unlimited replay-ability and will keep you entertained for hours, even if half of your time is spent screaming at the screen in an attempt to make your farmers work more quickly, or trying to figure out how one of your builders got stuck in an icy tundra in the middle of winter with no clear path home (I mean seriously how does this keep happening??)","February 10, 2015","true","269.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I'm not going into deep strategies here, but I'll try to give some pro tips. Thanks for reading.\n\nBanished is about a group of people who have been banished from their homeland and must re-establish themselves in their new land while trying to survive exposure and deprivation. It's essentially a city-builder where your enemies are time, weather, starvation, sickness, and poor planning. You start the game by setting a few basic conditions that will determine much of your fate before you even begin. In my experience, even on the easiest settings, I rarely have a group last more than 20 years. I haven't studied any strategy guides or gone into the forums much, so I'm sharing just what I've learned through the school of hard knocks.\n\nBanished can be an unforgiving game. If you frustrate easily, you may want to give it a pass. Let me add, however, that when your strategy works, there is a sense of an actual accomplishment that many far less challenging games fail to deliver.  And you're going to need some type of strategy and some luck to survive more than 7 years in many instances.\n\nAfter you've made your starting choices, you hit the ground running. You can let the clock tick along fairly slowly, but where's the fun in that? Pause the game, have a quick look around, open your most critical reports and let them hang on the edge of your vision, assign initial tasks to villagers, and pump the clock up to 10x speed (if you get bored easily like me--otherwise, just let it go). You may feel an inclination to go big, but I judge that would be a mistake. Don't clear huge areas of land or build the largest farms you can in the hopes that you will survive the first winter--you probably will regardless of what you do.. but that second winter might be your end-game even so. There will be time for going big later after you've learned the basics.\n\nGo moderate, but go quickly. Consider these as your first tasks (not necessarily in this order, but order can matter a great deal while you're learning... and even after that). Assign a few builders from among the general laborers. Clear some land. Plant some modest farms and an orchard or two. Build a place for the firewood provider to do his job.  Bump up your resource limits for food and fuel. Keep the list of future tasks assigned fairly short so you can change strategies easily when you're first starting out. You'll need more storage space. You'll need more tools. You'll need more iron, stone, wood. You'll need more fuel and food. You'll need medicines, too. The list of tasks keeps rapidly expanding, but choose wisely and try for some moderation. Don't be afraid to switch people around to whatever job is most needed at the moment. Keep in mind, too, that if things get moving along in a good way, you may be faced with a population explosion that might rapidly deplete one or more essentials. If you run out of fuel or food and someone dies of old age or starvation, you may have consigned your settlement to a slow withering death, or a quick one depending upon your skill and luck.\n\nNever give up. You may find yourself down to three people, but if they are hunting, fishing, or engaged in some other food production activity, and if they have enough fuel and other necessary items, you can bring them back from the brink. Just be careful. An abundance of good things combined with a population explosion may leave you without the resources to keep from going over the other direction--then you run out of food, your older workers die from some cause and your children are left to starve or freeze to death. Did I mention the game can be unforgiving? Or perhaps the younger ones already died, and there's nobody but the old and infirm to keep things going just a little longer. Okay, this is getting a little repetitive, but the game can be just that at times.\n\nBanished currently has an active modding community, though the mods seem pretty much limited to tweaks: a new type of building, an improved harvest rate, better schools. Consider adding some. Using the right mods, you can change some important aspects of the game that can give you enough of an advantage that you find yourself lasting longer. However, in my experience, having a few mods does not necessarily guarantee a stroll through the park on Sunday afternoon. A few dumb mistakes could leave you without the things or people you will have to have to survive your first 5 years. Who knows? You may even decide to mod it yourself and make it just the way you'd like to play it. Or not. The choice is yours.\n\nIf you need a big pay-off, I don't think there is one. Nothing in the game gives me any sense that there is anything more to hope for than to survive and grow as a community for one more year. Also, watch out for the time dilation effects. hahaha... No, but you must seriously pay attention to the passage of time in the game because it looks like the seasons pass and only a year has gone by, but your people seem to age far more rapidly than they should. And death is always waiting for your people. Watching and waiting. It's all a delicate balance that you must maintain. Fortunately, there are tweaks for these things as well if you desire to change them.\n\nI think that's enough to give you the general sense of how it plays and what it is. I hope that helps. Thanks again for reading. The game isn't for everyone, but it is worth playing. If you played it before, consider trying it again because, even without mods, it seems a bit easier than it did when I first purchased it--I think the developer may have taken some of the community feedback to heart, in other words.\n\nPeace.","January 28, 2015","true","23.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is not for the faint of heart; if you screw something which may seem minor up, many of your citizens could starve, freeze, or become sick; even when things are going well, something happens which completely blows you off course, such as tornados, crop pests, or just one's own ignorance.\nI like this game because it is unforgiving, which may sound strange, but it is because I like knowing I messed something up and there is a large penalty for it: Death of citizens, which in turn, results in more death.","February 20, 2014","true","49.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

It's very simplistic and unrealistic. The overall concept is great, but nothing new. It has full 3D graphics and you can rotate seamlessly the view 360 degree, though that's really not even necessary and in the end is more a gimmick. Same with tilting up / down and zooming in / out. Overall, Banished is beautiful, yet VERY simplistic in terms of game mechanics, AI and UI. Beautiful graphics (well, they're not mind-blowing) alone don't make a good product, that's what most devs forget. I rather have more simplistic graphics, but much more sophistication and complexity in a game (AKA "Factorio" or "Prison Architect").\n\nBecause of that, in the end I just can't recommend to get it (unless it's on sale and you don't care about the things I point out below), I got it on sale for $5 and might hop into it at some point again for some casual entertainment, but for something challenging that I can really get into, I rather load up Factorio or Prison Architect.\n\nSo, if you're interested, here are (some of) the issues I have with it:\n\n1.Not enough stats output (graphs) - for example, how efficient is someone at their work? Or at least, how efficient is a work-space? Is demand met with supply? It's common sense that you've got those graphs, to effectively manage people (whether that's in a business or colonists trying to establish a town or an established city).\n\n2. Too much micro-management due to "flawed" AI...\n\n2.a. For example, you have a storage barn with food in it. You build another one so you can relocate to another area (there's no way you can do that in the first year, you have to settle, even just temporarily, at that location!) and want to move everything from the previous one to the new one. So you give a demolish order to the old one so that everything is moved over to the new one as soon as that one's built (or even if you wait until it's built, doesn't matter). Yet, as soon as you give the demolish order, everything in it, food, tools, ... will become unavailable to those people. Until it's transferred to the new storage barn and put in there.  Which results in the people starving to the point of dying. Makes perfect sense, right?\n\n2.b. Those people don't seem like virtual versions of humans, but rather robots that look like and have the needs of humans. If I'd be starving, I'd refuse first of all to go long distances to some remote place, knowing that I'd starve on the way there or back; secondly, I'd eat at least a little bit, to the point that I won't starve; third of all, the devs obviously never heard of jerky / dried fruits and veggies!? Why aren't those people taking some food and water along. I mean, come on, that's common sense.\n\n2.c. In RL nobody goes mining / hunting / exploring w/o even the smallest of a backpack. Or goes to work without taking food along (unless you have a cafeteria at your job), even if it's close-by - instead, in Banished, every time someone gets hungry, they walk all the way to their living quarters to eat. Do you know anyone who doesn't work from home and does that? That's very rare to happen, even in a settlement like that where people don't have a 8-5 job but sometimes have to work from 5 in the morning until 8 at night or whenever the sun goes down, to get as much work done during daylight (I know somewhat from personal experience, and I know people who have done that kind of work and told me about how rough it is and what they had to do).\n\n2.d. The "wildlife" (well, there's only one kind, which are deer)... where should I start... For once, they're running all over the place, through your settlement(s), eating right next to where you mine / build / ...; not to mention there's only one kind - the aforementioned deer. No rabbits or other smaller animals. There are also no predators (bears, wolves, ...) in Banished.\n\n3. I'm also not fond of (because it creates a disconnect from reality) how time has been implemented... basically, your settles have babies, raise their children, they become eventually old enough to work and then at some point they die due to old age (or before then, due to accidents). All good stuff.  Also, it implements seasons and each of the four are further divided by three (early, mid and late). However, your "banished" people age rapidly within a year. I haven't paid full attention but I think it takes about three in-game years for people to go through their full life cycle. I understand that you can't obviously play the game in real-time, but all this could've still been implemented much better.\n\n4. In connection to what I just mentioned in 3. regarding time, this also becomes very obvious when building structures or harvesting resources (actually that's another point but I'll just say it here - you have 3 resources for building, that's it: wood logs, stone and metal - not even different types of metals; and two types of fuel, which is fire wood from cut up wood logs, and coal)... it can take a whole month to build a wooden house (one part of a season), yet it takes about the same time to create a fully functional mine.\n\n5. The UI and font both do not scale with your screen resolution, same goes for the location placement of the windows. Also, they don't "snap" to each other's borders. Again, it's usable, but just the way everything is implemented, is just very simplistic.","November 4, 2015","false","20.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","3"

If your birth rate is too low (limited by population mood and available housing), there may not be enough future laborers to take the place of those that die of old age.

I have to say that I'm so pleasantly surprised at how well-thought out this game is. Aside from the details about the game, the developer clearly put a lot of love into this idea enough to create an engine for it. He took into consideration others' imagination to make sure modding is easy (for modders, a circle of people to which I do not belong). I have only been digging into this game 15 hrs more or less at the time of writing this and by no means am I proficient. I've killed off all my populations thus far, but I've played enough to motivate me to share my thoughts.\n\nAs someone who is drawn to the outdoors, I've always been disappointed with the way the living world is depicted in games. Granted, you are still harvesting resources in this building game, but there room for success through many different means. Yes, you could build a large bustling town that depends on farming, animal husbandry, and orcharding and all fueled by industries of coal and iron mining. But you could also supply your population with staples of venison, forest tubers, mushrooms, and other wild edibles by maintaining deep forested areas. This flexibility is a first in my experience, and one I have been long awaiting.\n\nControls are rather straightforward and the tutorial is succinct.\n\nCycles of seasons alter priorities for a town, as do losses of skilled members of the community, and Banished places the gamer in an enjoyable predicament of balancing interests. Population booms may well lead to busts in several decades time, and slow-and-steady seems the safest strategy for the beginners.\n\nThe graphical quality is appealing without being a load on older systems when zooming in and out of the map. Thanks to developers for keeping some great games accessible!\n\nThe music is innocuous (a step up for the genre in my opinion) though not noticed for its greatness. This is expected for a nearly one-person project as sound isn't integral to the\n\nNo tech trees to unlock, which affords all the more opportunities for alternative roads of development.\n\nSome games I happily buy full price, this is one of those few. If you are interested in town-city builders or like me and looking for a break from fast-paced games, this is the best I've come across by far.\n\n","June 26, 2014","true","44.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I know enough at this point to make an informed opinion, right?\n\nThe first thing you should know is that there is no story, nor is there an "end game". I see so many people complaining about that in their reviews. This game follows the lives of your little group of settlers and all of their offspring. They are born, they get married, they breed, they die. Some of them go to school, some of them don't, some farm, some hunt-- ALL of them will, at some point, do something to infuriate you. But how can there be an "end game" in a city builder? It goes completely against the point of building, if you have to stop.\n\nThis game is flawed, yes. There are bugs. People tend to freeze up when their houses catch fire, which is unfortunate. Playing on easy is usually more difficult than playing on hard. Traders only travel by water (slowly), but nomads only travel by land, and in groups that get larger and larger until you have to start turning them away. My favorite, though, is when people starve even though you have an enormous surplus of food. I've encountered this one a lot. All Messica has to do is go to the storage barn to get food, but noooooooooooo, she goes walking in the forest instead.\n\nThen dead.\n\nThere are a lot of positives as well. Your AI is unpredictable, so even if you do the same thing over and over again, they won't. They graphics and sounds are beautiful. And it's true to life. Your mines and quarries will eventually dry out, deforestation causes not only a lack of trees, but a lack of food in that area, too. The maps themselves make you want to see just how big you can push your village, but there's such a delicate balance between growth and resources. It's incredibly hard to find it. I'm still learning how to do things better, even after the amount of time I've put in.\n\nTl;dr- Sure, the game still has bugs, but it was made and is being maintained by one guy. AI is wonky, game can get repetitive, but, as far as city-builders go, Banished is one of the best ever made.","December 28, 2014","true","774.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Before CC and the minimods that improve CC (Sawmill, 1 day is 1 day, CC Fountain mod, etc) Banished was a great idea and a great platform but without much game in it.

It's easily worth a purchase now, especially when on sale, and I can only see it improving in the future.

For me personally this game was worth it, but someone that doesn't like something that gets repetitive, and doesn't really want to strive to get to like say 900 citizens, or building more efficient cities this probably isn't the game for you then. Basically you'll have made every building available in the first few hours. But the real awesome part of this game is building the city you made more efficent, getting through natural disasters, preparing yourself for winter's worst, and just keeping everyone in your city happy and health is where the real fun is in this game.\n\nThis game honestly can be played while watching a movie and kinda just monitoring your citizens every once and a while on x1 speed, or if you want to power through and built up your city and not have to wait as much for things to be built go ahead with the x10 speed.\n\nHope this helps any of you that are skeptical about buying the game, and that it will sway you towards or away from buying it because we all want a fun enjoyable game to play through and this may be it for you.","February 22, 2014","true","18.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

How about a mode where they can go to war with you? Make people become soldiers, armed with weapons and armor, all could be made in a barracks. The blacksmith can make weapons and provide to the barracks which will distribute to soldiers. Send them off to fight or defend. Build walls and towers. Can't be attacked more than once within 4 years or something. Better weapons and armor can be researched in maybe a new building.\n4. Quests- Maybe merchants will tell you, "Get me a treasure buried somewhere over there" or "Defeat the nearby nomads" to earn food, XP (will be explained in 5th), or livestock.\n5. The ability to, after doing challenges or quests to earn XP, progress to the next age or era. From the colonial age to modern, build an empire. (maybe to ambitious)\n6. Realistic government- you can make rules, like nobody can own more than 2 weapons, or must work for food, or even pay taxes in whatever you choose.\n7. Currency, like real currency.

That idyllic little patch of land you've got may look bountiful, but unless you get your act together those four lonesome families are going to be starving and freezing come winter. Even when you get on your feet there is the ever present worry in your head - "Will the harvest be good?" In this game there are only two enemies: nature and your own incompetence.\n\nGet it right and its immensly satisfying. Get it wrong and its stomach turning. The only drive you have is making your villager's lives better, improving their homes, their variety of food, their working standards; this means expanding, and with expansion comes the potential for upsetting the delicate balance you've spent hours tinkering to achieve.\n\nIf this game had came out of a big developer well versed in this genre (Paradox, Maxis, etc) I would be impressed at their return to basics, discarding all multiplayer, all add-ons, all DLC, all glitz and glamour. This game is polished and complete at launch - how common is that these days? But this has not come from a giant dev, it's come from one man. ONE. This one developer shows what you can do with commitment and ideas. It shows in his game, where perserverence and determination will reward you and hasty decisions will punish.\n\nPlay this game. It will remind you what good, honest video games can and should be.","February 19, 2014","true","26.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

My village remained small and eventually shrank to a tiny size because I didn't build enough houses and had bouts of famine taking a toll on the young. The population that survived was mainly too old to have children so I had a severe labour shortage. After about ten years my population started to recover as I built many extra houses. Now I have a small village of 40 people that primarily produces food via foraging, fishing, a little farming and pastures.\n\nThe interface would be confusing for newcomers to videogames, it's primarily button symbols with no writing but is controlled using the function keys to access sub menus. The sub menu of food production for example, would then be controlled by using the number keys 1-6 to access the different buildings. This is comfortable, quick to use and looks minimalist which fits with the 'bare survival' theme of the game.\n\nVisually the game is very enjoyable and the animations are of a quality I'd expect. I do have some criticisms, the pilot of the trade boat's model looks blocky and low quality at odds with the rest of the game. Also I feel like the tree chopping and falling animations could have been improving with an element of physics or ragdolling. Sometimes the trade boat passes through the fishing dock's model, this is very irritating.\n\nThe tutorial explains the basic use and controls well enough without spoiling the challenge of the game. It's a great, polished game but I hope that Shining Rock Software take the time to add more content around the 40-year mark. Such as new buildings for new industries and such. It may be possible however that I simply didn't grow my town to a large enough population to unlock stuff that may already be in the game. The occurence of disasters is very low, I had one house fire in a 35 year period, though all my houses were made of stone and one walnut orchard disease.\n\nI would also suggest that traders visit more often, or there are other methods to acquire livestock as I had extreme difficulty buying any animals for my pasture which sat empty for nearly 25 years. I did however especially like how the farming seasons work. I would like to see more crops that can be grown at different times of the year such as winter grains.\n\nI can definitely recommend this excellent game to anyone who loves the idea of shaping a large town over long periods or failing horribly in the process. It may seem expensive for an indie game but the quality and effort put into creating this, compared to some other games, make it worth the price in my opinion.","February 19, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Instead, it seems to be more of an exercise in tedium and micromanagement of resources and workers.\n\nThere is a lack of endgame tech/production content or complexity.

It's a city builder with very little in the way of progression. Only a couple buildings can be upgraded (from wood to stone). The AI is occasionally frustrating. The game is rock hard at the beginning, but if you can survive long enough to get your population under control.... that's it. You expand at a snail's pace, till you're out of room. There's no tech tree, no missions, no customization (beyond where you decide to place the limited number of building types in the game), no unit variety, and no depth.

Let me explain why I don't recommend this game.\n\nMy first 50 hours in this game were really fun--it was challenging and I enjoyed it. The problem is that the game lacks depth. Once you figure out how to minimize disaster (diseased crops/livestock, sick citizens, etc.) there isn't much left to do. I moved on to using mods for the remaining hours I played. I tried all of the mods and many were fun and the additions were neat but, they all failed to add real depth to the game-play. Additional types of crops and livestock don't add depth all they do is make it easier for me to keep the citizens happy.\n\nOn top of the game lacking depth (its #1 problem) it also has some very glitchy mechanics. I've had a newborn child end up living alone in a house (and somehow survived). Greedy citizens will steal all the resources they can and horde those resources (food/fuel) in their homes at the expense of neighbors who will starve and/or freeze to death. Resources can randomly teleport across the map which, can cause your workers to starve or freeze to death during the long journey to pick up that gliched out resource (in my case a piece of meat) from across the map.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for this game is the horrible FPS drops it suffers when you build up a large population. People who are really into this game play it on pause because once you have a large population, if you try to play at 5x or 10x, you'll get 1-5 FPS/sec even with the best possible hardware.\n\nIn the end there was nothing that made me want to come back and play this game. I love City Builders but, this game pales in comparison to games like Anno 2070 and Cities: Skylines. I like the general idea of this game but, aside from building up an ever-larger population (which isn't even much of an option because of the game's ♥♥♥♥ optimization), there's really nothing to do after about the first 20 hours of game-play. This game doesn't have war/fighting, the trading is limited/lackluster and the random glitches/FPS drops can be infuriating. If you're looking for a City Builder with real depth check out Anno 2070 or Cities: Skylines.","May 20","false","214.0"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","21","36","5","1"

Best game of this genre that I've played in ages!\n\nThis is the kind of citybuilding/strategy type of game I've been waiting for. It's all about building, managing resources, trading and to make sure all your villagers stay both healthy and happy at all times. That being said, it's not an easy game getting into. The chances your villagers will either starve or freeze to death the first couple of attempts are quite high. However theres a few things you can do that WILL make it all much easier.\n\n1) Get into the statistics-menu (the gear-icon on the lower right side of your screen)\n\n2) Enable the resource window. This right here is a must. If you don't monitor these closely... you're screwed.\n\n3) Enable the jobs/labour window. Make sure you balance these well! If your woodcutter dies and you don't assign anyone to replace him, there will eventually be no firewood left and your villagers will die.\n\n4) Enable the evenlog window and to begin with also set it to notify you when someone dies of old age. Reason for this is that the game by default won't tell you anything about this, and therefor you might end up having crucial jobs unoccupied.\n\nPlace all these windows somewhere on your screen where they aren't in the way of anything and keep them open. The fact is... You will spend a great amount of time looking at these windows. Like it or not. This is what might put some people off in the long run. You've got all your resources flowing well, and you expand by looking at what resources you have available, you place the building while closely monitoring the different values, pressing x10 (game-speed) and pause depending on the outcome. It can get a little tedious at times, but the sense of achievement once you got it all under control makes it all worth it.\n\nThe graphics aren't really that much, yet it's just how I want it to be. It's simple, yet somewhat charming. I think the graphical-style appeals to me as it reminds me a lot of what the Black & White games looks like - which I played for countless hours back in the days.\n\nI'd easily pay 30€ for this game, so the current price of 18,99€ makes this a no-brainer for me. Prepare for many hours of challenging, but at the same time rewarding and relaxing gameplay.

It is very addictive and extremely fun. It's the kind of game you want to have when you're sick of getting shot at or dismembered. This is one of the few games I have enjoyed with no story, no stunning graphics, no main characters. You yourself are the protagonist and antagonist. It is up to you to help or hurt this makeshift society.\n\nPros +\n\n- Fun and engaging gameplay that anyone from 5-105 would enjoy.\n- A nice getaway from games like Skyrim or Battlefield.\n- It doesn't pull any punches. What I mean is that if you make a few bad decisions, your citizens will die. As Eddard Stark so wonderfully puts it, "Winter is coming."\n- Better graphics than expected, this is the first game I've played on Steam that I can with out a doubt say that the pictures don't do the game justice.\n- Worth the price. Right now $19.99 USD, worth it, although I got it for $10 in a Humble Bundle Sale.\n\nCons -\n- Still needs work, the game is not perfect. The AI is a little buggy, and the timing on the weather is very predictable. Sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain, sunshine, snow, sunshine, snow, sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain,  and so on...\n- Not exactly a CON, but the dev is one person from my understanding. Great game designed by one person, but it could be even better if designed by 2+.\n- Very hard to play now that Borderlands 2 is $9.99, but that's a personal problem.\n\nAll in all, I give this 4 out of 5 stars. To put in prospective, I give Sims 4, a LOOSLY similar game, a 2 out of 5. Unfortunatly I can't compare it to another City Builder game, as I have none.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dezbo/recommended/242920/","dezbo","Desbro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dezbo/","63 products in account","This game has some mixed reviews, and from what I've seen, a lot of the negative ones are based on frustration bred from laziness and an inability to properly apply one's common sense in a city building simulator.\n\nAll negativity aside, Banished is an excellent city building game, but could do with some fine tuning where information is concerned. When I first started playing, it took one or two towns (what I like to call my trial and error period) to figure out how to set things up, and what the natural ebb and flow was. This was - maybe - two or three hours of experimentation, and certainly post-tutorial. When I figured out the very basics, it was relaxing and fulfilling to watch my tiny population grow into something a bit more impressive.\n\nMy only critiques would have to be regarding the placement of buildings, as that seems to be the hangup for a lot of players. Tooltips would be grand, even an in-game FAQ of sorts for people to refer to when they had questions about what buildings work best, and where. Otherwise, Banished lives up to everything it promises to offer in a city building sim.\n\nTips & Clarifications\nthings learned on the fly -\n\n+ The benefit of a School House is undeniable, but in the early stages of the game, not the smartest move to make given the time it takes to groom more efficient laborers. Establish a comfortable population, wait for the initial ebb in numbers, where the founding members of your new town die out (and they will, usually one after another) and once you've compensated for that loss and have a few new kids on the way, build a schoolhouse and let the grooming begin.\n- School Houses take children 10 through 18. New laborers without a school house present, start work at 10. Good things to bear in mind when deciding whether or not to build one.\n\n+ Fishing Huts suck. There's no other way around it. They yield next to nothing for the manpower and they introduce panic early. If there is a decent sized patch of trees, it's prudent to drop a hunting lodge, or a gatherer's hut in there first. (I will add fishing huts later more for the variety of foodstuffs and less out of actual need.)\n\n+ In the beginning, I like to take stock of my seed (map) and will immediately pause, zoom out and start mentally zoning areas, everything from places suitable for livestock and crops, to dense forest areas fit for cultivation.\n\n+ Foresters, Herbalists, Hunting Lodges and Gatherers should never, ever, be placed in a residential area. The further they are from your main buildings, the better.\n\n+ Foresters keep the area pruned and lush, providing your people with the wood resource.\n\n+ Hunters can only do their job when there's enough woodland to camouflage the deer (less woodland means less deer.)\n\n+ Herbalists get the largest yield of herbs in old forests. The longer the forest has been there, the better. (Don't clear cut EVERYTHING in sight at the beginning of the game.)\n\n+ Gatherers are much the same as Herbalists, the better health the forest is in, the better yield you're going to get.\n\nPossibly the most underappreciated, and infrequently mentioned tool in this game is the Increase Priority function. I use it in the beginning to let my builders and laborers know what things need to be built first. (Typically food sources are the first things to go up in my town, regardless of mode and especially in hard mode.) They can live without houses for a season or two, but food is a must have if you want them to survive until they can build those houses. I also cannot live without my Statistics, Log and Job Menu tacked to my screen. Later, when I build a Town Hall, I often have just that and the logs pinned, but it's helpful to have those three open to easily assign workers and keep track of things happening in the game.\n\nIn conclusion! Don't be afraid to let your game plateau a little bit and build an excess of resources. Manage this with your birth rates, and workers coming of age, of course, but building stores is always good when you're trying to grow and for the longterm.","March 1, 2014","true","68.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Co-op (not an AI co-op) would seem to benefit this game, I see no valid argument as to disclaim my personal opinion. Think about it, Banished having two people in it, one player starts on one side of the map, and the other person starts on the other. Both players build how they wish and neither of them may mess with the other persons buildings, roads, or civilians. Endless fun of playing with a friend, again, in a non-competitive and non-combat way.\n\nWith that being said, I still love this game! It is hard, addicting, and very fun!

That it has been the first middle ground of city based management in a long time.  At the Tripple A side we have EA charging DLC for things that should have been apart of the main game, and on the indie side most indie managment games are either way to easy, or you need a calculator and a degree in mathmatics to enjoy it, and the community snubs you if you don't 'get it'.\n\nBanished is the perfect balance, it is a compleate game, it doesn't take much to learn, the tutorials are very helpful and quick and it is as easy or as hard as you wish to make it from there.  The graphics are very nice for a one man team and gets across everything it needs to, there is little to no confusion on what is needed, everything is pretty straight foward and its a nice game.\n\nIf you enjoy management games, god games or building games, I highly recomend this one regardless of the price.  It is worth it any time and any price for you.\n\nAlthough if you are an achivement hunter I highly recomend staying clear of this one, the achivements are earned and not given away so freely, even after plugging six hours into the game at the time of writing I have yet to achive anything.  Not a complaint in the least but, the game really isn't kind to achivement hunters.","July 21, 2014","true","19.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a good thing in my opinion.  There are no lofty tech trees to chase and no taxes to levy or money to manage.  There are no nobles to appease for fear of them burning down your city.  This is a game where your citizens are simultaenously your biggest problem and your most precious resource.  If you're looking for combat, you won't find it here.  This is survival against nature.\n\nLearning curve:\nThe basic operation and interface of the game is very intuitive, but the learning curve on balancing people and resources can be surprisingly brutal.  You do have to be forward thinking with respect to resource management and population management (more on that below in relevant sections).  Even if you are a city builder/management sim pro, you can still expect to have at least one major failure before you get it all figured out.  I personally started a few towns with the intention of determining limits and understanding population growth before making a town I was really invested in.\n\nBuilding:\nMuch like the Anno series, you place roads and buildings where you see fit.  Unlike Anno, there are no hard coded limitations on where you place buildings in relation to each other (no "sorry, but you can't finish your road because the corner is outside the influence radius), but citizen travel times are factored in and distance of a home to a work area affects the ability of a worker to complete their tasks.  Roads are important for reducing these travel times.  Layouts that would work well in real life can work in this game.  Storage and stockpile buildings, farms, etc. all share the need for reasonable proximity to each other.  Building speed and collection of materials all seem fairly balanced.  There are no tech trees and all buildings are available to build so long as you have the materials to build them.  Luckily, unless you assign workers to a building you don't need, constructing something too early is just a waste of construction resources and time builders could have been doing something else.  There are far worse mistakes you can make.  The only downside to building I've found in this game relates to lack of any terraforming.  Hills are in the way and will prevent building placement even if it's just one square on a corner that's on "hill" terrain.  Real people would just dig out a little for that corner.  You can construct tunnels to pass roads through hills but it takes a while and uses a lot of stone, which is an abundant but non-renewable resource (more on that in the resources section).\n\nCitizen Management:\nYou manage your citizens by assigning X number of laborers (the default/idle job) to various other jobs such as builder, farmer, woodcutter, etc.  Your citizens will determine for themselves which laborer picks up that job based on their home's proximity to the building/resource being worked.  This distance factor appears to update only when unassigning or reassigning jobs.  Citizens are divided into families which will occupy one house each.  A family starts as two adults and any children they already have if it's a starter family or nomads.  As children reach an age to make families of their own, you have to provide housing for them to expand (unlike real life, young couples won't move in and breed in mom and dad's basement).  This is the primary method of controlling growth and has to be balanced with aging.  If your people get too old before you make extra houses, they'll never get a chance to have kids and your population will stagnate, ultimately dying off.  If you build too many houses your population may outpace your ability to gather food and resources.  Schools are necessary for fully efficient workers.  Health and happiness are factors controlled mostly through resource management.  With the right building, you can receive nomads from time to time which helps with recovery from stagnation, disease, or other population reductions, but they also have the potential to bring disease with them.  Populations can get to decent sizes with a LOT of work.  Early on you can expect to reach a hundred or so before you start losing balance.  With experience and careful planning, people have reached into the low thousands.\n\nResource management:\nThis game has nowhere near as many resources to manage as an Anno game but it does cover all of the basics.  Logs, stone, and iron are your construction resources, all of which can be gathered by laborers under manual direction.  Logs can be sustainably gathered by forresters who will cut and replant in an area around their building.  This is important because logs also become firewood to keep your population warm and will need constant replenishment.  Stone and Iron can be quarried and mined if there's not enough on the surface, but they require significant labor, are dangerous for worker and will eventually deplete.  Often, trading for stone and iron is a more sustainable approach.  There are a wide variety of food sources (farming, gathering, hunting, etc.) and having a variety is important for the health of your citizens (living on potatoes alone isn't healthy).  Some are more efficient early, some more efficient later, but all very good to have.  As you might expect, food is the most important factor in balancing your population, followed closely by firewood (or coal) and clothing.  There is also an herb resource that contributes to the health of your citizens.\n\nFinal opinions and replayability:\nThis is a sandbox game, not a game with quests and goals.  The goals are whatever you set for yourself, be it steam achievements, X population, stabilized population, challenges, etc.  This makes the game as replayable as your personal interests and imagination allow.  The variety of buildings and resources are reasonable but don't make for significant replayability on their own (like trying to build superprojects in Anno).  If you are a very content driven gamer, you will probably be able to see everything this game has to offer in 5-10 hours of gameplay.  Personally, I love the challenge of growth balance and the long game so I'm going to get a LOT of hours out of it.  This game is complete, not early access, and the finish is solid.  I haven't encountered any bugs myself.  The creator is presently working on making it modable which could lead to significant community expansion.  The music is pleasantly ambient and the sound effects are good.  The graphics are surprisingly good for a one-man project, which I think is partially due to use of great textures.  It's a lightweight game and plays just fine on my i5 laptop with Intel HD4000 graphics.  I hope this review was helpful.","June 27, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is the most challenging simulation game that I have ever played. The only thing it might be missing for other who enjoy a good simulation game would be the advancement over the years of moving into technology. The other would be others either real or computer generated that you would battle against. I myself do not miss those two factors.\nThat being said what I do like about this game is it’s challenging factor. You have to balance your focus on many things at once and make smart decisions on where and when to build and or expand your city. Just one minor wrong decision could make the difference between having plenty of supplies or running out and having half to three quarters of your cities population starve or freeze to death.\nAnother great factor of the game is the pairing of people. If you building the community shelter not a lot of “Breeding” will go on and your cities population will not expand. You must build houses at the correct time and the correct amount in order for your citizens to move in and create children.\nThe graphics are acceptable and the terrain maps are okay but it is the game play that makes me spend so many hours trying and trying to build a huge city. My maximum population that I have achieved in my 50+ hours of game play is 149. I know and realize that I am doing something incorrect for any possible expansion.\nI intend to play this game as long as it take in order to create a thriving city that is well balanced and expanding. I am glad that I purchased the game and I give it a 7 out 10. Thank you.\n","July 20, 2014","true","56.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Key aspects of this are finding enough food to prevent starvation and not freezing in winter, as well as ensuring there are enough houses and resources to continue daily life. After that, it becomes mostly about growing effectively.\n\nIt's a fairly simple game, with the graphics being one of the biggest positives. A simple hamlet with farms around it, serene and calm. Your village in winter with snow covering the roofs, and a bridge over the river occasionally used by a villager to get to the other side\nBut you can find graphics at any screenshot. Lets talk gameplay - It is very simple for a citybuilding game, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing. You build houses to house a family, and they bring food and firewood there to not starve or freeze. You build workstations for them to work at, farms, smithies, gatherer's huts and many more. The few things such as huts are often bigger than their homes, but they can not live there. Everyone lives in a house, and you will be able to make roads to speed up their travel time to and from where they need to be. They all need a coat to keep warm, and a tool to keep their working efficiency up, and the children will need a school to get educated.\n\nOnce you have your basics set up, you will find the trade depot to be expensive, and it will probably take you a long time to build. Along with needing to be on a river, so potentially quite far from your settlement depending on the randomly generated map. Once it is build, it will take a while for a happy merchant to arrive at your trade post as well, and when they do they may not sell what you need, or have an interest in what you're selling. Every merchant has their own list of things they buy and sell.\n\nThe citizen AI is basic, but functional. And it uses a few tricks to make sure it doesn't get stuck in the absolute least efficient patterns. For details on how it works you can find the creator's blog and see how he made them move, and how he made them. Citizens move jobs and houses every now and then to cut down on travel times, and while this is helpful and possibly essential to keep the town as a whole running, it makes it so that every citizen is a jack of all trades. Your citizens are shallow, they do not have personalities or skills, they just do what you want them to do. They are just there to make sure things keep working. Sadly this makes it much less enjoyable to watch the citizens and think about how they would live, but it is neccesary to prevent a village from being an inefficient mess after a few years ingame.\nThis is further compounded by the fact that villagers age several years in one game year, thus ensuring that you always have a steady stream of new children growing up and old adults dying of old age. It becomes difficult to find any attachment to your citizens.\n\nIn the end, the one thing I realised about Banished is that all of this adds up to a lack of interactivity. Key in this was when a friend told me he accidently fast forewarded through an entire year in game, and nothing changed in his city. The main thing you can do in Banished is look at your city being developped, with only occasionally having to actually make a trade or designate new building sites.\nAs limited as the game is, with workshop support it can be modified and you can add or change things in it. I would say this makes the game go from just alright to good, as this support means you will be able to fix whatever you don't like, add new buildings, and overhaul the game to be more to your tastes.\n\nIf you mainly want to relax, enjoy a quiet hamlet with some beautiful scenes. This is the game for you, it looks great, and once you get past the first few winters there is little pressure and a lot of potential to do whatever you feel like. But if you're looking for an in-depth game where villagers have their own lives and skills within your town, or you want to be actively building and changing things while you play, you may want to skip it. It's a game to relax with, not a game to stress over whether or not the blacksmith you grew attached to gets enough firewood to survive the winter.","February 2","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you're looking for a citybuilder that is similar to Sim City, then this game may not be for you. However if you are looking for a City Builder with survival elements, akin to Anno then continue listening!\n\nWhat is banished?I've come to call Banished a Town builder instead of a city builder, even then you'll be luck to get more than a large village in your first few games. At first you will begin with a small hamlet, then you'll become ambitious and want to expand so you can add mines, quarries, town halls, schools, churches and more to your town. This is when the real fun in in Banished begins, as suddenly it becomes a game of balancing people's job. In the winter you will want to change certain citizens roles, such as farmers, as they are useless in the winter and vice versa when it comes to spring time.\n\nThe catch of the survival is when something goes wrong, it really can go wrong. Lets take my most succesful town (at time of writing) as an example. I was expanding to quickly, i had a mine, blacksmith and a quarry, all i needed to support growth I thought. However I forgot to take into account that some building use iron and tools, made in the blacksmith use iron, my income of iron wasn't exactly flowing. I had hit around 60 population at the time and everyone had a job. Suddenly the entire village ran out of tools, now everything took far longer to do; farming, mining, foresting, woodcutting. I had no tools to mine the iron fast enough to make tools.\n\nAnd there, is what Banished truly is, a balancing act, in which things can go drastically wrong with a single mistake","February 22, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Banished does not have this problem, it is ALWAYS a challenge. Just yesterday I went from a huge 600+ settlement, ( a hell of an achievement in this game) and within 3 winters my people were starving because I was eating through the food surplus built up over decades. So dam sad.... a whole city gone well most of it. The game has great visuals, it is what you would expect England circa 1200 to look like. Fantastic game made by one individual, he definetively deserves to have his efforts rewarded.

Before recommending it to anyone, you have to ask yourself what type of city builder are you searching for? Below I will mention what Banished provides from a unmodded perspective.\n\nA. Challenge - In the beginning of gameplay you will be challenged on how to keep your population alive at times. Once you learned the ropes and strategies, the challenge to keep your population alive is not that difficult. But then again I've played this game quite a bit.\nB. Buildings - Banished in the unmodded format provides limited buildings. If you build a stone house, then that is all it will be, a stone house. Buildings don't evolve like in a civilization style game which means the buildings stratisfy evolving into more efficiency or the graphics change with the next generation. Banished buildings stay the same unless you use mods.\nC. Sandbox - Banished can provide hundreds of maps you want to start from. The map seeds are practically limitless. This allows you to construct a new village/town facing various dynamics of land types, weather, and bodies of water.\nD. Micromanagement - One aspect to this game is you micromanage jobs, resources, crops etc etc. If you don't like micromanaging how many people are working as a farmer vs miner, then I suggest you pass this game up. A large part of this game is micromanagement.\nE. Modding - The game was designed to be modded. There are numerous mods out there that allow new buildings, crops, jobs, etc. etc. The only downside to modding is many mods disable the achievements.\n\nThere are some downsides to this game but it depends on your tolerance level.\nA. AI - The computer AI sometimes get very annoying after a bit. The computer AI is the citizens. Citizens go idle once in a while, which results in them being non-productive. An example is you are building a house, the builder almost finishes the project but then he/she goes idle and stops working. The only way to get them out of the idle phase was reload the game.\nB. Timesink - Expanding your village and creating a higher population takes lots of time. If you don't mind playing this game passionately for an extended period of time then no issue. On the other hand if you have limited time to dedicate to building a village up into a town, then I would think twice.\n\nOverall, the game is fun for a while but over time, once you played it over and over, it gets kind of boring. When it is on sale I recommend buying it cheap. At full price I would say it is not worth. If you have lots of time, enjoy micromanaging a village, and understand the aspects of keeping a population alive that was banished to a land, then by all means I would recommend.","November 5, 2015","true","141.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

All you do in this game, is manage your colony. You are responsible for the lives and the well-being of your colonists, sometimes very literally. For example, if during the summer you neglect an important aspect, such as producing food, your colonists will probably starve and not survive the cold winter. Or, for another example, you don't make sure your colonists have enough wood and the ability to use it to warm their houses during the winter, they'll just die of hypothermia. So far, the game's formula seems simple, yet deep and complex enough to make it interesting and carry the weight of an entertaining game.\n\nVisually, Banished looks really well. There's nothing too fancy about the game's graphics, as it seems the developers were smart enough to focus their efforts and resources on other aspects of the game, but they obviously did enough to make everything really polished and smooth. I really liked the weather effects, they really sell the seasonal theme of the game. I raised the game's settings to the maximum and it runs very smoothly. Up until now I haven't encountered any bugs or problems. No crashes, no slowdowns, nothing - pure gameplay experience! While I do have a decent computer (Quad-Core i7, 12GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), it seems like this game could handle itself well enough with much cheaper hardware.\nThe only aspect I'm a litthe disappointed of, is the audio. There are important sounds effects, but the music is so insignificant, that after 15 minutes I decided to turn the game music off, so I could listen to popular music while playing.\n\nIf you like colony management games, you should definitely try Banished. While it might not be an incredible AAA game or a pure city-builder, it's easily better than the broken and buggy Simcity and Cities XL.\n\nI promise to update this review if I learn anything more worthy of sharing.","July 3, 2014","true","229.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is really easy to lose in this game, You've got to make sure that your citizens have homes so that they have protection, have to make sure that you have loggers to get wood, have to make sure that you have someone that converts the wood into firewood to keep everyone warm, have to make sure that everyone has enough food before winter, you even have to make sure that your town is not too overpopulated or underpopulated because having an overpopulated town means you most likely have a lot of children who do ♥♥♥♥ all work and increase the demand of food and having and underpopulated town means that not a lot of people are able to work and harvest food.\n\nIt may sound like I am complaining but that extra challenge is obviously the appeal to the game and which is why I personally love it.\n\nI would only recommend it to others if they have an interest in city builders and want an extra challenge.","December 11, 2015","true","19.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexikun/recommended/242920/","mexikun","Raum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexikun/","248 products in account","A fun city-builder with a strange difficulty curve.\n\nBanished starts out very hard. You'll have a few villagers, Winter is coming, and not much else. You have to quickly get the ball rolling; get resources to build new structures, chop wood for firewood, gather roots and berries for food, begin hunting... and the complexity ramps up from there, building tools to keep production going, planting crops, orchards, trading for seeds and livestock, sewing clothes for winter, building a tavern... and while there are a few more things to do after the previously listed goals, once you get to a certain point the difficulty drops off entirely and you are mostly just managing growth at a decent rate that doesn't make you run out of food or supplies.\n\nIt's very tough to get your first successful village past year 5. You'll deal with problems like old age wiping out an entire generation leaving a bunch of kids to try to survive, or hunters and gatherers under-performing and leaving the village hungry. Once you figure out how to optimally build production, and figure out a couple of the tricks, there isn't much else other than expanding your town to the edges of the map. It feels a bit funky to go from managing 15 adults and 4 kids, barely hanging on, to suddenly having a bustling village of over 300 people. It kind of spirals out of control from there, where you'll have tons of crops, orchards, and pastures providing a massive bounty of food and a plethora of activity going on, fueling your medieval empire.\n\nKeep in mind, I don't find this necessarily to be a bad thing. With other city-builders, once you learn the ropes, it's practically impossible to fail unless you seriously screw up. Banished is kind of the same way, but it gets stale after a bit of time  because the hardest thing becomes simply waiting for your builders to walk across the map to bring stone to the new house you want to build, or waiting for your mine to generate more iron. As long as you continue building proper clusters of production buildings, replace quarries and mines as they run out, and keep building new housing, it's very hard to hit a fail state. This feels weird because getting your first 100 villagers can be insanely difficult to the point of frustration. You'll have the previously mentioned generational problems, or you'll run out of nearby stone and end up being unable to build anything, but then it all clicks and you're just building a few things here and there followed by waiting for a bit, seeing how the production and supplies even out, and then repeating.\n\nFor an indie city-builder, this is a great take on the genre. It's fun to go from a very micro-oriented mindset to managing a few hundred villagers and tons of jobs. The early-game is definitely the most fun part, as it can feel very dire sometimes. Most of my early villages involve watching jobs very carefully and using each citizen to their maximum potential. Most of my late game villages involve setting five things to build, waiting ten minutes, and then building another five things, maybe glancing at my jobs to make sure everything is accounted for, dismissing a trader because I don't need more pecans, and then waiting to build some more things. I wish there was some kind of endgame... I mean, expanding your village can get tough, but once you realize that hunters and gatherers only go so far, and that crops or orchards or pastures will do more than enough to feed you as long as you have plenty... it kind of gets a bit old.\n\nDefinitely worth it, even if my review here sounds a bit critical. I'm a city-builder fanatic and take them pretty seriously, for whatever reason. This is one worthy of your time if you enjoy the genre. Even if not, you might get some enjoyment out of the "suffering simulator" aspect of the first 100 or so villagers. Every winter can be a challenge at first, and that rush you get when you get your first seeds from trading is great.","December 15, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Start with four families and a cart; attempt to carve a new life for your people out of the (not really very howling) wilderness. See the screenshots and videos for how it looks; I find it quite evocative.\n\nThe game is very tight, very elegant; I like how all the pieces/parts fit together. There are a couple of places the UI could use some tweaking (larger fonts, resizable windows, and perhaps the Trade screen), but otherwise it's intuitive and appealing. I love the look of the game, and I love the attention to detail the developer (singular) paid to the graphics. The AI is one of the better ones I've seen - your populace will occasionally appear to be doing something insane, but for me there has always turned out to be a reason for the insanity (usually something braindead I have done). In fact, the agent-AI is a lot like what EA said was going to be in SCnewest, and then horribly failed to deliver.\n\nThe game changes with the seasons. Rain falls in spring, trees get their leaves, your people move back into the fields.  Crops grow in summer, your foresters continue to plant, your orchards grow full. The fields empty in autumn, little stacks of resources pile up as your laborers try to get all the crops in before the snows of winter fall.  And around we go again. Every person in your village has a house, that needs to be near where they work, and needs to be near to some place to gather food, and tools, and clothing, and firewood; you can follow individuals around as they go through their day. People age at (I think) four times a village's year - so you quickly find yourself dealing with generations, and watching the elderly die as the young are born. (Or not, if you aren't paying attention)\n\nIf you like city-builders, if you go through the tutorials, and if you adjust well to the idea that "slow and steady wins the race," then the complaints/issues of it being "too easy" and "too shallow" have a certain amount of validity. My first village, for example, is in year 58, I have ~375 people, on a small map, and things are pretty much bopping along needing only marginal help from me.\n\nIf you ignore the tutorials, and common sense, and run the game at 10x speed, and ask regularly "when does the combat start" in various fora - You're Going To Have A Bad Time. It is amazingly easy, even when things are going well, to trip into a domino-effect of Suck that will see half your pop starve or freeze to death before you fix the problem.\n\nThere are achievements, and most of them actually mean something (as opposed to the "Grats! You Started A Game!" style) Also, there's no way to get all them with one village, because some of them require mutually-contradictory playstyles.\n\nSometimes I zoom in as far as I can, pitch the camera as low as I can, and zoom along 20 feet about the streets of my little village, just watching my people go about their day.  Yes, I am a geek :)\n\nI was in the last round of beta testing, so I've got about 40 hours in the game, fwiw.","February 20, 2014","true","70.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Banished is a very fresh take on the genre, and takes it a few steps futher than others.  This is an outstanding game, and any who are into builders should play it.\n\nPROS\nEasy to pick up the basics (the tutorials don't kill the mood and weigh the fun down), just the right amount of difficulty.  Once you understand what it takes to make it through the first winter or two, you get a great feeling of accomplishment.  That's when things start going wrong.  The game really makes you analyze what you did try different methods.  Never once was I disappointed when a town died out.\n\nIntroduced the idea of sustainability to a city building game.  Most games like this have either a single resource (money), or several that are used to build stuff.  Banished makes it much more real by consuming your resources the way they should be.  It's your job to make sure you don't expand too quickly, or remain stagnant and your villagers die of old age before a new generation comes in.\n\nMany city builders are plagued by annoying micromanagement and not enough of the right kind of customization.  The way they designed how you can assigned different types or workers and change them on the fly is awesome.  Also, the idea of being able to limit your resources and how they are used adds a great layer to the game. You'll quickly learn that maybe it wasn't such a great idea to make a crapload of tools for your town.\n\n\nCONS\nThe only thing I can really think of is some people may want more options of buildings, jobs, crops, tools, etc...

It's difficult and relaxing all at once. It's amazing to think that this beautiful game was made by one person! All the programming, graphics, art, GUI, sound and design! I read that he had help with the music, but was more than prepared to do it himself.\n\nThe game is about surviving and thriving. You have to manage your resources carefully or you'll find your little people start to grumble and drop dead. It's fun to take small steps and in no time at all you are ruling a sprawling town.\n\nThere are a few hiccups. In my experience at least, there have been numerous graphical issues like animations happening too fast, water showing through the trade boat and certain buildings. The herbalist also makes no sense to me. Nobody ever uses herbs, and my health has never dropped below 4.5 hearts.\n\nI heartily suggest this quaint little game.

While it may seem that there is not that much content (types of buildings etc.) you won't notice since the game plays relatively slowly and it takes a time to build a solid town. You will find yourself struggling mainly in the early years as the firs few winters tend to be the hardest, yet you musn't let your guard down even in later years as the careful planning is crucial and key to be succesful in this game. Me for example I was able to build a city of some 600 people and I was doing great, but since I had bad infrastracture and didn't place the buildings in efficient manner, the whole system collapsed on itself... population dropped by roughly 400 individuals due to starvation and my town became a ghost towm... The game is challenging and quite addictive despite being relatively simplistic, I'd say there is a steep learning curve, as beginners will probably struggle for first two or three games but once you pick up basics (and there isn't really much to pick up) it is relatively easy. Despite the game being fun you will find it a little bare and with low content once you master it, but until you do, it should be fun.

After a couple years more children were brought into the world by the citizens and a new generation was secured. I accompanied Jaide's life closely, often checking on her in her parent's house near the gatherer's hut admist the forest.\n\nThe girl became the first attendant to the village's school, a village where half the population was illiterate, years before any other child would come to attend. Graduated at 18, I was proud to see her become an efficient educated worker and help the others in their struggle to survive. One summer I was surprised to see that Jaide was no longer living with her parents, she had moved in with Dicki, a 16 year old still in school; they had a daughter of their own in that very season.\n\nThe town hit it's lowest population of all time while Jaide was an adult, as the older folk were quickly dying of old age, but Dicki and his wife had 5 kids, all parts of the silver lining above the food shortage and low workforce. Years later another generation was finally reaching adulthood and the people started seeing better days.\n\nJaide died in the autumn of '20 of old age.

After I got the lemmings to survive and maintain a supply of resources and happiness, there was really nothing else to do but continue to micromanage. I set my own goal of trying to spread out and cover an entire huge map, but it started to get unbearbly laggy before I had covered a quarter of the map.\n\nAnd speaking of micromanagement, I found that part really tedious. The ai of the citizens is pretty awful and in a lot of respects there's nothing you can really do about it, you just have to work around them being stupid. The game ui leaves a lot to be desired in terms of maximizing efficiency, to the point that anything beyond a tiny city becomes a nightmare to manage.\n\nEven if you really like city builder games, I'd wait till a sale to try this one out.","February 28","false","28.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Very addictive and highly recommend it for someone who's looking for a great simulation game. Actually, it's more like a survival/simulation game imo.\nBut, you want everything in this game to be perfect. It can get pretty intense when your people start starving if you don't have enough food or a sickness breaks out and you don't have a herbalist and a physician.\nOne of the things I absolutely love about this game is that when you want to start over, it doesn't feel like a boring rut or anything like that. You just become so focused on getting crap right this time. The maps are also randomized as well.\n\nOne time, everything was going perfect for once. There was enough food, tools, clothing, firewood, etc. And the next thing I know, a tornado comes ripping through my village. Killed some villagers. Destroyed my town hall building, houses, fisheries. Mother nature is cold. And you will never ever be prepared for it.\n\nBanished is also all about balance, such is life. You have to make sure your people are feed, happy, and healthy. As well as make sure you keep building enough houses for them to reproduce. The townsfolk also love their booze, it makes them happy. Do not have a village without a tavern for the love of god.\n\nThe villagers also have a mind of their own. At one point, my village was running low on food because I screwed up. And I go around clicking on houses, checking inventory. And this 16 year old woman was living all by herself and she was hoarding food. "On this episode of Hoarders...." She literally had over 200 servings of corn, 150 fish, 300 venison, etc. Are you freakin' kidding me? So you know what I did? Ordered to have her house tore down and then build a small cemetery out of the materials from her home. She became homeless. Thus she had no inventory. And died. Her grave being in that cemetery.\n\nOverall, if you want a game that's addictive and repeatedly punishes you, get this.\n\nPros.\n-Addictive. (I know, I know. I keep saying it. But I don't think you guys understand).\n-Challenges you.\n-The villagers will annoy you and will find ways to extract revenge. You are the god now.\n-The soundtrack is really amazing. Love it.\n-Different maps, map sizes, local seeds for corps, livestock, and can also name your village.\n\nCons.\n-Villagers can be assh0les.\n-Nothing is truly in your control.\n-Addictive.","June 7, 2014","true","84.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"

Although probably not for everybody (as this game is HARD), it provides a real challenge to gamers that makes you want to have another try to crack that perfect formula.\n\nThe negative reviews on Steam stand testament, with the majority only being negative due to the fact it is hard to crack in an age where games seem to be getting more and more dumbed down.\n\nIt is so easy to lose yourself in Banished, with one game turning into a full day long marathon with only the approach of night being a warning sign of how long you have been playing.\n\nMy recommendation? If you like strategy games, love being challenged and appreciate a damn fine game, the price tag is more than worth the investment.\n\nIt still needs a tiny bit of tweaking (mines/quarries/fields being a little on the underpowered side with firefood being overpowered), but nothing that cannot be fixed in patches or mods.

The graphics are well done, detailed and suit the game. The UI has a scaling feature but even at the highest setting some buttons are under 2mm wide. Some UI elements look scaled and blurry.\n\nSound:\nNo problems here except trade ship arrival, a death and low stocks all use the same quiet alert sound. Can't comment on music as its usually the first thing I disable in a game.\n\nBugs & Issues:\nNo crashes or freezes of any kind. On a few occasions builders stopped working but reloading fixed this. The game ran smoothly with no slowdown or lag even running at x10 speed.\n\nGameplay:\nBanished is mostly a typical city builder game but tries a few things that mostly work well. Lack of an in-game currency is a nice change and trading for new crops and livestock is a nice idea although after a while it felt like any other 'random event'. It doesn't have the extreme manpower shortage that most games of this genre use as as a 'feature' and the way resources are featured is well done. The in-game character A.I. & scripting isn't the best but isn't bad and is much better than a game like Towns. It also lacks a way to prioritize some jobs over others which makes managing supply chains more difficult. The one thing most builder games suffer from is a weak link in resource supply chains and this game is no different, the problem being tools. Once you run out of tools everyone slows down so much that its only a matter of time until your people slowly starve or freeze to death. At 6 hours long it was a fairly quick game but the map felt big enough and while there were more obstacles to building than I like, I never once felt that I was running out of space to expand. In fact I'd say that Banished works better than most city-builder games with smaller segregated clumps of development. The one thing I did feel while playing was that at no point did difficulty ramp up in any way.  Managing 120 people feels no different to managing 20 and there was little incentive to diversify foods when health & happiness barely dropped. Despite a few issues that can be easily fixed (or overcome with mods if the feature is added), the game is fun and worth a buy if you like the genre.\n\nSummary:\nA well made fun entry into the city-builder genre. While it suffers from a few of the common problems with this type of game its worth a buy.\n","February 24, 2014","true","8.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

And before you think "well, he's probably asking too much" I want to point out that I don't mean in a 90% kind of way, but in a 30% kind of way... The first 30% of the game is there, I can't deny that. There is a genuine satisfaction in overcoming the first obstacles and trying to form your little village. Alloting the work so that there is no shortage of food, wood etc. Building the structures in such layout so that everything works in the best possible way. There is even the added effect of season change. You eventually reach the best part of the game where you can trade with other villages for otherwise inaccessible resources. Aaand that's where the game ends.\nThe choice of buildings is meagre to say the least. 2 types of houses. If that's not the bare minimum then what is? 1 type? You can pretty much build all the available structures after 4-5 hours of playing.\nThe villagers could well have been simply dots on a map, lacking any kind of realism. They move around at random, deep inside the forest or hovering around buildings. There is no pattern to work around and no sense of recreation or resting. They follow a random program of their own, in the absence of a night/day cycle at times farmers will suddenly drop everything and return to their homes.\nThe units of resources make no sense. The balance if you manage to find it is extremely precarious, one small change (like a disaster that kills a small percentage of your population) can have irreversible effects leading to a close extinction simply because there are no factors that work to pull the system back together. 2 farmers die -> 100 units of food are missing -> the forester dies of starvation -> 20 logs missing -> the fisherman freezes to death ---> and the population spirals to almost half the original one.\n\nThis is just another example of the decline of the game industry. More than a decade ago, a game like Evil Genius was released offering hundreds of hours of gameplay with numerous types of units with excellent AI. Minions that didnt wonder around aimlessly but started conversations with each other or seeked various types of recreation. The game had depth, with countless unlockable objects, new rooms, new quests, a change of island. And now we get Banished.. A game stuck eternally in Beta with no hope of improving. Graphics slightly (if at all) better than Evil Genius and that's about it. The developer probably left this game forever, cashed in with fake promises and spent a week in Barbados.\n\nI don't understand economics so I don't know what the best move for us the community is. If we buy it then we're accepting the bad quality of gaming. If we don't buy it then the city builder genre amongst many others that are not CoD related may simply die out. In any case this game is bad, unfinished.","May 7","false","16.0"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","27","49","0","0"

You could say playing Banished is "Zen-like" because there is no overbearing external pressures - you are merely massaging your production systems for optimal output. But don't rest on your laurels - there is the ever present slow burning drain on your resources - you consume resources to live and build. If you fail to plan ahead your town will wither away: because you didn't store enough food, tools, or materials.\n\nThe first 100 citizens is an engaging challenge, but then it becomes repetitive - until you hit 300+ citizens when you start to struggle against the natural limits of expanding your large town.\n\nBanished was developed by one man, and while I praise his talent, I can't ignore the following issues. The trading mechanic is very basic, but that is 'ok'. There is no stupid combat mechanic like in the Anno series, which is 'great'; The variety of external threats is still pretty good. The production & building requirements are simple - which is bad, ok, or good depending on your love of complex systems (but this is a city builder game you are playing).\n\nIn comparison to the Anno series, Banished is very basic in many ways. Banished doesn't have the huge variety like in the Anno series (crop variety is not real variety). In Anno 2070 there are many ways to optimise your production because of the intricate production networks you create - but this is not possible in Banished (because it is all AI determined) - but this may be a good thing you prefer your city to be easily understandable.\n\nI highly recommend Banished as a good introduction to city builders because of its almost elegant simplicity. When you get bored, which you may not, then try Anno 2070.\n","August 8, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That said, while playing this game I find myself looking for components that just aren't there. It seems necessary to have a better prioritization system- the ability to distribute provisions amongst the people. Another aspect I wish this game allowed is the naming of things. Whether it be houses, shops, bridges, or people, I feel the need to give them a personal tag.

Picked it up the other night and have to say I was a little surprised on how it plays. After installing and quickly clicking through the in-game tutorials I thought I was in for another city-building strategy game. This game isn't really a city builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading bandits or any military tech. Micro managing your town to protect your people from the elements, disease and starvation while expanding the population and maintaining the workforce all at once is plenty enough.\n\nThere is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader on the river. Trading resources your town has stockpiles of for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies is the only way to bring diversity to your towns diet and obtain resources you otherwise couldn't produce. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, as every map is randomly generated and can differ with resources and geographics.

I figured I trained my peeps well, they'd survive without me for a night (err, 20 years).  Recovering from the fallout is about the most fun I've had with this game, and that's saying something.  When I returned, tornadoes and fires had ravaged two major population centers.  Two markets were in ruins and 50 homes destroyed.  Half my farmers unassigned.  They were freezing with almost no stored food with twice as much consumed as produced in the last year.  500 people without tools.  But I've got 1400 stored iron, weirdly enough.  Even weirder, my population is not only within my designed parameters at about 950, it's actually been on a growth spurt for 10 years.  How did my town grow under these conditions?  I like to think they evolved the ability to digest iron while I was sleeping.  And that's why I love my people.\n\n... original review ...\n\nYou've just gotta hate it when a game dev figures out that exact formula to completely overwhelm your good sense and trap you in a never-ending spiral of digital imprisonment.  It must be amusing to wield that kind of power over people.  I imagine the dev has a throne and a white cat and often spontaneously "mwahahahaha!"s while stroking the kitty.\n\nI was half finished with the tutorial when I began to suspect that this game would suck up hundreds of hours over the next few years.  About 20 hours later, I know I was right.  I don't know how long it will take to build out the modest space I'm in now, but I know when I'm done I'm gonna want to try again, and again, and the modding possibilities are tantalizing.\n\nSure, the interface could be improved (suggestion: display recommended worker count alongside material requirements while laying down pastures/fields) in several places and there are some limitations to the A.I. and prioritization that require a somewhat restrained style of play, but all in all I haven't been this pleased with a purchase since I bought Defense Grid.  I actually feel a tiny bit guilty for having gotten Banished on sale.

Just me and my people against nature.\n\nI started Banished all hopeful and tried to nurture my first brave band of exiles into a happy, healthy community. After they all starved to death I tried again, paying more attention to quick food access this time. When they froze to death with the onset of winter, I took a third stab at it, balancing food, fuel and housing more successfully - and thus began my slow but sure conversion into a medieval despot.\n\nNow I'm ruling over a small town ordering ten year olds down mines or sending them out into snowstorms to break rocks. A couple of very old men who have worked for my town their whole lives, sired many children and tragically lost their wives to old age - these men still work, but I want them dead, because I can't evict them and they're taking up a whole house by themselves and I want a younger 'breeding pair' in the house. When the old widows and widowers die, I let out a happy little 'Yay! Finally!'\n\nThe only reason I even have a graveyard to shovel these spent workhorses into, is because productivity suffers when the dead go unburied.\n\nI began the game a nurturing benefactor - now a mere 24 hours in, I'm an iron-hearted tyrant.\nYou have been warned.","February 22, 2014","true","100.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/averrois/recommended/242920/","averrois","Undogmatic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/averrois/","83 products in account","Short:\nDefinitely recommended, since it's a very promising concept. I recommend it specially to those who love SimCity, SimFarm, Anno 1404 and many other city-building related games.\nThis game, however, is much more difficult and meaner to the player. It's a survival town-building game where you can screw up pretty easily and have your citizens die from hunger, frozen to death, or in many other painful ways, specially if you're negligent at managing and building your town.\n\nLong:\nThis is a town-building survival game. You have to make sure your civilians get food, clothes and shelter. At times everything looks stable and easy, wonderful isn't it? Not so fast. Once you start facing problems like running out of food, tools or clothes (mostly after a baby boom), that's when the whole town can start crumbling like a deck of cards, faster than you might expect. Prudence is your friend here, dear reader, and this game will be pretty mean and unforgiving if you're negligent.\n\nYou might be thinking: "All I have to do is avoid the baby booms, easy peasy". So what do you do? You logically stop building more houses because that means less room for families to expand (and have babies), and then it's all good, right? Wrong. If you wait too long you'll have to face the problem of regress, with a population that's too old to make babies. With very few births your population will die off faster than it reproduces and that's obviously a problem. While babies and students mature you gotta have enough workers left to produce food and clothes for everybody. That being said: It's hard to maintain a stable population. It's challenging, and that's great if you love challenges. If you don't -- if you want a walk in the park until a screen pops up saying "VICTORY!" -- this game is not for you. Also: There is no victory (that I know of), there's no apotheotic triumph. Only despair and misery awaits you. The question is: how long will you last? How far can you expand your town before everybody is wiped out by your incompetence or lack of resources (usually both)? The game is still delicious even though the future of your town won't look pretty in the long run.\n\nTrade:\nThere is no money, it's all about trading resources of a kind (raw materials and produced goods) in exchange for resources of another kind... For instance: trading a bunch of firewood for some chickens.\n\nProducing food:\nYou can buy seeds and plant your crops and orchards too, it's actually nice when it comes to agriculture, there's a lot of variety to choose from (once you're powerful enough to afford all the seeds).\nIf you don't want to produce food through artificial means (agriculture and pastures) you can always treat your town as a hunter-gatherer society, but that's likely to be troublesome once the population growth hits a variable threshold (it depends on how much food you can collect at any given time). Remember that, historically speaking, human societies have thrived thanks to agriculture and other technological advancements (read "Guns, Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond for more info, if you enjoy anthropology), so you might wanna invest in agriculture if you wanna survive later on.","March 1, 2014","true","65.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/recommended/242920/","ichieroki","darkfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/","63 products in account","Banished is an amazingly built indie simulation game.  I say indie because it is built by Shining Rock Software which consists of one person.  He does everything from the art to the programming.  It is amazing what one person can accomplish.  Like it says on Banished’s own website the game is a throwback to the games that were played in the 90’s.  I am barely old enough to qualify to talk about those games, seeing as I was born in 1989, but even I can remember playing those early simulations games and loving them.  This game for me brings me back to those days when a Sim game of any sort could just waste away whole weeks of your time.  Whether it be Sim City or Sim Farm, those games were just the best.  And it wasn’t about the graphics or the immersion or anything that we usually talk about in games today, but it was about the fun factor.  The exploration and building of a little world that you created.\n\nBanished is also a neat little game that you can’t win, but only survive.  And because of that I think most people will find the game boring because there isn’t really much that happens.  You plan and build a little settlement into a town.  Hours upon hours go by if you are doing it right as your town grows.  Eventually you just run out of resources and your little ecosystem comes crashing down all around you.  The game however is actually very hard because if you “overexpand” the same thing can happen and lives will be lost so it is important to plan ahead.\n\nAll in all I can wholeheartedly suggest that everyone should try Banished.  With my current disappointment in Sim City, Banished fills that gaming whole for me and then some.  It is a great game to pick up and play between gaming sessions and on those “raining” days where you just want to sit around and play a fun simple game.","June 7, 2014","true","60.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/averrois/recommended/242920/","averrois","Undogmatic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/averrois/","83 products in account","Short:\nDefinitely recommended, since it's a very promising concept. I recommend it specially to those who love SimCity, SimFarm, Anno 1404 and many other city-building related games.\nThis game, however, is much more difficult and meaner to the player. It's a survival town-building game where you can screw up pretty easily and have your citizens die from hunger, frozen to death, or in many other painful ways, specially if you're negligent at managing and building your town.\n\nLong:\nThis is a town-building survival game. You have to make sure your civilians get food, clothes and shelter. At times everything looks stable and easy, wonderful isn't it? Not so fast. Once you start facing problems like running out of food, tools or clothes (mostly after a baby boom), that's when the whole town can start crumbling like a deck of cards, faster than you might expect. Prudence is your friend here, dear reader, and this game will be pretty mean and unforgiving if you're negligent.\n\nYou might be thinking: "All I have to do is avoid the baby booms, easy peasy". So what do you do? You logically stop building more houses because that means less room for families to expand (and have babies), and then it's all good, right? Wrong. If you wait too long you'll have to face the problem of regress, with a population that's too old to make babies. With very few births your population will die off faster than it reproduces and that's obviously a problem. While babies and students mature you gotta have enough workers left to produce food and clothes for everybody. That being said: It's hard to maintain a stable population. It's challenging, and that's great if you love challenges. If you don't -- if you want a walk in the park until a screen pops up saying "VICTORY!" -- this game is not for you. Also: There is no victory (that I know of), there's no apotheotic triumph. Only despair and misery awaits you. The question is: how long will you last? How far can you expand your town before everybody is wiped out by your incompetence or lack of resources (usually both)? The game is still delicious even though the future of your town won't look pretty in the long run.\n\nTrade:\nThere is no money, it's all about trading resources of a kind (raw materials and produced goods) in exchange for resources of another kind... For instance: trading a bunch of firewood for some chickens.\n\nProducing food:\nYou can buy seeds and plant your crops and orchards too, it's actually nice when it comes to agriculture, there's a lot of variety to choose from (once you're powerful enough to afford all the seeds).\nIf you don't want to produce food through artificial means (agriculture and pastures) you can always treat your town as a hunter-gatherer society, but that's likely to be troublesome once the population growth hits a variable threshold (it depends on how much food you can collect at any given time). Remember that, historically speaking, human societies have thrived thanks to agriculture and other technological advancements (read "Guns, Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond for more info, if you enjoy anthropology), so you might wanna invest in agriculture if you wanna survive later on.","March 1, 2014","true","65.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You don't have to worry about warriors, or monsters. Just Winter and starvation. Sometimes a fire or a tornado.\nToday I was doing well. I built my small village of 20 people up to 50! We built up from having nothing left when winter ended to food stocks of 5000+ pounds. We were trading with nearby towns for new seeds and livestock. We built a town hall... then a disease hit my cows... it wiped out the lot. I tried to quickly re-focus the town's work into other food options, but it was too late. One by one, then house by house people began to die of starvation. The town had to focus. No more blacksmiths or tailors. Stop mining for stone and iron. All hands to the farms. Down to just 15 people the village dropped. Then.... food stocks returned! We saved it. Sure... its a ghost town now... but at least its still a town. We'll rebuild.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akimbojoe/recommended/242920/","Akimbojoe","akimbojoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akimbojoe/","596 products in account","Recommended with reservations.\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis is a fine city building game that offers some challenge initially and  is spurred on later in the game by population influxes that will tax your available infastructure but eventually when (if) you learn how to play the game it becomes little more than an endless waltz between stability and the urgent need to accomodate growth. You basically end up building farms to feed your people, building houses to have the population to staff farms, and then needing more farms to feed the increased population, all while popping down houses so that the little families you've been watching over for generations have a place to send their decendants once they marry an uneducated migrant farm worker and pop out a few new, properly educated citizens (who will need places to move into when they get married) --annnnd repeat.\n\nI enjoyed my time with it though and building your own fantasy town around the available geography is a treat. It is truly a sandbox game, which is oddly an issue I had with it. There is no real objective or goal or endgame other than whatever you decide to do. There are no antagonists other than bitter hunger and the unforgiving winter. I see people complaining about housing and illness, so I will try to give some tips to players having issues with the game which may also highlight problems you might have playing this game (which is not a great sentence in a review):\n\n-The solution to not enough housing is to build more houses (this is a game remember?) or to build a boarding house (families will not expand in boarding houses) as temporary housing.\n\n-As far as illness goes people who are properly housed and fed with a good variety of foods will not get ill, especially with an adequate supply of medicinal herbs on hand. I had hospitals in each of my civic centers and they went largely unused, the doctors spent their days writing up theorums on phlogestin in the humors and whistfully hoping they might some day see a cold.\n\n-Food will be your biggest challenge at the start of the game followed by the collection of wood and having enough builders to actually build anything in time. Late in the game your problem becomes having enough laborers to haul things around and help farmers with the harvest before crops spoil. I recommend getting your hunting and fishing on early and transitioning into farming as soon as your population can support a few extra guys doing that. It will eventually become the best way to gather food. Start the game by clearing an area you intend to use as your town center and use that wood to build enough homes for your initial settlers.\n\n-Keep wild areas preserved for the collection of game, herbs, gathered food, managed forrestry services and the like. To quote Teddy Roosevelt, "we are not building this country not for a day". Be mindful of locations where you might place quarries and mines when building your town and avoid building into land that could have been used for an exploitable resource.\n\n-I have seen people complain about production, I do not doubt they are running into inconsistencies however something to keep in mind is that production is determined by a number of factors, the most important being space and worker skill level (and education). A skilled worker can buld in a fraction of the time an unskilled worker will take and an educated worker works faster still (they must use whips in the Ivy League).\n\n-Mind your space certain industries require workable territory to function and piling in too many industries into the same area results in decreased  efficientcy. Putting too much housing and city structures together starts making it hard to get basic resources to people (the purpose of marketplaces) and get them out to work  (they start to get confused), so it's best to build several self sufficient civic areas interconnected by bridges and roads. with dedicated wild space for each.\n\n-Saving and reloading can save the life of someone who dies of a random event, but sometimes that 88 year old woodcutter is going to die no matter what you do (must be Groundhogs Day).\n\n-Play the tutorial. I fell asleep midway through the tutorial the first time (such fun) but it's really the best way to grasp the concepts of the game and get a feeling for the basics of survival.\n\nIt's a fun game that doesn't really go anywhere (could say it lacks an endgame), but building a successful and bustling city out of nothing sure can be satisfying. Should you choose to buy it (it's well worth snagging on a sale) I hope you have fun with it and either way, best of luck to you.","November 5, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Incredible that this masterpiece is the work of one man.  Not to mention that, apart from an AI bug I actually prefer to keep (animals walk under water when they travel!), the game appears to be completely bug free.\n\nI do, however, have to warn you that this is also one of the hardest in the genre.  Expand too slowly and you'll be stifled by old age; expand too soon and your town will starve to death.  The resource management is key, and is incredibly sensitive to fluctuation.  Find yourself on a downward spiral, running out of resources?  You're probably already doomed.  Managed to harvest in excess?  Store it up so you have a buffer zone.  Not enough workers?  Accept some nomads, or help your population to breed.\n\nThe game might appear to be a little shallow - once you've built all that appears in the menu, that's it - but I promise you, there's so much to this game if you're interested in making a successful, expansionist town, especially if you're after the achievements.\n\nIt's not a quickfire game either - you need lots and lots of patience to survive, and even more to master it.

Intricate and relaxing game of micro-managing people and resources to slowly build a thriving settlement. Similar enough to games like Dwarf Fortress or UnReal World that simulation/management genre fans should be able to pick up and play, but originally styled enough to feel like a fresh experience.\n\nI have built up a small self-sufficient community, and am embarking on educating the children that are soon to be young adults. Compelling just watching the settlement grow through the seasons. The major part of the gameplay involves the balancing act of providing buildings and specialised jobs for labourers, thus increasing your production output, whilst ensuring enough resource production for the immediate winter - and for a growing population.\n\nI believe that the test of the gameplay in the future will be how luck factors designed to introduce challenges (such as disease and famine) are manageable with forethought and planning. If it's always doom and gloom with little way to mitigate failure, it may be that there's not enough longevity in the game. But I have no reason to suspect that at this point.

Or you didn't build enough homes and your village is slowly dying because not enough babies are born.\nBut once you get some balance... it is just  worth it to see the seasons pass and to see your village grow.\nAbsolute favorite 9/10","September 21, 2014","true","75.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Picked it up the other night and have to say I was a little surprised on how it plays. After installing and quickly clicking through the in-game tutorials I thought I was in for another city-building strategy game. This game isn't really a city builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading bandits or any military tech. Micro managing your town to protect your people from the elements, disease and starvation while expanding the population and maintaining the workforce all at once is plenty enough.\n\nThere is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader on the river. Trading resources your town has stockpiles of for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies is the only way to bring diversity to your towns diet and obtain resources you otherwise couldn't produce. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, as every map is randomly generated and can differ with resources and geographics. Not one plan will work for every town which will bring replayability.\n\nThere is no winning in Banished, you either get it right and flourish or your people starve to death over the next cold winter.","February 20, 2014","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A combination of rolling hills, forests and rivers combined with modestly sized and decorated builds make the game look as barebones 'back to nature' as the title would suggest.\n\nThe game requires you to be adept at planning and building your town from the ground up, with sometimes severe restrictions of resources. You need to manage your population to ensure that you have enough homes, food and clothing to take care of them and you need to assign jobs in order to increase your production. The game can become incredibly difficult and actions made in the first moments of the game can sometimes seriously hinder future progress.\n\nI'd highly recommend to anyone who is interested in a well implemented city builder which focuses on keeping your people alive. There's no big talent trees, there's no evolving through the ages, no building troops or managing defenses. Your only enemies are the cold and starvation, so get building.","March 12, 2014","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That said, while playing this game I find myself looking for components that just aren't there. It seems necessary to have a better prioritization system- the ability to distribute provisions amongst the people. Another aspect I wish this game allowed is the naming of things. Whether it be houses, shops, bridges, or people, I feel the need to give them a personal tag. I really hope the developer adds this or a mod is released soon- the experience feels incomplete without it.

The strategies and pathfinding lack any form of reasoning.  For example, gatherer's huts, hunter's lodges, and fishing huts all produce more food per person than farm fields.  If that were in any way realistic, humans would never have moved towards agriculture.  The game boasts scenic, procedurally generated environments.  But, that is the extent of this game's shining points.  Resource gathering is as a whole is a painful and dreary process.  Moreso, however, maintaining reasonable levels of harvestable resources is nigh impossible.  Not to mention that once your town reaches a respectable size, citizens prefer to starve rather than path to the nearest storage barn.  Overall I would give this game a 3/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/recommended/242920/","ichieroki","darkfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/","63 products in account","Banished is an amazingly built indie simulation game.  I say indie because it is built by Shining Rock Software which consists of one person.  He does everything from the art to the programming.  It is amazing what one person can accomplish.  Like it says on Banished’s own website the game is a throwback to the games that were played in the 90’s.  I am barely old enough to qualify to talk about those games, seeing as I was born in 1989, but even I can remember playing those early simulations games and loving them.  This game for me brings me back to those days when a Sim game of any sort could just waste away whole weeks of your time.  Whether it be Sim City or Sim Farm, those games were just the best.  And it wasn’t about the graphics or the immersion or anything that we usually talk about in games today, but it was about the fun factor.  The exploration and building of a little world that you created.\n\nBanished is also a neat little game that you can’t win, but only survive.  And because of that I think most people will find the game boring because there isn’t really much that happens.  You plan and build a little settlement into a town.  Hours upon hours go by if you are doing it right as your town grows.  Eventually you just run out of resources and your little ecosystem comes crashing down all around you.  The game however is actually very hard because if you “overexpand” the same thing can happen and lives will be lost so it is important to plan ahead.\n\nAll in all I can wholeheartedly suggest that everyone should try Banished.  With my current disappointment in Sim City, Banished fills that gaming whole for me and then some.  It is a great game to pick up and play between gaming sessions and on those “raining” days where you just want to sit around and play a fun simple game.","June 7, 2014","true","60.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The strategies and pathfinding lack any form of reasoning.  For example, gatherer's huts, hunter's lodges, and fishing huts all produce more food per person than farm fields.  If that were in any way realistic, humans would never have moved towards agriculture.  The game boasts scenic, procedurally generated environments.  But, that is the extent of this game's shining points.  Resource gathering is as a whole is a painful and dreary process.  Moreso, however, maintaining reasonable levels of harvestable resources is nigh impossible.  Not to mention that once your town reaches a respectable size, citizens prefer to starve rather than path to the nearest storage barn.  Overall I would give this game a 3/10.

Intricate and relaxing game of micro-managing people and resources to slowly build a thriving settlement. Similar enough to games like Dwarf Fortress or UnReal World that simulation/management genre fans should be able to pick up and play, but originally styled enough to feel like a fresh experience.\n\nI have built up a small self-sufficient community, and am embarking on educating the children that are soon to be young adults. Compelling just watching the settlement grow through the seasons. The major part of the gameplay involves the balancing act of providing buildings and specialised jobs for labourers, thus increasing your production output, whilst ensuring enough resource production for the immediate winter - and for a growing population.\n\nI believe that the test of the gameplay in the future will be how luck factors designed to introduce challenges (such as disease and famine) are manageable with forethought and planning. If it's always doom and gloom with little way to mitigate failure, it may be that there's not enough longevity in the game. But I have no reason to suspect that at this point. It's been fun (and worryingly smooth sailing).\n\nI want to mention that the movable, informative (and yet unobtrusive) UI is fantastic and should be something of a benchmark for future games.","February 19, 2014","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't plan effectively, and your town will fold like a cheap suit at an origami expo.  Not enough food from your farms prior to winter?  Everyone starves.  Did you forget to have your woodcutter working this summer?  Prepare for you populous to freeze to death.  Did your blacksmith die of old age, and did you forget to replace him with a young apprentice?  Prepare for your production to slow to a crawl when you run out of tools.  You will manage workers, food sources, renewable building materials (read as: trees), and even housing vacancies.  Ignoring any of these metrics could spell the end of your fledgling colony!  Players are challenged to not only gather resources to survive, but to do so in such a way that is sustainable.\n\nWhile the base game is very good for those of a management mindset, Shining Rock Software has made a smart decision by integrating steam workshop support.  The player community has added a number of resources, such as different crops and livestock, and new buildings as well.  Banished really shines when you add the Colonial Charter mod by [Black Liquid].  Colonial charter adds a large number of resources and new starting options, allowing new players an easier way to learn, and offering veterans numerous options to challenge themselves.\n\nBeyond the fun and challenging gameplay, the graphics are also quite nice.  With a multitude of building and road types, your eyes will soon feast upon the robust hamlet you have created, and the sight is both pretty and something to be proud of.  If you like city builders and are looking for a challenge, look no further.  Banished is for you.

The 'city-building' concept is one I like and have pursued from the earliest years of the genre. Banish is appealing to look at with its neat little houses and leafy landscape and would seem to have great promise for those who like  games that slowly progress to their end-point.  Trouble is... dare I say it? It is, at present... boring.   Starting from 'Hard', it has taken me 10 years to grow a population of about 35 souls. I  have a mine, quarry, school-house, couple each of hunting-lodges, gatherers and forestry conservation sites, a fishing hut, market and traders post. Oh, and a blacksmith and tailors. No-one has died, children have been born and raised to adult-hood, no-one has starved or got ill, no disasters whatever have come my way - and only one trader, so far, has arrived, who wanted to sell wool, but did not have the seeds or stock I need to start a farm or grow fruit. I sit here twiddling my thumbs, waiting for something to happen.\n\nI followed the development of this game from early days as the developer, known as Dukas,  took time and trouble to inform us of its progress; the snags he encountered, the problems he solved, the  details he attended to. It was a fascinating insight and for that alone I want the game to succeed because to see it actually finished and presented was almost like  watching a baby come into the world. In that analogy, I think Banished has some growing up to do. I look forward to the promised mods. Dukas  said he wanted  us to create - mods to enhance the game, expand it, enrich it. Yes please! I also think it needs something more to aim at than simply balancing the plus against the minus. Something extra you  can get to happen or attain. Seeing houses  evolve from what they are at the start of the game to something else as you progress, for instance, though I do not  think that will happen for Banished. One day, but not quite yet, Banished will be a great game, and if Dukas puts as much time and attention into the next game he creates as he did this one, building on his experience with Banished, it will surely be a corker - and NO ZOMBIES - yay!","May 8, 2014","true","505.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Her fingers were deft with the clothes that she tailored, and her shop was full; ever bustling. The small town (Viago) she was born into from her tenacious mother and her strong willed father, had shaped her into an upstanding woman. She learned to be strong like her woodsman father and crafty per her tailoring mother. Martha lived beside the shoppe with her mother and father until a handsome young man swept her off her feet and she quickly married the merchant, moving halfway across town. Not ideal for trekking to the shoppe, but quick access to the nearby school, church, and market where her new husband worked. Soon, Martha and Edwin started their own family and had a little girl name Kaye. Kaye follwed her mother wherever she went and spent some days with her grandfather in the woods (adorable!). It was no surprise when they welcomed another small blessing into their family, a little boy this time by the name of Cole. It should come as no surprise to you by now that I was clearly infatuated with this family and followed them very closely.\n\nTheir town (Viago) was focused on husbandry; Cows, Sheep, and Chicken pens were spread throughout. Small Peach orchards spilled a sweet scent into the air that almost covered the stench of manure. Fields of Wheat, Beans, and Peppers laced the countryside and farmers worked the land day and night getting ready for market that season. Viago had recently constructed a fisherman's wharf and the whole family (and town) was excited to finally have some meat that was a bit lighter on the pallet. A portion of the town on the southside was made up of mines and quarrys and large chunks of housing that precariously touched one another. It was no surprise that the tavern ended up in this neighborhood but it did good business with it's peach ale. If you could muster the courage to wander into southside Viago you could partake of the drink.\n\nSeveral years went by and Viago flourished! The town rejoiced and finally constructed the townhall, because nothing says official like misconceived authority! After founding this town hall, they had nomads come across their land and seek refuge within. Of course the people of Viago let them in! The townsfolk even built an inn for them to stay in until proper homes could be arranged. Some of them even married with the townsfolk and started their own family! Now, by the time this happened, poor Martha's mother had passed away from old ago and her poor father took to drink and moved to the southside where the ale ran like the river. Martha and Edwin continued their lives as normal, having aged considerably their kids grew up. While Cole had found himself a job as a blacksmith (having apprenticed for years!), he settled with a blonde girl named Hannah who was a herdsman. Unfortunately for Kaye, she still lived at home with her mother but had found reputable work at the Market with her father.\n\nThen It all changed so fast.\n\nOne of the newest batches of nomads that were granted entrance to Viago unknowingly (or knowingly!) brought a bad case of scarlet fever with them! Unfortunately the town was surviving off of the herbalist and were pretty close to darn near perfect health. The plot for the hospital was all picked out...and under construction. Nobody knew where to go or where to turn! People were literally dying in the streets and disappearing into the woods! The fever claimed many children's lives before the hospital was made available to the public. Once the crowd of about 20 with the fever made it in, many survived but still died. The population had dwindled from 100/20/18 to around 70/15/10. Many places of work had to shut down because there simply were not enough people to fill in the blanks.\n\nEverything returned to normal for about 4 years.\n\nBy this time my beloved Family had suffered more tragedy. Martha's Father died of old age, leaving her with her husband and children. Cole and Hannah were thankfully still employed and had two little girls to show for their love. Gwendolyn and Pips (Don't ask me I don't name the buggers!). All was not well with this family and it seems when despair came it came twenty fold. Cole and Hannah's house caught on fire. Luckily they lived near the town's well and their neighbors and friends helped put out the fire, but the house was in great disrepair and had to be torn down and built back up. Unfortunately Viago was experiencing an iron shortage and Cole was hard pressed to find work. Slowly people didn't have tools anymore and were running around in a panic! The barns that were once full of produce and meat and eggs were suddenly dwindling rapidly in supplies because the farmers couldn't farm successfully without any tools! Chaos ensued! Peaches were not getting delivered to the tavern, so the drink ran dry. Since the Market closed during the Scarlet fever people were having a hard time getting food when they lived further from town! The church however got an increase to patrons (Fancy that!) but the graveyard that sat beside it was mostly barren except for those from the great scarlet fever, but that absense was not to be!\n\nStarvation! Starvation! People were once again in the streets, in the feilds, picking what they could. The fisherman tried their best but clients stole away the food for themselves and stored it in their homes! Some had actually managed to take a great deal of food and citizens came to their doors and begged for something to eat where some of them obliged for a while but others turned them away. As more and more people died, the citizens of Viago had started to wander the streets in search of food like some great apocolyptic nightmare. The graveyard was full...and this was when my attention to my perfect but tragedy fueled little family came back to my attention. Upon checking in and keeping up with the recent events I was saddened to see that Martha and Edwin had both succumbed to starvation, and Kaye was on the edge. However I had not been paying as close attention and saw that Kaye had her own home and had managed to have an illegitimate child with someone right before the starvation and the poor thing wasn't even a year old! A little boy named Mackey. I shed a few tears as I watched the home and soon baby Mackey ended up in the ever increasing graveyard and his mother stood in the graveyard (probably near his grave) before she DIED RIGHT THERE! I couldn't be too distracted for Hannah and Cole and their wee little ones Gwendolyn and Pipps were surprisingly still alive! Cole was trying his hardest to continue to produce tools one at a time but it seemed to be to no avail! Once he made one it was gone and there were loads of others who needed tools! His wife tried to get food by leaving the sheep and working with the cattle but a freaking infestation infested that cattle yard and she died from an infection! The small children played in the fields or were by their father's side but by this time with Cole/Gwendolyn/Pipps as the only remaining in my family the population was 15/0/1. Some stupid sod had given birth to another child. Viago was more than half shutdown. There was no hope. The storage fluctuated sometimes because one field was still active and so was the wharf. But finally many started to die from starvation again and I watched the little blips of a 14 year olf Gwendolyn and 11 Year old Pipps fade away and be replaced by cemetary markers. Cole was now the only surviving member of my family. He died that winter at the age of 45, not due to starvation, but due to another bout of scarlet fever due to the atrocious health of Viago from all the death and starvation.\n\nBest Tragedy Simulator of the year. 1000000/10 Would Cry again.\n\nBut seriously? This is an amazing game and thoroughly well done. It tests your capabilities and makes you think hard about your decisions. There is no easy way. There are mods to make it a bit more casual, but it's fun/tragic/delightful/frustrating. Enjoy!","December 7, 2014","true","125.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Such as lack of tools which bring all of your production down and makes even more chaos.\nOne thing to watch out for is the colonists can get a little greedy and take all available food when there's only a small amount in stock, leaving none for others and letting them starve.\n\nThe base game does lack buildings and you can soon feel as though you've built everything in a short time, there's plenty of mods to download but I would have liked to have seen more in the game.\n\nBiggest problem with the game is the frame-rate when reaching 1,000+ population, for me it became unplayable so you will need to keep that in mind when building a village across the whole map.\n\nOverall it's a great game and plenty of time can be spent, there's some nice achievements you can work towards if you like extra challenges/goals..\nDefinitely worth a buy if you like builders and/or management games.","May 22","true","252.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I say that as a huge 4X gamer.\n\nOf the "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate" there is really only eXpand and eXploit.\n\nReally though, it's more of a survival game than anything.\n\nI played all day, and I love it, though there are some things people should know.\n\nRPS did a great review which falls in line with my experience.\n\nThe fun comes from the difficulty in my opinion. It is NOT as easy as you say. Mother nature is a cold ♥♥♥♥♥, and you feel that in this game (figuratively and literally).\n\nYou need to balance carefully where your workers go, and how many you assign to each job, in addition to watching resource amounts, health, and happiness, and making sure you have enough houses.\n\nIf you don't have enough houses, your citizens won't keep having babies, and you won't expand. It's not static though; those citizens keep getting older, and one day you'll look up and 3 quarters of your population has died, and you have no way to recover.\n\nDisasters can strike, literally ending the game for you. It's almost rougue-like in that aspect. It's not SimCity where you simply re-build. If people died, you can't replace them.\n\nBanished is simply unforgiving, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nI enjoy it because apparently I'm a glutton for punishment, but also I rarely find games that TRULY challenge me.\n\nI'm not sure on the longevity, but there will be a mod kit released at some point.\n\nGet this if you enjoy things like this, but it's not for everyone. It won't hold your hand.\n\nHere's just a taste of what happened to me today:\n\n"I was doing great until a tornado came through and killed all the children and young adults in the town.\n\nWhat I was left with was a population of elderly useless people who couldn't reproduce.\n\nEssentially I had nothing to do but wait for them all to die, barring some kind of miracle.\n\nEventually, years later, the last two people were left. A husband and wife. The husband died of old age, and I expected the wife to die soon as well.\n\nBut no. She decided she was gonna give me the middle finger and keep on keepin' on until the ripe old age of 92. I guess she didn't appreciate the last 20 years I had her work in the mines for no good reason.\n\nAs a final ♥♥♥♥ you I had her build her own cemetery, so there's that."\n\nAs far as polish, it's extremely well done. Haven't come across any bugs, and this is a game ONE man did over the course of 3 years or so. The seasons changing is gorgeous, and it's pretty in it's own way. Though the buildings could use more differentiation.\n\nThe UI definitely needs work though. It's useable, but comes across like a spreadsheet simulator many times.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for polish and difficulty, though also accounting for it's UI issues and unfailing ability to make me stay up way too late.","February 19, 2014","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I say that as a huge 4X gamer.\n\nOf the "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate" there is really only eXpand and eXploit.\n\nReally though, it's more of a survival game than anything.\n\nI played all day, and I love it, though there are some things people should know.\n\nRPS did a great review which falls in line with my experience.\n\nThe fun comes from the difficulty in my opinion. It is NOT as easy as you say. Mother nature is a cold ♥♥♥♥♥, and you feel that in this game (figuratively and literally).\n\nYou need to balance carefully where your workers go, and how many you assign to each job, in addition to watching resource amounts, health, and happiness, and making sure you have enough houses.\n\nIf you don't have enough houses, your citizens won't keep having babies, and you won't expand. It's not static though; those citizens keep getting older, and one day you'll look up and 3 quarters of your population has died, and you have no way to recover.\n\nDisasters can strike, literally ending the game for you. It's almost rougue-like in that aspect. It's not SimCity where you simply re-build. If people died, you can't replace them.\n\nBanished is simply unforgiving, especially on the higher difficulties.\n\nI enjoy it because apparently I'm a glutton for punishment, but also I rarely find games that TRULY challenge me.\n\nI'm not sure on the longevity, but there will be a mod kit released at some point.\n\nGet this if you enjoy things like this, but it's not for everyone. It won't hold your hand.\n\nHere's just a taste of what happened to me today:\n\n"I was doing great until a tornado came through and killed all the children and young adults in the town.\n\nWhat I was left with was a population of elderly useless people who couldn't reproduce.\n\nEssentially I had nothing to do but wait for them all to die, barring some kind of miracle.\n\nEventually, years later, the last two people were left. A husband and wife. The husband died of old age, and I expected the wife to die soon as well.\n\nBut no. She decided she was gonna give me the middle finger and keep on keepin' on until the ripe old age of 92. I guess she didn't appreciate the last 20 years I had her work in the mines for no good reason.\n\nAs a final ♥♥♥♥ you I had her build her own cemetery, so there's that."\n\nAs far as polish, it's extremely well done. Haven't come across any bugs, and this is a game ONE man did over the course of 3 years or so. The seasons changing is gorgeous, and it's pretty in it's own way. Though the buildings could use more differentiation.\n\nThe UI definitely needs work though. It's useable, but comes across like a spreadsheet simulator many times.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for polish and difficulty, though also accounting for it's UI issues and unfailing ability to make me stay up way too late.","February 19, 2014","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Congratulation on developer that manage to create a game that satisfy me.\nIm actually fallen sick after playing this game as i always tried to save my people out of hunger and disease.\n\nJust a little story..\ni've been looking for a medieval themed city building when i see this game and then i think "maybe i should try this one".. The first sale is coming after i wishlisted this game, but i missed it.. im crying for 5 days before i finally able to move on with my life..\n\nabout 3 months later the sale is coming back..\ni remember that day, im crying in tears once more.. tears of joy.. tears of hope..\nim asking to myself.. "is this the right time?".\nim taking my pray at that very moment.. "praise thanks to you, oh the great one.. for this opportunity".\n---------\nyou still reading this ? really ? ok then.. here is my points of view.\n\nThe Good :\n- Slow PC & Net-Friendly\n- Good Graphic\n- Good Management System\n- Challenging Sandbox\n- Reply Value\n- A lot of Scenario (Infinite?)\n- Great Atmosphere\n\nThe Bad :\n- No Political System\n- No Law & Crime System\n- No War\n- No Random Events\n- A bit repetitive on Early and Late Stage\n- Little variety of choice\n\nA little word..\n\nI know this is a city-building game where "WAR" is not the main point. But if we are actually building a Medieval city we have to understand that it is common where people use Sword & shield to spill blood for gold and food, at least there should be event like where bandit raiding the village or a kingsman offering protection.\n\nThere is still some "little word" to be told.. but, i guess i've cover some aspects that needed to be said.\nif you think i missed something in this review just tell me..\n\nxD Have fun playing !!","November 10, 2015","true","0.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

In banished you have to keep everyone alive, and it can be a b*tch sometimes. It only has very few things - and some workshop items - but it's all you need most of the time, as eventually you'll think everything is going well, then your population tips over the supply of food, houses, firewood and tools, or a nomad will bring a desease you can't deal with, or there's a fire in your dense housing estate, or every working citizen expires from old and most, if not everyone, will die.\n\nYou mostly deal with supply and demand of the things keeping everyone alive; you need to prioritise what is more important. There's not much to it, really. But there is always a brief stage between when you're just starting out and when everything goes horribly wrong where you can bring in the uses of churches, taverns, town halls and trading. Depending on the difficulty, you start of with varying amounts of supplies, including seeds for farming and lifestock. Everything can be found at the trading post. But you need to remind yourself not to ever think it's all going well, because winter is coming.","April 18, 2015","true","30.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's no Dwarf Fortress, maybe more of a cross between Sim City and the Anno series, just without the complex spreadsheet-based gameplay of either. There isn't a lot of variety in the gameplay, even the maps are simply "How much does it rain/snow? How much impassable mountains are there?" and with both the inability to pick where you spawn and how fast you kick the bucket if you don't set up immediately means you're just stuck with whatever the game starts you out on. Once you do get started, though, it's mostly twiddling your thumbs and trying to set up constant resources while hoping you actually get people.\n\nBut, despite all that, it really isn't a bad game. This review was made when it was first released and it's being actively developed, so circumstances could change.

I just can't handle the stupidity of the townsfolk. It makes the game very difficult to manage but for the completely wrong reasons... For example:\n- Out of four houses in my town, two houses would be starving and the other two would have way too much food than they needed. This was purely because certain townsfolk would get to the food first and take it all for themselves. Even though the two houses that were starving were actually closer to the food source.\n- People would completely ignore that fact that they were starving and let themselves die. Going to work when they should prioritise feeding themselves. And even leaving their starving new borns at home to die.\n\nThese problems quickly resulted in a downward spiral of death and labour shortage. Further resulting in a completely dysfunctional town. I tried to play three times. This happend everytime and I gave up in total boredom.

I love the idea, the setting, the goal ... everything. But, the mechanics are downright frustrating.\n\nTypically, at Year 15, I have 20,000 or more food and around 60 residents. But, around that time, regardless of all the population-building strategies I've built, people start dying ... and the game doesn't tell you that people are dying or why. And, strangely, their homes still use firewood, and they keep eating. In fact, the decreased population eats more and faster than the increased population.\n\nSo, by Year, 20, I'm down to 30 residents, but I'm still burning as much wood as 60 residents, and my food stores are down to starvation level.\n\nAfter 140 hours, what's the lesson to be learned? Don't play this game. All it does is become an obsession to try to figure out why it works this way, but for this game, there is no answer.\n\nAnymore, I just play the first 10 years, because they usually make sense.

I don't see how anyone in their right minds could rate this 10 out of 10. When Banished was just released, there was an enormous hype. The game stood at the top of Steam's bestseller list for weeks. At any given time, 13.000 people were playing the game. Now, 7 weeks after release, those 13.000 have shrunk to 1.300. The game is no longer at the top of the bestseller list, not even on the first page of it. And all the media attention has gone. Why is that?\n\nBecause Banished does not hold people's attention very well. When I first started playing I was obsessing over it. There were new mechanics to learn, great visuals to look at, and a real buzz of something new. After about 15 hours of playing, I was working on my third city and it was all going well. I had obviously mastered many of the games mechanics. And that's where my attention started to wane.\n\nAfter a while that city reached a population of 600, and that's where the game started to act up. At first, people started starving because they were running from one end of a large map to the other for some menial task. Yes, they would rather die from starvation than pick up food from the barn next to them. After that, my food production started to fail because of the same problem. And from there, it was a cascade of death.\n\nI didn't give up and started two more cities, trying each time to do better. But the game had already lost most of it's appeal to me. I liked it at first, because it was relaxing and peaceful to build. But the further I got into it, the more punishing and destructive it became. On top of that there are some bugs and glitches that the developer acknowledged, but still hasn't fixed.\n\nAnd that is another one of my gripes. The developer that releases a game, is taken aback by all the bug reports, and just disappears. Seriously. Shortly after the release, we got two blog posts and a beta patch. Then, weeks of nothingness. Followed by one report saying that he doesn't get to code as much as he needs to. And that he won't do overtime because he doesn't see the point of it. A very, very apologetic blog post indeed. He knows that the game needs work, but he won't be doing it.\n\nHe is supported by a very combative and poisonous community. Both on the official forums as on the Steam forums, there are a few teams of people who will respond to every post. They will say that in order to criticize a developer, you first need to develop a game of your own. That you should own a business yourself before you can have complaints about someone else's. That the bugs aren't bugs, but minor glitches. And that you just don't know how to play. That you should leave the developer alone, because he really has a hard time of it, and that he deserves a life too. So, no support to speak of.\n\nA game like this, to me, feels more like a blueprint. At best, it looks really nice and has some fantastic ideas. But it isn't finished by a long run and there's a good chance that it never will be. This game left me empty and a slightly frustrated. 4 out of 10.","April 8, 2014","false","51.7"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

And then make sure there isnt too few children (otherwise you lose workers as they oldies die) or too many children (or everyone starves). If youve got all that, and youve managed to get on top of every other little thing that stands in your way then something else will ensure your downfall. Still either you win or try again.","March 7, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Secondly, their retardation manages to keep them alive for surprisingly long.\nCitizens are selfish, they hoard ALL the food that they can while others starve to death.\nThat aside, the game is surprisingly fun albeit frustrating from time to time. The game can also be very difficult (it is highly likely that your first town will not succeed or be very unstable and wobbly before failing altogether). The game is time consuming and very stretched out, but like I said it does offer a challenge and I can reccomend this game despite its minor faults.","November 18, 2014","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign.\n\nThat said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant. But until new content shows up, you can always just start a new city and deal with a whole new set of challenges.\n\n8/10","November 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimuLord/recommended/242920/","SimuLord","SimuLord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimuLord/","122 products in account","This game is very, very reminiscent of the Tropico series rather than Cities XL or SimCity.  Individual lives are more important than big-picture thinking, resource gathering is a matter of watching visual feedback---you can see your people at work---and the in-game economy is very much dependent on producing enough to export so that you can get what you need from foreign trade.\n\nThen again, that might be this game's problem.  It's Tropico set to Battletoads difficulty for reasons that often don't make sense.  Citizen resource consumption rates are set high seemingly as a difficulty construct, random (negative) events occur at the same frequency they would in the aforementioned Tropico's "Are you loco, Presidente?" setting, and the game never reaches a point that's the most rewarding part of the genre---the ability to sit back and enjoy what you've built.  There's always _something_ horribly out of true, or if there isn't, it's only a random event away.\n\nWhich makes it a great Ph.D-level program for master city builders (I've been playing this genre since SimCity Classic and have played every major and some of the minor series to come out over the last 25 years).  What it doesn't make it is a game to just relax with and enjoy.\n\nA hesitant recommendation.  Know what you're getting into and don't force this game to be something it's not and you'll like it just fine.  It's well-constructed.  It just too often crosses the line between fun and frustrating.","March 2, 2014","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And all the while you get to watch your citizens go about their business.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant if you don't expect too much, and there's some pretty serious calculations going on behind the scenes.

It may start hectic at first, but eventually you learn that speed multiplier is your long-time friend.  A bit of a learning curve for settlement management, but trial and error is a wonderful instructor.  If you have trouble here's a few hints:\n\nPAUSE the game early on while you place your initial layout, editing as you go along, and pause each build.  You can then activate each one 1-2 at a time when you restart the game.\n\nTRACK all your core resources closely (iron, stone, logs, firewood, and food). Lack of firewood or food WILL kill you.\n\nBUILD at a pace.  Do NOT have multiple open build projects active at once.  Prioritize and only have 2-3 at a time going.\n\nTOWN HALL will bring in nomads, if your health/happiness is above ~50%\n\nTEACH your people ASAP with a school.\n\nALE and religion will raise happiness, CEMETERY will keep it steady.\n\nDEVELOP a variety of food sources, and learn how to use them for secondary benefit (wool, leather, ale, TRADE)\n\nRELAX... get comfortable and take an interest in thoughtful development.\n\nROADS are an utter waste of time while active builds are going.  They may also divert your builders from more important work.\n\nPLAN your settlement out in advance.  You can designate buildings and FREEZE their resource demands and builds for later on (mines, quarry, bridges, tunnels, markets, trader, town hall, etc).\n\nEXPLOIT your terrain.  Plant trees in open areas, and place associated resource gatherers within the AoE. (hunter, herbalist, gatherer, maybe even a woodcutter and small stockpile).\n\nSEND me a message, or a question, and I'll do my best to help you out.  I give this game a 9/10.  -1 for unminimizeable windows, an apparent non-exponential population growth to population ratio, and use of text in game that borders on beyond too small)","August 9, 2014","true","207.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees.

It's the same experience that I enjoyed when playing From Dust.  The seasonal weather provides a stable pace.  The music is calm and entrancing.  It lends a coziness and inspiration to be a bit precious with my people and resources in this game, in the same way that Tropico used it's salsa soundtrack to encourage me to be a bit madcap and never take any disaster very seriously or worry if the city became onesided.\n\nThere's a strong sense of freedom here, but what keeps it from becoming a bland blur of click and place is the constant need to balance as I build.  If I haven't built homes in awhile, my villagers start to live with their parents and stop having babies.  If I let it get out of hand, I'm going to have a huge wave of childless people dying off of old age at once, throwing my large town into disorder.  So I build houses, and babies start showing up in them.  More mouths to feed.  Do I have space for farms?  Are there good points on the river for fisheries?  Are there plentiful forests to set up hunter/gatherer stations, or do I want to take the long view and plant an orchard for a couple of years later?  And there's a lot more detail to this end, but not so much that it feels tedious or confusing, just very satisfying.\n\nI'm not very far in, but I don't expect that I'll play this game like a hardcore addiction.  It seems rather, like a bright, happy little diversion that will fill a few weekends.

There are no ancillary objects other than succeeding challenges of growth, fire and winter. You start out with a handful of homeless villagers and a stockpile of food and tools. You can build houses, roads, farms, fishing piers, wells, mines, etc. There are no skill trees. However, there are resource walls. Don't plan on raising cattle without trade as cattle can only be acquired through trade. That's not to say successful towns require anything other than your creativity in resource management. Successful towns are often built around diversity and quantity of food and resources.\n\nThe game reminds me of Black & White but without the godlike abilities, opposing town, or civil strife. Essentially, Sim: Village. Just needs a few aliens spaceships to go with the occasional tornado.\n\nI recommend this game to those who enjoy the genre of simulation; specifically, city-building, without the city. If your looking for conflict other than watching your villagers fight off winter, famine, and fires, then this might not be the game for you.","February 25, 2014","true","31.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign.\n\nThat said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant.

For example I had a town and after trying everything possible I just made a bunch of fishing huts and two farms. When I looked at the inventory of a house I saw that they hade every ♥♥♥♥ing peice of fish in the game. They had over 400 pieces of fish! I looked and saw this was the same case throughout all the houses. In the end everyone died of starvation. I don't like that if you are short on one material that it leads to your ultimate demise. So maybe the creator could make it so villagers did not take so much food. Or maybe you get more materials so you don't die. Right now I give this game a 7 out of 10. But if they fixed it I would make it a 9 out of 10.\n\n\nSo after playing this game once again after an update or two I thought they would change the AI so they didn't take the world's population of food and ♥♥♥♥ themselves in the ♥♥♥ by having a Thanksgiving feast in every home every night so they don't have ♥♥♥♥ for food two days later. I noticed it was slightly better but not much instead the population of my town caught autism while looking for a settlement. When you want ♥♥♥♥ built where there are trees the builders 40% of the time will stick their tumbs in their asses and walk around staring into the sun and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves instead of do their ♥♥♥♥ing jobs. Leading to an exhausting effort to get these ♥♥♥♥ heads to move their asses. Many seasons later the ♥♥♥♥ing structure is built but it is too late because 75% of your population has died in that time. #♥♥♥♥YOUBUILDERS. I wish the builders would build the structures in the order I ordered them to be built in instead of doing the one that is closest. Who am I kiding I just want a guarentee that they will build at all. Also I would think that a fishing hut would produce as or as close to as mush as a hunters hut. No that would make too much sense, if a hunter kills one ♥♥♥♥ing deer it is given 100 but if I have 4 fishermen fishing they get around 40. In what ♥♥♥♥ing universe does a deer give anywhere close to 100 meat. I should expect that considering every household eats 3000 potatos. The pathing also sucks. If I build a road I expect the people to use the road. Instead they waltz through the grass when there is a road right beside them. The name of this game should be "Autismville" and the description should be "If a group of Autist engore themselves stand idle and die". I swear ants function better than these ♥♥♥♥ers. This game needs an AI fix and balanced. I played the game exactly like the tutorial and still failed. I wish I could successfully play this game once in my lifetime. I am changing my rating to an "OW I AM DYING OF STARVATION" out of "WAIT I AM SUPPOSED TO BUILD ♥♥♥♥".","March 5, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game was mostly written by one guy and to see how well he has put the whole package in terms of gameplay, longevity and overall look and feel of it is amazing compared to other games from "companies" sold thesedays.\n\n10/10 Excellent game, certainly my game of 2014 so far this year.\n\nOkay for those of you considering this game it is basically a survival city builder game. The main object is to build your settlement and maintain growth and sustainability for your population. Initially you need to provide homes, food and warmth, if you can maintain that your population will have basic survival. To extend past this you need to education, provide building resources and tools, clothing, religion and health care. There are lots of food options to maintain a balanced diet to keep their health, along with various ways to improve their happiness including a tavern. There are some things I would love to see this developer add, but I know he has made this game in the mind it can be modded, although I would prefer to see official DLC from himself than third party ones that could clash with each other.\n\nAnyway my conclusion is, if you like city building and want a nice twist and challenge then this game is 100% for you and definately worth the price and the support for this guy to continue!","March 12, 2014","true","88.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As your population ages, your older workers will die off and, if no new childeren have been born for some time, you may run low on citizens old enough to work.\n(Adults will move into new houses and begin raising children if new houses are avaliable, but older adults can't raise children)\n\nin addition to the need for basic nesessities and growth, your workers must walk to their place of work, meaning that you must make sure enough housing is nearby for them to live in (but they will exchange jobs automaticaly to minimize the legnth of their walking paths)\n\nThere is also the ability to trade with other towns for needed resourses and unlock new types of food by trading.\n\nMedieval setting.\n\nbugs of note:\n\n-laborers (the default task) may die to starvation if a task is set too far from their home no matter how much food is available.\n\n-roads cannot always be removed by the remove road tool once placed.\n\n-game crash if you set orders for a merchent after they have already left your dock.\n\nA very intuitive, interesting, and relaxing game that challenges you to make the best use of the resourses avaliable to you and create a major metropolis from sticks and stones. Very impressed with the game's design and how seemless the game experience is from start to finish.","March 21, 2014","true","180.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The support from other players will teach you what you need to know fast and prevent you from having no fun when everyone is starving or you're population isn't growing.\n\nFinally, Rock software have confirmed mod support in the future so don't expect this game to stagnate :)\n","February 22, 2014","true","175.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And all the while you get to watch your citizens go about their business.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant if you don't expect too much, and there's some pretty serious calculations going on behind the scenes.

For those who have enjoyed games like SimCity, this is the game for you. Dont expect to survive for too long though. And keep 2/3rds of your entire population collecting food for the winter. And then make sure you have a woodcutter and logs to chop ready for winter. And then make sure everyone is housed. And then make sure there isnt too few children (otherwise you lose workers as they oldies die) or too many children (or everyone starves).

For some reason the post game-session steam advert grabbed me, my first reaction was 'ooh, that looks nice.' Not being a real city builder fan I had my reservations about making a purchase. I usually enjoy big AAA action blockbusters (and KSP) and with big AAA let downs of this genre like Sim City, I was thinking what could ONE guy do to better that. I was so, so wrong. There's no enemys and once you get through your first few winters, an established, working town can thrive pretty easily even on hard difficulty but there's a simple beauty to this game that grabs you straight away, from the music to the brilliant aesthetics. It's hard to comprehend how one man found such a perfect balance. Granted the pace is slow but it's extremely addictive. You develop an attachment with your citizens and township which is great.

If you like Sim City, Tropico, or any other "build your own town" game, then you will love this!\nOne problem I've always had with this genre of games is the obnoxious problem of budgeting expenses, as I would always end up in debt somehow. Banished takes the time period of the piece (ranges from rennissance town to early American settlement, your choice) and only asks that you use natural resources to live. No fumbling money, no need to trade (if you're good), and no worrying about debt.\nThe game boasts beautiful graphics, simple yet challenging gameplay, and an infinite amount of possibilites.\n\nHeres a little rundown of the game:\n-- You start by creating a town, and there are map seeds in case you like a certain area you've played before. You can choose a difficulty which will dictate how much stuff you start with. Weather/climate, disasters, and other changeable aspects  are all modified before entering the game. When all of that is done, you're entered in, and depeding on what difficulty you've chosen, you must start building certain buildings. Simply cut tree's and stones to gather resources, assign villagers to certain jobs and balance out what is important until your population begins to expand. There is an automatic birth/death cycle constantly going on, so your population will eventually increase. Eventually, you can designate hunting areas, farming areas, and much more (trading, fishing, herbalists, woodcutting, tailors, blacksmiths, teachers, etc.) Keep building until your town suits your style, and is sustainable!\n\nThe game is great! I would recommend you buy it when you get the funds (as 19.99 is a great price for the content you get).\n\nHere, have some pros/cons:\n\nPROS-\n-Great simulation with climate, seasons, weather, disasters, health, and much more needed to be watched over to ensure survival\n-infinite amount of ways to go (you can literally build many different towns on the same map)\n-A+ Graphics\n-Simple yet challenging\n-Awesome tutorials that make it easy to get in and go\n-Large amount of content\n-No money to deal with! Trading is done through material bartering\n-Good time period for this kind of simulator\n-Overall: A+ Fun, Great concept, infinite replayablilty, and always changing gameplay\n\nCons:\n- As of right now I have not found any at all\n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10\nBeautiful game with an awesome concept and great execution!

You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.\n\nBanished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.\n\nMy laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.

It is solid gameplay at a fair price.  It is more challenging than your standard sim because everything has direct consequences, moreso than in other sims.  For instance, if let yourself run low on tools, you will quickly find that people don't work as effectively.  People that don't work effectively are mining for the materials that the blacksmith makes to make the tools.  So you run out of iron, coal, and logs to make tools.  Farmers, hunters, and other food bearing people need these tools.  So then you starve and your village becomes a ghost town, all because you let yourself run low on tools.\n\nThe game mechanics remind me of back when Stronghold was a good game, a couple releases back.  There were things in Stronghold that I wish were in this game, such as taking wheat to a mill to make flour that you take to a bakery to bake bread.  More of a "tech tree", if you will.  But the few elements that this game does have (metal, coal, various food types, wood, etc) are done extremely well.\n\nBanished has some fresh ideas as well, such as crop and animal diseases, various human diseases (filthy nomads!), and schools.  Regarding schools, educated villagers perform better but are a drain on resources until they graduate.\n\nThe graphics and sound are great for a game at this price point, and I only suffered one crash to desktop in my over 500 hours of gameplay.\n\nAbout that.. The insane amount of time you see that I've played Banished isn't entirely accurate.  One of the things I enjoyed with the game was to see if I finally created a self-sufficient, self-surviving village, and then I would go to bed and leave it running.  9.9 times out of ten I would wake up to see that I didn't think things through in one area or another, or that a tornado had come through, or my pastures were diseased, or....\n\nIf you like sim builders, and are up for a challenge, Banished is definitely for you!","May 18, 2014","true","593.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

You take control of a small community of outcasts and attempt to keep them alive as long as you can in a verdent but harsh environment. You will have engineer your town to provide the necessities of life not only for your workers, but also for those too young to provide for themselves. Those needs include shelter, fuel, food, clothing, tools (non-fatal) education (non-fatal), medical services, wells for fighting fires as well as sourses of wood, stone, iron and other resourses for the production of said items and for the growth of your town.\n\nIt is the first game I have seen that has penelties for not expanding your town regulaurly. As your population ages, your older workers will die off and, if no new childeren have been born for some time, you may run low on citizens old enough to work.\n(Adults will move into new houses and begin raising children if new houses are avaliable, but older adults can't raise children)\n\nin addition to the need for basic nesessities and growth, your workers must walk to their place of work, meaning that you must make sure enough housing is nearby for them to live in (but they will exchange jobs automaticaly to minimize the legnth of their walking paths)\n\nThere is also the ability to trade with other towns for needed resourses and unlock new types of food by trading.\n\nMedieval setting.\n\nbugs of note:\n\n-laborers (the default task) may die to starvation if a task is set too far from their home no matter how much food is available.\n\n-roads cannot always be removed by the remove road tool once placed.\n\n-game crash if you set orders for a merchent after they have already left your dock.\n\nA very intuitive, interesting, and relaxing game that challenges you to make the best use of the resourses avaliable to you and create a major metropolis from sticks and stones.

There's one developer working on the entire game, and yes it's a pretty nice game so far. It's somewhat different from a lot of sim/city building games, in that it really does focus on survival - no food = your entire population dying out very quickly. But when there is really no major depth to the game (by the time you end up with a few hundred people in a stable pop you've basically beaten all the game has to offer.. there's just nothing more to offer. You can set your own goals in terms of what pop you reach or having every kind of seed and animal etc, but for me, just not a great deal to offer at the moment. Hopefully the game is either not difficult to mod, or the developer has a LOT easier time to develop additional content for the game now because if it's going to take him 6 months to push out a new profession or similar, then I can't see this going anywhere unfortunately.\n\n6, maybe 7/10.","February 27, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The User Interface is fluid. The game is responsive. The attention to detail is astounding. When you build farms, you don't just have a farm, you are allowed to choose between a dozen food types. Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees. You have over a dozen food choices to from. Corn, pumpkin, squash, wheat, beans, and more. Easily worth the $20 i dropped on it. I missed it on sale for 15 by a few hours.

(Mountains, harsh climate etc.)\nEverything is so balanced in Banished, graphics are beatiful and more than enough for such a game, atmosphere is beatiful, each building has some different skins to choose from, seasons are perfectly set, climate changes are perfecty shown, economy chain is perfectly set(there is no money or gold in the game), you can see the whole life span of your citizens flow in front of your eyes(Each citizen has a unique name) and so goes on.\nActually it's unbelievable that the development team(?) only consists of one guy.

The fun of the game is really in figuring out how produce enough food/tools/clothes/medicine/etc to prevent everyone from dying.

From them you can purchase seeds, livestock, food, etc. in exchange for your own goods.  Not all traders have the same thing.

It seems to be difficult at begin but after few hours you get the tricks and can have a got start then, even on hard conditions. The interface is easy to operate so you don't have to search for anything too long.

I am not going to say that those are bad, becuase I couldn't handle it. I suppose in reality it could be the same. You have to think in order to let the town grow smoothly and if you are too lazy to think, just try again :P\n\nThe disasters which can destroy your town are awesome. I had a town with about 350-400 citizens and tornado had struck it. As you can predict almost everything have been destroyed.

The main goal, however, is not to build a prosperous metropolis, but to keep your citizens alive in a hostile environment. The key to this is wise resource management and proper planning. Banished has been called "The Dark Souls of City Builders" and I can agree with this. It may seem very hard - even unfair - at first, but once you understand the mechanics, it becomes very doable as long as you keep paying attention.\n\n+ Actual Simulation: Every single citizen is born to a family, given a (weird) name and after growing up and finishing school, will get a job, move in with a partner and found a family of their own. Everything that you set in motion will be visibly carried out by your citizens; from clearing land to planting seeds to finally bringing in the harvest, you can observe every step being carried out. Similarly, buildings don't just plop up where you order them built, the necessary materials have to be carried to the location, after which you can watch the structure being erected in two or three visible stages. Your workers have to get there first though, which means the farther away from established infrastructure you chose to build, the longer it will take (and the less efficient production buildings will be).\n\n+ The Achievements: There are no "Do something incredibly moronic and counter-intuitive that will totally frack up your savegame, or just be a boring grind that will taint your memory of the game if you care enough about achievements to actually do it" type achievements. Almost all of them are just about doing well at the game. The others, like "Mountain Men", can be viewed as scenarios (which are otherwise missing from the game).\n\n+ The Bugs: I haven't encountered any.\n\n\n\nTHE "MEH"\n~ Graphics: The graphics are OK, i.e. "not ugly". Fully zoomed out, they're even kind of charming, as long as you ignore stuff like the river-crossing Jesus Deer.\n\n~ Sound: The loop of a very limited number of background music tracks quickly becomes boring, but at least the music isn't annoying (to me). The same cannot be said for some of the ambience sounds like the mooing of cows or the gusts of wind, which are constant if you play on x10 speed. MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH. You'll probably play with (ambience-) sound off after a while. (Why isn't this under "bad"? Because it's almost enjoyable on x1 speed.)\n\n~ Resource Management Tools: While overall very well done, they're lacking in some parts. E.g.:\n\n- You can place production limits on all manufactured goods, including clothing, but not on leather and wool, which are needed for clothing. If you produce slightly more raw materials than your tailor uses (and if you don't keep an eye on this), your storage barns will eventually overflow with them, meaning there's no space for produced goods anymore. This is exaggerated when the clothing limit has been reached and the tailors stop production.\n\n- You cannot prohibit citizens from using certain goods. They will eat the wheat intended for your brewers to make ale and they will use coal instead of firewood to heat their homes if coal is stored closer to the market than firewood at that moment. (You need coal for steel tools). You also cannot limit selected stockpiles to only store certain goods, or a maximum amount of a specific good.\n\nThese are minor issues and there are ways to get around them, but it certainly isn't optimal.\n\n~ Variety: There's not a lot of it, except in food. There are very few building types and even fewer upgrades (one for houses). But hey, it works and there is enough to manage.\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n- Performance: This simulation-heavy game is not optimized to run on multi-core processors and will only use one core. This results in simulation speed and FPS drops after a certain amount of citizens in your town. The point of the game slowing to a constant crawl was reached at a population of around 1000 in my case (i7 5930K). This is quite late in the game though. Point of reference: The highest population achievement is 900.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI obviously enjoyed playing Banished and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who is interested enough to read through this review. It's a good game. Not great, but good.","August 3, 2015","true","104.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The citizens have their own names, houses, families, and places of work. They have children who grow up, go to school, then join the workforce. They grow old and die unless something else catches them first. There are many ways to lose citizens and that's where you come in. They need food, they need shelter, they need clothing and firewood for warmth; they need medicines and balanced diets for health. All of these needs are met by industries set up by you, the player, and you must manage your workforce effectively. You may build a dock and conduct trade for the things you need. There is no currency, you trade items you need for items you have in surplus of equal value. Natural disasters are in the game if you so choose. Tornadoes, fire, disease, crop infestations, early frost, among others.\n\nIf you like the idea of micromanaging on a small scale that eventually becomes a large fine tuned machine, or a chaotic train wreck of despair then this game is certainly something to pick up.

If you produce slightly more raw materials than your tailor uses (and if you don't keep an eye on this), your storage barns will eventually overflow with them, meaning there's no space for produced goods anymore. This is exaggerated when the clothing limit has been reached and the tailors stop production.\n\n- You cannot prohibit citizens from using certain goods. They will eat the wheat intended for your brewers to make ale and they will use coal instead of firewood to heat their homes if coal is stored closer to the market than firewood at that moment. (You need coal for steel tools). You also cannot limit selected stockpiles to only store certain goods, or a maximum amount of a specific good.\n\nThese are minor issues and there are ways to get around them, but it certainly isn't optimal.\n\n~ Variety: There's not a lot of it, except in food. There are very few building types and even fewer upgrades (one for houses). But hey, it works and there is enough to manage.\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n- Performance: This simulation-heavy game is not optimized to run on multi-core processors and will only use one core. This results in simulation speed and FPS drops after a certain amount of citizens in your town. The point of the game slowing to a constant crawl was reached at a population of around 1000 in my case (i7 5930K). This is quite late in the game though. Point of reference: The highest population achievement is 900.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI obviously enjoyed playing Banished and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who is interested enough to read through this review. It's a good game. Not great, but good.","August 3, 2015","true","104.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The citizens have their own names, houses, families, and places of work. They have children who grow up, go to school, then join the workforce. They grow old and die unless something else catches them first. There are many ways to lose citizens and that's where you come in. They need food, they need shelter, they need clothing and firewood for warmth; they need medicines and balanced diets for health. All of these needs are met by industries set up by you, the player, and you must manage your workforce effectively. You may build a dock and conduct trade for the things you need. There is no currency, you trade items you need for items you have in surplus of equal value. Natural disasters are in the game if you so choose. Tornadoes, fire, disease, crop infestations, early frost, among others.\n\nIf you like the idea of micromanaging on a small scale that eventually becomes a large fine tuned machine, or a chaotic train wreck of despair then this game is certainly something to pick up. There's plenty to discover and tweak just right to keep you trying new things.","February 18, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its not like a traditional simbuilder where you just keep an eye on income, but you have to keep an eye on literally everything your villagers do. It has a decent learning curve though and it is a very good example of "trial by error". It takes a few attempts to get a good village going, but you shouldn't let that stop you from trying again and again. It's very rewarding to notice you keep doing better and better at the game.\n\nOne final important piece to notice though is that this game will start to lag the larger your town becomes. Some people with bad computers will notice a slowdown after 500 inhabitants, I noticed a huge lag/slowdown at 1000 inhabitants. I recommend just playing on a medium map.\n\nDont expect a thrilling story or objectives and goals. This game only has two goals: expand and survive. It's a great game "to pass time".","February 6","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a vast array of building types, jobs for citizens and can be extremely engrossing.\n\nGraphically this game looks wonderful, small details here and there offer the world a lot more depth. Colours looks fantastic as seasons come and go, caking the landscape in snow or lush green hills.\n\nThe tutorial lays everything out for a newcomer to the series, though making sure you complete every single one provided is key to success.\n\nLastly this game includes mod support and some mods that the community has cooked up are really interesting but NOT required to enjoy this game since the vanilla version is extremely well done.\n\nProps to the developer and i look forward to future DLCs for games you release.\n\n10/10","February 17","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You look at people's hours and it's probably confusing seeing someone with 5 hours say they've made 10 cities and others have over a 100 hours and still be on their first city. There's a button that allows gameplay be at standard speed (I'd say roughly 20-30 minutes per year) and options from 2x, 5x and 10x (10x makes it a mere couple minutes.)\n\nNow what's unique about this is it allows those who enjoy all management style games to play at their own speed depending how much they like to control their 'resources'. If you are a relaxed gamer when it comes to the genre, such as myself, then you can easily stroll through the game controlling life in your city casually. It's slow enough too to where you can multi-task while playing, like I enjoy watching professional CS:GO on Twitch, so I'll watch that and have this game open and check on it once or twice a minute. If you're someone who wants stuff done right now, then the 10x mode is perfect for you. It's not like a speed demon mode or time trial, but it's definitely rapid gameplay for a management game.\n\nNow this game is on the harder side of management games, now I still recommend all ages for this game but to truly do well at this game you probably need some experience with other games of the genre. What's hard is once something goes wrong (resource depletes, natural disaster, etc.) then it's pretty much all over for your city. It's hard because it can be simply one resource that causes the downfall of the city, and it's not a common one like food or clothing that can ruin your economy or happiness of your city.\n\nThe main objective that I usually shoot for in this game is to simply grow my city and the number of citizens,  and that seems to be the only goal in this game. With that, you can set up your own personal goals and if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ then this game has some pretty difficult ones for you to get, especially if you're a relaxed gamer.\n\nA good pickup for the management gurus and a good one for the chill gamers.\n\nTopic: Strategy Simulation Management\n\nReplayabilityGreatPrice TagGreatWith friends?Not recommendedAge groupEveryoneDevsUnsure/Quiet\n\nSingleplayer10Community10Characters6Gameplay10Controls8Graphics8Sound7Strategy8Survival9Management10\n*Curator's pick for MANAGEMENT*\n\nScore: 86/100\n\nThanks for reading!

That being said, it would be better to call it a "Town-builder"; instead of games such as SimCity where citizens are given in the thousands, and their well-being can be negligable at some points, this game focuses on keeping them alive and thriving. Food, warmth, and resources are arguably the core concepts. There is no defined currency in the game; resources are used (wood, stone, food, iron, leather, tools, etc.) to construct buildings or to trade. When beginning, the game might seem overly-difficult and overwhelming, though after "mastering" the game it can become repetetive and lacking.\n\nPros:\nMostly original take on city-builders\nChallenging, but not challenging enough to ruin it\nvery few bugs\nfuture workshop support\n\nCons:\nBeginning can be daunting and frequent restarts are required\nlimited end-game content, expanding can become a grind for resources\n**Could be fixed when the workshop is introduced**\n","November 4, 2014","true","51.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a lot harder than I thought it would be, as unlike other medieval city builders which usually involve combat and enemies. In this game the only enemy is nature. Whether it be a bad harvest causing half of your population to starve to death, or an unexpected snow causing your civilians to freeze because you were unprepared and didn't have enough firewood. An outbreak of syphilis because you opened your city to nomads or you forgot to make room for extra population so your people stopped reproducing and then all died at once from old age, leaving useless incapable children which do nothing except drain your resources. Or of course a aggressive tornado rips through your city leaving nothing but rubble and ♥♥♥♥ing children..\n\nIt's quite a challenge and your city will probably die for your first few attempts but it's a lot of fun and I'd recommend it.\nThe game was made by one guy and that's impressive. 9/10\n\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","55.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However the second  winter was cold and dark and everyone froze solid.\n\nTown three: The village flurished and grew for many years. Unfortunately no one had a proper sex education and did not have families. instead they just grew old and frail until one day a group of immigrants came and took over the land. Many years later a tornado left a young child and a few elders stranded on an island with just enough resources to stay warm and fed for a decent amount of years. The elders died of old age quickly which left just the young boy to witness the rest of his village die from a ruthless epidemic. He could do nothing but watch all his friends and family die from his island just off the coast. The child starved after 7 years alone on that island.\n\nToronde: Toronde is currently a thriving village of 100 surviving off of its main export "fire wood".

Its not like a traditional simbuilder where you just keep an eye on income, but you have to keep an eye on literally everything your villagers do. It has a decent learning curve though and it is a very good example of "trial by error". It takes a few attempts to get a good village going, but you shouldn't let that stop you from trying again and again. It's very rewarding to notice you keep doing better and better at the game.\n\nOne final important piece to notice though is that this game will start to lag the larger your town becomes.

Hours after I've turned off the computer, I find that repeating tune stuck in my head.  God help me, I love it.\n\nAs of this writing, over 91% of the reviews are Positive, and there is good reason for that.  The game is a winner.  There are an almost infinite number of scenarios to choose from, with some childishly easy to succeed at (a good place for beginners to start), and the difficulties go all the way up to essentially unsurvivable.\n\nThe incredible number of MODs available to choose from in the Workshop also adds so much richness and variety to the game.  There is a HUGE Banished community growing and supporting the game and its MODS.  The one scenario that seems to disturb me most is the two settlers, Adam & Eve scenario - LOL, where brothers wind up marrying sisters, and then 1st cousins, etc.  Now, that's a genuine Uncle Daddy & Aunt Mama family tree.  Anybody on earth should find that hilariously funny, with no disrespect meant to Arkansans.... Bless their hearts.\n\nI've seen a few critical reviews that reference Sim City, and such, and if that's all they see here with Banished, they came in the door with the wrong expectations.  I own multiple generations of the Sim City series dating back to Win95, as well as, Cities XL, Cities in Motion, and so on.  Banished has little in common with those, IMHO.\n\nThe Banished player gets the chance to more closely manage resources and activities, and essentially 'craft' to build more complex structures, more sophisticated clothing, etc. (Hint - warmer settlers work more efficiently in harsh winters).  This is not a high pressure, can't go AFK for a coffee or bathroom break, kind of game.  So, settle in, relax, and enjoy.  For frenzied, Constant ACTION, Run 'n Gun players, there's always a Call of Duty server somewhere, right?!\n\nIn short, the Banished player chooses the region and number of initial settlers, as well as starting resources in the game menu.  The race is on to get sufficient shelter, food, and fuel (firewood/coal) before winter sets in.  When it gets cold, you won't see much production from the settlers.  The strategy you start with is up to you.  As for me, early in the game I prefer to focus on Gatherers and an Herbalist (the Healer) before that first winter.  I've had great starts where there were tons of firewood, food, etc., only to see everyone die off to sickness, because I forgot the Herbalist.  Another point I keep in mind is to stockpile absolutely every scrap of firewood, food, and medicine that you can lay hands on to the point of ridiculous excess, so that you can spare settlers to be teachers, preachers, and healers.  Sure, it sounds corny, but Education is important, since educated workers here simply produce more.  Be leery of nomads.  When they show up, they usually lack education, have scores of unproductive, hungry children, and invariably bring disease, so you better have a hospital.  The game never makes it clear what the disease is, but I suspect some nasty STD - LOL.  Again, no offense intended, Arkansans.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I had settlers dropping like flies, and sadly, my major concern seemed to be having a large enough cemetery.  But now, regardless of difficulty, I manage to keep things balanced enough that the only deaths seem to be from old age - as it should be.  I also highly recommend one of the Mods that change the passage of time to one actual year of gameplay for each year of the settler's life.  The default seems to be several years of life for each four-season Banished year.  When everything is stable for a moment, and little direct input is required, it has a great Fast-Forward x10 that moves things along until a point where more input is required.\n\nA satisfying moment for me is when I'm 8 or 9 game years into a scenario, and I have some of the original potatoes from the wagon in the barn.  That's when you know the food production is more than under control.  Anybody hungry for a 9 year old spud?  I'll pass!\n\nI bought Banished during an earlier Sale, so keep your eyes open for sales.  Frankly, for me it would be worth the money at full retail, so jump at the chance to buy it either way.  More than 91% of the buyers think you'll be glad you did.  I hope this was helpful.

Suinim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IllanreSuinim/","58 products in account","What is there to say about Banished that has probably not been said already?\n\nFirst, and foremost, Banished is a City Builder based upon the premise that you are in charge of the survival of the people. You tell them where to harvest resources and place buildings. What buildings to build and what jobs they must fulfill. This is not a necessarily easy game as it relies upon someone being able to predict the effects that the seasons will have upon your food as well as how many workers will you lose much less gain.\n\nBanished is, for the most part, one of the most realistic city builders that I have seen but I am also the worst to ask about city builders. I've only ever played SimCity, the old ones, and never really took the time to play the newer SimCities [I have a strong dislike for EA]. It touches a part of me that favors the more Medieval period of our history and plays true, for the most part, to how people would live during that time period. This, of course, means you have to handle diseases that would come from the risk of trading with other civilizations or groups. Realism is also pressed farther by the chance that you might hunt deer to extinction or fish the rivers clean. Crops require rotation to keep the soil going and the list goes on.....\n\nThe good parts of this game are also, perhaps, the parts I dislike the most however. When my village [As just happened while typing this review] decides to begin starving to death because I never took them to school there is no stopping the constant downward trend. I can place almost every villager I have upon food gathering but it doesn't make a lick of a difference until my once 80 people population turns into 26.  Those 26 also never seem to recover but I'm going to let them continue as my village also just caught fire because of someone apparently attempting to roast a roach [That is my guess, not part of the game].\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes. If only to support the one man team that put work into deveolping a realistic city builder that will create just as much joy, and pain, as it does for me.","March 2, 2014","true","35.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That is a good thing.  Normally after playing a typical sandbox city building game for an hour or so, you have the whole system figured out and can game the hell out of it so you can just let it autorun for an hour without any attention.  Banished is a harsh mistress and isn't just your run of the mill citybuilder.\n\nThere is a constant need to keep an eye on your town since the overall success of it all boils down to people.  Citizens can die from anything, from workplace accidents to old age.  The loss of just one person can set off a ripple effect that can wreak havoc on your village if you're not careful.\n\nThe graphics and sound design are pretty decent, seeing as this game came from what amounts to a one man studio.  Controls are simple and easy to use, and the guts of the simulation will keep you on your toes.\n\nProbably one of the best citybuilding sims I have ever played.  10/10","February 19, 2014","true","77.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're tasked with keeping your few followers fed, clothed and homed, gathering resources to expand and battling the elements and the terrain. This is much harder than it sounds like, as disasters in the form of disease or fire can hit without warning, nevermind more common occurrences like starvation or hypothermia caused by your mismanagement. All in all, an enjoyable game once you figure out how to grow and diversify your settlement a bit.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is how housing distribution is handled, and how little control you have over it. Your citizens will not have children unless they have homes of their own (i.e. adult children do not reproduce). This means that you will either have to constantly build more homes, or suffer devastating generation crashes every so often as widowed old people greedily demand a full household until they die, meaning you'll have fewer families and ultimately even more people above child-rearing age. A demographic disaster can be harder to recover from than anything else the game throws at you, save perhaps a wildfire scorching half your town. If you have a town hall and the ability to bring in nomad settlers, it'll be easier, but often the first pop crash happens long before you get that far.\n\nGiven that this is a survivalist game, though, overcoming such challenges is a large part of the game experience. The game does grow on you after a while, and the soothing, perpetual music urges you to continue for that little while more even when bedtime beckons.\n\nBanished is quite decent value for your money, all things considered - just expect some frustration as you learn how to cope with the many hurdles it can toss at you.","May 4","true","49.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is reminiscent of a wilderness version of the old (fill in the blank) Tycoon! games. If you liked those games, I would definitely recommend this game mostly because there aren't a lot of newer games in it's niche. I would recommend starting without natural disasters because at first struggling to move forward is hard enough (and slow enough) in this game without half your village burning to the ground. It's definitely fun once you learn the controls, but it wears off. The graphics seem good for a casual game, and the soundtrack sets a very immersive mood. The controls aren't that difficult to pick up on, and abundant descriptions help you learn as you go. Also the randomly generated geography is both entertaining and beautiful.\n\nCons:\nThere's a limit to how long you can play before you get annoyed/bored out of your skull. Commands take annoyingly long to complete. And when you have limited resources (Basically the entire time you play) you're basically watching people die while you wait a painfully long time for workers to collect/make a resource so that you can do something so that they won't die. Even in full fast-forward the game seems to take forever. It probably is a more realistic expectation, it just means that you spend the whole game scrolling around looking for something to do while you anxiously wait for something to finally finish.\n\nSome of the game mechanics are annoying. The merchant ships never have anything that you want, and the few things that you would want (different livestock for example) never arrive. You're supposed to be able to help prevent natural disasters with different structures in the game, but they don't seem to help much (wells don't seem to do much against fires, the sick people wander around outside the hospital and get everybody sick) And it feels like nobody is ever productive. Most annoying of all, Resouce production is stupid slow.","May 22","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's exactly what I thought of this game originally. Then, an update appeared on Steam. No idea what the update was but it reminded me of the game and thought I'd try it. 10 hours later and 4 maps later I finally managed to get to a self sustaining village of around 70 citizens.\n\nThe game is a challenge, resources are constantly under pressure particularly in the early stage and this is a micro managers dream. You need to shift your dozen or so citizens between various lines of production to stop the village from starving, freezing or without resources. There are a few mods available that make resource production a little bit easier, I used the iron and wood boost for a short while to prevent my city from dying out.\n\nI love city building games, my favourite being Cities Skylines and this game is a medieval city builder with some differences in gameplay which make it unique and make me want to recommend to everyone that enjoys any kind of city building game.\n\n10/10 would let guy get crushed by a rock again.","May 23","true","21.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is not much of a story to the game, so dont come in expecting to be thrown into a story while you build, you wont find that here. This game is a sandbox. Great modding community though. But its still a sandbox. And what keeps you going after you get the hang of the game is achievement hunting. So many failed towns, so many lives lost in the hunt. Let's take a moment of silence for all the abandoned towns that have perished trying to achieve the ultimate achievements. Alright. Thank you. Anyways.. Its a fun little game that if you love hunting them achievements, this game will keep you interested for a while, or if you love playing around with mods, this is also a thing that kept me hooked for the slow hours of the game. Personally, I love the concuction of the balance of the game, and in fact, I'm going to go play it a little bit more now, still hunting that one "have a town of 300 people" achievement. Keep running out of food for my people. Anyways, even with no multiplayer or Co-op I still reccomend the hell out of this game.

The basic concept is simple, a group of "Banished" people is sent to a harsh land, where they just have to survive, isolated from the rest of the world.\n\nDe facto, this is what this game brought up to the table, it`s just a town building game, there`s nothing more than that, just chill and see those little people thrive and develop on that given piece of land.\n\nIf you played and liked games like The Settlers franchise or Anno games from Ubi, this is a must play game. It is not  very beginner friendly due to a lack of tutorial, however, its mechanics are not hard to learn either, since the goal, aswell, is simple, you just have to SURVIVE, later on, once you get used to it, you may start getting into the "fancy" part of the game.\n\nIf, after some hours, you get yourself tired of the game, you should definetly try mods like Colonial Charter and New Medieval Town, wich add a lot of content, like chains of production and a bunch of new and interesting buildings and interactions. It is not an exageration to say these mods make a whole new game.\n\nIt is worth to mention also mods wich may change Vanilla mechanics, if you find yourself annoyed with them, like Aging or how Quarries and Mines work in the game.","August 28, 2015","true","117.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game hates you and your puny peasants so it always finds a way to kill you, even when you least expect it.  This one time I had 150 people and 60,000 food units stored, which seemed pretty good to me at the time. I decided to expand my foodonopoly by buying more different seeds and adding more crop fields. I split my chickens/cows/sheep to have my livestock increase. I had to keep building new barns to support my richness. I had 4 mines and 3 quarries, all working at full capacity. I FLOURISHED AND I WAS THE QUEEN AND EVERYTHING WAS JOLLY AS ♥♥♥♥.\nSOMEHOW the food storage plummeted down after I added more crop fields and farms. (which, uh, is supposed to do the opposite) My precious 60,000 sipped through my fingers into oblivion, despite population being pretty much the same. Despite having mor than enough people per crop field, they never managed to harvest things before late autumn (aka when everything DIES before you collect it) even though they always planted everything timely. I have no idea what happened. I am devastated and weeping.\nYet, I always feel the urge to go back and play Banished. Maybe Im masochistic. Maybe it's one of the best city builders out there. Maybe it's Maybelline. 10/10 would die again.","March 19, 2015","true","68.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","3","4","7","0"

While having similar aspects to games in the city building genre such as sim city or tropico it has a slightly different flavor the game is more focused producing the correct amount of resources and managing expansion instead of the normal produce as much resource as humanly possible. I still feel like this game is missing something, but even so its fun and relaxing to play.\n\nSpecific complaints there is no way to prioritize stock piles and/or set them to only hold certain resources which can be a giant hassle if you are trying to stream line a wood cutter. Laborers priority settings are lacking if they are out harvesting resources and you drop a house which has a tree on it they will not stop harvesting to remove the tree.

It takes elements from other games like  the Anno series and "Knights and Merchants" then rolls them all into one game minus the combat aspect. you start out slumming it struggling to get food and firewood for winter then work your way up to a massive town with over a 100 people. Good micromanagement is a must for this game. The graphics are also quite pretty. Getting to watch the seasons change and seeing how snows and ice affect the villagers in real time can be pretty immersive. I'm already very addicted.","February 19, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you were a fan of the early settlers, Anno, or Age of Empire Games, then this is for you!  Made by one person, yet still so much better than the supposed AAA games of the genre with 400 people working on it!\nIf your thinking about buying this; stop thinking and do so!  If you think there is even a chance you might enjoy this, there is a 99% chance you will!","February 27, 2014","true","39.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Your wife no longer loves you, your kids have shunned school in favour of working down the mines and some fat swine has inhaled all the vennison. It's just an inevitable slump into the cold light of day where you eventually starve to death, forgotten.\n\n[I love this game, but it does get harder and harder until you finally fail... so you know...]","June 18, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","1"
