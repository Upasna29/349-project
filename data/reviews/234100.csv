Lazy shovelware that is not worth playing at any price.\n\nGame plays very slowly with animations between each turn. Does not track used tiles (you have to do this yourself, on paper).\n\nNo option to use the tournament wordlist (i.e., no swear words).  No option to supply your own dictionary.\n\nAI is garbage.  Its only strength is perfect word knowledge.  It's easy to bait the computer into throwing away blanks and S's for low points.\n\nNo tools to help you improve your play, like a reviewer that recommends better moves.  Of course this would require a real AI.\n\nNo actual multiplayer.  Hotseat play is stupid and broken in a hidden-information game like Scrabble.\n\nIf you want to improve, there are better single-player  Scrabble programs and most of them are free.\n\nIf you want to play against many people, there are Scrabble games with real multiplayer and some of them are free.\n\nIf you want to play against people in your house, buy a Scrabble board.\n\nIf you want to spend $5-10 on a video game, there are much much better values for your money out there.","December 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","3"

In my opinion single player word games are fun. This is something simple and easy for me to play before bed to wind down for the day.  Oh yeah, if you put the difficulty on Hard the AI is a little crazy with words most people have never heard of....lol.","February 25, 2014","true","57.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

Seems to be stable and everything.  Nothing real wrong with it that I can find yet.  There are a few customizable rules.  If you're a fan of Scrabble, go for it.\n\nIf you don't know what Scrabble is, it's a board game about spelling words and scoring the most points for the best words.  Games on here that you may be more familiar with such as Bookworm, or DS titles such as Word Jong, were definitely inspired by the classic Scrabble.  It's a bit like a crossword puzzle that you build yourself, without the clues.\n\nI've been a lifelong fan of Scrabble and having it here on the computer without having to worry about tiles everywhere or getting out the old board is pretty nice, and I have an AI opponent to test myself against.","March 21, 2014","true","43.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

People who complain about the AI might have missed this, because the hardest AI setting is like playing the dictionary.  If there's a person out there who can routinely beat the computer on the hardest setting, I'd like to meet them.  And no matter the AI setting, the computer's responses are lightning quick.\n\nThe game has windowed mode and a slick presentation.  The only thing you could want for with this game (provided you like Scrabble) is multiplayer.  You can't even do multiplayer on a local machine.  But the thing is, I own a very nice real life Scrabble set, and when real life friends come over, we use the genuine article.  But EVEN THEN I have this software open in the background because of the convenient dictionary included in the game that allows you to type in a word and have it judged as a valid Scrabble word or not.\n\nSo this game wins in every aspect for single player, and acts as a perfect "Scrabble Word Judge" companion for playing the  physical board game with real life friends.","February 13, 2015","true","259.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tcondren/recommended/234100/","Tcondren","Tcondren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tcondren/","102 products in account","So I got all four board games made by this developer, decided to playtest each of them.\n\nDidn't know what to expect from this.  Never been a fan of Scrabble, never played it much, and no clue how you could put it on PC.\n\nSo I started it up, made a new game, and played Scrabble.  That's it really.  It's Scrabble on the PC.\n\nThe AI is a bit wonky in the way that it uses words that most people would never ever think of, the board looks quite odd with huge, tripple-dight points words on it mixed in with your own fairly unimpressive ones.\n\nBeyond that I really had no issues with it.  Just like the other 3 games they released, run, hit start, play.  That's it.\n\nThis would be recieving a negative review if I could rate the actual gameplay, but it's a love or hate kind of thing.  If you like scrabble, it's worth shelling out $10.","December 29, 2013","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
