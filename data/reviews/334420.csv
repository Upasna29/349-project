Like the starship Voyager, you jump from system to system trying to replenish limited resources, and along the way you meet alien lifeforms and learn new technologies that increase your chances of reaching home. I think the game aptly portrays the feeling of isolation in space, from the ambient soundtrack to the uneasy log entries of the protagonist, a lone astronaut who wakes from cryo-sleep to find himself far across the galaxy.\n\nHowever, in going from FTL to Out There, I seem to have traded one form of monotony for another. Drilling rocky planets yields iron to repair your hull, but landing on and leaving those planets costs additional fuel. Probing gas giants yields fuel necessary to travel from system to system, but orbiting those planets damages your ship's hull. If either resource (or oxygen) reaches zero, your session ends. Drill, probe, drill, probe. From my experience so far- about three hours- I'd say this routine forms the bulk of each session, which I personally find uninteresting.\n\nThere never seems to be enough space to really exploit the technologies you learn on most ship types. Each technology takes up one slot, and most of the ships I've seen so far have no more than a dozen total. Not to mention, around five of those slots will always be taken up by your most essential ship systems. In addition, each unique element / resource takes up its own slot regardless of how little you have of each, and some technologies require multiple elements for construction.  Keep in mind the technologies you learn each session are randomized, so you won't know which metals you'll need at the outset, either. Often I just didn't bother with technology so I could stockpile the three basic necessities, since each slot only stacks up to twenty, and you often need more.\n\nWhen you meet alien lifeforms, you're usually presented with a choice of Approve or Disapprove, but because you don't know the languages spoken, and because translated words don't carry over from session to session, you may as well flip a coin unless you're writing down all the words you learn on the side. The other events with choices feel equally arbitrary, though I acknowledge this was also built into the design of FTL and may not faze everyone.\n\nIn short, if the premise and feeling of the game are what interest you, and the above issues don't bother you, there's a good chance you'll enjoy Out There. If what you're looking for is mechanical depth and varied gameplay, I'd caution you to take a closer look before buying.","April 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 298 of 349 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","298","349","2","8"

In Out There: Ω Edition you play as an astronaut who has just woken up from cryogenic stasis on a journey from Earth to Ganymede, you quickly realise you've gone horribly off course and you're nowhere near your destination, you're out there. You must carefully manage your fuel, oxygen and hull in order to stay alive in an unexplored galaxy, along the way you will not only find remnants of the human race who have mysteriously vanished but you will also find alien races and alien artifacts never before seen by man. Out There: Ω Edition is a story about the survival of one man who is way out of his depth on a journey that shouldn't have taken place.\n\nThis game has a fair few similarities to FTL: Faster Than Light, in fact it's these similarities that made me buy the game, so you'll see me compare the two games a couple of times over the course of the review.

The biggest problem is that the game is 90% based on luck. No matter how good you are at the game, you always depend on luck to constantly find planets with enough fuel, iron and oxygen.\nJust be prepared to get frustrated a lot. For example even though you captured an amazing new ship, spent a lot of time discovering new technology, collecting the rare resources to build tech upgrades etc. etc. And then, bam, a random event makes you lose half of your fuel, and you end up in a solar system without any gas planets. Game over in two turns, and nothing you could do about it. This happens A LOT!\nUnfortunately, the devs don't wanna hear anything about it. check the forums, they wanna keep this game a game of chance, to somehow show you the "thoughness" of space travel or whatever. I think its sad, the game could be so much better and more skill based...\nI hope modders will fix it, like it happened with FTL.","April 6, 2015","true","7.9"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","65","79","4","2"

But in this title your chances of survival are 90% luck, 10% follwing an identical formula for the best chances at success.\n\nIt's a game about exploration and discovery. Yet it just rips you down again and again, forcing you to repeat from the beginning. Which is basically the same strategy for the first 20-30 stars anyway, and quickly becomes monotonous. The difficulty would be bearable if there was a huge amount of gameplay variation, but you'll find yourself seeing repeated events constantly after only a few runs. But realistically even though there are a lot of events that happen, at the end of the day no matter what happens it can only affect your fuel, oxygen and hull. Which ultimately limits the game.","May 19, 2015","false","10.1"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","54","64","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/334420/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","In 2014, developer Mi-Clos Studio released Out There, a space exploration title for iOS and Android devices. The game was a critical hit, winning awards and gaining rave reviews across the board, with praise for the game’s story and depth. Out There was commercially successful too, selling over 250,000 copies worldwide.\n\nNow the French developer released the acclaimed mobile title for PC, Mac, and Linux, with a wealth of new features and content available. Mi-Clos Studio is also making the new version, titled Out There: Omega Edition, free for any buyers of the original mobile-only build. Gamers who had yet to play the title now have the chance to encounter Out There beyond its mobile beginnings.\n\nOut There is a space-based roguelike, placing a single player into the role of an astronaut who has become lost in an unknown part of the universe. The astronaut must travel to different stars, collecting fuel, oxygen and mineral supplies to try and survive. The end goal is to reach a distant system that promises to reveal secrets about not only the astronaut’s destiny, but the fate of mankind. Players face a procedurally-generated journey from system to system, meaning that each playthrough is different.\n\nIt is all to easy to compare Out There to FTL: Faster Than Light, another space-based roguelike. There are, however, a number of differences between the two games. Most importantly, Out There is devoid of combat, and players will not face firefights against opposing spacecraft. Although this may make it seem like players are in for an easy ride, the opposite is true. Indeed, Out There may well be crueler than the Subset Games-developed title.\n\nOut There’s gameplay is entirely based around vulnerability and survival. Players are not able to rely on firepower to escape dangerous situations, and the bulk of the gameplay is instead focused around resource management. Keeping tabs on fuel, air, and hull stability is essential, with different elements repairing or refilling the Fuel, Oxygen, and Hull meters. These elements can be found by mining ore-rich planets to repair the hull, probing gas giants for hydrogen and helium for fuel, and landing on garden planets to refill oxygen supplies.\n\nIn a strange way, this means that the game almost plays out like the galaxy exploration mini-games of the Mass Effect series, particularly Mass Effect 2. As a result, if players found the planet-probing moments of Bioware’s series less-than-enthralling, then Out There might not be entertaining. The majority of the early gameplay is made up of three different proactive gameplay moments: sending probes for fuel, mining ore planets, and landing on garden planets. This worked incredibly well on mobile platforms, but home computer players may be left wanting more.\n\nThankfully, there is plenty to keep players occupied beyond the actual proactive gameplay itself. Out There plays almost as a minimalist adventure story, with text boxes revealing the inner thoughts of the astronaut and locations and events he discovers. Players will also be met with binary choices along the way, such as how to react to unknown creatures and objects in the void. The results can go two ways, rewarding players with additional material and items, or damaging the ship.\n\nThe additional items add even more tough choices for players to face. Each new module for the ship, such as shield generators to decease hull damage, takes up space in the cargo hold. Adding a new tool will mean there is less space for fuel, minerals, and oxygen. Players will have to make the decision about what elements must be dropped, and whether new modules are worth keeping over mineral supplies.\n\nThe player will also be given the chance to transfer over to new ships, abandoning the human-built craft for alien designs. These ships contain spacefaring tools of their own, as well as upgrades in cargo space – as long as the player is able to repair different parts of the alien vessel. Meanwhile, the player can also meet bizarre monoliths out in the void, granting players with new locations to discover and further developing the game’s story.\n\nIt’s not just alien craft that the player discovers, either, as Out There’s garden planets often contain life of their own. Mi-Clos has created a number of bizarre alien races for the player to make contact with. As the player meets and interacts with other races, they gain more and more alien vocabulary, and can slowly begin deciphering the unfamiliar language. Successful negotiations with sentient beings have their own rewards, with new items and the rare and vital Omega element, capable of fixing any of the three main ship components.\n\nThe brief meetings with alien races only intensify the feeling of isolation that Out There provides. Mi-Clos Studio’s title is incredibly successful in creating a sense of loneliness, meaning that every moment of contact with another race seems extremely important for the astronaut’s wellbeing. Out There nails down the idea of the cosmos being a dangerous and expansive void, which is lost all-too often in other spaced-based games. In terms of science fiction video games, this is 2001: A Space Odyssey to FTL’s original Star Trek.\n\nThe title has plenty of influence from science fiction of days gone by, particularly in terms of the graphical style. Out There has a pulp sci-fi feel, comparable to old-school sci-fi comics, and the vibrant color palette includes Hotline Miami-esque neon-soaked moments to create a varied and complex universe. It works well with the sparse writing, and marries brilliantly with the game’s ambient electronic soundtrack, created by Antichamber composer Siddhartha Barnhoorn. Out There’s music is gentle and unobtrusive, creating a deceptive calm.\n\nIt’s a calm that could be needed, however, as Out There does have the potential to frustrate. The cosmos can be cruel and unforgiving, and the random nature of the game’s universe means that a player’s skill will not always dictate success. Star systems will not always contain gas giants or garden planets, and an unlucky encounter on the way to another system could see severe damage done to the ship hull. If a playthrough is unsuccessful, however, it will not be long before players will want to start another, such is the desire to discover more of the game’s universe.\n\nOut There has translated to home computers with ease, taking on the extra content required in its stride. The title avoids a number of science fiction tropes, and the bold move to avoid combat mechanics gives Out There its own place in space-based video games. Although the gameplay itself may prove tiresome over long periods, the game’s story elements, sense of isolation, and soundtrack make Out There a more-than-worthwhile purchase.","December 13, 2015","true","5.4"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","43","51","4","2"

You've traveled "Out There." Its now up to you to explore a new galaxy and find your way back home. Out There: Omega Edition boils down to a combatless, inventory management game in a beautiful space setting with randomized solar systems and events. For your survival, you need to manage your cargo while maintaining fuel, oxygen and hull to stay alive. Its an easy and relaxing game to play, relying on mostly button presses with your mouse or touch pad. Death is permanent, but since the game is randomized, you'll have a personal story to tell each time you play.\n\nWhile exploring this strange new galaxy, you'll find abandon space ships that you can take as your own. You'll be required to take a look at your ship in order to manage your inventory with ship components and your cargo. To refuel, repair and oxygenate your spaceship you'll need to click and drag minerals from your cargo and drag them to the maintenance. Its just that simple. Each ship has different requirements for its hull and fuel. Most require helium or hydrogen for the fuel and iron for the hull. Helium will refuel the ship faster. The inventory is a grid and you can click an empty square on the grid to craft additional components from schematics that you'll find scattered throughout the galaxy. Components can also be dismantled for their minerals which is helpful when you abandon your ship for another one.\n\nMinerals stack up to twenty per square. Its odd in a way that twenty hydrogen takes up the same space as twenty platinum or iron. You have no weight limit either. Just a grid limit. Different ships have different grids. Smaller ships have less of a grid, but consume less fuel. I found smaller ships to survive far longer than larger ones strictly for their fuel consumption.\n\nOn your way, you'll encounter anomalies that will send you on quests, none of which I've seen through to the end, even after six hours of playing. They're always at the furthest reaches of the galaxy, like your ultimate goal. You'll also meet aliens in picture form and learn words to their unique language.\n\nWhile the solar systems get randomized or "rogue-like," the map of the galaxy isn't. Its the same galaxy time and time again. You'll encounter the same blue giants, red, yellow and white dwarves, black holes and super novas every time you play. Your ship has a radius that it can travel and if a system is in the radius you can travel there at the cost of fuel and oxygen.\n\nEach solar system can consist of random rock planets, gas giants, anomalies, garden planets and a star (or black hole). Even when you're in these solar systems you need to spend a set amount of fuel and oxygen to orbit and visit the locations. Everything amounts to a beautiful background scene with your ship over it. Again, its nothing fancy, but it does do a good job of a space ambiance.You'll never know what's in a solar system until you visit. Nor will your ship remember what was in a solar system. There is of course a ship component to analyze solar systems.\n\nGas giants are the most important, they're how you'll get precious fuel. Even visiting them will damage your hull. To get the fuel, you send out a probe and you're given a choice how big of a probe. The larger the probe, the more fuel you'll get. Always spend the maximum amount of fuel on a probe. Otherwise it will never return with enough fuel. Ever. The larger the probe, the easier it is to return damaged or get destroyed. You can easily repair anything broken with iron that you have on board. Even if a probe gets destroyed, you can recover its components and use iron to make a new one. Its a small price to pay to have more than enough fuel on board. Its a constant struggle in the game. You can probe over and over, but the yield will be half of your last attempt, making it ineffective.\n\nRock planets are how you obtain iron and other resources, but nothing feels as important as iron. To get the minerals you'll have to orbit the planet, then land. When you're done you'll have to take off and all  these procedures cost fuel and oxygen. Again, this is an inventory management game. When you're on the planet, you need to drill much like probing. Always use the largest drill to get the most yield.\n\nGarden planets are the most interesting. You can land on them to instantly replenish your oxygen, drill for different types of minerals, but more importantly, there's life here. You can speak with inhabitants and while they don't speak your language, you'll learn a word or two from them; even give them things or receive schematics or the Omega from them. This Omega is special and can be used to repair things amongst other interesting things further in the game. The garden planets have different minerals that are used for components most of the time.\n\nIn terms of components, some of them feel useless, but there are others like shield generators and wormhole generators that feel more useful. You can improve fuel efficiency and other things all through components. The only down side is some components require others, so that's two slots from your cargo used.\n\nWhen drilling or probing, you're forced to take or abandon things without having the ability to use my maintenance to fuel or repair your ship. It seems only logical that I deliver hydrogen straight from the probe to my maintenance, but instead I need to jettison something from a full cargo hold.\n\nIn terms of anomalies, those are abandon ships, quests or cubes. The cubes will replenish one specific thing whether its fuel, oxygen or your hull. They're very helpful and give you a reason to always live dangerously with low fuel, oxygen or hull hoping to find a cube. Visiting stars themselves will heavily damage your ship and it doesn't seem like there's a use for them unless you get a ship component that lets you fly through a black hole or harvest the power of a white dwarf or something. Other anomalies will wormhole your ship to a different solar system.\n\nWhen you get to each solar system, sometimes there's a random event will play out through text. Sometimes you're given a choice. Things like you're being attacked, do you hide or flee. Again, there is no combat, so your choice determines does your hull get damaged or do you expend extra fuel escaping? The game recaps what you've gained or lost. With everything playing out via text and the fact that you travel from one star to the next, Out There can feel like a single player board.\n\nThe game is beautiful, vivid, colorful backdrops of space, planets and other celestial bodies. It feels spacy with great ambient music and that's all you really need for any space game. Just give a feeling of isolation and gorgeous backdrops. Its a place you can sink a lot of time into.\n\nDepending how far you get, the game will shake things up a bit with hostile aliens that will conquer planets. You won't be able to visit these planets, making a tough game even harder with no difficulty settings.\n\nNow for the major problem that I had, your ship has a radius that you can only jump so far in. About 30 minutes into each play through, I'd come across dead end after dead end. The galactic map never changes, so you can remember your route and where not to go. You need to start relying on random luck to find schematics for worm hole generators or anomalies that will randomly teleport you to places. This makes the game feel unbeatable unless you have luck. Back tracking seems like a brutal death sentence.\n\nFor anyone that can get into the game, its a good, relaxing time sink that will keep you playing again and again. There's so much here, but unless you can find a new ship or efficiently manage your fuel, you'll be doomed. That still won't stop you from continuing to explore the outermost galaxies of Out There. I'd like to thank Delphine and Plug In Digital for my copy of the game.","April 9, 2015","true","8.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

You have just been thrown into some random star system and your only task is to get to this other, equally random star system in your laughable spaceship. On the way there, pick up upgrades, mine more resources, and meet the locals but try to not get eaten by them. Avoid being stranded in space as you run out of fuel or suffocate in the endless expanses. That's the premise of the game. It's a combination of FTL's spaceship customization but with a much heavier focus on the storyline which serves to be the centerpiece for this game.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSilence is Golden....\n\n(+) Storyline - The storyline is beautifully written. Each time you play and fail and trust me you'll fail a lot, the events you get will be different. What choices you pick will determine what happens to your poor vessel. Exercise some common sense or not because finding out all the ways to die is part of the fun.\n\n(+) The Aliens - Each habitable population that you meet has a vocabulary that changes each iteration but fear not, as you progress in a campaign you'll slowly learn what they are saying. 'No don't give those worms hydrogen fool! Ok let's get out of this planet while we can. Let's look at the bright side, we learned what thb\e word death is in their language and all it cost was these subsystems and hull sections!'\n\n(+) Ship Customization - There's a plethora of ship upgrades to stick on your ship from improving fuel efficiency to shielding during atmospheric landings. Stick the upgrades to the basic modules for an adjacency bonus. The tutorial didn't explain that but I later found out so I'll share it with you guys for reading this far. :)\n\n(+) Resource Management - Gone all the days you can stick 64 stacks of ships, food, tonnages of metals, people, livestock, etc into your pocket. There's a very limited amount of space on each ship that you get. You'll need some space for backup resources to repair your modules and to fuel your ship. That same space gets occupied by cool new techs you'll want to make your ship better. It's a fine balancing act and the game honestly does force you to make tough choices there.\n\n(+) Visuals - The backgrounds to each planet look gorgeous, especially for the volcanic planet.\n\n(+) Price - I can't even buy a large sandwich where I live for $9. For the amount of narrative and gameplay you get, it's definitely worth it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n...but it's maddening as well...\n\n(-) Lack of 'Action' - Ok this one isn't a bit fair but it's more of a warning. Incase you didn't read the game's description, i'll state it one more time - THERE'S NO COMBAT. It's not FTL so don't expect FTL. If you like reading and playing through old-school adventures then this is the game for you. If you're studying for the future starfleet command then you're playing the wrong game.\n\n(-) Tooltips - I tried googling too but some things such as a ship's power, ecosystem,  and resistance. What do they mean? Oh there's an adjacency bonus? I wish the game told me. Some ship upgrades give you a qualitative description of their boost but I want to know the exact numbers please.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, it's a gem for those who like an adventure game that has rogue-like survival elements. The game might get a bit repetitive once you've figured out how much in backup supplies you should carry to reasonably get to the next fueling point but there or once you've read through all the possible ingame events.

These are as follows:\nTravel to the nearest solar system to the bottom-right, and pray that you can reach a yellow system before your oxygen runs out.\nWait for five-second travel cutscene to play out, every single time. (And disable it in the menu after the third jump.)\nHandle whatever random event the game throws at you by selecting one of two-four options, most of which will either drain or supply a varying amount of your three resources, or warp you to the other buggering side of the galaxy.\nDepending on which of your 0-100 resource counters is lowest, warp to either the gas planet in the system (if your fuel is low) or the rock planet (if your hull strength is low). If your oxygen is low, and you're not in or adjacent to a yellow system, you're dead; hit the convenient 'give up' button and return to step 1. If you still have enough resources to make each little hop, and your equipment isn't fried from the random event you get warping into the system, then congratulations; extract your resource of choice and hope that the RNG gives you more than the resources you spent to get there.\nJump out of the system with whatever generic resources you managed to eke out, or the vain hope that you'll be able to scrounge some in the next system. Repeat.You will perform these actions, most of which take about 5-6 clicks; "are you sure you want to spend the 6 fuel/3 oxygen to take off from the planet, even though you have no other means to proceed in the game, and if you can't afford that you're dead anyway?", for the rest of the game. Ultimately, you're hoping that when the starmap finally lets you reach a yellow system and land on the garden planet, that you can somehow guess correctly from the gibberish the alien there will spout at you and get a technology/vocabulary unlock and some of that cheaty-filler-'we-made-this-game-too-miserly'-element sweet sweet "omega" element. These three things are the only way you can make the game any easier; though you're still going to be relying ultimately on the beneficence of the RNG. I'll cover these in particular, as (aside from the plot which you will never get lucky enough to progress in) they're the only bit of gameplay you're going to get.\n\n1. VocabularyEvery time you try and contact life on a garden planet (the most reliable way to progress), and in some of the random events entering a system, some of the words will be gibberish until you randomly unlock translations; all of them with alien contact, some of them during the random events. Until you've survived long enough to be randomly awarded enough linguistic acumen to be able to guess-the-blanks, you won't know if the alien you're talking to is asking for a pinch of hydrogen or is accusing of being the spawn of satan. Don't worry though, he won't have a gun or pose any real threat to you; unlike the random event where you come across a giant space-box with nothing but "Gizzelthorpe" written on it and you'll have to guess whether it'll repair your hull or feed you to the giant space-kraken.\n\n2. TechnologyYou ever wanted a shield generator, so you didn't take so much damage trying to scoop up a little fuel, and could maybe save up enough iron to repair your telescope? Here, have three schematics for upgrades that you already need to have the shield generator for, and oh by the way the same random event also erased your schematic for the fuel probe. Why/how did that tooth-worm alien thing give me a schematic for blowing up systems into black holes? you may ask; Why would I ever want to do that, when I can't get anything from black holes and they still need fuel to travel to?, Why does it only cost two iron and a gold nugget to build? I don't know. But you will get this as your first piece of technology, five games in a row, while you exhaust your last bit of fuel warping into a neutron star.\n\n3. OmegaThis is apparently the coolest little element in the game, which half of the aliens you talk to will chuck at your feet faster than you can say donde es el bano. Congratulations, you can now spend the next ten jumps gripping it with white knuckles and trying not to spend its juicy 25-fuel-oxygen-or-hull bonus while wondering why you can't just get a single damn mote of cobalt to build that engine upgrade you need. Eventually, you will be out of options, and you will use it. An alien will give you another, and you'll do the math and realize that it doesn't even cover the cost of warping into the system, landing on the planet, and taking off again. But hey, if your drill needs repairs and you can't find any iron, at least you can spend the most valuable resource in the game to fix it.\n\n\nWhy am I here? Are we alone in space? Is there a god? Did this really have to be a 3-click operation? Out There will make you ask all these questions and many more; like "why does getting attacked by a blob of anti-matter hurt less than orbiting a gas giant" and "is this game in early access or something?". And in truth; there's a lot of neat stuff in this game. It's mostly a shame that you don't get to sit back and appreciate it because the gameplay is so blandly frustrating.  I think the best way to approach this game is as a shiny graphic novel, interrupted intermittently by by route gameplay.\n\nThis game is kind-of disappointing, but I'll probably spend a few more hours cursing at the Ansible upgrade, What alien space fleets?! I haven't SEEN any godamn spacefleets!, before I give up entirely.","May 26, 2015","false","4.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","18","20","4","1"

Loved FTL and the description of FTL without the combat sounded great.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't come through with any of the depth that FTL had.  It's got atmosphere, absolutely, but that atmosphere is thin and evaporates quickly.  The only way it's a roguelike is in permadeath.  There's not enough variety for me to really consider it a roguelike.\n\nThe biggest downfall is the ships.  You start out with a bucket of crap, which is fine and to be expected.  If you're lucky, you might wander across one other ship before the game gives you the second-best ship for free as an auto-reveal plot point.  There's maybe seven or so other ships in the game, but only two of them are actually better than the bucket of crap you started with...which is completely underwhelming.  The firefly, even though it has zero free space, is fun to tool around and explore in simply because everything is so easy -- it's such a relief after the slow-going of the other ships that it can make the game quite fun for a little while.  Otherwise the only major difference is the amount of cargo space.  Even with the biggest ship (21 spaces), you're still going to be very short on space.  If the ships had been at least minimally interesting, I would've enjoyed the game a lot more.\n\nSynergy - while not explained at all - is very important.  If a tech 'requires' another tech, placing it next to the 'required' tech improves the efficiency (giving a blue outline).  Which means less fuel/o2/mining!\n\nThe writing is sometimes interesting, but very much amateur hour sci-fi schlock.  Tons of spelling mistakes and awkward transitions.  Every time you warp to a new star, you get a random blurb/encounter.  After going through almost all the stars, I was still seeing new ones, which is something.  If the writing was a bit better, it would be a reason to keep going.  Unfortunately, it's not.  They don't ever really add to the very minimal story.\n\nDrilling/probing should always be done at 10/10.  Ignore the super mining/super probing tech, they're not worth the space or effort.  Get your tech from the alien encounters as soon as you can.  Certain species will always ask "approve" others will always ask "disapprove."  If you choose correctly you can get tech and new words.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the first couple of hours of learning the game.  But it gets old very quickly.  There's not much diversity in things to do.  The tech is shallow, ships are beyond shallow, and the map is far, far too large for how little there is to do.  Get it on sale/bundled.  Do not rush to get it.  Still fun for a bit if you really like the genre.  If you do get it, do yourself a favor and copy your save file before you do one ending so you reload it and complete the others.","December 9, 2015","false","14.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

There is no combat, it’s you against the environment. Strong story elements tie this game together with choices that matter, gorgeous art, high replayability, and management mechanics.\n\nBreakdown\nThis review is written with 8 hours in the PC version (2 hours in beta and 6 hours in full release), plus another 2 hours on the mobile version. I've avoided any major story spoilers.\n\nArea        Rating        Notes                Story        9        The strongest part of the game in my opinion, Out There constantly provides you with short story text describing your journey. Developers state there are 350+ unique text adventures, many with multiple choices with different outcomes (also the choices can be different depending on certain criteria). These are often interesting as it explains a sci-fi event, or reflections of your character as they struggle with their predicament. Some key events are repeated with each playthrough, but with 4 different endings to discover there is a lot of story to get sucked into. The game now also has an opening cutscene of a high production quality, it's nice and short, and gets the story across well.                Gameplay        8.5        The gameplay of Out There can be split into a few different areas but all revolve heavily around decision making. One major area is the management of your ship including what resources to carry for fuel, oxygen. However you need to choose whether building certain components are worth taking more storage space in your ship (ie less fuel to carry for emergencies). Decision making also shines through in the many encounters you have in the game. An example of this is you encounter a cage in space with a creature raging inside of it, do you free it, obeserve it, or leave it. Each has a different outcome. Without giving too much away, there are languages to learn, technologies to use, and ships to board, giving you plenty of unique situations and choices.\n\nThe game can be quite punishing if you don't plan ahead, for example "I'll be find doing one more jump, there will be fuel in the next system", but what happens if there isn't fuel there? It took me a few attempts to understand the balance the game requires to progress further into the system. I've now figured some effective strategies which is making the game even more enjoyable.                Graphics        8.5        The game uses gorgeous artwork for planets, galaxies, spaceships, and planets with extra effects to make the planets rotate, etc. The artwork is gorgeous, especially the artwork for planets, I have often found myself staring at them and looking at all the details.                Sound        8        The game uses minimal music to create the eerie atmosphere in out space. There can often be times of silence, which deepens the sense of loneliness. The score is created by Siddhartha Barnhoorn (Antichamber, The Stanley Parable). Other sound effects are using for discovering items, refueling, etc and work well.                Replayability        9        Even after 8 hours, I'm stilling finding new encounters and have only finished one ending. There is plenty to do as it can take a few attempts to understand how things can work, and it's that sense of discover that drives further exploration. The galaxy you travel through is also procedurally-generated for each playthrough, so don't expect the same encounters at similar planets. The game is great value for the price it's sold for.                Multiplayer        N/A        This game does not feature any multiplayer. You can compare top scores with friends however.                Overall        8.6/10        Out There provides a unique experience of surviving the elements and fighting with loneliness in outer space. There is no combat, it’s you against the environment. Strong story elements tie this game together with choices that matter, gorgeous art, high replayability, and management mechanics.\nGameplay Videos\nI've been producing a let's play series which covers my playthroughs of Out There.

It's got upgraded resolutions and more possibilities, and the base of the gameplay is still a bunch of fun. It's no level of FTL, as it's definitely a lot more simple. I do wish a tiny bit more of variety in the first couple of moves, but in the end, there is a lot of variety when the game opens up, and you learn little by little how to take advantage of things.\n\n+:\n-Addictive nature, one more run kind of gameplay.\n-Lots of variety and opens up as you get further and further into galaxies.\n-Upgrades all really serve different gameplay styles and there's reason to choose different upgrades depending  on your situation.\n-Visuals do the job well.\n-Like the language options as you find more races, you learn more and maybe can answer their questions better.\n-New ships always feel like a relief and are mixed in reasonably well.\n\n-:\n-When things go wrong, things go wrong.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/334420/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Space is a lonely, distant place, especially when you're... out there...\nFTL did raw panic, and the sheer urgency of a space based roguelite. Mi-Clos's approach to the genre, and indeed the space based roguelite is to go quite literally in the opposite direction. You do not have time constraints as such, as long as you can keep yourself fuelled, repaired and stocked with oxygen you can bumble around the galaxy as much as you like. Instead, what it provides is a sense of overwhelming scale, and of loneliness. This game is crafted around an uncaring universe, a mind-boggling huge, and often lonely place.\n\nStart at FTL, turn left at the first jump...\nThe similarities between this and FTL are entirely superficial, you have jump points that you work between, like a spiders web, and jumping between them will burn resources. Like in FTL there's a slew of different spaceships, all with their own idiosyncrasies. That's where the similarities end though, there is no crew in this game, there's only you. There are no weapons to speak of, there are some terraforming tools and a planet killing device which can radically alter the story, but those are special case items. There's no combat, instead you're evading the enemy as you work towards whatever destination you head to, there are no merchants to buy supplies from, instead you're mining and scooping resources and fuel as you go.\n\nYou construct your own devices which are then installed into your ship, each device eats up precious cargo space that could be given over to fuel (which you will go through rapidly), repair metals (which you will also go through fairly rapidly) and oxygen (which you will go through less rapidly but you'll come across less often). The game is finely balanced and often you'll find yourself a few jumps away from disaster, where a few bad judgment calls in a row will see your game ended.\n\nAnd it's not just your ship that is out to kill you...\nEven more critically, you start each game with zero knowledge of the alien language, which is randomised each time, so you will learn the words of importance with each encounter, gradually building up your auto-translator and being able to answer their queries and make trades with them as you go further into the galaxy. The very first encounters where you're stumbling over a few words and having to take almost blind guesses based on the positions of the words "Love" "Hate" "Death" or "Life" can often lead to unintentional hilarity.\n\nI'm flying through the golden age of comics...\nThe presentation in this game warrants special mention. Both the graphical design and sound presentation are literally off the scale. The graphics are presented in this retro sci-fi comic book approach, with everything done out in this comic book presentation of how space would look as if it were presented in a late 60's / early 70's era comic book The ships, planets, alien races, are all lavished with attention and the environments are spared no expense when it comes to the love and care that's gone into them.\n\nThese are places you -want- to visit, time and again. Furthermore the soundtrack that layers on top of this is easily up there with FTL as one of the most suitable and listenable in the genre, it really conveys the loneliness of being in deep space, of being alone in an alien galaxy and trying to find your way with precious few resources and fewer allies. This eerie, sweeping soundscape is of such a high standard I actively recommend buying the OST alongside the game.\n\nA place you'll lose yourself in time and again...\nDeeply replayable, tough to the point of occasionally being unforgiving, but always rewarding with new, gorgeous planets, and amazing encounters, along with starships designed with as much love and care as the comic book spaceships of old. This is a game that if you loved FTL, you simply cannot afford to pass up. It deserves your attention if you have any love of the roguelite genre at all, and it's a great place to start even if you're fairly new to these types of games.\n\nVerdict : Essential, especially for the soundtrack, and especially for fans of FTL","May 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","6"

The game starts you off with an inciting story and the transition from tutorial to actual game is done without any interruption making the game flow well. As a strategy management game it's pretty minimalistic... but that will make it easier for new players to get into... obviously it's roguelike game so dying means starting all over. The visuals and sounds are pretty unique and appealing in they own way... but as a 2D space exploration game it will lack the immersion that other 3D space games offer(like Kerbal Space Programs)... the story elements where pretty funny, however the choices weren't really part of the in-game "context"... making them feel more like a flip of a coin... rather than a decision based on actual calculations. All in all it is a pretty half decent game. I did make a let's play/first look video of it, if you want to check it out before getting it, right here:  https://youtu.be/kmQbb4JElGI   .

One jump by five can kill you in many way than I can't enumerate it. You'll never have some help, tips, nothing.

When you do, prepare for some inventory managment so you can stock up!\n\nIn the screenshots, the game seems like your main focus would be exploring strange new worlds, encountering life. And at some point in the game, maybe this does happen. But in my 2 hours of playtime, I couldn't manage to get past the first 10 or so galaxy hops. All this game was, in my experience, is drilling planets for materials, probing gas planets for fuel and hoping to the Random Number God that the game would bestow a planet with oxygen at some point so I didn't asphyxiate. Too many of my playthroughs ended simply because the game didn't randomly give me a planet with fuel, or a planet with oxygen. Reading the forums and guides, I do not see how I could have played differently; the game just didn't spawn what I needed, so it was a lost game no matter my choices. DYING TO RNG IS NOT FUN.\n\nThe game also has another false choice -- in the beginning, when drilling or probing for materials, the game presents a prompt for how deep you want to go, out of a scale of 10, where the higher number gives more of a chance of your tools breaking. Unless you knew ahead of time, you will waste you time until you find out that you ALWAYS, no matter what, go 10 out of 10. Repairing the tools is less than trivial, so 10/10 is always optimal. If you don't, you simply just waste more fuel and get less materials.\n\nOnce you find this truth, the beginning game is monotonous -- you simply hop galaxy to galaxy, consuming planets like Galactus, waiting until the game starts to throw some random event so you can actually start making any sort of decisions. By this point, I was too bored. You still have to hope that the game spawns what you need and doesn't just not give you oxygen until you die. I'd rather have more agency determining the outcome of my run.","July 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I was sure I'd like it based on what I'd read on Rock, Paper, Shotgun, which is why I bought it at launch, but it's more of a chore—one frustratingly sabotaged by luck—than a fun or exciting adventure.\n\nYou spend all of your time juggling resources.  You'll sacrifice, for example, fuel and hull for the chance to pick up some oxygen at the rocky planets you come across as you travel along the line of stars between you and your ultimate destination.  You'll keep finding rare elements like tungsten and platinum that you can't use for anything until you discover relevant technologies, but they leave you annoyed at the lack of space in your cargo hold.\n\nYou'll meet an alien who gives you the mysterious omega element and decide to throw away your highly common silicon to make room for it, and immediately afterwards you'll chance upon a random event in which robotic termites eat your space folder, leaving you stranded.  If you only had some silicon, you could have repaired it.\n\nThere's clearly a story simmering in the background.  You encounter all kinds of zany alien life forms, and a lot of them try to communicate with you.  You gradually pick up some language that might help you to make decisions during these interactions if you actually have a run that lasts long enough, and they're all worried about judges or architects or something.  The writing is the sort that makes you feel like it thinks it's good, like it's really got something to say, but it's actually cringe-worthy much of the time—and badly in need of proofreading, as well.  Here's an example:\n\nDay 63 _\n\nLet's say I find a magic lamp drifting in space and it allows me one wish. What would I wish for?\n\nI must admit to a craving for sausages. Maybe I could return to Earth, but discretely, so I can have some sausages without needing to tell my story a thousand times.\n\nNo... My wish would be to find out what I really want.\nThat's terrible, right?  Come on.  It's hard to care when the writing is that bad.\n\nSo there's really nothing compelling me to continue playing this.  I guess I'm curious to see what it's like to have a nice ship decked out with a bunch of tech that makes life easier, collecting rare elements and building interesting new devices, but getting there is a matter of pure luck.  There's no progress between runs that helps your goal to seem more plausible, either.\n\nEverything that I manage to discover before inevitably running out of fuel after desperately traveling to the nearest fuel-rich gas giant that the game tells me on arrival has nothing left to probe—all of the technologies and new ship types (with their ample, blessed cargo space) that I've found along the way are gone.  I haven't unlocked anything that makes the crapshoot of space travel more manageable next time.\n\nOne of the game's selling points is that it has no combat; it's just you against the environment.  Well, maybe if it did have combat I'd actually feel like I have some control over what happens.  The idea of a game without combat appeals to me!  But it needs to be better designed than this.\n\nOut There is no FTL.  There's no real strategy that you can employ as you play to have a greater chance of success.  In the moment-to-moment gameplay, it's just dull, while in the grand scheme of a full session it's frustrating.

The art style is bold and nice to look at.

You'll want to explore all the weird wonders this game has.\n_Good writing: Can be a bit pretentious, but nice and well-written otherwise.\n_Great resource management: There's always a compromise at every turn. Everything that goes on is a trade in this game. You're trading space for material, trading materials and space for usable ship parts, as well as fuel and oxigens; and, worst case posible, you're trading in parts of your ship for materials to use during emergency. It's managed to be very intense and thought provoking.\n\nCons:\n_Techno-Babble: Sometimes the game will use terms that you won't understand. Sometimes the game will have an entire paragraph that you won't understand.\n_Can be slow: As with any game that is more focus on discovery, the game can go on long stretch without much happening.\n\nPros/Cons:\n_Has no combat: Your ship doesn't have any guns on it, at all. This doesn't matter, because the resource management is the crux of the game's tension and conflict. Whether this is good or bad, depends solely on how you feel about that.\n\nIs it worth 10 bucks?

You move from star to star, planet to planet exhausting fuel, oxygen and hull integrity. It's up to you to drill and probe the many different planets in order to keep progressing. This game is difficult, simply difficult. Your objective is to reach the end star.

The scenery and soundtrack are both enjoyable and engrossing, while the challenge of surviving alone in an indifferent universe will engage you for many hours.\n\nWhere the game fails however is in the execution of the resource management and randomized systems. Limited cargo space makes stockpiling difficult, while the sparsity of gas giants for fuel makes it all but impossible to actually net fuel in the long run. I've had games where I had 3 stacks of stockpiled fuel and a full tank and I lose anyway because the next series of systems I visited had no sources of fuel. Games. Plural.\n\nIn 30+ games I've yet to get more than halfway to the target systems at the far end of the map and that was only because an event teleported me much closer (only to leave me stranded because I didn't have the jump distance systems to get out of the cluster). I can understand some difficulty, but the journal entries, encounters, and events start feeling stale and repetitive after seeing them the second or third time in a playthrough because you've not gotten that golden game where everything goes right.\n\nThis is compounded by some UI oddities that stem from the game's mobile origin. Lack of many simple shortcuts makes for tedious management of things. To get more fuel you send out the Hydrogen Probe and it returns with whatever it found. Rather than being able to put it directly into your tank from this screen, you have to switch over to the ship view and drop it into the fuel tank there before switching back over to the planet screen to probe for more fuel. Rather than a button to empty everything from a probe or drill or double clicking to transfer to cargo, everything is drag and drop or rightclick to select transfer to cargo (then watch the game drag and drop it for you, meanwhile you can do nothing but wait for it). Normally these wouldn't be an issue in a game, but when you're doing this a dozen times at every gas giant you go exploring for fuel, it gets massively tedious.\n\nAbandoned ships you encounter are often side-grades from the shuttle you start in. The few ships that are larger have oddties or are in need of serious repairs before you can use the extra space they afford; the few ships that are smaller only amplify the resource storage problem.\n\nThe technologies you find are interesting to find but don't help much and are an uncommon find if you don't get lucky with finding the right tech and the resources for it. The new modules save a small portion of your resources by taking up space where you could have stored them in the first place. I imagine finding three or four would actually make for a much more efficient ship, but again the problem is luck in finding them.\n\nI will likely continue to play to try to find some closure for the plot, but as it stands for me I don't hold much hope of ever finding it. Such is the drawback of random generation and encounters: Some players don't get lucky.\n\nDespite these flaws it is a solid game of exploration and resource management. I encountered no bugs or glaring issues while playing. If you enjoy exploration and atmospheric games, grab a touchscreen and this will be an enjoyable experience for many hours.","June 18, 2015","false","18.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

For example when you use your drill or probe it's like looting and you get random loot popping up, say 3 or 4 things. To take them you have to drag them with left click from loot box to your inventory or right click each one and select to take it from the context menu. There is no -loot all- button. When you want to add a resource to your oxygen, fuel or hull you have to drag it across too. There should have been a one click button to fill your fuel, oxygen and hull, each one separately or all at once.\n\nThere are also issues with being forced to do something -right now- or lose the chance. An example is using a probe and not having room to loot everything from it, but the game won't let you take the resources in your hold and transfer them to your fuel, oxygen or hull: you have to dump stuff overboard or else you'll lose everything you looted in the probe.

I know this game is suppose to have an element of chance to simulate the harshness of space; but when 9 times out of 10, you either run out of fuel or hull material, or just wind up stuck someway because you encountered a chance scenario that breaks your space folder and drill and you have no material to fix it and you can't drill for any (this happens surprisingly often). There is a problem with the game that doesn't allow your choices to ultimate determine how far you get.\n\nThere is no strategy because in order to even survive, you must drill or probe very conservatively, meaning you must only use as little fuel as possible while mining for as much resource, fuel and hull repair specifically. I've gotten farther on some attempts vs others but when 5 out of 6 sides of your dice ends the same way, it becomes tedious and I no longer want to  play. In other words, when your game isn't allowing me to have fun, when every turn ends the same way despite the choices I make, there is a problem. I have encountered so many no win / stuck scenarios - and this happens the further you progress. Everything depends on chance in a way that is unfair and unfun rather than being unexpected and challenging.\n\nI've beaten FTL several times, don't get me wrong, I've died 10 times more than I've survived, but NEVER did I feel like my choices didn't impact my result - sure chance situations occur, but my cumulative choices in those situations still allowed or disallowed progression.\n\nI still think this game can be fixed with an update where they allow changes in difficulty and altering gameplay mechanics in the options menu. Also allow for the ability to create fuel and hull material using other materials (this may be currently allowable but after 10 playthroughts I still haven't experienced it). OH and please add a Move all resources to cargo button when probing or drilling. and/or keyboard hotkeys for pc. Thanks\n\nBut until then, your game might as well be telling me to simulate space by putting a plastic bag over my head.","July 18, 2015","false","25.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Music's fitting, SFX are nice and in time, if a bit scarce. Tad generic, but everything works pretty well.\n\nOut There is a game that looks decent. The occasional stunning view or the very nice intro are counterbalanced by the general hand-drawnness of the game (nothing against that style, I just think it doesn't work very well in this particular game). The text boxes and the fonts also look wrong, maybe overly clean, maybe too much spacing to the sides, maybe it's the artificial feel of the fonts. At any rate the game is kinda irregular throughout but when it works it works, I just think it falls short of the style they were obviously aiming for.\n\nOut There is a game that reads pretty nicely, the random tidbits on arriving to a new system tend to be pretty entertaining to read.

Most times those text messages are just elaborate ways to tell you you've lost something, so pretty soon you'll be skipping over them and get the non-verbose "here's what you lost this time" message. Other times you won't understand whoever you're talking with, and through trial and error you'll finally be able to understand what they're telling you. I think it's a neat mechanic on paper but that alienates the newer players and gives an advantage to veterans. I tend to have problems with mechanics that work like this.\n\nOut There is a game that in paper sounds great: you start on a ship with hull, oxygen and fuel. Traveling costs fuel and oxygen. Approaching certain bodies will cost you hull. Different ships take different elements for each of those, and you can get the elements strewn across the 3 main kinds of planet: rocky (metals), gas giant (fuel) and breathable, where you can also interact with other races. You can build modules with those elements as well, and there's also a variety of random events, including derelict ships you can take for yourself, peppered across most of the systems you'll go to.\n\nOut There is a game that manages to kill all of the previous due to what I think are really sloppy late-cycle decisions that constantly remind you how much more fun you'd be having with the game if the main source of difficulty weren't incredibly obvious arbitrary restrictions aimed squarely to kill you faster. Now, when I say "arbitrary restrictions" I don't mean the ones that come along with the systems the game chooses to base itself off, such as the tile based inventory. If anything, a tile based inventory feels more at home with this game than many others: after all, you can tell me you have 16 universal, fixed compartments on your ship that can only be occupied by one resource and I'd be cool with it without even asking why there doesn't seem to be barrels in space. I can sorta roll with it. If the game played fair.\n\nYou see, through the game you'll constantly catch yourself thinking "wait, I can't do this now?": have you just looted a lot of fuel but your cargo hold is full? Tough luck, buddy! No, you can't transfer the fuel directly to your reservoir. You can't transfer the fuel that's in your cargo hold either, despite being totally fine anywhere else outside of the loot screen. No, you can't just exit the loot screen and go back to it after arranging your cargo. Do you have the one single unit of silicon to craft a module? You need to free up another entire compartment to build it first, despite the fact that there'll be one or more empty compartments after you craft it. Want to mine a breathable planet before talking to the natives? No siree! The option to talk to the natives will be gone by the time you come back from the loot screen. Do you want to transfer this module between ships? Christ, no! Even though just a while ago your dude went out on EVA to get into a transparent station to shoot a negative energy ray to a sun. You can only dismantle them, AND THEN get the elements back to your ship.\n\nNow, here's what I think happened with Out There: They planned the game, they prototyped it, they coded it, and when it came time to testing it they realized that some testers were beating the game too easily, or that the existing system was too prone to exploits. But either because of an exceedingly rigid development plan, because of deadlines or because the game was  way too far developed to redesign it into something that solved the issue they were having, they instead made a list of the strategies the testers were using to beat the game and just simply took the common elements in these strategies out of the game. It is the equivalent of having a game where you have control over your stuff but with the developer sitting next to you and slamming on the keyboard every now and then screaming "NO YOU CAN'T DO THIS IT'S NOT FAIR." Not only will that feeling come to you when you'd need those things (and, again, you'll constantly think about these things since they're commonplace), but you'll also be constantly penalized by an entropy that honestly seems wildly exagerated and out of whack: flying to a gas giant will take you 10 fuel, and mining it between 5-10, and the probe that's designed to scoop fuel from a gas giant and return it to your ship will come back with barely enough to cover ITS fuel cost, let alone your ship or the jump to the next system. While wasting oxygen and hull at the same time for good measure. This can happen up to three times in a row (and I couldn't keep counting because my hull disintegrated trying to get to the fourth), showing that the game wants to kill you way more than have you presented by a series of decisions in an environment where you are in control. I tend to bash on tower defense games calling them "antigames" because there's only one ideal solution and maybe a couple sub-optimal ones to each level, but in Out There there isn't even that. In most cases you will find youself dying without any chance of control over it and no satisfaction for that playthrough. And yes, space is merciless and life sucks. That doesn't mean my experience with a game has to suck just because those two things are true.\n\nSo in closing, Out There is a game that although majorly pleasing to the senses and a solid concept comes apart because of a series of very obvious, very arbitrary design decisions that will constantly remind you that this is not a game made to be challenging and fun, it is designed to make you fail unless you are very lucky a lot of times. The entropy is stupid and the arbitrary restriction of player control is inexcusable for a game that calls itself "a genre bending roguelike". Roguelikes should be hard, but fair. And this game doesn't play fair.\n\nI honestly can't bring myself to give it a bad score because of the solid core, but I can't honestly recommend this game because of the very big and very evident flaws on its execution.\n\n6/10.","July 19, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

While there is no combat, the challenge comes from keeping safe amounts of Fuel, Oxygen and Hull Integrity on your way through space which can be obtained by harvesting elements from the planets you visit. It's quite compelling to improve your ship's stats by collecting blueprints and building new technology. The overall presentation is very good, music and artstyle ranging from adequate to convincing, the game is definetly polished!\n\nDespite all of this, I cannot recommend this game because of this SINGULAR reason: Survival is just too random. There is not a lot of room for skill or potential for strategic thinking, that would improve your chances drastically. Whenever you lose a run, you never feel like you deserved it. You would expect this to be resolved by some form of persistent unlocks but there is literally no progress carried over when starting a new game.

Gets pretty repetitive after three or four hours.  Revolve around hopping from star to star collecting any available fuel, oxygen, or iron.  Eventually you will run out and die.  For variety, you get "events" at most stars.  these events might be a choice, or maybe something that gives or takes resources, or often just a scrap of prose to read.  I'm already seeing a lot of these events repeat themselves and they aren't all that interesting in the first place.\n\nYou occasionally meet alien life, but not much happens there either.  There is a sort of neat thing where, as the game progresses you learn words from the alien language, but in the end, nothing ever comes of it--you never learn enough words to understand the aliens speech or writting, and even if you ever did, from what I can tell, the only thing the aliens ever really have to say is that they would like an item and they will give you technology if you give it to them.\n\nIn short--Fun and relaxing for a couple of hours, but repetitive and dull beyond that.  Would maybe recommend for two bucks as a relaxing ap you play here and there while taking a dump or during commercials.\n\nAnd the "mood" of the game is nowhere near as evocative as some of the reviews on here would lead you to believe.

It's suprisingly interesting and definitely worth a look.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wAlsEgo3wq8\n\nWhat is it?\n\nOut There is a science fiction rouge-like game. You play as an astronaut who has mysteriously arrived deep in space after waking from cryo sleep. You're goal is to travel to one of multiple objective points on the star map. In order to survive the journey you need to harvest fuel, metals, and oxygen along the way.\n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of FTL in cetrain areas. The main map consists of star systems that you can jump between. Once you're at a system you can travel to the planets to mine them for rescources and potentially find technology. Between each new star system you get a random event where you have make choices, often with limited knowledge that can hurt or benefit you.\n\nThe game focuses on the feelings of lonliness and exploration that your character feels while he is traveling. You have to try to communicate with aliens and in the process begin to learn their language. The atmosphere is built as a beautiful combination of lonliness and exploration. Everything is new and alien, but that adventure doesn't take away from the fact that there is no one to share the stories with.\n\nUnlike other rouge-likes, there is no way to change what you start with. You always begin with the same ship and you can only get others by happening upon them in your travels. Each ship has its own benefits and drawbacks (although your first ship is really a hunk of junk).\n\nPros:\n\n-Every game will be very different. You're coices will be storngly driven by whatever ship or technologies you find first.\n\n-Immersive atmosphere. The soundtrack, the text, and the visuals all work together to build on that atmosphere.\n\n-The game focuses heavily on its rescource managment side and does it well. It doesn't burden itself with a combat system (which could be a con for some, but a I think this game did it well). You will often dread dropping that tungsten, but you have to to make room for fuel.\n\n-Multiple endings. I've only one once so far, but I've seen at least four different objectives that one could go to.\n\n-Games can be quick. I think that my average game was about thirty minutes going to as long as an hour.\n\nCons:\n\n-Grindy. The gameplay can end up feeling a bit grindy as you fly between rocky planets and gas giants just probing them all day. Despite this, I didn't hate the grind as much as I might in other games.\n\n-Potenitally simple endings.  The one ending that I have achieved was the first objective you are given. When I got to the star I spoke to the Architects, an old race of aliens that keep the universe working. All that happened was that my character figured out that he was the last human and then flew off into the stars to try to resurect his people. I didn't get any choice in the matter and the game ended. I don't know if this is how other endings work, but it's food for thought.\n\n-It can feel unfair at times. I've had instances when I go to three gas giants, troll them for fuel, and can't even recoup the fuel I spent getting there. There wasn;t any obvious reason why and it is a bit frustrating.\n\n-All progress is lost after you die. I like rouge-likes that reward you for doing awsome things (like winning the game) by giving you something that you can start the game with. FTL's version of that was new ships and layouts. Out There doesn't have any of that.\n\nOverall, Out There is a really fun game. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with it so far. It's more than worth $10, especially if you love exploration.","April 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's like FTL, but prettier.\nLots of interesting story elements.\n\nCons:\nThe game gets repetitive too quickly. While the story has constanly new and different elements, even that loses its flavor after awhile, because unlike FTL, which had more immediacy to it... there is very little driving force to push you forward. Your focus is to keep your ship going... but you are severely limited in how you can do that,\n\nThe new technologies you can discover seem neat at first, until you realize they don't tend to do all that much differently or improve the gameplay all that much. Your ship is extremely limited. You can actually discover new ships, apparently, which does improve things, but there is no garuntee of this and the existing ship has very little space in it. It seems like poor design decisions led to combining your cargo with the slots to install your new tech in. I don't recall you ever being limited in cargo in FTL and that is one of my big gripes here. Plus, in FTL, you could easily expand various capabilities of your ship beyond just new tech you can install. The tech seems more varied in Out There, but also far more limited.\n\nHaving to micromanage your cargo space is annoying, because while all the elements you can find have info on them, most of these elements are pretty much useless unless you stumble across the right technology that requires these elements to build.\n\nAlso, if you go to a breathable atmosphere planet and immediately fill up your O levels, why can you not also fill up as much inventory of O as possible? I would have to drill for it, and still too often get too little. The balance of elements to drill or probe for seems out of whack. Also, more often than not, it seemed like a waste to drill or probe a second time, as it produced little to nothing in addition. I would think drilling 2-3 times could still yield some good resources, at least more often than not. Otherwise, why is there an option to drill or probe a second time other than to waste your resources? Just make it only doable once and be done with it.\n\nI played through three times, and got better each time, but mainly, I stuck very strictly to doing very specific things, because otherwise, it is way too easy to run out of resources in this game.\n\nFINAL SUM UP:\nI think if I didn't have such limited cargo space and the elements were not quite so out of whack when drilling... the game would play better for me. It is in many ways a more laid back kind of game compared to FTL, which has combat and the risk of being attacked if you explore too much... and I want to like this game for the graphics and story, but it seems like there isn't enough of a game to really make it worth more than a few playthroughs. Maybe if there was more story that a player can actively get involved with, but it is all so passive, almost like a visual novel you can die in and have to do a little bit of work in, but mostly, just... yeah.\n\nSo I cannot really recommend it... very lightly, very mixed. .","June 14, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Be aware, it is far from a similar experience.\n\nAlthough I did enjoy the fact that there was a storyline incorporated into the game, this is for me the only positive aspect of the game. The game is designed around resource management and strategy; however, I found myself desperate to keep my ship moving. Every action you take requires fuel... even OBTAINING MORE FUEL! To a degree, this works but the amount of fuel consumed felt excessive. Combined with the constant bad-luck events and the inability to carry resources from one game to the next, it leaves you with a game session that ended in failure within minutes (ie. not enough time for strategy to even play a part).\n\nThere are many other rouguelike, resource management games out there. This one doesn't have the balance to be playable. After attempting for an hour to enjoy the game, I have requested a refund--something I've never done for any other game before.","July 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got alot of good points, but it's too simple to be worth $10. It was made to run on a phone, and it shows. Very little content. Excellent writing, but very little story. The artwork is great, but the game is just not what you'd expect at this price point.\n\nThis is a Roguelike set in space, so of course it gets compared to FTL. So imagine FTL without combat, crew management, shops, system upgrades (although you can keep the augments), alien races (you can keep the occasional space-monster), and the rebel fleet. What's left? Jump, read event text, harvest system, jump again, and try not to run out of fuel.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is that the game claims to be more than it is. The game is 90% resource/inventory management (which was pretty simple/uninteresting), 9% flavor text (which I thought was very good), and 1% "meeting intelligent species that won’t care about you, but also dealing with ancient powers linked to your destiny and the fate of mankind itself." In my humble opinion, a 100 word dialog in the end scene about earth does not make the game about the fate of mankind. Also, the game purports to be story driven, but the story is just a series of unrelated microevents that occur when you warp into a system.\n\nAlso, I'm not saying this as a negative point, but this game is unforgiving. All roguelikes will kill and frustrate you at first, but I thought this one had more to do with luck than skill. The games are quick enough that it's not like you've got a huge amount of time invested, but there will be games that simply cannot be won.\n\nHonestly, the game is kinda dull and repetative, but the artwork and writing really are great. I just was expecting a little more.","July 23, 2015","false","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Music's perfect, atmosphere's evocative, art is simple while suiting the game well, but the design isn't quite there for me to recommend this game without reservation. Still largely worth a buy, I'd say. And if you don't like it, get a refund - easy.\n\nEdit: I'm going to change this to a no simply because there are too many design shortcomings that negatively impact the experience. The inventory is a major factor in the way it paints you into a corner or creates arbitrary crises simply through bad design. I don't mind losing in a difficult but fair game, but the game wasting my time because it's poorly designed is inexcusable.\n\nI'll give an example: in the course of the game you need to gather and stock various rare elements (like gold, thorium, platinum, etc.) in order to build and repair some of the more exotic ship modules. Good so far. The problem is that the ships you're flying will generally tend to be between 14-16 tiles, with a good 2/3 of those taken up by essential ship hardware, leaving maybe 6-7 to store cargo in. You want to be stocking full 20-stacks of essentials like iron, hydrogen, oxygen, or helium if you can get your hands on it, but rare elements you only use for repairs, or the omega element that's essentially a wild card, all MUST take up an entire cargo hold even if you only have 1. So if you have 1 omega, 3 hafnium, 3 gold, 8 thorium, and 5 platinum, that's FIVE of your 6 cargo holds used for storing crumbs of rare elements that you need to mitigate RNG with. In a sane world these crumbs (that incidentally total up to 20) would only take up one tile of space. Where's the iron, helium, hydrogen, and oxygen going to fit? Nowhere. Something needs to go overboard, and sure enough, as soon as you dump it, you'll get a random event that requires the element you threw away. It's like the developers, or all the people giving this game awards, never bothered to play it.\n\nThis is 3/4 of a good game, with the last quarter being lazily programmed and amateurishly designed garbage, as is distressingly common with a lot of these games that rely on their music, writing, or art direction to draw people in, like Don't Starve, Sunless Sea, and several other overrated culprits. It's like going to a restaurant with attractive ambiance, a great band, and being served a perfectly arranged meal that tastes like cat vomit.\n\nDevelopers, fix your ♥♥♥♥in' game; it isn't too late. This game is already highly modular and begging to be expanded on (orbiting derelicts, trade posts, maybe a little space combat hazard to use the Resistance stat, stealth - emission sinks, etc.). An inventory fix, and fixes for a few other imperfections, would be just the thing to throw in there.","July 18, 2015","false","15.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's so many different places to go. And solar systems. Such as blue giants, red dwarfs and supernovas.\n\nThe music is calming and the art style is simple and sweet. The resources that you collect via finding, mining or catching from probes are used to research, build and repair equipment. Said equipment takes up slots, which, if needed, you are able to dismantle the equipment and get it's core components.\n\nYou can also help other races, and ships. Aswell as board abandoned one and use them yourself.\n\nI cannot stress how good this is. I got it for 50% of the price (crafting coupon) but bloody hell, it's worth full price.

(As so many others have done.) With that, instead of combat, you have to deal with survival resource management. It's a roll of the dice whether or not a certain star system will help you out or be a waste of fuel and oxygen; but it's more of a cost-benefit analysis mechanic. (Will landing on this planet to gather resources be worth the fuel, or will I end up with a bunch of stuff already in my cargo bay?)\n\nLike FTL, I found this game particularly frustrating when I first started playing. It grew on me though. Getting used to the game's mechanics will likely take a number of play-throughs. The strategy involved comes once you start learning how to best utilize the various technologies available to you as the game progresses.","April 13, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Moving the mouse from one side of the screen to the other to click buttons is as about as tedious as it can get...zero keyboard short cuts....I feel like im playing on an iOS emulator, and thats not a good thing.

While taking risks that might not pan out is acceptable, way to much (dare I say the majority) of this game is left soley up to chance.

In FTL what will kill you is a missile or sweeping laser hitting you at a bad time, where as in 'Out There' what will get you killed is a decision you made ten turns ago. Like say thinking that you will be good without keeping that common-as-dirt iron cluttering your ship's hold  or thinking you have plenty of fuel to make another jump.\n\n'Out There' is like slow moving chess, with quiet dreamy music and little vignettes. It is the first game I've played in a long while that emphasized the exploration part of game play and it is a refreshing change. Even talking to aliens is a neat little mystery as you have to guess what they are trying to say and as you go along learning little snippets of language and the backstory as it unfolds.\n\nThere are fun little jabs of humor and it would be relaxing if you weren't on the knife edge of survival at every instant. You can see gameplay elements in managing your ship's resources. You'll be thinking about fuel, oxygen and whatever rare metal dugup and trying to make sophie's choice on which to abandon and which to carry on the chance you might get a technology to use it. Make no mistake this is a rogue like, a pretty, quiet, sedate one but still a roguelike and you will die many many many times.\n\nIt is an interesting reversal of the normal formula. The game is at its most random in the start when you have nothing and a bad roll of the dice can doom you on turn two. But if you can just last long enough to find a good technology, or a new ship, or a lucky streak of events you start to get a lot more options and agency. It is thrilling to get to that point, to get into a good routine.. then it becomes your own damn fault if you got greedy and risky.\n\nThe game is a port from on the phone but the visuals are a nice moving comic motif and the sound score does much to set the mood. For what it is it doesn't feel cheap and runs well. Even though the UI can have a bit finicky things but they are minor.\n\nAnyone who is a fan of exploration and roguelikes will enjoy this title.

I would gladly pay full price for this game knowing what I know now: this game is fantastic. It is very simple, yet extremely complex. You have a ship which needs fuel, air, and metal to survive. (Fuel to move, air to breath, metal to repair the ship). You collect these resources from different planets you encounter. Planets are in various solar systems you travel to. Gas planets have fuel; oxygenated planets have air and life and metals and one form of fuel (carbon); rocky planets have metals and carbon. You discover technologies as you jump from solar system to solar system through random events. (You can also lose tech through random events: ex. space bugs chewing through part of you computer causes it to lose the info on how to build a certain tech. If that tech is destroyed you won't be able to rebuild it if you don't re-discover the tech). This is what makes the game so addicting. The randomness of the gift of tech and space ships and life forms that all have their own advantages and disadvantages. Life forms give you gifts randomly or by saying and giving them all the right things. They have a randomly generated language (every time the game is restarted). Learned words are always the same every time you restart. So, whatever languages you learned with this current space explorer's life, you will have for his duration. Once you die, everything beins anew. I just beat the game- finally- and I plan on replaying it much more. Why? Because I only got one of the endings! There is so much more I have left out, but I think this is adequate enough to pique some of your interests. Note: the game is very tough due to the randomness. If you can have things fall your way until you find a bigger ship and gather some useful tech then you will increase your chance of survival exponentially.

Whoever can flip heads the most times out of a thousand wins. After that we can have a dice rolling contest.\nOh oh I have an idea, let's make a board game where you advance a token down a path, each turn rolling three dice, and if any of them is a 1, you go back to the beginning. It'll be a great game.\n\nNo really. This is a beautiful game but I'm only going to enjoy looking at the beginning of it so many times, even if it's a randomly generated beginning.\nIf they wanted it to seem like it was closer to the reality of space travel by making it harsh and unforgiving, then I don't understand why they included fantasy things like warp drives. They could've just made a game where you start flying to another star in a conventional spacecraft and die of old age 0.000001% of the way there.  Or why did they even include starting again when you die. That's not real. If it were realistic you'd game over once and then the game would delete itself. None of this endlessly repeating early stages of a journey, you'd just see the early stages once and that'd be it.\n\nWhat's the point of this design mentality really? What does it achieve? A game I can't actually play, is all I see here. A game where a player unexpectedly loses all progress due to circumstance beyond their control - you can frame it as "game over" but it's an effect identical to a game with bugs that cause it to crash randomly.\n\nedit 1: Okay switching it to a positive review(this review was initially negative). I'm not going to just wipe the original review because it serves as a good example of what a first impression of this game looks like. It's up to the readers of this review, maybe I'm an extremely wishy-washy person, or maybe this game's mechanics are really off-putting. I was reluctant to check negative to begin with because it's a really beautiful game.\nSo anyway I got far enough to get one ending out of four, seven hours logged but who knows how many runs. Ask for/read advice in the forums as to how to do the game, play it enough times, discover the RNG can be managed.....sort of. Maybe I just had a really lucky run. The game tutorial could offer some hints on the game's strategy at least to soften the blow of that first 3 hours. I'm no stranger to games with lots of RNG, I play Hearthstone of all things, so I'm used to the idea of considering things like order of operations to minimize risk, but the strategies here weren't readily apparent and I doubt I'd have found some key points on my own(there's a trick thats pretty counter-intuitive but makes all the difference: always drill/probe on 10, it only takes iron to repair the equipment breaks, iron is common, if the equipment is destroyed and requires a different resource to rebuild it will drop right then, and positive events are also possible in addition to the breaks).","July 18, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think it qualifies as a roguelike, for starters.  This is more like.....a point and click exploration game perhaps.\n\nThe steam page accurately refers to it as "interactive fiction" with some heavy resource juggling. Instead of any sort of combat (none of the ships you can use have weapons of any sort) you'll be presented with a dialog box with two, maybe three or rarely more choices, usually each choice affecting your resources in some way. That's where the similarities to FTL start and end really, if you mess up and run out of any one of your resources, you're screwed, and this being screwed can happen at random even if you're careful in some cases.\n\nInterestingly there are multiple ways to end the game, with wildly different outcomes; its very much a choose-your-own-adventure type game with lots of text and some nice comicbook-esque visuals. It was originally conceived as a mobile game and it shows, but (much like another mobile game I liked a lot, Plague Inc) its kept patched with the occasional new feature, he's actually adding an "easy mode" apparently, since death or failure in this game really can be sort of arbitrary.\n\nFor the people on my friendlist who played and liked stuff such as Sunless Sea or Long Live The Queen, this is the sort of thing you'd likely enjoy.","October 5, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love story driven games, and I love super difficult games.  This game though is horribly flawed.  The most infuriating thing about this game is running out of a resource, finding a planet that has it, and then getting less from it then it took to even reach the planet.  If I go to a gas giant, I expect ♥♥♥♥ing gas, not levels of hydrogen so low that I was actually better off never going in the first place.  Sure rogue-likes are supposted to be random and luck based, but when this happens 2 or even 3 times in a row and end your play through, its no longer about difficulty as much as it is straight up stupid.\n\nThe fact that everything also requires its own special element and you will almost never find said element when you need it nor ever have the cargo space to carry 1/5th of them for future use makes the game incredibly grindy while also being too luck based to grind in the first place.  This is also my experience on Easy mode, f$%k if id ever try the harder modes if easy alone is not enjoyable to me.\n\nThe second problem I have with this game is the story.  The aliens you meet are boring and their dialog is always the same, with very slight differences.  The hundreds of events you run into when jumping to a new sun could have easily been incorporated into the alien life meetings, but they wern't which was a huge mistake.  After you get whatever technology you need for your "mission ending" there is no longer a point to talk to aliens, which devaluates what should be a very important aspect of a game that pits you as being very alone.  I should be alone because everything is foreign to me, not because the backwater hillbillies on every planet speak gibberish and toss me useless Omega or space wasting technologies I give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about.\n\nLastly this game has very few endings for a rogue-like that needs to boast replayability, and most of the endings are poorly designed and give you a very poor taste and bad memories of the game afterwards.  A game like this should have endings that are memorable, and few of them are with the others feeling like they robbed you of your playthrough.  With 0 bonuses for completing a playthrough and a lack of diversity in the game making multiple playthroughs feel more like a chore then an enjoyable experience you feel like you are better off just youtubing the rest of the endings instead of forcing yourself to grind them out (which I did for the endings I didnt recieve yet).\n\nThis game saddly feels like something that would play great on a phone, but is ill suited for the PC in its current stage.  It has a lot of promiss, but it feels horribly unfinished.  I get this bad feeling that this game needs to be put right back onto early access, not have a "new edition" title added to it.  Go play FTL or Darkest Dungeon if you want a fun rogue-like experience, this game has a lot of growth left to it.","October 18, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games is sometimes described as FTL without combat, which is an apt comparison, however Out There lacks FTL's replayability. I appreciated the game's artistic style and especially the feeling of being alone in the vastness of space. You slowly discover new technologies and learn the language of the aliens you meet.  However, the mechanic of resource management as you travel from planet to planet quickly. This is offset  somewhat by your character's journal entry's in which he describes how he feels being trapped in space and what he will do once he comes back to earth.\nAfter five hours of play I'm mostly bored with the game although I would like to see the other endings. (I think the game has four endings.) I feel like this game doesn't quite live up to it's potential.

I've played about seventy-one minutes and I've given up.  The small cargo hold in combination with the constant self-defeating need to refuel and repair drag me down every playthrough.  To be clear, you need to repair everytime you go to a gas giant, where you go to refuel.  And getting the components for repair requires you to land on a planet, and both taking off and landing require fuel.  Why can't I get hydrogen and helium anywhere but gas giants?  Isn't hydrogen the single most common element in the universe?  To top it off, installing technology and upgrades onto your ship to make the game easier requires cargo space: but you have very little of that.  Each unit of space can hold either one upgrade, or up to twenty units of a single element.  You need a variety of elements in order to get different upgrades, you need a steady supply of iron and helium/hydrogen for the refuel/repair grind (or should I say...  timesink), and you need certain techs in your hold just to stay afloat.  Some will say that you're supposed to recycle upgrades you don't immediately need, but that just means you need to retain a wider variety of elemental components in order to constantly manufacture the different upgrades necessary for each situation.  A variety of components which are unlikely to all fit in your hold if you mean to keep a decent supply of fuel.\nIt's clear that the game is designed to kill you so that you have to keep starting over before making any progress.

I love story driven games, and I love super difficult games.  This game though is horribly flawed.  The most infuriating thing about this game is running out of a resource, finding a planet that has it, and then getting less from it then it took to even reach the planet.  If I go to a gas giant, I expect ♥♥♥♥ing gas, not levels of hydrogen so low that I was actually better off never going in the first place.  Sure rogue-likes are supposted to be random and luck based, but when this happens 2 or even 3 times in a row and end your play through, its no longer about difficulty as much as it is straight up stupid.\n\nThe fact that everything also requires its own special element and you will almost never find said element when you need it nor ever have the cargo space to carry 1/5th of them for future use makes the game incredibly grindy while also being too luck based to grind in the first place.  This is also my experience on Easy mode, f$%k if id ever try the harder modes if easy alone is not enjoyable to me.\n\nThe second problem I have with this game is the story.  The aliens you meet are boring and their dialog is always the same, with very slight differences.  The hundreds of events you run into when jumping to a new sun could have easily been incorporated into the alien life meetings, but they wern't which was a huge mistake.  After you get whatever technology you need for your "mission ending" there is no longer a point to talk to aliens, which devaluates what should be a very important aspect of a game that pits you as being very alone.  I should be alone because everything is foreign to me, not because the backwater hillbillies on every planet speak gibberish and toss me useless Omega or space wasting technologies I give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about.\n\nLastly this game has very few endings for a rogue-like that needs to boast replayability, and most of the endings are poorly designed and give you a very poor taste and bad memories of the game afterwards.  A game like this should have endings that are memorable, and few of them are with the others feeling like they robbed you of your playthrough.  With 0 bonuses for completing a playthrough and a lack of diversity in the game making multiple playthroughs feel more like a chore then an enjoyable experience you feel like you are better off just youtubing the rest of the endings instead of forcing yourself to grind them out (which I did for the endings I didnt recieve yet).\n\nThis game saddly feels like something that would play great on a phone, but is ill suited for the PC in its current stage.  It has a lot of promiss, but it feels horribly unfinished.  I get this bad feeling that this game needs to be put right back onto early access, not have a "new edition" title added to it.  Go play FTL or Darkest Dungeon if you want a fun rogue-like experience, this game has a lot of growth left to it.","October 18, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think it qualifies as a roguelike, for starters.  This is more like.....a point and click exploration game perhaps.\n\nThe steam page accurately refers to it as "interactive fiction" with some heavy resource juggling. Instead of any sort of combat (none of the ships you can use have weapons of any sort) you'll be presented with a dialog box with two, maybe three or rarely more choices, usually each choice affecting your resources in some way. That's where the similarities to FTL start and end really, if you mess up and run out of any one of your resources, you're screwed, and this being screwed can happen at random even if you're careful in some cases.\n\nInterestingly there are multiple ways to end the game, with wildly different outcomes; its very much a choose-your-own-adventure type game with lots of text and some nice comicbook-esque visuals. It was originally conceived as a mobile game and it shows, but (much like another mobile game I liked a lot, Plague Inc) its kept patched with the occasional new feature, he's actually adding an "easy mode" apparently, since death or failure in this game really can be sort of arbitrary.\n\nFor the people on my friendlist who played and liked stuff such as Sunless Sea or Long Live The Queen, this is the sort of thing you'd likely enjoy.","October 5, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would gladly pay full price for this game knowing what I know now: this game is fantastic. It is very simple, yet extremely complex. You have a ship which needs fuel, air, and metal to survive. (Fuel to move, air to breath, metal to repair the ship). You collect these resources from different planets you encounter. Planets are in various solar systems you travel to. Gas planets have fuel; oxygenated planets have air and life and metals and one form of fuel (carbon); rocky planets have metals and carbon. You discover technologies as you jump from solar system to solar system through random events. (You can also lose tech through random events: ex. space bugs chewing through part of you computer causes it to lose the info on how to build a certain tech. If that tech is destroyed you won't be able to rebuild it if you don't re-discover the tech). This is what makes the game so addicting. The randomness of the gift of tech and space ships and life forms that all have their own advantages and disadvantages. Life forms give you gifts randomly or by saying and giving them all the right things. They have a randomly generated language (every time the game is restarted). Learned words are always the same every time you restart. So, whatever languages you learned with this current space explorer's life, you will have for his duration. Once you die, everything beins anew. I just beat the game- finally- and I plan on replaying it much more. Why? Because I only got one of the endings! There is so much more I have left out, but I think this is adequate enough to pique some of your interests. Note: the game is very tough due to the randomness. If you can have things fall your way until you find a bigger ship and gather some useful tech then you will increase your chance of survival exponentially. (I went from lasting maybe 20 or so solar systems explored to over 100 in my last playthrough).","July 21, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it is essentially a luck driven game.  The penalties you receive by random chance are devastating; the cost to travel, drill, probe, etc is too high or the ability to stockpile resources is too low.  Ultimately, it just becomes a dice roll.  Sometimes you'll survive through 30 star systems, sometime as low as 3.  Play enough times and you'll get somewhere, but very little will do with skill (although some base knowledge of resource management is needed).  This game is not for explorers, this game is for masochists who don't mind starting over after no real fault of their own.  A save option might fix this so you can "reroll" those fickle dice of fate.

I was expecting a game like FTL, but with its own unique style.  It does have a unique style, but the gameplay is severely lacking.  Resource management is much more complicated than it needs to be.  You constantly run out of everything.  Running out of any one of the games three resources--fuel, hull, and oxygen--leads to an immediate game over.  Space on your starting ship is very limited, and you will constantly find yourself destroying and rebuilding modules to make more space for resources.  Game overs are frequent because you can run out of resources at any time if you hit several systems that lack planets to resupply at.  Game overs are far too frequent.\n\nThe game itself is unrewarding.  Unlike FTL, there are no unlockable ships.  You can find ships randomly during your adventure, but there is no way to start the game with a different ship.  Different ships require different materials to repair and maintain, which means you can stumble upon great ships that need materials you don't have because you never have enough space to carry them.  Not being able to unlock different starting ships makes the game stale as it limits your options.\n\nTechnology gains are also completely random, and whole sections of the map later become inaccessible later in the game if you haven't stumbled upon certain required technologies.  Even after you acquire the design for a technology (which can be lost in random events), you still must build it, often out of resources you can't keep on hand because of space limitations.  And for every technology you add to your ship, you have less space to gather materials.\n\nThe map of stars is fixed, but the planets and events are randomized.  This may sound like enough variation to keep the game fresh, but the lack of choice made the game stale for me after a few dozen attempts.  There are four different endings, but nothing that any of them offer could compel me to play further.  There is too little strategy, too little choice, and too much chance.\n\nThere are makings of a good game here.  The art and music are both excellent, and the production values are high, and it does have some interesting ideas.  It's just poorly balanced and unrewarding.  Making ships unlockable (so that you could choose to focus on different materials and have more freedom) would be a welcome change.  If a sequel is made that addresses my complaints, I will be the first in line to buy it.

Sure, eventually you'll solve most of the encounters and events - making the game's replay value limited to a few tens of hours, I suppose - but it's well worth the cost.\n\nThis is not the game for everyone - it requires patience and reading to fully enjoy, and the desire to learn and remember the "right" outcome of various events - but it's a game I can appreciate, a game that stirs the imagination the way most games these days just can't do. A game that has a story which you can get invested in, paradoxically because you know just how likely it is that the story will end with the phrase "This is the end of my journey."\n\nOne word of advice: If you have a large tablet or touchscreen laptop, I'd get this game for the tablet instead. The mouse is not the ideal control scheme for this game.","July 16, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it impossible to win, no, but the chances are extremely slim and rely on both planning and lots of luck. But something about this extreme difficulty is what really makes this game have charm. You play an astronaut who has been out for who knows how long, as far as we know Earth and humanity may be wiped out and you may be the last of your kind. The ominous fear adds to the basic principal of what ha made humanity humanity. We have always struggled against the impossible when there was no hope, in examples like the ice age, the black plague, and global warfare, even in the bleakest of times we continue on and that is the reason we still exist today. This game carries the same spirit of knowing you're going to die and yet you try to push as far as you can before that happens because you have hope to see the end.\n\nSo yes this game is hard, this game is unfair, and you know you're going to die, that's what makes it charming. add the log entries, the random situations, being stranded in uncharted space encountering creatures you can't understand and not knowing what dangers lie around the next star jump, that struggle for survival just eminates throughout the whole game. Beautifully conveyed in both audio and visual forms, the game is relaxing and enchanting to both look at and listen to.\n\nGive it a chance, and understand that this game is an experience in what it means to be human, not just another title to buy and beat.","January 4","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I instantly fell in love with its unique art style, hypnotic music, and the fun, relaxing atmosphere (no pun intended) that the game created. While the gameplay itself was brutal, I found myself kicking back and enjoying the music and the story that I managed to follow as the game slowly progressed.\n\nOmega Edition has maintained all of the spirit of the original game, and managed to make it even better. While I thoroughly enjoyed the 2D art of the original game, Omega Edition has created aesthetically 3D planets and systems in the planetary view while maintaining much of the spirit of the original 2D art. There's more possible endings, more ways to use resources, more kinds of ships, and more music. All of which have combined to create the amazing package that is Out There.\n\nI love this game so very much, and I hope you do as well.","December 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/334420/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: An atmospheric space exploration roguelike with multiple endings, involving exo=ploration, finding resources, building technologies, and making choices..  Simple controls make it easy to play, the resource management and many decisions make it a challenge.  Must-buy for space exploration roguelike fans.\n\nOut There: Omega Edition puts you in the position of an astronaut whose normal shuttle flight and cryo-sleep doesn't go as planned, and a simple trip finds him in an unknown part of the galaxy, with a mysterious faster-than-light drive, and a signal calling him to a far star system.  You're in the unknown with limited cargo, and a vague idea of what's going on.\n\nSimple point-and-click navigation lets you travel to various star systems and explore the planets therein.  However every choice costs valuable resources - fuel, oxygen, and hull integrety.  You've got to balance what you choose to do carefully to keep yourself alive.\n\nAs you explore, you'll encounter various worlds.  Some will have oxygen and life, letting you restock supplies and perhaps gain some insight or resources from the inhabitants (which also requires you to learn an alien language).  Others may be rich in minerals, providing elements you need to craft new gear.  Yet others are gas giants, providingr fuel for the journey.  Exploring may lead you to mysterious artifacts, ancient ruins, abandoned ships, black holes, random events, and more.  You're never quite sure what's around the corner - though the right equipment may help you avoid (or find) surprises.\n\nCrafting and repairing equipment is a large part of the game.  One broken piece of technology -or one new device - may make the difference between life and death.  Some technologies radically change your ship's capabilities, and some can be paired to enhance their functions.  You might find yourself mining - or scavenging - just to try out something new.\n\nYou'll also find different spacecraft if you're fortunate, providing you even more options for exploration.  Some of them are wildly different and highly imaginative - and may or may not be what you're looking for in your travels.\n\nOn top of all of this there's an interesting plot with multiple possible endings for you to try and reach depending on your inclinations.  The entire package combines into a fascinating, engaging adventure - each move, each decision, requires some thought and planning.\n\nThe game also has excellent art design, though some of the planetary art is recycled or palette-swapped, so it can seem a bit "samey."  Alien design is exceptionally imaginative, and until you're used to all the species, you'll probably go "wow" at some of the creatures you encounter.\n\nThe music is quite good, setting the mood without being invasive.\n\nThere's few flaws in the game.  Some of the game flow and control options seem odd (can't we just ignore the space-travel filler?).  I've encountered occasional bugs.  Complaints aside, it's an extremely solid game - and quite replayable (you'll probably spend quite some time to get all endings).\n\nThis is one of the games I can definitely list as a must-buy for fans of space exploration and roguelikes.  It has the right mix of easy-to-play, compelling and challenging.  It can be enjoyed in short bursts or long sessions..  It's got everything you'd really want in such a game, so give it a try.","March 28","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
