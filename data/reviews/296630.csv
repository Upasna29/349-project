Better than a vast majority of the indie crap that's out there. The graphics are great, the game mechanics are sound,  it's a game that had an obvious amount of love invested in it. The reason I don't recommend this game is that it is terribly short experience with a threadbare story and few real action pieces. The game isn't an experience in terror, like some would claim, but felt more like a teaser to a much bigger game. I'd say this was more a $5 game than $10. Even so, if you've got money to burn and an hour to kill, go ahead and give it a go.","October 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 79 of 108 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","79","108","0","0"

The other recurring theme is MODELS:  No, not the wafer-thin things which caper about on cat-walks, but rather a three-dimensional model of the building and its attendant rooms/sections (an absolutely ingenious device which you'll have to play the game to "spoil" for yourself), and some of the hands-down scariest (and human-sized!)  bronze statues/art models you will ever have the good fortune to be terrorized by.  Always nice to be so pleasantly surprised by a game you didn't even know existed until it was already available in the Steam store (the last such game for yours truly was perhaps Outlast, so this title is in mighty good company therein).   That's not to say there aren't a few problems, however...\n\n\nFirstly, the Steam asking price is a tad silly for a game which even I managed to complete in two hours ('cause believe me, I play games kinda sloooooow).  The project is apparently the product of university students graduating from a game design course, so within those parameters it's impressive as hell, but it doesn't hurt to recognise that even the very best of such projects can't exactly go head-to-head with the "big boys", especially price-wise.  Secondly, there's a fair few glitches...on more than one occasion, I had a particular enemy freeze on me; which might almost sound like a "good"/opportunistic thing, but decidedly less so when you require said enemy to cause damage to something in order for you to progress.  Also, I had a hell of a time getting a couple of objects to successfully interact with what they were SUPPOSED to interact with.  I especially had no end of fun trying to get a round ornamental medal thing to go into its appropriate slot in a wall...thought I must be missing something...looked up a walkthrough and lo and behold, the dude playing it gets it in first go without even trying.  One game reboot later and I finally managed it, but again not quite as promptly as Mr Walkthrough did, so...yes, problems, it had a few.  I did however break with my usual cheapskate tradition (of waiting for a decent sale) and bought this game smack-dab on its release date, so perhaps these little bugs will be corrected with time...\n\n\nOn the whole, though...VERY impressed.  Expect big, big things from the people involved.  For now, this one merely qualifies as a single "big", but there's no doubt there's some talent involved here.  If I were their teacher, I would definitely give them an "A" (but not quite an "A+")...but since I'm not a teacher, I'll simply rate them in my standard manor (whoops, make that "manner"), and round off my review with the customary:\n\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","September 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 49 of 72 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","49","72","2","0"

The game is creepy, well orchestrated, has some neat lay-out mechanics, and gives a nice feeling of unease throughout the story... the problem is that there just isn't much story. There's no intro or reason why you're in the manor in the first place... no investigation is mentioned, and the clues to the tale are scattered minimally throughout the game.\n\nThe antagonist is effectively creepy until you figure out the mechanic behind the attacks and how to stay safe... and at that point, the game suddenly begins to feel like a rail haunted house ride. You're there to experience a mostly linear story, and you can do it in relative safety. It just doesn't feel like it at first.\n\nIf I knew there would be more game added on to what's already here, I'd recommend it at full price.

If you expect a lot of jumpscares i am going to disappoint you. There are moments that Kraven Manor will scare you and make you cry but these are few throughout the whole game. What makes this game an absolute must have in your library is the dark and creepy atmosphere and the general feeling that there is someone, something behind you the whole time. A very beautiful game with gorgeous graphics that will make you forget it's an indie one.\nThe mechanic that allows you to interact with miniature rooms in order to gain entrance to the same rooms in the manor is innovative and brings a fresh breath to the genre.\nPuzzles are not very hard to solve but neither too easy to think the game is failing. The only negative aspect of the game is the fact that is short. It will take you 50 mins - 1 hour max to finish. The great ending though will make you forget about that very fast. You should buy Kraven Manor if you are looking for a true horror experience.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/296630/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","590 products in account","Kraven Manor was developed by a team of thirteen gradate students within a six month time frame. In some ways that fact is all too apparent, in other ways it's surprising just how much was accomplished with so little.\n\nA first-person horror set within the eponymous building, the game's unique hook is that the structure of the whole manor can be changed dynamically. This is achieved by finding scale models of the individual rooms and setting them onto a board in the main hall, the arrangement of which determines what can be accessed. It's a really clever idea that lends itself well to an exciting scope of gameplay possibilities... or at least it could, it never really gets used to its full potential here. I think there were literally about two or maybe three instances in the whole game where the positioning of the rooms actually mattered in any significant way. Otherwise, the only thing it affected was the walking distance to the room you were heading to next.\n\nI say "the whole game", there's isn't really all that much to it. There's maybe less than a dozen unique, relatively small areas to explore, all of which can be seen in probably about an hour for most players. But at least most of that time will be eventful as various set-pieces are triggered with regularity along the way, the vast majority of these being highly effective at unnerving the player. This is largely thanks to the main threat to your survival in the manor, a life-sized bronze mannequin that appears both lifeless and yet obsessive in its focus on your demise, made even more unsettling by its strange behaviour as it will only move and attack when not being looked at directly, otherwise perfectly playing its role of inanimate object.\n\nSo it has a solid idea at is core, a suitably terrifying creature stalking your progress and is well designed with its creepy locations and adequate visuals. But it's not without its issues. As I guess is to be expected given the nature of its birth, there are technical hiccups and bugs, several of which forced me to reload my game on more than a few occasions (sometimes not triggering an event necessary to progress, sometimes essential items couldn't be interacted with, and on a couple of instances closing the game and spitting me back out to Steam). Loading can also take a while, though in fairness, that's most likely due to the fact the rooms aren't in fixed locations, plus it only seems to load once at the start rather than room by room and is seamless thereafter. Movement also feels somewhat sluggish and cumbersome, though whether this is by design to add to the fear, or a result of poor programming is debatable.\n\nOverall this ends up feeling like a very advanced prototype or proof of concept more than a fully-fledged game, and I really do hope it's developed further by the team into a greater experience. Despite its flaws, it really does have so much going for it well beyond a lot of other games in the genre made by more experienced people with more resources and hints at greater things to come for the young talents. So, if you're a fan of horror and have the patience and tolerance to see past its blemishes, then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with Kraven Manor.","September 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

You don't particularly know the ins and outs of why you're there, nor do you know too much about the manor itself but you must press on in search of answers. There isn't much in the way of story or narrative here, the crumbs of story which you are fed are genrally found through interacting with old photographs and books that are strewn throughout each of the manor's creepy, harrowing halls and rooms. The gameplay is similar to other games of its kind; You are equipped with nothing but a flashlight and a journal which updates every so often after certain events occure. There are no weapons to speak of, running and keeping your wits about you are the only tools you'll need to survive. Exploration is the meat and bones of the game, whether you're looking for a key to open a locked door or a gear to fix a mechanism, you'll always be roaming room to room.\n\nSoon enough you'll come across the game's antagonist, a bronze statue that will terrorize you throughout certain sections of your journey through Kraven Manor. Keep your eyes on him and he's nothing more than any other creepy part of the manor's decor, but turn your back on him and you'll be terrofied by the loud, clanky footsteps that make their way toward you in the dark. It's a foe that will keep you on your toes throughout. One moment you'll be at ease and exploring, then the next you'll be fleeing in absolute horror as this metal abomination pursues you down darkened hallways.\n\nArguably the biggest star of Kraven Manor is the manor itself. Dripping in atmosphere with rain splattering against the windows and thunder pounding through the halls, Kraven Manor seldom gives you any peace or moments rest. There were often times that I neglected some books and photographs, instead opting to get the hell out of whatever room I was occupying.\n\nKraven Manor is  a short game, you'll probably finish up in an hour or maybe an hour and thirty depending on how thorougly you explore.\n\nIf you're looking for a short, tense game to play one evening then it's a game you should definitely try. It may not do anything new and it never really strays away from established and tried mechanics, but Kraven Manor's bronze antagonist and gloomy setting are easily worth the price of admission.\n\n","June 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

It has events outside your control, jumpscares, things changing position when you turn away, mandatory puzzle-solving, and a lovable creepy assailant. What it lacks is length, its easily less than 2 hours if there aren't any show-stopping bugs (only saw one - a medallion thar didn't slot into place) for normal, no clue about the tougher difficulty.\n\nIf I recall there are two configurable difficulty levels, and I assume the tougher one allows for access to slightly more content, which may make more content accessible with the added challenge (which would make sense because there were some moving parts I couldn't complete on normal).\n\nThe one knock I have with the gameplay content is the chase sequence towards the end. Repetitiously running through an I'm-being-chased maze til completing it isn't spooky or scary, its kinda lame and boring. Okay maybe two knocks - ZERO explanation as to why the character ended up in there, who they are, or anything else, so I really have zero connection to the avatar I'm controlling and feel no empathy for it.

Originally a Guildhall student project, this one is a first-person romp through a spooky mansion with a creaky inhabitant and a cool gimmick for navigation. Once you start to dig into it, however, the polish starts to come off in some unfortunate ways. Part of that is in how the monster works, so if you're wary of spoilers you might want to skip this review.\n\nThe first thing you come across in the main hall of the manor is an incomplete model of the building. Throughout the game you find pieces of the model that you can fit as you please, freely rearranging the structure on the fly. It's a cool, simple gimmick that is used to unlock the final sequence... and that's it. You're not going to be doing much else in the manor, either. There's no inventory to fiddle with, only some books to get snippets from, items to lift and throw, and buttons to push.\n\nWhat you are going to be doing is staring down the house's obnoxious bronze inhabitant. The enemy in Kraven Manor is one of those ever-popular Weeping Angel or SCP-173 types that only moves when you're not looking at it. I know that sounds kinda cool, but what that actually means is the moment you turn to work on a puzzle or leave the room, it caves your skull in. Sequences with the monster turn into aggravating games of Red Light, Red Light where you stare at it while trying to blind navigate to whatever the hell it was you were doing. And the thing goes all herky-jerky crazy when it's just out of your sight, resorting to straight-up teleporting if you're too good at keeping eye contact.\n\nEasily the biggest knock against the game is its length. I beat it on Normal in just a little over 30 minutes. There's a Nightmare mode for masochists, because all it does is limit your flashlight and make the enemies kill you faster. If you're a jumpy type like me you'll get a few good rushes out of the enemy encounters and a few of the scripted moments, but it doesn't last. As a student project, Kraven Manor is undeniably impressive, but a paid product needs a lot more than what's offered here.","October 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","32","54","0","6"

I have finished my first playthrough in about 1.5 h taking my time to read all notes and paying attention to details. My second playthrough in which I aimed to get to the alternative ending took me about.. 27 minutes... the plot is simple but engaging, there are scary moments, but enough to remain scary, not frustratingly repetitive. The atmosphere of the old manor is felt and the graphics are surprisingly good conidering this is an indie title made by students (as far as I know).\n\nHowever what makes this game unique is the concept of dynamically creating the environment around you, which certainly should be developed into future, more complex project.\n\nConsider this game as an indie with a lot of potential to become a successful aaa if developed with proper amount of money and resources.\n\nThis game if deffo worth getting on sale r in the bundle.

At least the first time around.\nIt's true that the game is quite short, around 45 minutes to an hour at best, and Kraven Manor will make you nearly crap your pants within that timeframe. The atmosphere is intense and immersive, while the enemy is quick and deadly. The puzzles are easy enough to figure out even for the most novice of gamers, but to be quite fair if they were any more difficult it would become frustrating since the gamer will feel a constant overwhelming sensation of being watched and/or chased; this aspect makes concentrating on puzzles difficult at times.\n\nWhile the game has it all and has done it right in terms of pulling off an authentically scary horror experience that doesn't rely on jump scares, the end of the game feels extremely rushed. From my understanding, Kraven Manor was a student project and so I understand that the developers only had a limited amount of time and resources. However, if allowed to continue the project, I believe that this title could've been a runner-up to the Penumbra/Amnesia franchise. As is, it still beats A Machine for Pigs by a landslide and that game is about five times longer than Kraven Manor.\n\nSo if you get the chance, definitely give this title a shot this Halloween or whenever you're in the mood for a down right creepy and atmospheric game. If you don't feel like paying the asking price, Kraven Manor is generally available in bundles from time to time and it does go for a decent sale price during the holidays and summer sale.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Especially worth it if you catch it on sale or in a bundle (I got my copy in a bundle).\n\nBasically, you explore the manor, solving fairly simple puzzles to advance to the next areas. The puzzles arent overly complicated, or much more than "find object A, carry to point B, advance to area C".\n\nThe sound sets a pretty foreboding atmosphere, but the lightning seems especially loud compared to other sounds. The lighting effects are also pretty nice, and the graphics are also pretty well done.\n\nControls are pretty basic. F for flashlight, E to use things, WASD to move, LShift to sprint. Theyre also customizable.\n\nThe main enemy of the game is a bronze statue that will show up every now and then or attack you. Something I thought was kind of cool, that you may miss, is when at the very start of the game, walk up the bronze guy and hit E. As you walk away (back pedal), after a lightning crack, he turns to face where you were. Was a nice creepy touch by the devs.\n\nEither way, the game is short but well-done, and fairly creepy (it reminded me of Rose Red, the Stephen King miniseries).

I didn't really plan on playing any of the other games. However, Me and My Associate thought it would be a laugh to play Kravendales Manor. It looked like a Frictional game (The company that made Amnesia: The Dark Descent).\n\nI kind of feel deceiving for giving this a thumbs up. It was not the worst game I have ever played, however it did have a few low points. Some of the ideas were dank. The changeable room layout was a nice touch and gave you a lovely feeling of immersion. Plus, the graphics were pretty good for a cheap horror game. However the cheapness can be experienced in Kravat Manor.  The main antagonist "The Bronze Man" was poorly designed and shown way to many times for him to actually be scary, especially when his movement is shown to the player, which breaks all sense of fear as Talos' underdeveloped brother is slipping about the halls. Some of the animations were really bad and the last boss fight really took the feeling of the game and flipped turned it upside down.\n\nOverall, at its core, Kraken Manor is a cheap Amnesia clone with Slender stapled to its ♥♥♥♥ end. I would suggest giving this a shot if you wanted a short adventure game, not a scary spooky horror game. In the sea of cheap scary games, this could have differentiated itself if only it was a puzzle adventure game.\n\nRemember Dear Readers, You heard it here first.

Regardless of who made this and their experience, this is still a product that is asking for money.\n\nFor $5.99 the price is barely justified. Even though it is a little over an hour I could not bring myself to finish this. I typically enjoy short bite sized games perfect for killing a couple hours but between everything that was wrong with it I just had to put it down.\n\nFirst of all the game runs bad. Very bad. Graphics set to low and 0 FXAA, it struggled to stay above 24, rarely peaking at 40. This made it ridiculously janky and nigh impossible to stomach. I'll say that if it maintained a steady 60 frames a second on high (which should NOT be a problem for my specs) I would've enjoyed the setting and general look of the game alot better.\n\nGameplay-wise there isn't anything special. Walk around, solve "puzzles" (so minimal and straightforward they shouldn't be even called that), antagonist pop up at places/follow you/etc. This is how almost all horror games go, except that this doesn't work here all the time.\n\nThe bronze mannequin was definitely creepy at certain points and the way it behaved and interacted with you was well done. At certain points you would be stumbling around in the dark trying to keep your eyes on him (otherwise he can move and attack you). Playing on Nightmare, your flashlight runs out and darkness allows him movement. This was the strongest aspect of the game.\n\nOther instances of interaction with the mannequin were sadly laughable and unavoidably comedic looking. At some point you walk into a sideroom in the bedroom and the door shuts behind you. You open a chest and see some pictures and then you hear a loud sound like the door opening. Turn around and the mannequin's leg is halfway in the room. It then "is dragged" out while dramatic music is playing. When you leave the room there is a shadow on the wall of the mannequin that "falls over" when you get close to it. There are many other times like this that unintentionally spark a chuckle, such as the time you spend in the wine cellar, the white medical ish room (the maze was another frustrating sequence that I gave up on when the game crashed), the attic, and the second visit to the library.\n\nThe last main point of contention would be the "examine-able" objects, like the notes, books, and pictures. Nearly all other horror games, regardless of being true independent titles or "indie" in the sense that Amnesia is indie, all have notes, books, and pictures being the main source of plot information. Typically when you interact with one you get to view the note, book, or picture, however in this, a tooltip simply pops up telling you the information. Other than this being a way of cutting corners I see no purpose for deviating from the working existent formula. What purpose does NOT showing you the paper serve? Especially with the photos. What were they thinking? Any potential impact of the story was completely wasted this way. Instead of seeing a crime scene photo you are told that this generic looking photo is that of a crime scene. This was not a budget, time, or experience issue, since many other games (even markedly WORSE ones) have the sense to not do this. This was pure laziness.\n\nThe music would be the strongest aspect of the game, but sadly this isn't saying much. I love me some dark ambient / borderline drone music but compared to what's in other games, albums, etc. either the score was either generically weak or it was terribly under-utilized. Droning sounds are not inherently creepy. If they are used well in conjunction with elements in the game such as what's going on, interactions, scenes, etc. it has the potential to be creepy, even terrifying. The quality of the music was not unique enough to hold up against it being under-utilized.\n\nWhile there are some distinct positive aspects to this title, Kraven Manor severely underwhelms for the price. There are countless other games out there that have many things in common (even stuff that at first glance you'd assume to be worse than this) for $5.99 or less. I got it for free and was somewhat willing to look past the flaws but even then I came away disappointed.","January 1","false","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The details on every inch of the game you encounter looks amazing and sets the perfect mood for the game; cozy, yet spooky. Also, the concept of being able to move different modules of the manor around is quite unique and interesting.\n\nHowever, you don't get a lot of context as to what you're doing in the Kraven Manor apart from reading notes, which nobody really does. At some parts I even got a little bit stuck because of some unclear guidance, where the enemy kept touching me in inappropriate places. I think they could've done a little bit more work on that.\n\nAnother thing is that you need to properly WANT to survive in order to feel terrified by the enemy, which usually isn't the case with horror games that have monsters with some impressive artificial senses and intelligence. This means it's as scary as you want it to be, instead of forcing it upon the player.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy playing this game and I would recommend it to anyone interested in horror games. If you need a little bit more context about this game, I would suggest watching my playthrough. You'd get a pretty good impression on what it's all about:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBPVrahjRg","October 12, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/296630/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Kraven Manor is a short horror game set in a mansion that starts out as a single entrance hall, and grows outwards as you build the layout using a small-scale model in the hall from pieces that you find by exploring. It's an interesting concept, but it's short-lived, both because the game itself is pretty short and because of the fact that unless you go for the somewhat underwhelming secret ending, the game never really uses the feature in any puzzley sort of way except for one point where you're tasked with connecting rooms in a straight line to access one on the end of the board. The core gameplay is based around solving small puzzles in each room, usually while under attack by the game's enemy, a mannequin that you can probably already imagine if you've played Condemned, or any number of the other games that copied the "mannequin that follows you when you turn around" feature. For something made by a group of college students it's a pretty decent horror game, and it's certainly better than all those $20 Slender clones that weren't even worth making, but it is still a bit of a steep sell for $6, given that it ends so abruptly that you're mostly just left with disappointment that they thought up such a novel mechanic and did mostly nothing with it. Kraven Manor is the sort of game that you throw into your cart as a bonus after adding all the games you wanted to buy in a sale because going from $30 to $33 isn't that big of a jump, but I wouldn't necessarily call it the game that you go out and buy on its own.","January 4","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

As far as indie horror goes, it's nowhere NEAR the worst game that I've ever played. The graphics are slightly above average (for indie horror games), and.................that's about all I have to say that's good. Now for the bad. It's incredibly short; I beat it in it's entirety in about an hour. (Not sure why Steam claims I've only spent 0.4 hours, but oh well.) The monster isn't really all that scary; once you first encounter it and understand how it behaves, the game pretty much loses any challenge. The music/soundscape is pretty bland; they could've done a lot more to enrich the atmosphere than they did. Combine all that with a $9.99 price tag and and unsatisfying ending (and overall story, for that matter) and this game simply fails to deliver. If it were a free indie horror game it'd be another matter entirely, but for a game that spent as long in an Alpha state as this one did, it should be much more refined and enjoyable. Buy it if you will, but I don't recommend it.","October 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

But now that the full game has come to steam will you want to play it ? In Kraven Manor you play as a unknow guy who enters Kraven Manor. Once you get there you start to find out deep and twisted stuff about the manor. Which i will not spoil here because its more spoiler territory. Overall how is Kravens Manor ? Its not good in any way. Right off the bat i have to say something about the demo too. The game barely added anything that wasnt in the demo. Only a few improvements and a new level. The game is still incredibly short just barely an hour long. The game does look great for an indie and the enviroment is outstanding so  is the atmosphere. But where does the game go wrong ? Well everywhere else. The game has incredibly stupid puzzles and not to mention dealing with the monster is also stupid. It does play like a fast paced amnesia but thats about it, Pros: The game looks great and plays great too. Oustanding atmosphere. Cons:  Stupid puzzles, Annoying enemies, incredibly short and anti climatic ending, Overall get Kraven Manor only when its on sale otherwise just skip this. I give Kraven Manor a 5.5/10","October 19, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Its a relatively short game that can be beaten in an hour or 2. At its price of 6 dollars I'd say it just about makes the cut for being worth it's asking price. It's borderline mediocre, but it so happens to be just be above average to warrant a rating of "good". I also managed to get a few scares out of it, which i was pleased with. The monster you encounter is pretty creepy, so thats a plus too. There were 2 particular sections in the game i found to be impressive.\n\nIf your a horror fiend like me and lookin to spend a few bones for a an hour or 2 of entertainment, you'll find it here if your expectations aren't too high","February 15, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The creature itself can be very creepy.\n- good music matches with the settings.\n- never came across any bugs.\n\ncons:\n- Because the way the enemy is set up it's easy to avoid death.

The graphic style is beautiful and music fits to the atmosphere, especially I liked the last song after you enter to the lift. It's more like a tech demo than a game.

Again.
