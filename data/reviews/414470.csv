The developer is doing a good job! :)\n\nTo start, the game is a good game. It's an eerie spin on survival. I like that perspective.\n\nThe game had a rough start, but many of the bugs have been addressed and it's now playable. It makes me feel really good the dev team listened and is now working on making a good game.\n\nThe game is kinda eerie. I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do and I haven't made it past the first level... if there are levels.\n\nFrom what I can figure out is that you start out stranded on a dark planet. Your ship is out of fuel so you have to collect meteorite fragments to make fuel. You also need to collect c-matter to make into food, ammo, and some other stuff.\n\nYou need the ammo because there are aliens that try to kill you --- actually, they're the natives and you play the alien. Anyway, they are creepy looking. The sound and music is well done.\n\nNow that I've seen the dev team fixing things up and cotinuing to improve their work I think this game is going to just get better.\n\nI'm looking forward to the game, Dev team! I hope you guys continue improving this game. Great job listening and reacting to feedback! :D That makes me feel good and thank you so much for responding.\n\nI'm going to start following your studio. You've shown good customer support and interest in making your stuff great. I am completely in support of that kind of company! :D","November 1, 2015","true","2.7"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","3"

Finding none, I controlled my generic protagionist to walk around and explore the base. Contacting the village, I could barely hear anything as I was in a Skype call with several other people. Frustrated, I equipped my tough guy mask and proceeded to open the door, only to be stared at what looked like a huge flying shadow baby, waaaaaaaaaay off in the distance directly in front of me.\n\n"Oh, look! A huge flying shadow baby!" *backs up, proceeds to close door* "I'm not letting that mutherfu-" In that instant, I screamed out the rest of the profanity when that.. thing did something or other and just jumped. It went FLYING toward the gate right as the door proceeded to close. It wasn't until I realized that a Silent One was responsible for the assault. Several things in that instance happened at once:\n\n-I screeched and my voice cracked and went up several ocataves.\n-My friends wondered wtf happened to Specialist.\n-I peed a little.\n-My monitor almost died because I was about to put my fist through the screen, in hopes that the physical contact would kill it since I couldn't bring myself to aim the damned gun I had in my hands and fire it.\n\nIn short, I am in the process of trying this again. I will update this review as time goes on, but can I reccomend this game? Absoutley. Buy it.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nIt's cold. It's dark, I'm alone, with only non-sentient Robots to guide me through my quest to escape. Walking to the large settlement of buildings, I fire my gun to defend myself agaisnt two Silent Ones, and quickly find myeslf an assault rifle, some health and a very plentiful amount of ammo. I begin to head back to base, scanning over my vitals when I realize that my sustenance is running dangerously low. I began to be swarmed by SO's when my vision becomes blurry, and in my frantic struggle of moving, I fail to notice Shadow-Baby flying overhead, attracted by the gunshots. What feels like an eternity, I eventually find my way back to base with 5.00 sustenance left, but low on health from the encounter with the Silent Ones. Replinishing my vision, I sigh in relief, planning my next moves when all of the sudden, I hear..\n\n"Whoooaaaaaa...."\n\n"That's a new sound," I wonder aloud. I turn around, and nearly jump out of my chair when I see the head of the disembodied voice screaming toward me, killing me the instant it makes contact. I am dead.\n\n10/10. Seriously. I love this game!!","January 1","true","1.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","23","27","9","1"

I liked the the game when it first came out, but now that it has been updated it is much better. I do notice that the enemies don't teleport as quickly as before making it easier to handle them along with the new main weapon. The new UI interaction notification thing really helps to understand what each of the machines do. The meteorite search machine is much better that it is shorter as it wasn't intuitive to look up to see what it does, now you can easily see the direction of meteorite. The new animation of the main character, and the totally different main weapon feels much better. There is no more pistol like in the preview, but kind of like a semi automatic rifle now. It has a nice weight to it. Overall I think there were more changes but I can't list them all off the top of my head, but now the game feels much more polished.\n\n\nold review\n{I think I am starting to get the hang of this game. I found the "encounter" with the enemies to be challenging, and they can be a bit scary as your radar only picks meteorite or memory fragments, they can be creepy especially when they pop out of the shadows. I like the concept and direction of the game so I'd recommend to those that like challenges. I get satisfaction from figuring out how to survive.}","October 31, 2015","true","2.0"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

Haven't escaped yet, but enjoying trying/failing/re-trying.\n\nPros\n- Atmosphere: very dark, dark, and twilight -- love the combination of Cthulhu and Plato (made me actually go read up a bit on some of Plato's works)\n- Monster design and avoidance/teleport mechanic\n- Sound effects: creepy, appropriate for the Lovecraft/Cthulhu mythos that it's partly based on\n- Cool graphics, not for being high end but for being appropriate to the story and creepy.  Reminiscent of some of the original black and white Twilight Zone episodes (the ones on alien planets or in space)\n- So far the dev has been doing a lot of great updates\n\nNon-spoiler tips\n- Read the hints at the beginning of the game on the giant white boards (look all the way around before selecting New/Load)\n- Remember that you can save (don't have to just let things get harder with each fail)\n- The game is meant to be vague and not have detailed instructions.  That's part of the fun\n- If you're having problems hitting the silent ones, try running backwards and waiting for the silent ones to move towards the center of your view, then quickly move to the side and shoot","November 24, 2015","true","11.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

It's a very dark dark game. Love the feeling of when a silent one appears. Sends creepy chills down the spine. The survival aspects of the game are amazing, however the sub levels seem to be a bit tricky. Using do long runs out looking for supplies, but never make it back due to sub levels falling.\nHands down it's a great game, and a steal of a deal at $5. Would recommend it to any looking for a fun/dark/horror surivival alien based video game.","November 24, 2015","true","1.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

You are an astronaut marooned on a pitch-black planet. While you are merely trying to escape, the planet'a denizens have another idea. You must gather survival supplies and fuel for your ship to take off. The atmosphere and enemies reflect a truly Lovecraftian malevolence, and you are given a sense of urgency and desperation.\n\nHowever, that's where the game stops being a spooky thriller and starts becoming frustrating. If there were a better save system, more places to re-arm and resupply, and more environments to explore, it would be better. But it feels like you are going in circles and accomplishing nothing.","January 3","false","3.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wubsicles/recommended/414470/","wubsicles","Kenuda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wubsicles/","330 products in account","I like Nightmare on Azathoth. It's an interesting survival game on a planet of darkness. Even daylight doesn't reach the ground, as the creatures you face push away all light on the surface. The enemies are troublesome without being ridiculous (except for the flying head) and are original in their simplicity (except for the flying head). I like the resource management, I like the giant floating monster that summons enemies to attack you when it gets close enough, I like the power system.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the flying head monsters. It's not because they are annoying, it's not because they steadily glitch out worse and worse, it's entirely because of the fact that the flying head monster's model comes from the updated version of the game "Eyes - The Horror Game". This was a theft, as Eyes was made by a completely different person.\n\nBut, let's try and focus on being optimistic. Maybe it wasn't theft after all. Maybe Modesto Rabena got permission and used the model. No idea. What I do know is that it means that they decided not to make something original for the game. Even a different looking model would've sufficed.\n\nIn the end, I do recommand getting Nightmare on Azathoth. It's difficult in the beginning because of the lack of a tutorial but, you learn quickly by doing things. Once you learn the game becomes significantly easier but, it will still take you time to complete, and the longer it takes the harder it will get as The Silent Ones will become more numerous. It's a fun game, and I do enjoy it. Just wish the flying head monster wasn't so suspicious.\n\nEdit: Upon seeing my review, the developer took time to let me know that it wasn't theft, and that they will be making changes to the flying head in both look and glitchiness. So now I recommand Nightmare on Azathoth even more, since the developer seems willing to fix bugs and errors in the game as soon as they are caught!","February 10","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","3"

Seriously though, I'd say this is a good 8/10. Graphics are alright, the lack of color makes the...fog, seem really freaking awesome, the Lovecraft influence is strong (ALWAYS a plus), the enemies scare the crud out of me, etc. Every time I die and start over I'm afraid to set foot outside again, and very few games do that. You have a gun, and usually the lack of defense is what makes survival scary right? Nah. The survival mechanics in this game (scrounging for ammo and all that good stuff) make shooting somewhat of a rare thing in this game. I still usually blow through my ammo starting off because the DOs are frighteningly creepy. The big floaty thing, creepy. This game, creepy. In a very very very good way. I suck at writing reviews but there isn't a good reason not get this game if it's on sale (a steal at 3.59 atm). You probably won't regret it. I didn't in the slightest.\n\nGee, I REALLY suck at reviews, ugh. Tl;dr = Buy game pls, is scare","February 14","true","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't forget to keep an eye on your level of sustenance and food, on that strange entity hovering, be careful about the annemies i call the dark dancers. I like their shape.

It definitely has potential as full Horror/Survival game with more content and polish if the publisher and devs ever wanted to expand this project. (This is a kind of short, bitesized alpha-ish game)\n\nI haven't completed this game yet but got to the very end and then died what seemed to be a random physics glitch or invisible insta-death area in my base before I could escape!\n\nI died when walking next the maintenance robot that moves back and forth between the volatile, burning dark fuel (that will kill you if you move into it) and the maintenace-pad-type-thingy that is normally safe to traverse.\n\nBut apparently, it is safe only for most of the game it is NO LONGER a safe area at the end, to my dismay... Perhaps I did not notice, but I suppose that area has dangerous, buring dark fuel too once you're at the end of the game.\n\nAll I know is I died instanly from mostly full health when I walked across it, and that only happens when you walk into the blazing dark fuel that is in the corner of the base. I was kind of upset after I made it all the way to the end of the game and almost escaped  > : (\n\nI do not remember seeing anything dangerous on the pad. Perhaps my maintenace robot crushed me when I moved across it and the big robot stepped onto it. Or it dumped burning dark fuel on the pad as a walked on it. I have tried to recreate it at the begining of a new game to understand why I died. But, I can stand on the pad with the robot moving around me and it does not kill me...??\n\nOther than this fairly off-putting moment, this game has a dark, spooky sci-fi atmosphere and creepy, lovecraftian monster vibe which I think is a pretty cool blend of genres.\n\nIt is not exactly unique, as there is a similar Sci-Fi/Lovecraft Horror style game on Steam called Noct. But that is a top-down shooter while this is a third-person shooter.\n\nThe TPS and survival mechanics of this game are pretty run of the mill, but the games winning assets are the atmosphere and mysterious story. Again, considering this is sort of an alpha and looks to be a mostly independent concept project, it would be unfair to knock it for gameplay mechanics/polish.\n\nStill, I can't exactly recommend this purchase, currently at $8, for someone who is not a fan of these genre's considering said amount of content and polish.\n\nBut, if you like to support independent projects like this and do like Horror and/or Sci-Fi, you will get a few hours of intriguing gameplay from Nightmare on Azathoth, once you get past the learning curve as this game has no real tutorial.\n\nYou will have to learn from exploration and moslty figure things out on your own with a handful of help messages in the menu and the base.","March 22","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
