If you have a disposable income and you're looking for a shallow game where you can just buy your way to the top of the leaderboards using Steam Market then this game is for you!\nTLDR: Game is a decent dungeon-maker / dungeon-raider, but is highly Pay-to-Win; be prepared to grind countless hours if you don't want to use the real-money cash shop for "boosts", "item packs", or just outright buy the good defenses from Steam Market. Also Ubisoft DRM (U-play) sucks!\n\nHas lots of potential to be a great game but sadly won't live up to it's potential due to developers focusing more on Pay-to-Win content instead of balance.\n\nThis game had been in closed beta for almost a year and had a major rework due to backlash and criticisms over their shoddy mobile-games-style "pay-dollars-to-not-wait-X-hours" business model. Amazingly, it took them almost a year before they realized their business model ain't working for a PC game - despite the constant complaints and whines of the players.\n\nGame got rework and released open beta on Febuary, 2014. It was buggy and unbalanced, but that was expected for a game that was on beta. What's not to be expected though, is for devs to start shoving DLC, advertisments for other ubisoft games, and locking characters behind a paywall - when the game is supposed to be testing for bugs and balance. Isn't the whole point of a beta to flesh-out the kinks of the game? Not "try to milk as much money from your players before the game even gets a full release".\n\nMy major complaint about this game is the terrible pace of balance fixes. Patches usually come in a bi-monthly basis. People have listed problems with the game's balance ever since the start of the open beta - problems that made the game repetitive, stale, and boring. The devs even acknowledged these problems themselves even as early as March - yet they barely touched the balance when it comes to patches; it's usually 1 minor balance change followed by more DLC, content disguised to entice you to spend money on blings (pets, costumes, crafting patch), or more advertisements.\n\nThe slow pace of balance changes results in "flavor-of-the-month" setups where people will just resort to the most imbalanced setups that's currently available. This is what makes the game a repetitive and boring choir, as 90% of the time, you'll find people are just using the same setups with little variations in their defences. This trend had been going on for over a year - and looking at how the devs are more content to shove DLC on your face than listening to players' feedback - then this game ain't going anywhere.\n\nUpdate: (August 2014 - Crafting patch)\nThe crafting patch has turned the game into Pay-to-Win, again!.. This patch introduced crafting rare monsters and equipment by collecting rare materials - these materials are so rare that most players who don't spend money on the cash shop will only be able to craft very few rare monsters and equipment; those who use the cash shop have a clear advantage over those who don't.\n\nUpdate: (October 2014 - Release)\nGame got released and it's still Pay-to-Win; I tried attacking castles but those who have tons of rare monsters seem impossible for me to win against. Meanwhile, my castle with only a few rare monsters get rolled over by other players.\n\nUpdate (December 5, 2014 - Added the ability to buy and sell items on the Steam Market)\nGame is blatantly pay-to-win as you can now buy and sell casle defenses on Steam Market. If you have a disposable income and you're looking for a shallow game where you can just buy your way to the top of the leaderboards using Steam Market then this game is for you!","August 11, 2014","false","115.4"," 2,019 of 2,221 people (91%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","91","019","2","62","71"

Unless you grind like there is no tomorrow you can't build the traps. The old ones you had already spent time and money on they put as diseased and are basically depowered trash. And now there are special double/triple traps or monsters to make. but they need so many epic parts that you need to buy loot bags for a chance at an item...of which you will need 3 or 4 to make. The game was fun. even with the people with glitching and trap castles. now its just pointless if you want to go in and do anything. It is still fun if you want to log in and take on a castle. Maybe you will find a fun one. Usually not. Now a days its spring trap into enraged juiced baddies or so many bought creatures that its unwinnable. Recently what finally did it was another mage nerf to make his key spell faster but now it does no damage. What was a fun cute game quickly turned into who can spend the most cash.

You start your game (having to create a Uplay account, STEAM isn't enough) and are on your way to disappointment. Create your character (only one mind you) you have to pay real money to unlock any of the other three. Play through a GRUELING tutorial (seriously, I almost quit just because of the crappy non-optional tutorial). And away you go!\n\n2. There is absolutely no plot or any kind of story at all; nor is there any form of character development. The Hero Skill system is laughable, providing no customization for unique heroes. Every Knight is the same as every other knight and so it goes for the other three one dimensional pay-to-play characters you can choose from.\n\n3. Castle runs take anywhere from :30 (Beginner castles) to 10:00 (Higher level castles), leaving you feeling very unfulfiled and seriously disappointed in the 'Epic Loot'. Not to mention: your hero can't even defend your own castle. The only redeeming quality would be Castle Design, but even that leaves you frustrated. You're given the opportunity to select a castle model and you're not given the option to restart your castle if you wanted to try another model. You're provided with one free castle theme, but in order to try any others you're hit with another pay-wall in order to unlock them.\n\nDesigning your castle is as basic as it can be: Place this room here, place this trap there, & place this creature here. Simple and boring.\n\nTraps:\nThe very definition of a trap is: 'any device, stratagem, trick, or the like for catching a person unawares.' However, you can plainly see where EVERY trap is located. What's the point of planting a trap, if it's in plain sight?\n\nYou are provided with a (very) limited number of traps to begin with, which can be purchased with in-game acquired gold. The rest require certain items to build; the item drop-rate of which is RIDICULOUSLY low. However, you can buy (yet another pay-wall) 'Item Packs' which provide you with more items than you would be able to find in a month of playing.\n\nMonsters:\n(View 'Traps') Pay-to-Play in order to create Low/Medium/High level creatures after you have exhausted your miniscule pool of gold-purchaseable creatures. Or, spend scores of hours on repetitive game-play attempting to farm the required components. As it stands now, I have roughly 55 hours of time invested and have been able to create one low-level creature.\n\n... and why only Monsters? I'm fortifying a castle, not a dungeon. Where are the Knights? The Archers? Monks? Mages? Mercenaries? Not even a standing militia? Why are frogs and chickens defending/living in a castle!??!\n\nCastle Rooms:\nThe only real difference between the many different rooms are where the entry points are located. Sure, some have pillars, some are wider, some are longer, but there is nothing truly 'unique' about them. There are no Libraries you can create, no latrines, no dinning halls, no barracks rooms, no training rooms, no torture chambers, no ball rooms, no archery ranges, no horse stables, no grave yards or tombs; no chapels, no game rooms, no bars, nor any dungeons or cells; no gallows, no rickety bridges over pools of lava, no towers to scale, no princesses to save, no secrets to uncover, nor any lore to discover.\n\nLets not forget the constant advertisements. Every time you log in, there are advertisements that pop up asking you to 'Buy this Special!" or 'Save if you buy this now!'. There's even a permanent icon on the left side of the screen that takes you to a menu of their current sales and pay-to-play content.\n\nConclusion:\nBeing a huge fan of both 'Diablo' & 'Dungeon Keeper' (two games which were directly compared to this one) I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. Why else invest 50+ hours in a game that is absolutely no fun to play? The pay-to-play aspect is beyond absurd; especially considering this is still in it's Beta phase.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone who isn't a glutton for punishment or has yet to  mentally develop further than a four-year-old. Minesweeper is more entertaining.","October 10, 2014","false","56.8"," 1,020 of 1,186 people (86%) found this review helpful 103 people found this review funny","86","020","1","103","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToozdaysChild/recommended/239220/","ToozdaysChild","Toozday's Child","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToozdaysChild/","139 products in account","The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is a game with an interesting and promising design format that ultimately falls short of it's potential.\n\nIn Mighty Quest (I'll call it Mighty Quest for the rest of the review because ♥♥♥♥ if I'm gonna type out the whole title every time I need to refer to it) you play as a citizen of the nation of Opulencia: a realm comprised entirely of super-wealthy elites who have built magical sky castles to escape the hum-drum woes of the ground dwellers. But how, you may ask, did the Opulencians acquire such wealth? Why, by looting it from others, of course! Sustain your wealth by robbing it from your fellow citizens, and then invest said wealth into an elaborate castle, complete with hordes of monsters and deadly gauntlets of traps that your neighbors must brave if they wish to do the same to you!\n\n...Thus spake the backstory. What this all means is: pick a hero, design a castle full of traps and monsters, and raid other player's castles while they raid yours. As a player, your job is to raid castles and acquire loot, then spend it to create a castle filled with minions and traps, all placed within the modular rooms the game provides, in order to protect the ill-gotten gains you took from OTHER such castles, all made by other players. Well, not ALL, there's some static NPC castles, but you get my drift. The traps are varied and interesting, including such novelties as spring-loaded platforms which vault players in a specified direction, bricks of icy jell-o which fall from the ceiling to entrap the player, and giant, bladed hamster wheels which run back and forth along tracks (also includes an ON FIRE variant),  The minions display a similar level of variety; each boasts an array of stats and special abilities that can be used to complement one another and exploit enemy players'weaknesses.\n\nNow, I'll come right out and say it: I love games that let you design and build stuff. GMod, Minecraft, Terraria, Space Engineers; any game that allows me to build something will automatically pique my interest. I just love the idea of making crazy contraptions and showing them off to others. So, obviously, a game that lets me make a death fortress that other players have to run through for loot is a game that's gonna get high marks from me, right?\n\n...Well, no.\n\nSee, Mighty Quest doesn't quite live up to all the promise of it's premise (that almost rhymed!). You might go into this game expecting to encounter a wide variety of player-built castles, each with a unique combination of traps and minions, right? Well, if so, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck, son, because all you're gonna get is a parade of copy/pasted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stretching to the horizon.\n\nOnce you hit around level 20, all the player castles you raid are going to start seeming awfully familiar. Sure, they might have different cosmetic themes, or have slight variations in how they arragne rooms, traps or minions, but it all boils down to the same design philosophy: stack your strongest minions and traps into as few rooms as possible. The worst offender of this by far is the ever-present springtrap/totem/minionspam room - I don't know if this tactic has a name yet, so let's call it The Entombminator. Building The Entombinator is simple; take a room with a narrow entrance, put a Totem in the center, surround it with minions, and then put springtraps facing inwards in the entrance.\n\nThe way it works is as such: The player walks into The  Entombinator's entrance and triggers the springtraps, which catapult him or her into the room. All the minions inside the room aggro the player and attempt to forcefeed them their own ♥♥♥♥. If the player attempts to walk back out of the room, the springtraps will throw them back in... or, if the springtraps are still resetting, the totem will prevent the minions from leaving the room and heal them completely. In short, the only way to get past this combo is to kill every minion inside the room; and considering that the person who built this monstrosity likely stocked it with all his deadliest creatures, good ♥♥♥♥in' luck with that.\n\nYou'll hardly ever see a design that tries something new or creative. It's just an endless mobius strip of the same castle with slight variations. In part, this is a fault of the genre: successful design elements are bound to be copied by other players. But if there's only a begrudgingly small handful of successful elements, THAT'S the fault of the developers.\n\nGames that allow creativity are also obliged to ENCOURAGE creativity. If you can do anything, but only one thing works, then in reality you can only do that one thing. A creative game should allow for multiple options,; it should allow players' imagnations to run wild and create all sorts of crazy things. If a single build becomes the absolute best then you need to rebalance it; otherwise your game isn't creative anymore.\n\nAll of this is, of course, without mentioning the other issues of this game, such as the terrible character balance (Archer wins, everyone else wishes they were an archer), the lackluster community features, and the blatant pay-to-win design (although, this being Ubisoft, was anyone surprised?)\n\nIn short, Mighty Quest is an amazing concept that fell far short of the mark.","July 3, 2015","false","253.0"," 229 of 246 people (93%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","93","229","246","26","1"

Haven't played for... 2 DAYS?? That's it, you got raided of money, crystals and almost all your crowns! That is, frankly, just horrible, Ubisoft. What were you thinking? I had the urge of uninstalling because of this downside really often. I opened the game to buy some new upgrades for my castle, but.. guess what? 50 players defeated my defense and ''stole'' all my items (and, please, don't come saying my castle defense rating was too bad and it's my fault; if you've played 5 hours you probably know that ALL, literally ALL people are using the same techinques to avoid traps and kill all minions faster; it's basically no matter what you do, your castle will get raided of everything and the only way to keep up in the leaderboards is to play non-stop, which won't happen, at least for me).\nAlright so new games got out and I uninstalled, with a bright smile, this game, promising I will never touch it again and cry at how empty my chests would be if I haven't played for more than a week.\nNow it gets ''fully released'' (which is not surpringly, really, Ubisoft is well-known for selling half-finished games) and reappears on my Steam Market page.\nNostalgia hits me in the hardest moments and I couldn't help but reinstall it, REALLY HOPING (praying while it was downloading) that Ubisoft did something about that horrible downside.\nAnd guess what?\nExactly. They didn't do ♥♥♥♥.\nSurprisingly I still had a few gold and crowns when I started the game, but that most probably was because my castle was inactive for too long and it just wouldn't show up on other's PC. The gameplay was almost the same, they just made the HUD 3x times uglier. That was 2 weeks ago.\nToday I open it up (repeat, 2 weeks after last launch) just because of boredom, and guess what? EVERYTHING was raided from my castle.... That is just NOT what I call a good, fun game, a game which you enjoy playing.\nLet me get one thing straight before I summarize this review: I LIKE the fact that people are also playing on my castle. After all it's ok to lose from time to time, so it wasn't the number of looters that dissapointed me. As stated, it's just publisher's fault for making a horrible balance. It's fine for me to see them getting to my treasure room (using the same techniques from one year ago, doesn't seem that Ubisoft give a damn about rebalancing those either), but losing everything you worked HOURS on? No, that is the ULTIMATE BUG, gamebreaking, unimmersive and leaving you in hatred for knowing that you could've spent those hours in other activities, which would let your effort be seen afterwards).\n\nTL'DR\n*sigh* It's rarely that I get to be so dissapointed by a video game. I have played not-so-great games (with a rating under 50 from Metacritic) and all user reviews not recommending it, and I can say that NONE, EVER, was so bad as this game. And it's just sad, The Mighty Quest had a FINE gameplay, but really, Ubisoft ALWAYS has to ruin their games in some way... If it's not horrible optimized, then let's just add a game-breaking mechanism.\nI am not glad to say this, but this game has definitely shown me just how bad a game can make me feel. Uninstalled, unsubscribed and hope not to hear from it again (at this point it just brings too bad memories to take it only as a simple game; it's dozens of hours ruined, in fact, fake giving me the impression I would finally achieve something..)\n\nFor this review I am not going to add a [+] and [-] rubric, nor a personal rating. I just want to finish with it already and forget about it. If you have tried it, I bet you can relate, if not, I beg of you not to play this game, unless you like gathering a lot of gold and then see it all gone in a matter of time.","February 24, 2015","false","4.9"," 430 of 502 people (86%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","86","430","502","28","20"

Think Orcs Must Die meets Stronghold meets Diablo.\n\nWhile designing mydungeon to be as nasty as possible and invading the awful or amazing dungeons of my neighbours was really fun, the monetization model eventually left me feeling unfulfilled and bored with the game at the same time. Reviews stating the game is no longer Pay to Win must have become outdated again sometime during the game's long run in Early Access. Typical issues include (17-Oct-2014):\n\n- Very slow grind for resources\n- Premium currency "Bling"(can be grinded for without paying... VERY slowly. The game prefers you buy the best value 70 euro currency pack instead)\n- Premium-currency-only items\n- Premium currency can buy everything (barring most gear, although rerolling and upgrading gear with Bling is possible)\n- Powerful and/or rare in-game item sales. (My Steam purchase netted me a giant boss-dragon complete with stuns, flaming breath and flaming trails of death I could use in my level 1 dungeon)\n- Purchasable XP/Gold/Loot boosts\n- Daily quests chores\n\nMighty Quest's payment model is not nearly as bad as it could be due to its asynchronous nature; you never directly do battle with other players. Instead, purchasing an overpowered dungeon filled with expensive traps and monsters will serve as adding a difficult dungeon for those who enjoy a challenge, or as an overpowered dungeon to ignore for those who do not. Unfortunately, the payment model is bad enough to significantly impact the amount of enjoyment you can get out of the game without paying through the nose or by grinding. If you are a completionist, or are into min-maxing, or are impatient, or have a competitive mindset, (in other words, if you're a gamer...) this will impact you.\n\nGreat concept, good for a decent time, feel like I mostly got my money's worth, feel bad afterwards and can't actually recommend to anyone.

The classes and skills never felt particularly well balanced, with a lot of the balance patches at best feeling arbitrary and at worst made by people who don't actually appear to know very much about their game.\n\nThe dungeon building element at first feels like it could be good fun, with some good potential for murdering attacking players with a variety of traps and monsters. You'll quickly begin to realise that it's exceedingly shallow, with repetitiveness kicking in quickly. The only practical differences between two random player dungeons is what monster and castle skins they wanted and, importantly, how much real money they were prepared to spend.\n\nPay to win is strong with this one and, if you aren't dropping real money on it, you're going to be at a significant disadvantage attacking or defending against those who do.\n\nThe whole thing has the feel of a mobile or browser game that you dip in to now and then, playing short sessions and paying money to make things happen quicker. It doesn't stop there though, you can spend money to buy outright stronger dungeon defences and markedly better weapons. You could likely get there eventually without spending a penny but it's going to take a very long time and a whole lot of grind.\n\nTop all this off with a nice dollop of mandatory Uplay client and you have fairly shallow and dull game, that will never tire of you spending money on it.","December 28, 2014","false","14.7"," 370 of 452 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","370","452","16","1"

The earning models to buy gems to speed up the process if you want to have some development in the game makes it unplayable. Same goes for the upgrades of the mines, in the beginning it's manageble, but somewhere near 140 per hour you have to wait 6 hours to get 14 pc more per hour, this takes 70 hours to reclaim the loss of 6 hours, with the following upgrades it gets even worse.\nThe whole game seems to revolve around getting virtual money, in the form of blue, green and yellow money, so you can progress.\nI have to wait 2-3 days now and login twice a day to upgrade part A and then wait another 2-3 days (with 2 logins a day) for part B...when i'm at part D or F i can then build one extra room......for people who enjoy waiting for the grass to grow, this is it.\nOh, i can also spend real money to speed this up, good luck big spenders and bling lovers.\n\nSo you want people that don't pay extra to only reach a high level if they put in a few hundred hours at least and for real money they can build that in a few hours....it's the death of gaming.\nWhere the basis should be that you start with equal chances and may the best win, here it is: may the foolish with deep pockets win.\nI am now at the point that the losses per day are equal to the earnings, if i want to proceed i have to log a lot of attacks (some 30 in one day) on other castles or spend real money.\n\nAs you can see, most positive reviews are from people who have only played it 2-3 hours, ask them again IF they ever reach 10 or more hours if it's fun.\nTo bad the gaming industry is so greedy, they destroy gameplay in the hopes they can get rich over your frustration.\n\nAbout games that play online only, it is a concept where you pay money to get NOTHING.\nYou should never pay for that, unless you like to sponsor greedy and possibly lazy people.\n\nLet's make that comparison in real life, you buy a new game like agricola (only single player i know, but this also works for multiplayer game like monopoly, but in the rules it states that sometimes your game is just gone for a few days or unusable for hours because:\na) you don't have the key to open the box and you have to connect via internet to the company, they will verify and send you an unlock code IF there servers are online, otherwise get a deck of cards because you can't open the box.\nb) the company decides when they want to change something to the game and don't give you an access key to the box until you have accepted the new board/rules/pieces and have send proof of destroying the now, according to the company, obsolete parts of the game.\nc) if you leave the game unlocked out of the box without logging moves somebody from the company drives by and closes and locks the game for you or takes it away because you broke the unreasonable and sometimes illegal licence agreement.\nd) if the company thinks they have earned enough or that the profit is too low they push a button and all sold games are locked forever...in basic they destroy your property or at least making it impossible to use. but you may be able to buy the same game with more detailled visuals if you want and sign an even more absurd and immoral licence agreement.\ne) you have to have a working internet connection even when you are at home playing agricola or monopoly with some friends and log all moves made by the players otherwise some people from the company come by and take away the game. Possibly if your internet connection is made via an android machine they also want to know your exact gps location while playing monopoly, all phonenumbers and calls you make or recieve, when you scratched your left ear, your eternal soul and your firstborn child.\nf) if you want to win at monopoly you just pay the company and they give you different 'chance' cards and an instruction to make it look like you just picked them from the deck or maybe just programmable dice.....those naturally selfdestruct after use, so buy some more....\n\n\nIf the servers are down you only have some waisted harddisk space. If you are somewhere without internet you can't play although you pay....if it's a game you want to play again years later you suddenly discover that the servers are down and will never come up again. USELESS and in my opinion theft.\n\nSingleplayer games that have no offline mode have no right of existence and should not be sponsored....\n\n\nYou used to have multiplayer games with lan capability, so you could play at home with friends, just as with monopoly and even start a server after years of being abandoned.....i'm almost wondering where my cd of RTCW is, although the graphics are crap the gameplay is good and after all these years it still works.","January 17, 2014","false","31.8"," 1,445 of 1,928 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","445","1","0","36"

The idea of creating your castle/dungeon, placing traps and monsters to protect your loot and kill any players that wished to raid your castle. Sounds like the perfect game for a good time right?!\n\nWell it was...\n\nI originally bought this game for $20, the Founder Edition, which gave me access to the Closed Beta, 15k gems for purchases (which at the time was nothing), special Founders Pack costumes, special costumes that were part of being in the Closed Beta, and a couple of special gear/items/traps/monsters/bosses that required a very high level to use. I played a good chunk of it and had a blast playing it. After awhile though I had got bored and quit playing, deciding that down the road later I'd give it a try.\n\nWell after almost 2 years I came back, and god damn did Ubisoft f*** this game up! Not only was I missing stuff, but they changed the game SO much that all of my stuff changed (for better and for worse.) The most noticeable change was that EVERYTHING can be bought with Gems. They added in so many more crafting materials to make everything it's not even funny, and most of them don't drop very often. I tried to see how much I could craft without purchasing any crafting packs, and I barely collected any resources, and could only craft a few basic monsters. So in the name of Science, I purchased the biggest pack of crafting resources you could, cause you know I have 12k just laying around doing nothing, and surprise you only get a few rare and legendary crafting materials... But not enough to craft my high end special bosses.\n\nI want to point out, Free Users will get f***ed over easily. Crafting costs become insane real fast. From what I can tell, free users can only hold a maximum of 2000 gold, and at lvl 10 all gear becomes way more than that.\n\nOh, and here is another fun tib bit. Somewhere in between me quitting 2 years ago and playing it again, my entire castle got wiped of it's traps/monsters and was left empty but 1 chicken placed in it. And the best part is?! I LOST ALL OF THEM! I did not get any of those monsters or traps back, they were not placed into my inventory, they were straight up deleted. I had a bunch of extra monsters, traps, and rooms in my inventory, and every single one of them was gone, so the game was forcing me to BUY every single one of them again, including my super expensive boss monsters. G f***ing G Ubisoft!\n\n\nSo congratulations Ubisoft! You ruined a great game once again! This is why I don't buy games from you anymore.","May 5","false","12.0"," 88 of 90 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","88","90","9","1"

Its a pitence of cost for over 2+ years.  99% of everything I own was earned through a lot of work or offered in long term support of the game.\n\nWhat can I say, that many others have not remarked already.\nI have played this game extensively, maxed out ALL FOUR heroes (3X, Runaway was a late Closed Beta development and primarily targeted for Open Beta), acquired 75% of all named epics and ALL named legendaries including rings and amulets and made the castle defenses that kill 70+% of all players regularly for months.\nI understand the game coding, and know what a successful game development project looks like.\nThis game has had a lot of potential that remains squandered due to incompetent development decisions either due to interference with marketing, or just bad choices.\n\nI have been successful, been ranked in the top 100 consistently worldwide (when I choose to play competitively, which is generally a giant tug-o-war), and its been a fun ride.\nMy global statistics remain fixed, as a testament to my "grinding".\nHOWEVER, the biggest problem remains substantial and consistent updates to fix ongoing balancing and bugs.\nThere are so many underlying problems that most new players never see unless you TRULY understand the game mechanics.\nI have reported DOZENS of exploits, bugs, and game mechanic problems since Closed Beta directly to UbiSoft with full write ups, and many STILL remain existing from Closed Beta.\n\nIts not a "Pay to Win" game, but it can be a "Pay to Wait" game.\n\nOnce you get to Level 30, the REAL game begins.\nGrind for gold to reforge equipment and try and find some proper NAMED epic equipment either through "roulette", castle drops or the blacksmith, or will you will just endlessly lose if you do not have skill and patience.\nAcquistion of "most wanted" creatures and traps becomes a MUST if you want to keep your castle defenses from being stomped on by savvy players or just exploits of overpowered heroes which requires grinding or money dropping (hence the improper "P2W" mindset), but can be accomplished with the significant hours I have mentioned as everything CAN be obtained.\n\nVarious MAJOR patches have undone massive amounts of work by veteran players like me.\nOpen Creation destroyed 100% of all castle creatures and traps, except if you had purchased one "exclusive" boss, Flameo.\n\nOpen Creation, Turbo Mode, and Item Stat 2.0, were all features that promote additional grinding.\nItem Stat 2.0 was particularly problematic, since it wiped a subtantial amount of player equipment, forcing "regrinding" unless you were prepared with "rare" equipment.\nIn essence, this last major revision DESTROYED the remaining veteran player base overnight, and has yet to recover sufficiently and now never will.\nIt is predominatly all new players now, which constitutes MQEL GENERATION X? since Closed Beta.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no END GAME and the development is focused entirely on new players.\nCapturing "new whales" per say, to extend the lifecycle.\nThere is little to keep veteran players around unless they are die hard fans (which I qualify).\nThe long term success of this game after its FULL release is marginal at this time, although there is a "roadmap" of ideas that want to be introduced.\nThe game continues to "inch" its way towards P2W by some of the concepts introduced such as "most wanted" traps and creatures, which upsets the overall balance of the game in order to offset problems with castle defense mechanics.\n\nPeople and new players have remarked and even joked, but you have played this game nearly 2000 hours (since I transferred my account to Steam from Uplay), how can you not recommend this game?\nThis just goes to show how uninformed and ignorant people are about UbiSoft in general.\n\nThe answer is simple, MQEL has a persistent system tray application that hides itself even after you quit the game.  It MUST be manually shut down (after overriding the program and displaying it on your system) or Steam keeps thinking you are playing.  This move when emplaced was inscrupulous by UbiSoft and artificially inflates statistics.  When active, you CANNOT start another Steam application, which is a tip off something is wrong.  In my case, HUNDREDS of hours, before this was caught.  This was not even known until nearly 3 after it was implemented, in many cases people still do not know this is a problem even after the game was released.  There are now hundreds of reviews that report things like "I dont remember playing this game for 30 hours, as I only played it for 10 minutes and quit".\n\nSummary:\n\nThe FINAL creative director was moved to a different project, the LAST development team either fired, relocated, or reassigned, ALL community managers are gone, and the server is set to automated.

Stop this nonsense, please! Keep these games away from your store or ask other developers not to mess with your DRM...)\n\nAfter too much handholding (15-20 minutes or so) with no way to skip you get to build your own castle in the sky. Initially it contains only bare necessities and three rooms. After placing traps and monsters to prevent other people from looting your mana and gold you have to beat the new-design castle yourself before it gets published. If you take too long, anyone will be able to take the treasures away from you.\n\nYou cannot place large numbers of monsters because you have a low budget at the start. You are just another newbie, unprotected and insecure. Other people may storm your gates, kill your monsters, loot your gold and mana. There is a way to defend your castle together with your monsters but I have yet to figure it out.\n\nYou get the resources to equip your hero and your castle by either collecting them from two wells (initially) or pillaging other people’s castles. And when you do it, you find out that camera controls are bad. Camera can be turned only by 90 degrees every time, four times to make a full circle. And what’s worse: it is impossible to change key bindings. And I wish camera turning were better when you have to choose what castle to loot next.\n\nThen there is ability bloat or something. At about level 5 or 6 you find out that the number of open slots on your action bar is less than the number of available abilities. What to choose? Or is it possible to buy more slots with cash? You cannot drag other abilities (I think) while storming a castle and you cannot immediately equip looted items.\n\nBut is the game fun? Yes, quite fun. Only if Uplay doesn’t screw things over. Oh, yes, I also like the colors and the overall approach to graphics. It is a fairy-tale game. It inspires good mood if you can play. But if you can’t…?\n\nDo I recommend the game? Only if the servers are stable. Otherwise, wait for it.\n\nUPDATE 02.03.2013\n\nAfter playing a couple of days (most of the played time counted by Steam is me doing something else while the game is alt-tabbed) I can add new information.\n\nWhen other people attack your castle and take all your treasures it seems that only a percentage of the gold and life force in storage is taken. The treasures in your wells are not affected. They are safe. Right after a successful attack you cannot loot them but they get rebuilt quickly and then you can loot them.\n\nGetting other people’s treasures can be as hard as it gets. Right after explosive traps become available and the traps that catapult your hero into the middle of a bunch of the explosive traps every step you take in an enemy’s castle can be deadly. Fun? Not sure.\n\nChicken castles!\nHowever, there is a silver lining. Some friendly souls have decided that offering people a fast way to get loot and XP might be more fun. I’ve found one castle (and I am on the lookout for more) that instead of traps and monsters is populated by chickens only. With a proper level, these “monsters” give a lot of XP, drop a lot of loot and gold. High five! My castle is now one of them. Too bad I cannot place the chickens proper for my level: gold is hard to come by.\n\nAbout in-game currency changes.\nJudging by third-party wikis available on the Internet prices for castle upgrades have been drastically raised after the latest patch. And only the heart of the castle now requires life force for upgrades. All the other upgrades (except for creature upgrades in the research lab and new creatures in summoning portal) require gold.\n\nI am now at level 21 and my castle is the same level. While one enemy castle can give you about 1000 gold (if you are lucky because people jealously guard their treasure) you need 26k to upgrade your portal (allows summoning new creatures), 20k or so to upgrade your research lab (allows improving existing creatures), 85k to upgrade your blacksmith to be able to make level 24-29 stuff (armor, weapons, jewelry), any piece of equipment costs between 18k and 40k. So basically you rely on drops.\n\nIf you are frustrated by dying a lot in other people’s castles, there are NPC castles, which are somewhat easy. And then there is a hidden feature: you can buy loot and potions (you cannot buy castle upgrades) with blings. For instance, if you don’t have enough gold, you press Buy button in the blacksmith shop and you see the option to purchase the item with blings. So those are useful.\n\nEarning blings in the game is slow: they are only given by taking part in competitions (25 for a spot close to the top) and completing quests (one per zone). Buy them? They will not make your progression too easy but you will definitely be able to wear a complete set of gear proper for your level the way the developers probably intended.\n\nSlow levelling\nEven with blings that allow you to buy one-hour (real time, not in-game time, so don’t alt-tab out) 50% boosts for magic find, gold find, and XP levelling will be slow. But then why do I need to level? Raiding some bosses at lvl30? Some cooperative gameplay? No idea. Maybe there is nothing at the top except the ability to build your castle the way you want and stuff it with monsters and traps.","February 26, 2014","false","66.3"," 190 of 265 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","190","265","0","9"

You have the Diablo style attacking system, where you simply attack and try to find cool loot. And a tower-defense style defending to protect your loot.\n\nOnly issue is the attacking isn't very fun. You unock a new skill every level until level 13, after which your abilities recieve lousy upgrades that aren't noticed in game. To find loot you need to grind for hours, and the loot isn't very "epic", just higher stats, which again, won't have a huge impact on your game. If you enjoy attacking/looting play Diablo or Borderlands, this game does not have a good attack system.\n\nThe defending is a super neat concept, and got my attention personally. However the balancing for the creatures in your castles isn't well-managed, which leads to player castles being super repetitive and not very fun to attack. They've introduced "wanted" creatures recently which adds variety to the game, but they're just securing these players who pay a stronger position.\n\nEven though I wouldn't recommend this game, however, I continue to come back to the game, as I have since Alpha, in hopes that this company gets the game into a good condition!","November 10, 2014","false","294.3"," 167 of 232 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","167","232","11","0"

Well because it is, paying will make a difference from the start to the end (check my amount of hours played, i have all heroes lvl 30).\nWhy is it pay to win ? Because in low lvls, having the inifity pack giving you a boss in your castle will make a real difference.\nIn higher lvls, paying will give you things you will NEVER be able to get without paying, and by never i don't mean you need more hours of playing, i simply mean you will NEVER have the same things than a paying guy.\nAnd, i'm not talking about skins or useless things, it's all about the BEST ingame traps and mobs.\n\nI know, most of people say it's all about pets or skins, but no, it isn't.\nActually if you start the game now, you won't be able to craft the best ingame traps and mobs, and your castle won't be able to really stop players. It's because of the "wanted" traps and mobs, that have been available few days during the passed years, and are now impossible to craft. It means you can get them only by paying (infinity pack or steam market).\n\nThat drives me to my next point, the steam market.\nPeople will say "if you play during months/years, they sometimes give back the super traps/mobs to craft during few days".\nWell yeah, it's true, as an exemple during this week i was able to craft the fire walls, one of the best def traps.\nBut i was able to craft 2 of them, because of the limited amount of craft on wanted items.\nThat simple means that even if i play 20 years, everyday to this game, the max amount of fire wall i'll have is 2 (since there is no trade ingame, all you can get without paying is your self crafted items).\nBut you can easy find guys with 3, 4, or even more fire walls in their castle. Well placed it can make a castle way harder than mine.\nWhy do they have more fire walls than me ?\nBecause of this http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=239220#p2_quantity_desc\nYou can buy and sell every wanted things in the steam market. It means that a paying guy will be able to get any wanted he wants, as soon as he starts the game (he doesn't need to wait (months/years) until they are available to craft). That makes the game pay to win in low lvls (having a boss and few nice traps will make a HARD difference in low lvls).\nAnd in higher lvls, the same paying guy can buy the amount of wanted items he wants. Thats is making the game pay to win in high lvls (because yeah, having your castle full of the best wanted items will make a real and strong difference with your not paid castle, even if you play some years and can get 1-2 of them).\n\nAll in all, this is still a cool game for tower defense players like me. I can't vote "yes" because of the pay to win system, but if you are a casual player just wanting to have some fun running castles and trying to build your own, it still can be cool.","March 7, 2015","false","398.6"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","57","65","4","0"

And it's a shame, too, because at its basic level it's very fun. You build and design trap- and monster-filled castles, and then go raid other people's castles. There are no pay-gates artificially limiting those things, so I was initially pleased. If you do particularly well raiding someone's castle, you even have a small chance to earn random paid items! So Pay 2 Win didn't really seem to apply to the core game at all.\n\nWhen one gets to the higher levels and higher leagues, however, that illusion crumbles. The difference between a moderately challenging castle and a murder-castle is that the murder-castle is stocked exclusively with special traps and monsters that a F2P player cannot reasonably obtain, and certainly not in anything approaching the quantities required. These traps and monsters are contained primarily in purchased packs, and they are universally and objectively superior to the "regular" traps and monsters that are earned and crafted in-game. Most high-lethality trap systems and the supporting monsters needed to kill opposing heroes are impossible to build or even emulate using F2P in-game earnings.\n\nIn short, if you want to win, you have to pay; and the more you pay, the more ability you have to win. It's a loathsomely slimy model, wherein players who haven't bought some kind of paid pack or who haven't bought enough of them are effectively sheep to be harvested by the players who've paid 30, 40, 50 dollars. New players are "fattened" by the pleasant leveling up experience and enjoyable gameplay amongst other new players, and then butchered upon running into the high-level pay wall.\n\nA fascinating game, ruined by underhanded pay modelling.

I still see many problems with it but it is a good game to play for a hour or two each day and it actually quite enjoyable. They fixed a lot of the problems in making your own castle and changed the game  from pay to win to non pay to win which is a huge improvement. A problem with the game is that it is quite repetitive but it is the kind of game you play for a hour or two each day like the apps on your phones. Overall I can recommend this game as a good time waster.\n\nREVIEW BEFORE UPDATE\nI really wish I could recommend I honestly do but I can't. The game is VERY fun at first but quickly the game gets repetitive. There really isn't much to the game besides attacking castle and building your own. I understand this game is in beta and early access but a game should at least have more to it than this. They say this is MMO but you don't actually interact with other players, you just attack eachothers castles. I'm sure this game will be great once they update it with more content but for now do not bother playing.","January 1, 2014","true","59.4"," 575 of 935 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","575","935","0","12"

Free players have a 2,000 gold limit and when you get past level 10 gear costs goes past 3,000 gold. You cant even progress in this game without paying money. Plus  you have to play so much money to be good in this game, Free players don't even have a chance to play this game because it's either pay Ubisoft loads of money or get dragged into a maze of OP dungeons. It's like Obisoft sending a big middle finger to everyone who plays this game. If it wasnt for this game being such a money hog and be a little more accepting of free players. this game may have been 1 of the best games on steam. Instead you got developers who care more about there pockets then there player community.

Same like with all of Ubisoft`s recent unfinished games!"\n\n"Dont start playing it if you are not willing to spend 20-50 Euros to have a good castle defense!"\n\n"A great example of how easily f2p games can turn into p2w."\n\n"Ubisoft should have given us a credit card alongside the game..."\n\n"What I would say about the game, you ask me? Well, if you will already use that in your review, let me describe you the game in 3 words: UBISOFT, UBISOFT, UBIF*CKED."\n\n"Just when I thought: Finally an enjoyable strategy ♥♥♥♥♥♥me, where everyone has the same chances.. Bamm... Ubisoft and their "Lets get as much money out of the stupid costumers as possible" marketing strategy!"\n\n\nMy final thoughts:\nI will still keep playing this game, because the attacking part is not f*cked up yet, it s actually really enjoyable seeing p2w castles with more than 70% win ratio burn and i want my clan to get into the Top 5 or at least into the Top 10! :) (Current rank: 15, Name: GymCyan) (12.2.2015)\n\n\n\nI AM HONESTLY NOT SURE IF I SHOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME OR NOT, BUT I WILL PROBABLY CLICK YES, BECAUSE FOR ME IT IS STILL A GOOD AND ENJOYABLE GAME AND IM STILL HOPING UBISOFT WILL MAKE CHANGES ON THE GAME! :)\n\nI really hope this review or rather critics to Ubisoft helped you out by deciding whether to download this game or not.\nIf it did please leave a thumbs up, so more people can read and agree/or disagree on my opinion!","February 15, 2015","true","394.7"," 63 of 104 people (61%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","61","63","104","16","0"

Epic Loot.\nI've been playing the Earl of Evilosity, and will be reviewing the game from the experience I had with him.\nI got to Level 27 at the current moment, and I've got a pretty sweet setup.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n-easy access. If I were in the mood for a good raid (or ten), I'll just click on a castle, attack it and try kill everything instead of vice-versa.\n\n-two ways to play the game. If you aren't interested in castle raiding, do not despare! You can always work on your defenses, however it my be a challenge acquiring the resources for it with only mines.\nIf you aren't at all interested in defensive gameplay, you don't have to worry about it. You'll be able to solely play offensively. Again, not entirely recommended, but doable.\n\n-loot! The super-rare EPIC items are a wonderful find when seen laying on the ground, in their purple glory. The satisfaction of looting a castle with 3 stars is undescribable.\n\n-spell generosity. With 3 sets of abilities/spells, you always have a choice. whether it's a CC setup, or a hard-hitting single-target setup, you will never be lost for combinations.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n-lack of information. I get a new Legendary hood with glee. after the raid, I look at its enchantments, to find "Control resistance - 20%". What on earth is that? Does it reduce time of stuns/snares/binds? Granted, this isn't with everything, as something like "Raise dead - level 18" is kinda self-explanatory. It'd be great to have tooltips explaining different enchantments.\nThis is also true for the character choice. You're pretty much going in blind as it doesn't give much information. This isn't a major problem, since out of my 4 friends, 2 went with mage, 2 went with warrior and 1 went with archer, we're all very happy with our choices.\n\n-malice/lack of regulation in player-castles. I'll be enjoying a good raid, when I get tackled by a Cyclops onto a springboard. This flings me into a 5x5 grid of fire pots. I had no way of escaping it and it feels malicious instead of crafty. Traps need to be made to have a minimum distance apart so as to make them survivable.\nOn the other hand, Joe Average here has filled his castle up with chickens. A few AoE spells and I'm finished. It took me 20 seconds, it took him 3 minutes. It seems like he doesn't put any effort into it. To combat this, I'd like to see highly-rated castles appear first before low-rated ones.\n\nAll in all, I enjoy every moment of it, and while it does have its problems, I would honestly give it a 7/10.","April 3, 2014","true","98.6"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","22","33","0","0"

Even better, Mighty Quest supports an unobtrusive free-to-play model, although a few drawbacks threaten to send this airborne lootfest crashing from the sky.\nStupid fun, though not particularly groundbreaking.

So I would recommend basic reading skills before randomly clicking everything instead of reading the instructions.\nThe tutorial is very easy and quickly learns you the basics so it's easy to start playing for real fast.\n\nJudging by the forum people don't seem to grasp taking 5 seconds reading properly during character creation, even though it's plainly and clearly stated that you only get ONE free hero, then you need to use BLING (in game premium currency) to get more. This makes you want to earn bling to unlock more, but it takes a while due to them costing 950 each.\nI would love for an option to delete your hero and start over with any class if you picked one you didn't like, but this can't be done to my knowledge yet. (I haven't seen the option, but I can be wrong.)\n\nWhen you come to about level 14+ the game takes a turn for the worse, almost every player castle are just filled with springboard+firebomb trap or something equaly instant deadly and loads of Zekes (a powerful ranger unit) that can focus really deadly shoots on your hero.\n\nI really liked my early time in the game and hope it will get more balanced since going from 400+ crowns (a player score that ranks you) down to around 200 because of springboard traps and Zekes really make the funny feeling go away.\n\nOverall early game score 8/10 that can maybe become a 10/10 after Beta stage.\n","March 9, 2014","true","21.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Players may feel cheated everytime a castle has a seemingly impossible design.\n\nPlayers should be ready to attempt a castle over and over again, trying different approaches until you've become confident that you will beat it when you see it again (see problem 2 below). You are not penalized after your first failure but instead rewards you nicely once you've managed to beat a castle. It helps to see the game as an interactive puzzle.\n\n2. Most castles are derivatives of each other which can make the game exhausting.\n\nThis problem will vanish once you have figured out several ways to beat the repetitions. You may even make a more foolproof version for your own. I personally find joy in creating a trap-puzzle game that only has one approach as a solution, and I don't get all the ideas by myself.\n\n*This is a tentative review after reaching level 18 (in a week) with highest point being at ~700 crowns.\n**These are presented more as opinianated guidelines rather than facts.\n\nHope you can take what you need from this review.","March 16, 2014","true","92.4"," 64 of 113 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","64","113","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/datto/recommended/239220/","datto","Datto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/datto/","48 products in account","I recommend at least checking out this game, since it's free to play.  In case you haven't read any other reviews and know nothing about this game, it's an ARPG/Dungeon Crawler where you get to create your own dungeon (castle) and go attack other people's dungeons.\n\nThere are 4 classes, the Knight, Mage and Archer and the Runaway (the Runaway costs money at the moment, but I've heard it'll be free later).  Each comes with 12 skills that you can interchange as you so choose.  The objective is to go loot other people's castles while simultaneously making your own castle tough to beat so you can protect your stuff.  There are a few pre-made castles, but they are incredibly easy for the most part, although they do have some decent rewards.\n\nYou can upgrade your castle with traps and monsters and you can upgrade THOSE traps and monsters with Life Force and Gold.  But the costs can get pretty overwhelming later if you're not playing a couple of times per day.  This is not a game that is meant to be played for hours on end, although you can certainly do that should you so choose.  I feel like it's meant for players to log on, loot their mines, run a few castles, update theirs and come back later for a little more.  That's how I've been playing and I'm not burnt out on around 20~ hours of playing.\n\nThe biggest issue at the moment is the castle defense meta once you get to the "mid-game."\n\nCurrently, the castle defense meta of open beta is one of the following three: lots of traps set up in a way that instantly kill you OR stacking all of the toughest enemies (or should I say enemy, because there's really only one that people use, an archer with a devastating triple shot attack) in the very last room of your dungeon OR a hybrid combo of traps set up in a way that deal a ton of damage to you while also aggroing multiple copies of the toughest enemy in the game.  While incredibly effective, it is not fun to play against, but you can't help but use the setup because you don't want people stealing from your castle.  I'm a level 19 Knight at the moment, but I've been seeing these kinds of setups since the early teens and it gets incredibly monotonous and frustrating.\n\nHOWEVER, the devs know about this issue and balance changes are coming (or are already here if you're reading this review post-update).  Will those changes make the game more fun?  Maybe.  But if you don't want to check out the game now because of those issues and would rather wait, that's understandable.  I still recommend at least trying it out, you have nothing to lose.\n\nI have not paid a cent for anything thus far and feel like I am progressing just fine.  The microtransactions are pretty much limited to gold/lifeforce/xp boosts and cosmetics.  You can't buy power in this game.","March 7, 2014","true","23.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Players always bring out their opinions when something negative happens in their opinion, but when something changes for better they rarely feel neccessary to voice their opinion.\n\nTo bring out my opinion, to say that game was ruined in that overhaul patch is very misleading. For starters, resetting the characters and castles was of course not nice, but it is not very uncommon to reset game progress while game is in beta state, although it was wrong on Ubisoft's part to inform players that there are no plans of resetting the game. Concerning the changes made to the game itself, I think that forcing the player to validate his castle before publishing it is definitely a good thing. I would not like to attack a player castle that has been designed with impossibility of survival in mind, it has to be proven that castle can actually be completed as there are otherwise quite few things limiting how a castle may be built.\n\nAnd yeah, it seems that putting a new character behind payment is a bit harsh, but after all this was the practice with wizard in a previous beta state after all. Plainly put, players are not neccessarily missing out from a lot of content as the character in question itself is still in testing state and not finished, and besides items for that character can still be looted even before purchasing it. And Ubisoft has said that character mentioned will be available for purchase later with in-game money.\n\nThat's about it. This game is in my opinion already in quite playable state as bugs are actively being fixed by the dev team and in-game purchases are not really required to be successful in game.","March 9, 2014","true","26.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

Quite frankly I think the attack/defense system was a good way to remix this formula into something that has more substance.\n\nAttack! or die horribly\nLooting castles is pretty fun when the plan goes well but on the bright side you can still get stars for beating the time. The stars are just 3 general challenges you must complete in order to get more crowns from the other players. The number of stars are ranked on something that can be universally applied to any castle which is a nice way to go about it.\n\nDefense! or lose all your resources\nYou don’t really lose all your resources just like near 1/10 or something of it maybe more. I generally found myself not really caring for being robbed alot because your castle gets defenses up after that for 12 hours of protection. They can steal your crowns but not anything more that would be hurtful to you building.\n\nIn order for other players to play against the new defense you set, you must beat your own castle! It is rather an interesting concept which allows players to run their castle multiple times until they have a great time set for other players to challenge themselves against.\n\nLoot the name of the Game! Literally\nLoot is pretty good in this game, though I wish you could use the pet settings that allow you to fetch only certain type levels of items for your own character. It would just be great not to have my inventory to be cluttered by junk items. The loot drop rate is splendid compared to many other games I rather not mention which make you grind for hours...days...weeks for any hope at a nice legendary item and this game gave me two in a day.\n\nThe loot is also very varied in the benefits you get from them, since they also have certain skills and properties.\n\nOne is a Lonely Number\nYou can only select one hero to unlock at the start and you have to either complete achievements to accumulate the shop points to buy another one or you have to just dish out real life cash for it. I would strongly advise you look at the playstyles on youtube of the characters before making a decision heading into this game. They are all of course viable to get through the game with so suit one that best compliments your play style.\n\nHopefully they will also add some co-op to this game! Though seeing as how that would only work with npc castles which would need to be rebalanced. It would be alot more work to rebalance if they were able to co-op player castles. Seeing as how the time set so far by players have been purely solo so far, people who don’t co-op would be in a huge disadvantage to protecting their castles!\n\nConclusion\nA rather fun game for looting and building your own castle as a result. There is a good amount of customization for how many rooms you can add. Alot of people who liked torchlight or diablo will indeed like this game if they don’t mind that the other characters are locked unless you pay for them or earn enough in-game to get them from achievements and events. I am looking forward to seeing how the developers expand this game and possibly add co-op in a way that doesn't hurt the solo players.","March 7, 2014","true","22.9"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","72","0","4"

There is no extra Uplay download or Uplay overlay like Windows Live. Some people hate Uplay and if you're one of them, this game is flat out not for you. For everyone else, keep reading.\n\nThis is a surprisingly good Diablo style hack & slash game with unlimited content generated by players. The game is divided into two halves, the Attack half which is Diablo style, where you wander around dungeons from a 3/4ths top down perspective. You kill a variety of enemies, search for dungeon treasuries and mana pools and beware of traps. Each dungeon is pretty bite sized which is good. You level up, equip things and assign skills to your character that is one of your typical classes, Archer, Knight and Mage.\n\nThe other half is the Defend, because you see, you have your own dungeon. The game easily tells you what you need to do, with some very nice voice over. With your dungeon, you have a gold mine to generate gold when you're not looting dungeons, you have a mana pool to get mana when you're not looting. With the gold, you buy rooms for your dungeon and buy better weapons and armor. The catch is that armor and weapons are so abundant playing the game, you never really have to buy them. You will also get summon portals for monsters, a research facility, potion brewing station, blacksmith, treasury and mana reserve. Everything is upgradeable for either mana or gold. However, to upgrade to level X your dungeon heart must be at level X. Other areas have prerequisites too, but you'll get the hang of it very easily.\n\nBefore you can make some ultimate dungeon, you really need to upgrade your dungeon heart and then your architect's station to build more rooms. You start with a default of 3 cookie cutter areas (giant rooms) that make up your dungeon. You can quickly add another area, but your dungeon will not be giant, at least at first. Once you have your rooms / areas, you put your mana pools and gold mines. These are placed away from your heart, basically so players can find them when they play through your dungeon. With everything set up, you can buy creatures and traps for mana. Your traps require power supplies. Your traps and mana can have overall upgrades. You can even assign behaviors for enemies, such as charging cyclopes or ground pounding cyclopes. There is a nice variety of enemies.\n\nThe only way to let players play your dungeon is to test play and complete it yourself. Each dungeon has a star factor, such as destroy the mana vault and gold mine without dying to get one star. The game assigns a par time to your dungeon, which might be your own time beating the dungeon when you test it. Beat the par time and get another star or two.\n\nNow for the downside, with all of the user generated dungeons, there are often enemy bottlenecks. It starts with a series of extremely undisarmable traps, followed by a giant pool of creatures in one area. Some areas go smoothly and its enjoyable to plow through everything. But once you get far enough in, there are just waves of giant monsters that block your path and take a while to kill, since everything is massed all in one area by most players. The archers kill pretty quickly, so they tend to be a priority. There are creatures that resurrect others or summon giant skeletons that make things annoying.\n\nIf you die, you either restart the dungeon or for a 100 gold fee (cheap once you get further in the game), you can be resurrected. There doesn't seem to be any sort of exit from a dungeon. Well the button is there (open beta problem?), you just can't click on it. If you are defeated, you lose crowns, if you win, you gain crowns. Crowns seem to be rankings of players that are currently playing. Such as if you find user created dungeons with 0 crowns, chances are their dungeons are just being beaten over and over again. Which lowers their crowns. Players with 100 - 200 crowns are actively playing at that moment.\n\nThere's a very nice visual interface when you select dungeons. You can tell how difficult a dungeon is by looking at its stats or just by its level. If a dungeon is 2 levels higher than you, the game will warn you. The stats are nice. If you're looking for gold, you can see how much is in that dungeon. If you're looking for experience, it is all right there in the stats. Once you have really maxed out your dungeon and need to level up the dungeon heart, you need to level up your character, which is where the stats are important, I would rather go into 10 dungeons with 1,500 XP than 30 dungeons with 500 XP.\n\nThere are thankfully several non user generated dungeons including a boss dungeon of a region. While there is a recommended level for a region, it is not required. Regions are marked with levels like the 2nd region is for players 5 - 9. These official dungeons are marked with green on the selection screen while player dungeons are yellow.\n\nThis also leads to a competitive factor. If one player beats your dungeon, well then there's a challenge to beat that player's dungeon. It feels highly addictive if not highly competitive while still keeping a single player feel. There are even dungeon races to see who can complete the game with the fastest time. When you stop playing the game, your dungeon is 'shielded' for 8 hours. Others can run through your dungeon, but not get your mega earnings. So if you grind for 2 hours, max out on gold and mana, then leave for 8 hours, chances are someone will beat your dungeon and take all of your gold and mana. That's why I highly recommend spending everything you have before you leave. You will still gain gold and mana from your gold mine and mana pools. You can and will be farmed if you are not 'shielded,' but when you are farmed, it resets your shield for another 8 hours. Thus giving your mana and gold time to build up again to be farmed again.\n\nNow for some other downsides, this game is dark. There are exterior room areas that dungeons can use, but to be honest, light makes everything so much easier, so it is in a dungeon maker's best interest to have an interior dungeon. Sometimes walls get in the way, even if there is transparency with them.\n\nThe controls don't feel all that good. It is a very clicky game. Click to move, click to attack once. You do not continuously attack once an enemy is clicked. Maybe some prefer it that way, but I don't. There are no key re bindings. Setting enemies in your dungeon is very tedious. Placing the enemies is super easy, but then you need to rotate them one click at a time. Having to click and drag to move your screen in your dungeon design also doesn't feel good. I'd rather use the arrow keys to move the screen. Instead the arrows just rotate the screen.\n\nThe other problem I have are only 5 quick action slots. While I cannot imagine needing 9 skills, I need potions. In fact when you bind potions to a quick action, you only get to use 4 for that slot. Even if you have 99 potions. I can understand the logic in having only 4 potions per slot, since you're competing against the dungeon maker. Your right mouse click attack is also bound to one of the 5 quick action slots so that's just a wasted slot.\n\nFinally, there are micro transactions for cosmetic items and booster packs like boost your XP, gold or mana, but you also get some free micro transaction currency for progressing through the game, so that's not bad. Its free with a mere 500 MB download, give it a try.","February 26, 2014","true","11.0"," 107 of 194 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","107","194","0","5"

This review is coming from a collection of players i met in game and friends of mine that play this as well:\n\nPros\n-Base building\n-Crafting system\n-Humor\n\nCons\n-Extreme lag when too many units/traps are around\n-Loss of control, unresponsive to keybinds at times\n-Base building system is far too restricted early on\n-Currency system is unbalanced and confusing, making you feel like you are doing something wrong, or even missing something when you have far too much of one currency, and not much of the other.\n-Crafting system for your castle/base and your hero is far too restricted as well, i beat the game and still only was able to craft 2 out of all the many boss monsters; unless you pay them to give you materials*\n-Clunky interface; becomes a vicious cycle when trying to navigate your castle contruction, hero loadout and choosing other player castles to attack; pressing ESC doesn't close any windows, just brings up a laggy menu screen; selecting objects throughout the game becomes difficult when unwanted tooltip windows pop up and block everything you want to see.\n-You collect hoardes of garbage and have minimal inventory space; unless you pay them to expand it*\n-Game can't close correctly and frequently causes artifacts on the desktop\n-Has issues detecting sound devices plugged in/changed launch\n\n*Constantly seeking your money at every turn like a begger on the streets. If you aren't paying a LOT of money for in-game purchases, then you are going to be walked all over upon by those that frequently do.

This is a seriously fun and challenging game, and the new patch allowed complete freedom with designing castles rather than limiting you to place things in certain areas only. People will argue this took strategy out of the game and made castles ridiculously hard and overpowered, but honestly, it's really not. Keep your potions handy and don't think you can get through a castle just by doing click attack and spamming the same move constantly. I'll admit, some of the castles players make do look cheap and powerful, but I've been able to beat them regardless, because you can't take on any castle that the player theirself haven't beaten. That keeps them all balanced to a certain degree. Anyways, that is about as far as the multiplayer goes though, attacking other character's castles. There's no actual co-op or versus modes other than that, so at most it's just something fun to fiddle around with and see what sort of neat defense you can make and beat.","March 19, 2014","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

In other words you'll be running these dungeons solo, and raiding other player castles solo, and taking all the loot solo after 20+ min boss battles (Don't try to get go up against one that is 10 levels higher, it's possible but ffs it's not economic).\n\nAny-case the game is fun for the first 15 levels then shortly realizing that's all there is too it. The mobs slightly change with slightly different abilities and the same castle walls. There's not even a second floor, it's just one flat hallway run to boss and treasure room.\n\nDungeon creation seemed interesting and the playbacks of watching other people suffer your horrific green halls of slime and gerble death wheels gets some enjoyment. The fallback strategy everyone seems to be using is using trap floors in a tiny corridor that springs your victim into either a mob pile or a minefield of bombs. This is way to effective for it's own good unfortunately as the mob layout/makeup is a bland smashed group on the other side of the trap field.\n\nIf your bored, this is worth a try. The lack of anyform of party systems to help muster through the tedious mobs and dungeons may not make this enjoyable.\n\nOther tid bits:\nOnce a class is chosen you have to pay to use the other characters.\n\nChanging your castle's look costs money.\n\nProtect your harvesters!\n\nStill has a buggy inventory system, if it fails to work a restart should fix it.\n\nCan not change gear or drop loot once a raid has started.\n\nShift + left click allows you to attack while holding still.\n\nCtrl + left click allows you to move without attacking.\n\nYou can't rebind any hotkeys.\n\nMake sure to have a specialized mob group for certain character classes (i.e. golems against mage class as they have high magic defense.)\n\nIf you don't want to do anything fancy just trap the place up, set chain of trap floors to vault your intruder indefinitely.","February 28, 2014","true","113.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

When you attack NPC castles, you won't really have much of a problem untill later on.\non the multiplayer gameplay; you have a rating system of stars, three in total. to get 1: reach the treasury without dying, to get 2: loot all of the mines (you have to build mines to provide a constant source of gold and "lifeforce".). To get the 3rd star: you to beat the defender's time (when you edit your castle, you have to build rooms, summon monsters and validate the castle when you're done, when you validate it, it will set a time attackers have to beat to get 3 stars.).\n\nThe only bad point is that there are microtransactions and people can pay to win which i find really annoying, but since it's free, it's kinda expected.\n\nas a whole, i'd give this game a 7/10... thanks ubisoft, it's still a good game. :)","March 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","2"

The idea raiding other players castles they put traps and monsters into has tons of potential. The way the make it so you really do not lose much when you are raided is a nice touch. The one major problem I have with this game is this: Attack and move should not be the same damn button! When you get higher in levels players put tons of monster and traps and such all over the place. Sometimes to defeat certain defences you have to kill certain monsters first. This is very hard to do when the game seems to think you want to move instead of attack. I have literally watched my character circle a monster twice refusing to attack :-(. The frustraiting controls aside this game is actually quite fun, but can get repetative quickly. I am on the fence for this one, I like it and hate it, good for something casual just to pass the time.","March 5, 2014","true","32.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The validation was definitely needed as making grindable/impossible dungeons was not enjoyable at all. I feel as a F2P title some things are unobtainable as a free player which is never fun but it doesn't seem to go over the top with it either.\n\nThe one complaint I fully agree with is repetitiveness, this is very true. You can only customize so much and make your dungeon so unique and with common layouts and mob strategys it leaves for a very bland experience if you plan on grinding day in day out.\n\nWhat this game is great for is the casual morning game every now and then. I would not take it seriously, it is not the next Path of Exile. It's simpily a game that is fun to play, easy to learn, and has quite a bit to offer.\n\nOverall 7/10\n\nI appreciate that the devs tried to bring something new to the dungeon crawling genre, and it is actually quite enjoyable. But in terms of replayability, gameplay falls short as you left cusomization up to the community.\n\nI did a first look video if you would like to see some gameplay as well.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3aFAGMxOYUk","March 9, 2014","true","5.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Now that the wipes are over, let me finally recommend this great F2P game. There have been many positive changes since closed beta including (baffling) less lousy F2P time based mechanics. It appears that many of the build timers have been completely taken out of the game (at my level anyway) and earning the 2 non-premium currencies is relatively easy. Think of this game as a hybrid between Diablo and Dungeon Keeper (not the crappy iOS one).\n\nYou build a castle and cram it full of rooms, traps, and mobs for other players to challenge. Then you go out and do the same. The low level play is appropriately welcoming, but I've seen Youtube vids of higher level castles and the challenges are definitely there. The whole affair has a very addictive "one more castle" mentality but it's extremely easy to just play for a few minutes, which is one of the major detractors of both Diablo and Dungeon Keeper which require a decent time investment each time you play.\n\nYou don't have to pay a dime to try it out, so come raid my castle already!","March 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 39 of 68 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","39","68","0","3"

There really isn't a cooldown on attacking unless you want to attack specific people in that case you have a limit that refreshes after some time, but that doesn't hold you back really at all.\n\nAs the defence side you will probably always want more loot i mean its part of the title, but theres been more than one occasion where i've had more loot than i could actually spend because i didn't attack enough to upgrade some things. Dont get me wrong by thinking this is a bad thing because its not. This just means that by playing the game i was able to get enough of the ingame money to actually be able to progress so no dungenkeeper bs here.\n\nI fully recommend this game as it is fun and have a great balance to the game that won't penalize you for not wanting to pay money if you can get this game and try it theres no harm in even that.\n","July 12, 2014","true","17.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Thus creating a dungeon building simulator (filling it monsters and traps) and a dungeon crawler at the same time.   The premise of the game revolves around "defending" your own castle from other players, while venturing forth to attack other people's castle. All in the ultimate goal of getting -better- loot. This is where the game kinda falls a notch or two for me. Loot system is a battle of the numbers.Also it follows the formula that has been implanted in most people , grey, blue, purple and orange rarity. For example, you can get a sword that does 1.1 damage or a sword that does 1.3 damage, and so forth. Exterior of the weapons changes ever slightly , maybe a color change or a slight tlint. Overall as a game that emphasizes EPIC loot it falls short ,but hopefully in future intergration they would actually implement loot thats worthy of the title( Like a gun that shoots Octopi at people and tentacle restrains them for 10 seconds while squirting ink all over them costing 1 DoT)\n\n7/10","February 27, 2014","true","13.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DNBSmooth/recommended/239220/","DNBSmooth","Levi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DNBSmooth/","257 products in account","So I decided to write this review after seeing so many people complain about "oh my castle got raided and I lost all my crowns" as well as "Pay to win is just to real, cashers have the advantage". This caused me to not download this game for a long time just based off reviews.\n\nThese reviews are BULLS***! "Cashers have the advantage", sure they get more stuff then you eairly on in the game, but at NO POINT does it make their dungeon impossible (especially if you ever play games like Dark Souls, The Witcher, and Diablo).\nFrom what Iv seen cashers just get a few bosses without having to earn them (Yes, you can earn everything in the game as far as Iv seen besides some cosmetics). Since you can earn anything that would give you a gameplay advantage,\nthat means cashing only lets you get ahead of new players, NO PAY TO WIN IS IN THIS GAME.\n\nNow on to the "my castle got raided and I lost all my stuff" this means one of two things.\n\nA. your castle is losing CONSTANTLY, and by constantly I mean around 75% of the time. This means your castle sucks goku's dragon balls so you just need to work on your ♥♥♥♥.\nB. You have to many crowns for your castle's skill level because you raid weaker dungeons to get crowns, and have them taken away by raiders.\n\nTo me, the crowns are like an Elo system for ranking. The more you have from raiding as well as the more wins your castle racks up, the more you earn, the higher your rank. So if you get say 1k crowns, but have a level 11 castle, people are going to F*** UP YOUR CASTLE FOR EASY CROWNS.\n\nI just started playing, made a castle that is really tough, and so far my castle's win rate is >60%. This has resulted in my not losing crowns as much, so when I log back in I can just earn the little I lost, and keep going.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, while you should not completly ignore the negative reveiws, they are VERY overblown thanks to the same "entitled children" that downvote any game on steam that ask for money. I mean god forbid ubisoft offer's the option for their free game to make money.... those dirty bast****....\n\nAnyway if you Like Diablo style games and have skill to deal with cashers (yes they can be easily beaten with skill, Iv prooved this time and again with my runs), then get this game. You will enjoy it and get a good 100+ hours out of it, I know I will!","July 1, 2015","true","270.4"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","1"

At first hand, I loved it. It had that RPGMMO feeling that had always pleased me ever since I started gaming. Me, as a closed beta participant, and before the game came out on steam, I liked it, I really did, and I would've rated this a 10/10 if there were more things to do. I'm gonna be getting the basics of the game, what you do in it, and why I rate this a thumbs down.\nFirst of all, you're in a floating castle, which is obviously yours. Your main purpose in the game is to, well, attack and raid other people's castles for "Epic Loot". There are also levels, which each new level reached, will thus allow you to further upgrade your castle's defense, your character himself, and other various features. Theirs various obstacles that you can put in your own castle.\nThis game is massively multiplayer, which in my opinion, is the most fun and enjoying type of the game catagories. After you finish the noticably long tutorial, you set out to attack other player's castles, and like in other games, theirs trophies, or crowns I should say.\nWhat got me to play this game were the pictures, not the video. The trailer has NOTHING to do with the gameplay. All the video has to offer is some amateur showoff who thinks hes good and boringly talks through the trailer.\n\nNow I'm gonna list the good ol' Pros and Cons.\nThe Pros:\n-Decent graphics\n-Interesting gameplay\n-Custom game mechanics\n-Levels for your character\n-A variety of different kinds of gear\nThe Cons:\n-Same repetitive gameplay\n-Filled with big spenders/P2Ws\n-Unbalanced, higher experianced players can destroy your castle\n-Later endgame upgrades are intensively expensive\n-Most, if not all things in this game can be bought with IRL money\n-Some weapons drops are RIDICULOUSLY rare and will most likely require hours of farming.\n-In order to not get bored at the game in a week, you have to buy different heros for IRL money.\n-The level capacity is relatively low, at 30, in which I got to level 20 in just 2-3 weeks of gameplay.\n-Attack, raid, upgrade, repeat.\n-Controls need a bit of fixing, same as scrolling.\n\nThe game is highly repetitive in terms of gameplay. You find a good raid, you attack, you accomplish, you upgrade little things, and you repeat until you realised you've wasted hours, and hopefully not, days of your life. Another thing to not about, isn't just simply entering the game and play enough? Well, apparently not, because "Uplay" wants another account. This game is very heavy on the P2W. About 7/10 of the players that attack my castle are the big spenders who will usually dominate my defense. Another thing I dislike about this game is that you just watch your castle get raided.\n\nOverall, I would highly unrecommend this game. 2/10 would I rather grind my balls on a splintery spiky chunk of wood than play this game again.","March 21, 2015","false","20.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","7","9","4","0"

Heres why.\n\n1) I played the beta, and the minion shop was good... now its steem item that most of the "good" minions are eather expensive in RL money or just out of range of casual players .\n(Or might not I've stoped playing since the launch because thats when they did that swich.)\n\n2) All minions that I had from Beta where deleted and I've never got them back... but I was fine with that, till #1 made me Rage quit.\n\n3) It's be came mostly Pay-to-win, (They my have added new options since I've quit) The best items rather it be Minions, Traps, Or even the peaces/Upgrades for your doungeon, are all more or less for sale for RL money.\n\n4) Equips... most of it can be found in Another's doungeon. The PvE doungeons where scaled properly in beta, but are now more "Come back @lv30" for a lv10 PvE Doungeon. Also, Drops for your Starting Toon have become MUCH less frequent which is one of the few resons why its a 3 and not a 2. (This too could have bin changed since I've quit)\n\nSome of you might be confused at why my scale only gos up to 7... This is due to the odd number makeing so that there can be a middle ground, a place where good can balance the bad. And for the fact that 1 is lowest in my scale.\n\n*Sorry for any spelling errors or misplaced CAPS, And feel free to completly dis-reguard thisreview if you disagree.

All about money and buying extra slots for extra characters I presume. That's how I see it and I highly disapprove.\n\nBut aside from that, from what I remember in the beta, TMQFEL was pretty much fun to play either alone or with/against friends. The game is definitely worth playing (duh, that's why I wanted to play it again myself), however, no option of staring over is inacceptable to me and I had to drop the idea of playing... and mark my opinion as negative.\n\nIf you haven't played it and you like the screenshots, videos, etc. you should definitely give it a try - it is, indeed, a nice and funny connection of Diablo and Dungeon Keeper.

This means that the hours displayed here does not show my entire experience.\n\nType of game: 3rd person dungeon runner / dungeon master - Casual gamer appeal.\nYou have two different playstyles in this game. You either raid dungeons made by NPCs or players, for gold, that is  spent on upgrading your own hero or your own castle.\nAlternatively you devote your time maximizing your own defenses against the raids from other players, seeking to steal your treassures.\nThe game somewhat requires you to explore both playstyles.\n\nGraphics, Audio and controls:\nThe game looks nice, feels nice - and sounds nice. I'd probably give it a 10/10 on this.\n\nReview: The first 7-8 levels are the most fun you will have in this game, but in turn it is challenging and enjoyable.\nIn the beginning levels you will see a wide range of dungeons, some which are challenging, some are easy - and some downright impossible. This started very fun and was utmost enjoyable, but soon turned to be a tedious grind.\nThe castles eventually turned into clones of eachother as certain trap builds were proven more effective than others, and that's when the game seized to be fun. After raiding the 10th castle in a row with the same trap setup (catapult block + mines), at which point i was getting somewhat used to dodging and breaking the traps by running on and off them, i no longer had fun. This is where I changed over to only working on my own defense, and tried very hard to make something fun but nothing remotely close to the trap build. I did and do still enjoy the defending part of this game, but as the prices for upgrades and similar went up, I found myself having to either wait a month or to grind NPC castles over and over 100 times to get an upgrade.\nAs a gamer with plenty of experiences grinding, I came to the conclusion that I did not feel the results were worth the effort, which is when I stopped playing this.\n\nConclusion:\nFun game to try and play for a while, but it gets incredibly tedious and grindy for what is supposed to be a casual game.","January 18, 2015","true","16.0"," 63 of 119 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","63","119","5","0"

You have $512,586,348,954,125 to spend on games then you will have a super amazing castle with super amazing traps and everything. Here is the flaw. A lower level skilled enough can still beat your castle.\n\nWould you believe me that is the pro?\n\nHere's why, there is nothing more satisfying to a person who is playing all legit(free) and beats a cheating(pay-to-winner) with nothing but skill alone. Takes nothing but a small about of skill to beat most people. The only thing that makes a castle hard is the level of the monsters in relation to the player and layout.\n\n\nTo make this simple, just download and play this game. It is point and click so if you are not a person who likes those kinda games then maybe not for you. but if you like DoTa, LoL, or Diablo(1-3)(1-2.5) then you will enjoy this game.\n\n\n\nSmall edit for a REAL con - crafing things take a while if you take that route and dont pay money. only crafted a few things (not chickens) in 14 or so hours.","January 19, 2015","true","16.9"," 64 of 121 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","64","121","10","2"

In short it is a mostly solo action-rpg with a castle building side. Gamplay is all about attacking other players' castles with one or your heros while getting cool stuff and designing your castle to be bigger and badder.\n\nYour main interaction with other players is attacking their castles and visa versa. There's no co-op in that you cannot form a party and go raid castles together.\n\nIts F2P and at the time of writing has an in-game currency. Though I've so far not really needed to drop real cash on this. A pity in a way, I would have bought this game if it was just on the normal pricing model.\n\nAnyway, IMO the game is fun as hell. Castle building is fun, easy, and deep. Raiding others' castles is fast paced and people have some great designs that can be really tricky and awesome. Since the game makes you run your own castle, I've yet to run into anything that was impossible or glitchy or hacky.\n\nI particularly like that you can rate and comment on any castle you raid. I like being able to give people feedback on their designs, especially the ones that really presented a challenge.\n\nUpdate (2/5/2015): I'm level 20 now and, unfortunately, the have and have-not nature of this game is becoming apparent. There's people who've paid and those who haven't. You can tell cause one group has amazingly tough castles and the others don't.\n\nWhile you can technically get everything you need for elite creatures, boss creatures, and amazing traps... its slow enough that you will have to grind for a long time to have a properly equipped castle.\n\nIf you care about having a castle that can actually kill invaders, protect your gold, and earn you leaderboard points, then you need to pay. Its a really long grind to make a castle that's good enough without spending real money. Its really hard to kill players in this game and you've gotta craft (which is the chokepoint) a lot of stuff to get there.\n\nIs it still worth playing? I'd say so, but if you care about leaderboard rankings and competitions, then be prepared to shell out at least for the infinity pack.","January 21, 2015","true","294.1"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","0"

Also my review is no longer accurate because they overhauled pretty much the entire game. It's a totally different game now, and it only got worse. I uninstalled it and will never play it again.\n\n\nBeta review:\nI played this game for many many hours (80 hours in 2 weeks) and bought and maxed out pretty much everything. So here is my review:\n\nReasons not to spend money on it:\n- WARNING: External DRM & account registration using UPlay.\n- EXTREMELY unbalanced and filled with exploits (I know it's beta). It will most likely be fixed in the future.\n- There is no endgame. When you are level 30 on all characters with a full level 30 castle then there is nothing to do. You get no more xp, no use for your resources and ranked play is incredibly unbalanced and unrewarding.\nAlso buildings like the blacksmith are a joke endgame. Too expensive and the gear is less than what drops on pretty much every run. But again, just balance issues there.\n- Magic items with better stats than epic items or legendary weapons with +0 dps but just like 10hp or 10 mana...\n- Relatively poor support for steam users (none in fact). [Update: This has changed now and Ubisoft is now also active on the Steam forums]\n- Extremely repetitive gameplay.\n- Their official forums are regulary filled with spambots for marriage council and flamers. They can't even control their own official forums. Or maybe that was temporary but still...\n- Has pretty much the same problems as the (now closed) game "Dungeon Empires".\n- No co-up. Yes it is 'MMO' but you will never fight against or with another guy. When you attack a castle it all happens client-side and it's basically singleplayer. A hot-seat game has more multiplayer elements than this game.\n- Read the forums and such before you spend money in this game! Also wait until you are like level 20 because then you will notice what is really wrong with the game. If you still like it at that point, yes do spend money on it.\n- No real ranking system. Totally unbalanced, even presumably hacked at some occasions, and filled with exploits. And even when you rank in the top, there are no real rewards other than "good job, you exploited everything!"\n- And many more reasons.\n\nUpdates:\n- Currently you can not raid your friends (practice mode only). Will probably be fixed in the future though. [This has been changed and you can now do this a few times / day]\n- Common server disconnects. [Mostly fixed by now]\n\nReasons to spend money on it:\n- Early game is really fun.\n- Good graphics and great music.\n- Has decent humor and an epic trailer.\n- Takes you about 50-100 hours to max all characters and castle. So enough gameplay. But the last 50 hours are probably just farming farming and more farming just like raiding the same dungeon in WoW over and over again. Only now it's solo.\n- NOT pay-2-win. You only pay for extra characters, xp boosts and such and visuals. You might want the characters but aside from that you don't need to buy anything.\nBut sadly those extra characters are very expensive and if you really like this game then you will need them.\n- It's free.\n\n\nOther reviews that claim that you can "earn" those points ingame... Well.. That will take you months of play before you can even unlock one character that you will then max out in 1-2 days... By running competitions for example it will take you almost exactly 3 months to unlock ONE character.

At a certain point in the game when you reach the required level, you can purchase 'totems' that prevent creatures from leaving it's radius and healing them on their return. Combine this with Aura Guardians who give damage immunity to all nearby beasties, you have a recipe for a really ♥♥♥♥ing tedious to deal with castle.\n\nAnd literally everyone is doing it. Literally everyone. Meaning you HAVE to use them yourself to even try and compete with them. Plus, there's really no downside to using them. I've heard people say 'OH BUT THEN YOU CAN WALK PAST THEM' but 9/10 times those people are placing the above setup into chokepoints meaning you HAVE to engage them.\n\nThe introduction of the recent 'Infinity Pack' gives you access to all previous content added plus whatever they add in the future. Said pack includes defenses that are arguably the most overpowered in the game. The pack only costs about £15 (at the time of this writing, anyway).\n\nAt the end of the day, the game literally just boils down to 'stop making creative layouts, just use totems'.","January 26, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mlerner12/recommended/239220/","mlerner12","Ferra/Torr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mlerner12/","67 products in account","A really good game. It's one of those classic games where you pick your hero and level him up and learn more abilities, but this one adds in more humor, multiplayer, and castle customization. The multiplayer works really well, because you don't get paired against random enemies like in most iPhone and Android games. However, I don't like the way the castle customization works. You should get more traps and monsters as a starting player, because you don't have nearly enough to actually cover much of your castle. I also think that they could change the way the view sorks, because currently you can only view your character from four directions. I think he should be able to be viewed from all possible directions, in a different format from the curent ones.\nOverall, a very pleasant game. It's not one of those games with a really important storyline you have to follow, like Assassin's Creed, where you can't do anything else until you've beaten the game, but there is some story to it you can play.\nGoing to give it a grade similar to those given in school, A-F. A being the best game, F being the worst. I say it's probably a B-, maybe an 8.2/10. It's free, I think, so it's not like it hurts to try it.","June 14, 2014","true","16.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, over time, the game gradually became very repetitive and storming other user's castles that were rigged in such a way as to become nearly unbeatable made the game a lot less fun.  If in the future there is more variety to the castles that can be built and other characters can be used then I think this could be a great free-to-play.  Overall, I would have to give the game a 7/10.  I was entertained for quite a while but it ultimately lost its charm relatively quickly.","June 26, 2014","true","22.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a mix of Diablo style hack'n'slash mixed with a kind of 3D tower defense. The game is in beta and to be honest I think that was a bit rushed, it would feel better having it tagged as Alpha still. That being said there are a few main things to be dealt with gameplay wise before the game will be something that I consider complete. My best guess is that at current time it is going to be 6 months out before this is a polished game. It is still very fun to play even with the couple design flaws present. And I think most people will not even be as tight about those issue's as I am. You'll need to hit level 16 to really start seeing those things, but for the most part I think the game is pretty great.\n\nTake care when reading negative reviews that they are not outdated.

At a certain point in the game when you reach the required level, you can purchase 'totems' that prevent creatures from leaving it's radius and healing them on their return. Combine this with Aura Guardians who give damage immunity to all nearby beasties, you have a recipe for a really ♥♥♥♥ing tedious to deal with castle.\n\nAnd literally everyone is doing it. Literally everyone. Meaning you HAVE to use them yourself to even try and compete with them. Plus, there's really no downside to using them. I've heard people say 'OH BUT THEN YOU CAN WALK PAST THEM' but 9/10 times those people are placing the above setup into chokepoints meaning you HAVE to engage them.\n\nThe introduction of the recent 'Infinity Pack' gives you access to all previous content added plus whatever they add in the future. Said pack includes defenses that are arguably the most overpowered in the game. The pack only costs about £15 (at the time of this writing, anyway).\n\nAt the end of the day, the game literally just boils down to 'stop making creative layouts, just use totems'.","January 26, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Invade enemy castles with your hero, evade traps, kill everything and loot treasures. Level up hero, learn abilities, buy items, sets, potions. Buy and craft new traps and stronger guardians for your castle, build new rooms and mazes.\nSounds like hell lot of fun, right? Well its not. The game is complete P2W, you can pay for absolutely everything to make it much stronger than those F2P biches.\nAlso, this "trying-to-be-comedy" style pisses me off hard. It might be fun for 10y.o children though.\nInvading enemy castles is just boring thing to do. Turns to stupid grind very fast, breaking through and grabbing that castle's loot doesn't bring any joy either.\nPlanning and building castles is just poorly realized. Guys, Dungeon Keeper was released in 1997. Couldn't you just like, look at it and improve somehow?\nThere are 3 character classes (guess them? Warrior, Archer, Mage, nice shot of creativity), but well, since you are F2P user you can only choose 1 and stick to it, since you have 1 slot. This way you can't even see the differences between 3, which is nice.\nWhat to say, nice idea and terrible realization, wait a second, terrible *P2W* realization.\nDespite, game is alive and people are playing it.

I lost all interest in it once I started getting raided by such high levels, it's the classic "bully" in this kind of game, the game is a very good one but the fact that you can lose so much by someone who outlevels you by far is just dissapointing.\nThe humor in the game is amazing and the way you can just get mutilated by ONE wrong move is rage-inducing but at the same time makes you question your own intelligence, but after a while you learn to laugh at it.\n\nPros:\n-The creativity and diversity of the game are what make it so cool, the fact that you can build your fort the way YOU want it is just great.\n-Like mentioned, the humor and the irony in the game are awesome and they keep you distracted for a while.\n-The premium currency isn't necessary at all to get through the game which makes it a real fun F2P.\n\nCons:\n-The game is full of people who just stack units in one place makeing it boring after a while.\n-It get's kinda repetitve cause it's always the same, the forts are the same in the early levels, and in the higher levels it's just people who waste time.\n-It would be nice if it would get a bit more development case the fact that you can glitch through places is seemingly stupid and you can die from it.\n\nI really would approve this game for someone who likes a raiding game, a game that forces you to think... just kidding in this game you can run right into a thousand troops with 3 healing potions like a madman and still win.\n\nFinal Score: 7","April 7, 2015","true","16.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It is very exciting to have a bunch of notifications on your screen, check all the playbacks of players trying to loot your castle and fail. Or succeed. It makes the whole process of improving your castle very entertaining. But the truth is, there's no place for improvement in the end game. Unless you open your wallet to ubisoft. All the most powerful traps, monsters, weapons and gear are only obtained by paying money. After a while, raiding high level castles becomes impossible. It's not even a case of putting a lot of hours into a game for a chance to obtain some powerful items or monsters for your castle. No money, no honey.

The portions written on the attack portion of the game still hold relatively the same, but updates have rendered my comments completely void for the defensive section. I have no intention of playing this game again, so take this review as it is, a timely, but potentially expired review.]\n\nThis game breaks down two two gameplay systems, and either can reasonably be played independant of the other. The first is attacking castles, be it the castles made by the developers to allow world progression, or be it other player's castles. The second is a tower defence style mmo, where you must setup creatures and traps to prevent other players from completing your castle within a time limit (or all together). Based on my experience, whether you enjoy the attack portion of this system largely decides how much enjoyment you get from the game.\n\nThe attack portion of the game plays much like I imagine Diablo plays, and I say I 'imagine' because I've never had a remote incling to play any Diablo game. The control style is structured so that to move somewhere you click there, and to attack something you click on it. There are also special abilities that have area or effect damage, or line-style piercing, and these are assigned to keys. My problem with this is that I've never found that control style even remotely fun. So, take that as you will: If you like Diablo, you may like the attack portion, and if not then perhaps not.\n\nThe attack portion becomes very skill-based very quickly, and you'll quickly notice that often you don't stand a chance of defeting some of the player dungeons at your level when that player has competancy in how to setup their castle. That's not to say that you can't beat castles; by and large most players just haven't learned how to properly setup a dungeon to actually defeat a skilled attacker, at least in lower levels. One reason this becomes a real hinderance, is that the player's leveling is dependent on a tower that must be built in the defensive part of the game. This means that essentially, unless the player spends a significant time also playing the defensive portion, they hit a level cap, and basically can't progress any further attacking, and this is where the game is really held back by being "free to play"/"pay to win"/"free to wait."\n\nThe defensive portion of the game follows a fairly simple concept of tower defence. But, instead of a standard tower defence game where you build towers until some tower-unit cap is reached, that naturally gets progressively larger as the player "wins" and progresses through the game, the tower-unit cap is based again on other towers, like the attacking level cap tower. So, to progress, the player must spend gold upgrading this tower that governs the other towers, which are limited by the level of other towers, which are limited by the level of other towers, which are limited by the level of other towers, and so on. So the defensive game boils down to upgrading one tower so that other towers can be upgraded, so that other towers can be upgraded, until ultimately the actual defensive towers (or creatures for this game) can actually be upgraded. This would be fine, except the game is "free to play"/"pay to win"/"free to wait," so any time a tower is designated for an upgrade, this upgrade comes with a countdown timer until the upgrade is completed. This in principle is okay, except that the upgrade countdown times quickly reach into the hours, and from there into even full days.\n\nSo, the game ends up being this thing where you log in, do as much as you can until you reach these limits, and have to either stop playing the game, or pay real money for the third currency, which allows for instant completion of any upgrade. This would be okay in principle if not for the extremely excessive countdown times, but the prices required for these intsant upgrades are fairly steep, and quicly reach prices in the dollars for single upgrades. Seems a bit like a price gouge to me. Maybe the expectation is that the top 1% of players will basically pay for the rest of the players, but if that were the case the countdowns shouldn't get so high so quickly, to that point that they actually become prohibitive of gameplay. The game is like many other "free-to-play" games, and seemigly has the sole goal of extracting money from the player, not actually being enjoyable.\n\nIf given to you by a friend, give the game a try. If it's still free when you read this and you're still interested, give it a try. But no one in their right mind should pay a dime to get the game in the first place, and no-one but the rich should spend any money on the third currency until you know you actually like the game enough to do so.\n\nEDIT: I uninstalled this game right after writing this review because honeslty, I'm tired of waiting to not have fun.","February 10, 2014","false","22.3"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","2"

The game is definitely a grind, but there doesn't seem to be any way to buy a victory.  Spending money gets you additional classes, and XP and resource boosts, which just serve to make the grind shorter.\n\nI will say this, the game is definitely still in beta territory, but it is also free, so it is hard to come down to roughly on the problems the game has.  Those problems are mostly balance issues.  AI Aggro is very weird and not explained at all within the game itself, and there are a bunch of things with regards to castle building that are basically never really explained to the player in any detail.   The controls are also excrutiatingly frustrating to deal with right now.   The build controls feel completely unintuitive and just plain unsensible sometimes, and the combat controls feel awkward if you are coming off of Diablo 3, especially since so many of the abilities are extremely similar.  You end up taking damage when you don't mean to because things don't really work as smoothly as they do in D3.\n\nIf they can fix the AI and overall balance and controls, this game would be a HUGE winner.  It's already fun in its beta state.\n\nI'd give it a C+ currently.  IF they fix the issues it would be a solid A.   For free, however, it is totally recommendable.","May 2, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I recently got this game and I'm having lots of fun playing it although the one problem that concerns me is when I find low level bases with extremely hard defences just because they bought them off of the community market, this makes it harder for newcomers like me to get a feel to the game, and some people may continuously get high level defended bases which could in the end put them off of the game.\n\nI definetly would reccomend this game too you if you aren't worried about a couple losses that might just end up wasting your time.

The graphics look nice.   The action is fast and pleasurable.  The gameplay feels outstanding but everything you do really means nothing in the game since ultimately your score is based on how many easy castles you beat and how many times a low ranked person beats your castle not how good a player you are.  Leaderboards are very easy to manipulate since you can have your friends intentionally lose to you or create extra accounts to sandbag and steal large amounts of crowns from your competitors.\n\nI won't recommend against the game since its fun to play casually for awhile but I wouldn't spend much if any money on this.","January 29, 2015","true","113.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(To take up storage space, of course) Well, in reality it's all in how you look at it. I see a ton of reviews saying "Not Recommended" because it's almost a "Pay2Win" type of game. Well, what can you expect? It's Free To Play. I want you to name a Free To Play game that doesn't have Micro-Transactions. Hard, isn't it? While I, myself, haven't really played this game too much, it's safe to say it's okay. Sure, it does ♥♥♥♥ up at times, but I'd say it has solid gameplay. However, sometimes I feel too overpowerd, slicing through things without mercy. But at other times, I feel the game throws too much at you at once. But that might just be me. The defence element is cool, but we already have defence element games like this one. Like Clash Of Clans. You fight, you defend. And it seem too easy to raid your own castle (again, maybe just me). Overall? I think this might of done better on mobile devices. I'm mostly saying this because I think people would've been more happier that way. Since this game has Waiting Times, I felt like this was made for mobile devices the second I found out about it. Yes, it's a big game, but if Ubisoft tries hard enough, they could probably cram this into a small screen. It's just, waiting times shouldn't be in PC games in my book. But that sure shouldn't stop you frome trying the game. Even with all these bad reveiws, you still shouldn't look away for a second. Because a second could turn to years. And you should really check this game out first. I recommend it to you.","February 15, 2015","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It plays like a Diablo-like, but you fight exclusively in either pre-made castles, or castles made by other players. Other players can attack your castle and steal some of your gold and life force, but it's never a crippling amount, and it can be more than made up by playing one level, or attacking your attacker back. The castle building is relatively easy to use, place monsters, traps, etc, rearrange the rooms in your castle and add more to make it more difficult. The game is fun, but like a lot of other F2P games, progression slows down a lot after the first 10 or so levels. However, the game avoids being Pay to Win by selling pretty much exclusively cosmetic items. There are one or two barracade items you buy for the premium currency, but the Pay 2 Win of that is avoided in that the owner of a castle needs to be able to clear it themselves before others can play it, and their clear time is the time you need to beat. TL;DR, Give the game a shot, it's free, and it's fun.","July 18, 2014","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

By filling it to the brim with deadly monsters and traps, this castle will ensure that any would-be looters will think twice before setting foot inside. Players will also partake in looting of their own by pitting their own powerful hero against Opulencia’s most legendary keeps, using deep hack ‘n slash gameplay controls.

Tons of customization for your castle, and it feels great when your castle kills another player!\n\nThis game has a lot of people complaining about p2w....\nEvery game that is free to play is going to have an aspect where the developers receive money for a player benefit.(You are an idiot if you do work and don't ask for compensation) People always troll around saying all these games are P2W, but it's not at all. You either pay for a video game, or you play a free video game and if you like it, you pay for some extra gear. Why is everyone so butthurt about playing a free video game? These people need to get their brains checked.\n\nI've played this game for a few days and I have yet to pay a dime to the developers,AND I have almost all epic gear on my archer, my castle is ~30% wins which isn't bad, and no one has ever beaten my time. I don't have a boss yet but it takes time to farm the appropriate crafting materials, which makes sense, otherwise every room would have a boss in it. Once your castle is plundered and some of your loot is stolen, you are automatically defended for a certain amount of time so other players can't steal your loot, they can just enjoy running the castle. And if you play one or two castles which takes about 5 minutes, you can make all the loot you lost back and then some.\n\nTip #1 for new players, Traps are almost always what kills people, don't focus on monsters, just focus on traps.\nTip # 2 - if you are placing monsters, place them near an entry way with a totem so the enemy player can't kite them down the hall.\nTip #3 - To get epic loot, you NEED to beat the enemy times and kill all the mines. For the most part the monsters will chase you so just focus on finding the mines first and then kill the monsters. If you don't have to kill a monster, just run by it, if there is a red dot on your mini map, it means he's seen you and you DO need to kill him.\n\nOverall, great game, I've definitely put in enough hours already to justify kicking some money to the devs, and I'm thinking I might just to troll the trolls.","February 10, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

(you can still buy them, but thats not really worthed)\n-/+Pets dont really have something usefull exept picking up loot. (choose if that is a good or a bad thing)\n*This is almost your standard facebook game, only now you can fight, its just like: Ok, now i collect my gold/crystal mines, now upgrade something and you can wait 6 hours again before you get something.\nthis is not a big problem, if it was addicting, you dont feel like this: i need to be back in 4 hours to collect my gold; ok ill be online then. like you feel in farmville or candy crush or whatever.\n\n--Controls--\n+Moba controls\n+Abillity with numbers\n+I was very happy with the control settings at start\n\n--Balance--\n-You don't know from the start of a raid if it is hard or easy.\n-Really unbalanced in Abillity/minion (To easy to kill everything in early game)\n-It costs to much to upgrade your castle, and it is just not really worthed\n\n--Sounds--\n+Good sound, nothing much to say really\n-At start R.I.P. Headphone knight users\n\n--Graphics--\nNOTE: opinion\n(I play games for the gameplay, not for the graphics. maybe if it was a P2P game, like me in the beta i would juge them, but for a F2P i don't.)\n+It doesn't have bad graphics\n\n--First impression--\nYour basic Facebook game,\nOnly fighting, crafting and graphics better.\nDon't play this game for the strategy!\nYou will be disliking the early gameplay.\nThe early gameplay is about grinding and grinding the castles of enemy players.\nPatience = Everything\n\n--CONCLUSION--\n+Fun to play for half an Hour P/day\n+Easy to learn\n+First time spening RL Money In a game got me something Worthed (Material o' Matic)\n+F2P!\n-I paid for the beta\n-Miss the addictive part*\n-Boring after playing longer than a hour\n-where is the balance in this game?!\n\nWho ordered the offline-TP-Onelane-FacebookVersion of a moba?\nWhen you get the game for money => 4/10\nWhen you get the game for free  => 6.5/10\n\nSorry for my bad english, this is my first review.\nHope you liked it!","January 19, 2015","true","19.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Unfortunately the game gets dull and repetative after soon after you finish the tutorail levels. This is because there is not much variety in enemy and trap types, and while designing you own castle seemed cool at the time there isn't much you can do to make yours special. And because  of the games validation system in wich you have to beat your own castle to make it valid there is very little challenge in beating players the same level as you, and if it is hard for some reason you can just attack castle three levels lower than you. There are four classes of heroes and you start with one for free then you have use the premium currency to unlock other classes. This wouldn't be a problem if each class had lots of abilities and ways to play. This is not the case, i chose archer and he shoots arrows, and has abilities that let him shoot better arrows, and he has a pet hawk who can attack enemies. This lack of branching makes for a rather boring character. I also had a free trial of the knight class, he can hit things, and has abilities that let him hit things in arcs and hit things hard. Again not much variance. Ontop of this you need a Uplay account, I already had one from Far Cry 3 but I know some people hate Uplay with all their heart lungs and kidneys. So i reccomend it because it's free and fun for the first few hours, but it does get repetitive","June 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has gone through a LOT of changes, and only recently can I actually recommend this game.\n\nIt started off many months ago as an unfun time sink Hell.  Want to do anything?  Set it going and come back a long long long time from then.  It got worse the further you progressed.  Not fun, I stopped playing.\n\nNot so many months ago I heard the mechanics completely changed, so I checked it out.  Holy crap pay to win doesn't even begin to cover it.  Stopped playing.\n\nThe Infinite Pack got me scratching my head.  I tried the game again as a free player and realized it's not a free to play game.  It's a demo with no end, just gimped.  Was it still pay to win?  It seemed so on the surface, but I dug deeper.  I tried looking at it such that the Infinite Pack was actually buying the game.  You get all past and future content to some degree?  No extra money sink required?  Sounds pretty good.  So I went for it.  A few more hours of gameplay later I came to a conclusion about if it's pay to win or not.\n\nWhat can you buy with real money?  Cosmetics, crafting material packs, and rare monsters.  I am all for paying real money for cosmetic items.  Fully support that business model and hundreds of dollars to Path of Exile proves it.  Crafting material packs allow you to get dumps of mats to craft your normally available monsters.  Monsters even available to free players.  The materials are all gatherable by free players by raiding castles.  Not pay to win, but definitely pay for convenience.\n\nWhat about buying rare monsters?  Here's the rub.  If you consider the Infinite Pack the cost of the game you get quite a few already.  Can more be bought?  Sure.  Are they available to free players?  Not reasonably.  Sounds like pay to win.  But the devs did try to balance it.  For instance, your castle is limited to a certain number of monsters, and further, you're limited on how tightly you can pack those monsters.  All elite monsters won't save a horrible defense design.  But the strategic level of skill player with and without elite monsters will do slightly better with elite.  To further balance this the devs applied a loot-o-meter.  The more rare monsters in your defense, the higher the chance you'll drop rare loot.  This means more people will want to attack you.  Or, if you're a kindly person you can arrange a poor defense purposely and increase the loot drops for anyone visiting.\n\nAll things said, I've got about 10 hours played since the Infinite Pack came out and I have yet to encounter anything that was clearly unbalanced towards pay players.  But then, I'm not in the top tiers of end game yet, either.  I just have fun with the 2-3 minute mini dungeon runs and seeing what creative things people have come up with.  I purposely undo the shield on my castle that protects me from attackers just to get more people to visit and see how they handle it.\n\nIf it took longer to run castles I would be less pleased with the game, but in bite sized chunks it can be a blast.","February 25, 2015","true","53.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Put the game down and just recently picked it up again. Still having a blast and low and behold im actullay getting attacked by others. Great game. Some say pay to win.. i dont see it. they give you enough gems to start to get what you need and then even give you an option to get a machine that supplies you with 35 gems a day. dont know what more you want. Only way the "Pay to win may even come into play is in the higher tier lvls (Lvl 30). but ill be honest, you wont make it that far for a long time. So just try it out attack a few ppl and build up your defences. come back every now and then to collect your gems and attack a few more ppl.

Yes, you need a youplay account, but Ive already had it for other games and have never had an issue with it in any way. It just opens when you want to play the game and you can close it afterwards. Never has it crashed a game while playing for me.\n\nYou start out building up your castle and attacking others to earn money and such to make yours better. While you can pay to get bonus things, I have not spent a dime and am at lvl 15 and still having a blast. To make more creatures you find drops while fighting others monsters and you can craft things that way. You can level up almost everything you have as you go like your inventory, gold storage. When you attack others castles, they make it so you can stay at your own level of rank as to not be defeated as soon as you enter. Some are trickier then others so may take some extra time leveling up your little guy so he has better attack and defense items.\n\nI really do enjoy this game and Im sure many others will too. As always, take all reviews with a grain of salt and try it for yourself. Its a very detailed game and does have a very nice tutorial as you go through it first so pay attention so you dont forget simple tasks. :D Have fun!","April 1, 2015","true","35.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It truly is a good game, it has addictive gameplay, enjoyable characters and more. But my only real problem with it is the OBVIOUS pay to win side of it. Yes, it's possible to beat them without paying, but that's not my point. What I'm saying is this, most bosses have a weak side to them. Except for the one I've been stuck on for ages. Captain Clubbage, you can also get him as a boss in your castle. In my opinion he is blatantly overpowered. No joke, you can't stun him, at all. As a knight if you are around the same level, you are screwed. Because he can, clone himself, teleport, take a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage, has long AND close range attacks. And moves at a pace that can keep up with the hero. Now, as fun as this game is, having a boss such as that. That can be payed for very simply kind of irks me. As I said, I do like this game. But there are some massive balancing issues that need to be attended to. Hell, to test my theory I use a knight and then an archer which were both 4 levels higher than my friends castle. Both were able to easily get through it until he had his Captain Clubbage come after me. I dunno, maybe I'm overreacting. But it kind of ruins an entire portion of the game for me, knowing a level 10 can have this guy by spending a few dollars. I mean, even bosses that are HIGHER levels than him are easier to defeat. So the tl;dr version is. It has some major balancing issues that maybe need to be looked at. That and it has as many microtransactions as Candy Crush. (That was a joke. A bad one.) So that wraps up my opinion, but if I were to give it a score. 8.7/10.

It's good, but can do better with a bit of tweaking.","April 2, 2015","true","25.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Unfortunately the game gets dull and repetative after soon after you finish the tutorail levels. This is because there is not much variety in enemy and trap types, and while designing you own castle seemed cool at the time there isn't much you can do to make yours special. And because  of the games validation system in wich you have to beat your own castle to make it valid there is very little challenge in beating players the same level as you, and if it is hard for some reason you can just attack castle three levels lower than you. There are four classes of heroes and you start with one for free then you have use the premium currency to unlock other classes. This wouldn't be a problem if each class had lots of abilities and ways to play. This is not the case, i chose archer and he shoots arrows, and has abilities that let him shoot better arrows, and he has a pet hawk who can attack enemies. This lack of branching makes for a rather boring character. I also had a free trial of the knight class, he can hit things, and has abilities that let him hit things in arcs and hit things hard. Again not much variance. Ontop of this you need a Uplay account, I already had one from Far Cry 3 but I know some people hate Uplay with all their heart lungs and kidneys. So i reccomend it because it's free and fun for the first few hours, but it does get repetitive","June 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game it great mostly, you build your castle, you place creatures and traps to defend it and you raid castles made by other players. Wonderful idea and had me playing for hours searching for defense flaws and leveling up my character. It does have some kind of pay to win aspect but more than anything it speeds up the building of your castle. Nothing over powered like some players portray it, only a momentum boost.\n\nOnce I reached the higher levels though, I found myself sick of playing the game as nothing new was happening. Harder castles but same raiding style. On top of that my castle was barely getting any attention from other players even with my high defense rating. I was praying that more people would attempt to break my defenses but no. The game is still in Beta so do expect bugs and more importantly exciting updates.\n\nSeeing this is a free to play game I highly suggest that you try it out! But overall this is a great game for all ages with lots of potential for the future.","May 4, 2015","true","62.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I went into this game with low expectations since I really didn't think a F2P game could do a hack and slash loot game very well.  I was surprised and I played 16 hours the first day without realizing it.\n\nPros:  You just have to give it a chance and not expect the moon and the stars.  It is fun to attack other people's castles as you level up your character and collect loot and having to choose between spending in-game currency on your character or on your castle (to improve defenses) is a nice twist.  The tower defense part (where other players attack your castle) is a lot of fun too since you can watch the replays of every attempt to break in.\n\nCons:  Non-customisable key bindings is kind of a huge problem for me since I have hand issues to do a medical condition and it's a pain to reach all the way to the number keys to do my spells.  Also not being able to access your inventory while in a castle is kind of silly.\n","February 9, 2015","true","35.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

While the dungeon building may be a little weak if you don't want to spend money (The most powerful stuff is avaliable only through crafting or 'bling', which is tedious and/or costly). It makes up for it at least most of the way in my mind through the Revenge option, which allows you to raid the castle of a player who bested yours.\n\nIt's got a surprising amount of depth for what it is. Still, it's not at all a game to be taken too seriously, and frankly, if you find the pay to win aspects to be unbearable, you're probably taking it too seriously. I find it fits nicely in a not too casual, not too hardcore niche.","February 9, 2015","true","29.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Designing your castle will please Defense Tower lovers. And it's free, you can't ask for much more...\n\nBut once you reach the higher levels, you realize that the paid content is much, much deadlier (3-4 times deadlier) than the best monsters/traps you can buy or craft with the ingame currencies. You can still attack other castles with almost even chances, but your castle will be a walk in the park for your opponents, unless you buy the premium traps and monsters, with real money. And the more you buy, the deadlier your castle will be.\n\nI really shouldn't complain, I have enjoyed this game for free during some time, but I can't help feeling cheated on. I wouldn't mind paying for the game, as I have done with many other games, but I don't want to enter the circle of paying more and more to stay in the game. I don't want to have a great castle just because I paid for it.\n\nI also wouldn't mind forgetting about my castle and focusing on attacking other people, but this is also spoiled at higher levels, when you start finding impassable castles overstuffed with deadly fire and acid traps. You also find the same castle setups over and over, and the once thrilling experience now becomes repetitive and boring.\n\nConclusion: great at lower levels and fails at higher levels. Overall, I think it's better to dedicate you time to other game that won't disappoint you.","February 1, 2015","false","265.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Makes me think of a combo of League of Legends, Diablo, and Clash of Clans. I love the thrill of getting to take people's castles, get awesome loot, fight bosses, and get the loot from other people that failed to take over my castle. But, as others have commented, it seems to slowly start going downward towards Pay-To-Win. Now, I personally haven't experienced many bugs, except one in perticular, that I noticed many other people have experienced. After attacking a certain amount of times, the game will all of the sudden stop letting you attack. I personally am hoping this IS a glitch, and that you all aren't planning to start having limited attacks, as that will lead to many players to want to leave including me.

They took away features such as attacking friends castles infinitely just because they wanted to to be able to get loot from your friends. The defence system now is all bugged out thanks to the new trap "defense" cap. Another big issue that still plays the game to this day is repeat castles. People just can't seem to add variety because they add pay to win options through some of the mobs that are "limited time only" purchases. Some of those said purchases require you to buy a booster pack to get a chance at it coming from the booster or you can play 50 hours of the game and maybe see that item drop.\n\nNow this isn't to say the game is entirely bad. The game itself has a very good dungeon keeper esc. game that allows you to attack friends "dungeons" and have them attack yours. The loots system i wouldn't say is entirely broken as they did fix alot, but don't ever pass up a "Farm" if you see one. This game is a game that's a I'll come back to it if I'm bored and just nothing else sounds good kind of game.\n\nEvery game has it's ups and downs, but this one i found personally to have more downs. Play it for yourself and then judge it. I will say i loved it at one point, but maybe i was too hyped about it form a convention that i played it at when it was in alpha i don't know.","November 1, 2014","true","114.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I bought a new one, which was really good surprisingly! (this was 2 weeks ago). Then I remembered I bought GMod for my laptop, but there was a problem with my screen at the time :P. So I remembered GMod and so I got Steam again. It worked! I started playing Only If, TF2, and then.. I remembered that one epic game I saw at GamesCom! So I started downloading The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, and I immediately got hooked!\nIt may be that I've only played for 4 hours.. But they were 4 hours straight! I love this game so much!

The classes are\narcher\nwarrior\nwizard (so original)\nI'm not going to bother about the fourth class, seeing how little people buy classes with real money\n\n-Loot system\nThe loot system isn't terrible, you kill enemies and they drop stuff. You can also buy loot from the shop (no need for real life money, ingame cash will do) luckly you can sell loot you don't need\n\n-Towers build by the game self\nTowers build by the game self are usually pretty reasonable, you may have to try 2 or 3 times, but then you're good. The main problem is there isn't nearly enough of these towers, seeing as most are build by players. Thanks to this it's really hard to level up and get to other castles.\n\n-Towers build by players\nThis isn't an issue with the game or by developers self, this is purely thanks to the players. 90% of the players don't try to make a clever dungeon that's hard to crack. They just spam the biggest and strongest enemy 100x. I know the game can't help this, but it's really annoying, because it just turns the game into a grind fest.\n\nOveral I'd probably give this game a 5/10, because it gets stale really fast.\n\n","October 11, 2014","false","4.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

More than half of all traps and creatures are completely useless when you get to the end of the game, especially when the rare weekly ones are so much better than what you normally have access to. To make it worse, the game is geared towards making it easy for raiders, such as being able to consistently disable entire rooms of traps, getting time bonuses just for destroying objects, and healing for a lot just by using normal attacks. Unless you're a top 10 dungeon, it is rather pointless spending any time defending your dungeon since you will more than likely always lose to raiders, and you gain so much more from raiding constantly.\n\nVideo showing some gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r-GGeLHzqw\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","February 5, 2015","true","258.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The added features of designing and customising your own castle is pretty cool, but unfortunately I found myself pretty bored fairly quickly. The store is limited to "Invade that guys castle because he's bad, once you've done that, then there's another castle to invade, because he's also bad.". Attacking other players castles seems sort of useless, as they're all shielded due to previous player attacks, so the rewards you get from the non-player castles is far greater resulting in that familiar Diablo experience of running the same section, over, and over, and over again.\n\nBeing free, the game heavily relies on microtransactions, but does allow you one free character. For that reason alone, it has to be recommended. When you can get a few hours of enjoyment out of something free, it has to be worth it, right? This game might capture you, as I'm sure the later stages of the game can get very chaotic and the hardcore players would find endless ways to improve their castles, the difficult part will be sticking with the game that long.\n\nAll in all I give it a 4/10. I doubt I'll go back to it, after only clocking 3 hours. I can see younger gamers enjoying it more, but it's not for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cuddlycactus/recommended/239220/","Cuddlycactus","CuddlyCactus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cuddlycactus/","358 products in account","TLDR at bottom.\n\nOkay... this is a tough one. There is nothing like this game out there, it's one of a kind, which keeps me coming back.\n\nCraft a castle of your style, arrange rooms, place monsters, and place traps to ward off attacking players.  Players can attack you at will, and if they successfully defeat your castle without dying, they will attain a percentage of your saved resources.\n\nThese resources are what you use to craft monsters, traps, upgrade machinery, and buy various things. You get these resources from beating enemy player castles, killing monsters in those castles, and you also get resources from "mines" that you place in your castle... which brings me to the first gripe of this game.\n\nThis game has a distinct mobile feeling to it. In order to reliably attain resources, you place "mines" in your castle to farm them while you are away from the game, or doing other things. You click on these mines once every few hours to obtain the resources they have collected. You can spend in game gold to upgrade these "mines" making them farm more per hour. (Think clash of clans style). The menu's don't feel very intuitive, and how you navigate everywhere.  It feels like the whole game was designed to be released on mobile.\n\nSpeaking of mobile... This game is blantantly pay to win. You can play this entire game without paying a cent, reach max level, craft an intricate castle with many rooms. However, you will be extremely angry when attacking other players and seeing some traps, monsters, and bosses you cannot obtain. Even with the in game cash currency (Blings), some of these are only purchasable using real money. These traps, monsters, and bosses do feel overpowered, and really hurt. In a way, I am glad they offer a package to obtain most of these unattainable items. The $15.00 "Infinity" pack contains all these bosses, traps, and barricades. If you want to enjoy this game to the fullest, you're going to want to fork over 15$. The amount of frustration of experiencing this game without being able to get the strongest thing is really unbelievable.\n\nI've been playing this since early alpha, the game has changed a lot. The final system they arrived on is one that pushes the player to purchase in game currency to buy "Material" packs to craft items. Materials is a second component used, the second being life force or gold, to craft in game creatures. There are so many of these materials that it makes farming for them impossible. You simply go to other players castles and hope you get the type of material you want.\nSome creatures take over 20 or 30 of a certain material, and when there are so many that you can receive, it makes it extremely frustrating trying to get what you need. On average you receive probably 1 common material per run, while rare and higher grade materials being much rarer.\n\nThe "loot" in this game isn't very special. Despite the game name, loot is not very interesting. You gear up your player similar to any RPG and this makes him stronger and able to fight higher level castles. They look uninteresting, and are very very uninspired. It would be much more interesting to find loot for your castles with random modifiers and things like that. You end up raiding castles not for any loot, but for gold and life force to increase your castles capabilities. The gear you get is often just sold for this.\n\nSo why play this game?\n\nThere is nothing quite like it. There is nothing like watching replays of people attempting to raid your castle, and watching them feel miserably at a spot in your castle you specifically set up to be challenging with a devilish set of traps and monsters that work very well together.\n\nYou can enjoy the game for quite a while until you hit a point where you realize that you are gimped and don't want to play anymore without having to spend real money.\n\nTLDR: I am giving this a recommendation because this game is an experience that you won't get in any other game. You can play for a long time until you feel like you need to spend money. It's shamelessly pay to win, but until someone remakes a game with this style (which would be AMAZING), you have to get this experience here.\nPlease someone make a game with this concept that is deeper and more intricate without pay to win mechanics. I would pay a lot of money for a game without microtransactions like this.\n\nPros:\nUnique concept, competitive dungeon keeper\nWatching replays of people getting destroyed by your castle\n\nCons:\nMaterial system makes you REALLY want to buy material packs , or farm for days on end for a single creature you want\nReal money required to get certain things\nFeels like it was meant to be a mobile game\nBoring loot\nBoring combat\nUbisoft","March 24, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can customize your castle and you do so in a way to keep other players from reaching your "Core" and if they do then they complete your castle and leave with whatever they looted from your castle. The stronger the monsters and traps you put in your castle the harder you can make it for the players that enter your castle. The higher you make your character's level and your castle level the more monsters and traps you have available to you. There is a cash shop but everything you can get in the cash shop you can get from crafting or buying in the in game store with gold and life force which is the in game currancy. Bling is also an in game currancy which you gain very slowly. If you plan on making this one of your main games i recommend buying the infinite pack which allows you to buy just about everything for 1 gold under the infinite tab of the in game shop.\n\n","March 20, 2015","true","69.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember the days when I would drop 40-60$ on a console game. you can "Buy" this game for forty dollars by getting the infinite pack. If you don't have the money then you can save up bling (which is actually a lot more plentiful then people make it sound) to buy a bling mine and start getting it passively.\n\nAlso, for all the people complaining about finding crafting mats. Once you get into the late game there are passive enchantments on almost every item to give you an increased rate of rare item drops. I have a huge stockpile of epic crafting material for the next unique creature/trap that gets released.\n\nThe real fun lies in the castle development. I have over 250 hours logged just since it came out on steam. I log on almost daily to see all the people my castle has destroyed. People constantly scream "pay to win" after running mine, even though the vast majority of my dungeon I grinded for like most other people.\n\nTo close, for me the real gem in this game is sticking it out to the late game when all your hours lead to you having an amazingly over powered dungeon.","March 18, 2015","true","346.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another is the face that choosing your class option, me personally liking the archer loves the dodges and long range shots he can do, but all the classes specialize in different points. Lastly is the fact the game is free, for a game this good and to be free is quite hard to find nowadays, games like Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 are awesome free games but lack the fact that nothing is always better than the other.

Sounds cool, yes, but let us go into detail on what that means.\n\nBy a Diablo-style game, it's a point-and-click hack-and-slash, similar to Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. So if you're familiar with how those games play, you'll have no problem getting used to this one. If you've never played one of these kind of games, you don't need to worry since the learning curve is rather low, and the game is easy to get into.\n\nYou as a hero venture forth through NPC castles or player castles and try to get to the treasure room, defeating minions and avoiding traps along the way.\n\nThe dungeon building part of the game has you adding room segments to your castle, and filling them with traps and minions  to defend your treasure room from raiding heroes. You can upgrade your treasure storage as well as researching and upgrading minions and traps.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself seriously - for me, this was a nice change of pace from the seriousness that Path of Exile and Diablo has. Some won't like it though, but it's done well.\n\nThere are some negatives with the game, and this mostly comes from the lack of interesting player castles. You'll find many around the level 15/16 range that have traps that are meant to be almost inescapable and result in quick deaths, or very large mobs of minions in a single room with the goal of defeating you with sheer numbers. Ubisoft has done a few things to address the problems created with these designs, however many of these still remain and do leave many people with a feeling of disappointment - not because they failed to get through the castle, but because of the frequency of the design in so many castles.\n\nStill, even with this problem, the game is one you can spend two-three hours in and have some fun.","May 10, 2014","true","222.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't get far so I can't go into anything really deep on why I hated this game so quickly. All I can say is that the controls, camera especially, felt insanly clunky. I had a hard time getting anything done and finally just gave up.\n\nThe way the camera spins to fixed angles is very annoying. I hate the way the walls vanish, because they didn't vanish in time.

Somehow, even if you aim at a spot, it doesn't always aim there.\n- No way to rearrange inventory; lack of inventory space.\n- P2W (You can buy monsters or get a pack with pretty much everything)\n- Knight lacks so much when compared to rest of the classes\n- It's easy to tell which abilities to pick for the endgame on any class\n- Certain abilities just cost too much mana for what they do, for example trap disable skills on mage and knight.\n- Certain abilities make many challenges (and effectively, tower defense) trivial - for example, runaway's rebel yell and Tank knights lifesteal/shieldings trike build are so broken.\n- Certain monsters could be considered P2W - especially manaferatus when paired with small corner rooms and traps so that a mage can't escape from the already insane speed of manaferatu.\n- Fire Globuleyes also make many castles unfun - when you get to a small room with buffed or unbuffed fire globuleyes and disable traps for a short while, you haven't got much space to move or dps to kill them because traps will be activated after a while and when that happens, you will be taking high damage and won't have extra mana to keep them disabled. If you try to escape from the room before fire globuleyes are killed once (you have to kill 1 first, then 2 and finally 4 per globuleye), the globuleyes will move to their starting location with full hp. This can be especially frustrating if the defender is smart enough to build 0 defense unit p2w super generators on another room behind such a room so that the traps will stay enabled even if you disable one in such a room... and that's when you'll be avoiding both traps and monsters while not doing much damage.\n\nStill good fun, 8/10","March 29, 2015","true","234.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is amazingly fun, you could actually play this game for hours! It was pretty well made, the repetive kill the monsters is not actually boring, but instead it will excite you  to see what the next castle dungeon that someone created is like and deal with there creatures of dustruction and rewarded your self for destroying everything inside!","February 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each class comes with a it's own individual skill tree with skills suited for that class.\n\nThe aim of the game is to build up your castle's defences to stop people raiding your gold and loot; which you obtain from raiding other people's castles. It's a vicious cycle of making your character strong with awesome loot that you pillage from other people's castles, to making your castle's defence impenetrable, and then to unlocking new creatures and traps for your castle and new loot for your character.\n\nThis game can be incredibly fun to play, but it does have a pay to win feel to it; although even if you pay loads of money into this game, it wont mean anything unless you know how to use what you've bought. For example someone could of bought loads of premium creatures and traps with real money but their castle will still be easy to defeat unless they know how to position them correctly.\n\nSo all in all, great game, really fun; but has an element of pay to win in it, and still has a few bugs / issues (like with movement, sometimes your character will just walk into some traps even thought you didn't want it to, but then again all 3rd person games have a few issues with movement).","May 17, 2015","true","126.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you enjoy the mobile games Clash of Clans or the recent one King of Thieves then you will definently enjoy this game. Although it is free to play it feels very balanced and fun. It does have a paid currency though, which is only useful for cosmetic items and buying things you dont have the free currency for, there is also a mine which you can buy with the paid currency to be able to generate that currency for free. There is no waiting for things to build (as far as I can tell) other than when you are crafting items. Overall I would give this game an 7/10. -1 for being f2p (because games could be better if they are not) and a -2 for being integrated with the unholy U-Play.","April 9, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The action is fast paced and addictive, while the dungeon building is easy to understand yet hard to master.  I absolutely love this game.","April 6, 2015","true","322.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
