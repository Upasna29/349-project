I came across Downfall, a game released in 2009 by the same guys. I played it a little bit - never finished it though - and was definitely intrigued by it. When I found out the developers were working on a remake, I felt like the happiest person alive. A 'new' game that would show why The Cat Lady got the attention that it deserved. The biggest question is now ofcourse: was the remake of R. Michalski's first game what we hoped for, or was it perhaps a downfall too?\n\n<<<Story>>>\n\nMeet Joe and Ivy Davis, a couple that has been struggling with their marriage for a long time due to Ivy's eating disorder. In order to try and save it, they decide to go on a trip to "Quiet Haven Hotel". Things don't really go as Joe had hoped, but as stubborn as he is, tries to keep fighting for Ivy. After all, he is supposed to love her .... Right?\n\n<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>\n\nJust like in TCL, the gameplay exists out of two major elements: progressing the story via dialogue and exploring the area to do various puzzles and actions. Being a character driven game, there is quite a lot of dialogue to be found, but luckily, the conversations never felt uninteresting. I was also quite surprised with the amount of different replies that you can give. You can behave like the sweet and understanding husband, or like one that is totally fed up with the whole situation. Furthermore, if the game's madness wasn't already enough for you, there's also that spoon of humour that they threw into the mix to make things even more interesting. Some replies don't make a huge difference in certain conversations, but atleast it feels like they do - it's rather amusing.\n\nBeing not a big puzzle solver myself, I was pleased to see that this game focused a little bit more on story progression rather than constant puzzle solving. And the puzzles that were present, were never too difficult or frustrating. I remember being stuck now and then in TCL, whereas in this game, I got only stuck once. Most of the puzzles are pretty straight forward, but you might have to think here and there. All in all, they are really fun to solve/do. Lastly, both of those elements (dialogue + puzzles) alternated often enough to keep the game fun and fluent: I never felt like either of them went on for too long or became tedious.\n\nPersonally, I am someone who plays through heavily story-based games (mostly) only once, but for those who so desire: there are multiple endings! So try to forget all about this game and maybe replay it within a couple of months. Or, if you just want to try out all the different dialogue options/hunt down the achievements, you can do that. Just make sure to save often enough or make use of the quick-save option.\n\n<<<Controls, graphics and sound\n\nThe controls are very minimalistic: wandering around is done by the arrow keys. Inventory usage? Yep, you guessed it: arrow keys! All confirmation is done by pressing enter. Lastly, want to skip some dialogue during your second playthrough? The space key is your friend. The controls worked like they should, however ... 1 tiny little thing bugged me throughout my playthrough: at certain parts of the game, you have many items at the same time. Instead of having to press the right arrow key multiple times to get to the furthest item, it would've been useful if I could've just pressed the left arrow key to get to it.\n\nAs the original Downfall was a little bit more colourful, this game presents itself in a 2d black-white style, with some sporadic colouring to be found. I like to think that the usage of black-white or colours reflect the characters' state of mind/certain events, but that is merely my personal interpretation. Whatever the developers tried to express, there is no doubt that it adds to the (creepy) atmosphere of the game. I also have to say that they did an exceptional job on the looks of the game. TCL already looked pretty good, but this game looks just gorgeous. Just about every area has been created with a lot of detail and care.\n\nAlong with the beautiful art comes the amazing soundtrack. I found the OST to be equally as good as the one in TCL. There was a lot of variety to be heard - from slow and creepy piano sounds to loud and heavy guitar riffs - that nailed setting the tone/atmosphere for the whole game. As it should be clear now, this is a game that makes you feel uncomfortable with almost everything that happens. Despite this feeling of unease, you just want to keep playing and discover how the story will unfold. These guys may not make bestselling games, but they are masters at setting an atmosphere so creepy, even at times when nothing's really happening: it's all in our head.\n\nMy biggest point of critique (regarding the sound section) concerns the voice acting (VA), especially during the prologue: as a prologue is meant to peek the player's first interest, I was rather disappointed. The VA during the rest of the game was well done though. A last point of critique goes to the different volume levels: there were certain scenes were one character was almost shouting in my ear, whilst the other was pretty much mumbling. Also, it seems like not every VA had a good quality mic, which is a shame. All in all, ok voice acting, but there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\n<<<The verdict>>>\n\nI am glad to conclude that this game was not a 'downfall' at all. People who enjoyed TCL will not only play through a new story that they'll get to love, but are also in for quite a surprise later in the game! Fans of (psychological) horror are also in for quite a ride, but may miss some references: I definitely recommend playing TCL too. Even if you don't like horror, you still may want to give this game a try. I'm not a real fan of horror myself - on the contrary - I try to stay away from it as much as possible. Yet, I found a special joy and satisfaction in playing such a stylistic game that dares to embrace such confrontational subjects.\n\nLay-out overhaul & minor content changes: May 10th 2016","February 17","true","6.1"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","45","55","0","12"

I have to say I am so happy that I was introduced to Harvester & R. Michalski by my friends here on Steam!!!\n\n2016 Downfall absolutely exceeded all of my expectations. It has so much new from the first Downfall (story-wise) and is beyond the perfect chaser if you're looking for something after The Cat Lady. As a fan of adventure/horror games - it really doesn't get better than this. The haunting art, outstanding music, full voice acting (yes it's a bit poor quality in some areas - but judging it for what it is I *loved* it!), the story...the choices...replayability....it's just a fantastic game.\n\nBelieve me - I was REALLY hype for this game so if anything I was nervous that it would let me down in some way - but it was SO GOOD. I will go and play it a few times over now. If you're on the fence about purchasing this: you will not regret it. Please support Harvester & Screen 7...and Warmer and the VAs and everyone on this project! I am looking forward to the final piece of this "trilogy", Lorelai.","February 19","true","17.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","0"

Completed the game in one sitting in about 4.5 hours. B-movie storyline is very nice. Art style is pretty great too though I guess not everyone will like the choice of black and white palette with occasional splashes of color. Music and overall sound design are just too good.\n\nNightmare-inducing 2009's Downfall is included in the package so it's the safe recommendation from me. In my opinion that game had superior artstyle and I also liked the much darker feel to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Bitterness/recommended/364390/","The_Bitterness","The Bitterness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Bitterness/","83 products in account","Disclosure: I received a pre-release copy. Completed with 'Ending A: On the Run' during first playthrough.\n\nDownfall (2016) is a very good adventure game that is in line with The Cat Lady and even the original Downfall, at once not bound by its predecessor and yet faithful to it. Players unfamiliar with the the formerly mentioned games will miss a number of tie-ins but should not feel like they are missing part of the game. Players familiar with the formerly mentioned games will be in for a real treat.\n\nNegative Points\nSound\n-There is an issue with audio popping/static on the default settings that I encountered in the non-Steam version, easily fixed and which I wrote a fix for in the Steam just in case others come across it;*\n-there is an issue with volume leveling throughout the game, where the music will at times overwhelm the dialogue and vice-versa. This is something that Rem is looking into for a post-release patch;\n-voice acting ranges from fantastic (actors for Adult Joe, Agnes/Young Ivy) to poor (Young Joe, Adult Joe's and Adult Ivy's screams). The voice acting is generally quite good, however the bit in the Prelude (sans Young Ivy, who was fantastic) and the two bits involving Adult  Joe and Adult Ivy screaming at different points are worth mentioning because the rest of the voice acting is so good. The issues seems to owe to not using soundproofing during the recording, as Adult Joe's scream is notably muted and Adult Ivy's sees the actress notably standing away from the microphone. Young Joe's lines are generally delivered in a choppy or stilted form, however there are some lines that are delivered well.\n\nNarrative\n-Players unfamiliar with The Cat Lady will be able to make sense of the latest parts of the game without issue, however they will not be able to enjoy the narrative tie-ins as they appear in earlier and later parts of the game.\n\nGameplay\n-Players familiar with the original Downfall may lament the lack of combat (yes, the original point-and-click adventure game had a few combat and chase scenes) and the absence of puzzles (e.g. Dr. Z's mannequin). This is a matter of personal preference given that some of the puzzles in the original were obtuse, which contributed to pacing issues;\n-the camera motion and 'follower' movement (Young Ivy and Agnes) lurches in a distracting fashion, leaving a number of scenes feeling cut off (e.g. the children discovering X marks the spot in the Prelude) and giving multi-character movement a sense of awkwardness;\n-solutions to most scenes will be known to those that played the original Downfall and this can detract from the game for players that are sensitive to spoilers.\n\nPositive Points\nSound\n-The music is, once again, superb and maintains the same high quality as the original Downfall and The Cat Lady insofar as meeting the overall tone of a given scene and the way one scene flows into the next;\n-sound effects are appropriate (not overdone, too frequent, or off-sounding) and in sync with the animations. This should not need mentioning, however this is a problem with any number of video games across all genres and therefore a strong point for a small development team;\n-the addition of voice acting really brings the game alive in a way different from the original Downfall. The voice actors generally do quite a good job, with a strong notable mention being the voices in the Paradise of Rotting Flesh.\n\nVisual Design\n-The mixed-media-meets-graphic-novel approach that had its origins in the original Downfall and was greatly improved in The Cat Lady see further improvement here. The sickly and ominous sepia wash in the Prelude is just as poignant as the sparse use of colour outside of the prelude, cementing the chosen approach to visual design;\n-Quite Haven Hotel is easily reminiscent of the version in the original Downfall. The game world consisting of the hotel and other properties is at once a bit larger (extra rooms/corridors) while at the same time smaller (no movie studio), however on the whole the game world is a bit larger and the parts are better integrated than the original Downfall. Further, the room designs all retain the same core theme from the original Downfall while having noticeable differences, irrespective of whether an element in a room is added to/removed or whole rooms are added/removed. Players that are unfamiliar with the original Downfall will neither recognise nor miss these elements, while players familiar with it will be able to take joy in recognising the alterations.\n\nNarrative\n-The characters are all incredibly vivid and relatable. We know or know of someone like Harrison and 'Birthday Sophie', Joe and Ivy, Joe's father, and all the other characters. Some of their mannerisms seem exaggerated, but that is the point and proof of their relatability: a surprising number of people really are that way;\n-Joe, like Susan in The Cat Lady, initially questions the surreal environment but soon comes to accept it. The implications of this will not go unnoticed by more critical players interested in exploring the game's themes and metaphors;\n-the heavy themes explored in the game are balanced by an appreciable level of sardonic humour, something that was absent in the original Downfall and lightens what could potentially be a too oppressive mood for some players;\n-the blender scene. Period.\n\nGameplay\n-Players unfamiliar with the original Downfall will be able to enjoy a game that features the clear pacing of The Cat Lady and players familiar with the original will be able to appreciate the much clearer pacing when recalling the original. The gameplay is seamless and fast-paced, both incredibly appropriate given the game's narrative;\n-the game is unburdened by obtuse or frustrating gameplay elements which typified point-and-click adventure games, allowed players to immerse themselves in the narrative and focus on plot points-as-gameplay-decisions rather than pixel hunting and the like. This may seem like a problem to players looking for a more typical point-and-click adventure game, however it is important to understand that Harvester Games aimed at this approach rather than the more typical one and, thus, they succeeded at doing what they aimed to do all along.\n\nMeta-Game\n-Downfall (2016) seems to indicate the idea of creating a shared universe given The Cat Lady tie-ins. If this is actually the case players familiar with all three games are in for a real treat when it comes to the fourth game in what would be the trilogy;\n-players of either or both the original Downfall and The Cat Lady will find the shared universe, and retained/cross-over elements (e.g. the dress mannequin) to be rewarding. These elements are well done and do not get in the way of or otherwise obscure the narrative. Downfall (2016) is a game that stands on its own, but is a game that is very much for fans of what we can likely call 'the series'.\n_____\n* http://steamcommunity.com/app/364390/discussions/0/405691491122696276/","February 15","true","7.3"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","2"

Raw, gritty, without peers, hauntingly beautiful at times and a complete mind ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis visuals are a continuation of the unique art style of the Cat Lady, along with the story the stand out element of the game. From the outset the game is manic, as early as 10 minutes in tackling issues such as the incredibly gruesome death of a sibling, eating disorders, break down of a marriage, control within relationships & later infidelity. There are plot elements which leave you completely and utterly torn between whether or not character choices were the selfish or the selfless thing to do or more likely both. I fealt helpless, useless, no comprehension of whether I was helping or harming. True to it's name as the game progresses the plot points and character's sanity levels plummet to the point where reality is a blur, the game makes your head spin, leaves a bad taste in your mouth like a fryed belly fat / human head and "oregano" smoothie but for all the gore it's an immensely beautiful game in it's own bizarre way akin to doing the perfect swan dive from a waterfall into a pool of blood. The scene composition is stunning, something any photographer would rightly be proud of.\n\nFor fans of the Cat Lady there are many popular returning characters and elements of the story tie directly into that game thus it's hard for me as a fan to not recommend.","February 19","true","10.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

This is a remake of the 2009 game by the same developers, and it is included in this version.\n\nSTORYYou play as Joe Davis, a man who goes on vacation with his wife Ivy to the Quiet Haven hotel to try and fix their marriage problems. However, after the first night, Ivy disappears and weird, disturbing, violent and space-bending things start to happen.\nIf you played the developer's previous game or read some of Stephen King's horror novels, you know what you are gonna get: a creepy and weird story with depressed characters and dark humor. Saying more about the story would spoil it, but just know this: I was hooked from the get-go and I played the entire game in one sitting, which rarely happens to me. I laughed, I cringed, and I even cried while playing this. One of the best stories in a game since Telltale's first season of The Walking Dead.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is made with Adventure Game Studio, and you will either love or hate how it looks. It's mostly in black and white with 2D stripes and burst of colors (mostly a lot of red blood). There are some disturbing and gory images that might scar those who aren't used to them, and a couple of sequences will leave you with your eyes wide open in sheer terror.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is played entirely with the keyboard. You can pick up, examine and use items, as well as talk to the people that you will find. It is a very standard adventure game and there isn't any sequence that changes things up a bit, but the game focuses more on the story rather than gameplay, and the latter works more than well to move the story forward.\n\nCHALLENGEThe puzzle are usually really intuitive and even non-fans of the genre won't have trouble figuring out what to do. Still, I would've liked a couple more thought-provoking puzzles than the ones that we got.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is either going to ruin or make your experience. I personally really enjoyed it: the voice actors deliver their lines in a weird way that, surprisingly, works with the overall tone of the movie. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack that mixes quiet and eerie tracks with hard-rock songs.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are many choices that you make in the game that will change the outcome, leading to one of three different endings. There are also 30 Steam achievements to unlock that will keep you completionists busy enough to play the game at least three times.\n\nOverall, Downfall is an incredible adventure game that delivers a compelling, eerie and romantic story with simple but effective gameplay, delightfully weird voice acting and good replayability. A must-buy for fans of great stories in video games!\n\nStory: 10\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 6\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 9.5\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","February 18","true","6.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

This shouldn’t be a surprise to those of you who are aware with the studio’s work given the outstanding The Cat Lady that the studio released in 2012. Despite releasing only last month the original version of the game was released even before The Cat Lady in 2009. The original 2009 release of the game is now freeware which you can get from the title’s official website.\n\nFor those of you who are questioning whether or not you should just grab the free game or to pony up the $13.99 for the newly released version do know that the recently released version has been significantly remade and has been reimagined in a fashion similar to that of The Cat Lady – which to fans of the game should automatically raise a huge smile. For those unaware of the original title then I’d like to kindle your imagination with the thoughts of some of the best psychological horrors on the big screen coming to mind in 1408  and Identity.\n\nI was a huge fan of the controls that are established within the game. The simplicity of the system makes the game a joy to play and allows the player to concentrate on the story being narrated. I’m not going to spoiler the game too much as it is another game that deserves to be played and experienced first hand. I know some of you have advised me that you consider it lazy writing but I firmly believe that there are just some games that demand to be experienced first hand rather than being narrated to you to the point where when you come to play the game it becomes impossible for the narrative to have the same effect upon you as it possibly could have.\n\nThe graphics while simple really help establish the atmosphere and aide immersion. The camera work is extraordinary and while I know Total Biscuit hates people referring to games as cinematic experiences this is certainly a game that deserves that phrase being applied to it. Animations are used sparingly but when they are used in each scene there is an undeniable purpose which is consistently well executed. The decisions made towards the utilization of monochrome with very minimal utilization of color is outstanding and extend through to the lighting used throughout the game. This makes the horror and the gore stand out at a level that is arguably greater than the sum of its parts. This in turn leads to the voice acting. Although there are some scenes that I feel lack the oomph that would have made it a truly great experience throughout there is enough strength in the delivery that makes the whole above average. The decisions behind the choice of songs that constitute soundtrack are also of a sound decision. The sounds again raise the level of the horror and demand praise. It is a game that I would recommend that you wear headphones for.\n\nA word of warning for some of you to take heed of is that there is quite a significant amount of gore throughout the game.\n\nDownfall is one of the best psychological horror experiences I have enjoyed across all media in a long time. It is highly recommended.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 28","true","3.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daveferret/recommended/364390/","daveferret","ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daveferret/","1899 products in account","Product received for free\n\nPolish developer Remigiusz Michalski in 2009 introduced an interesting adventure Downfall, which was praised for its horror atmosphere with intriguing story. It is now published in its revised version, which every obscure adventure games fan should not miss.\n\nDownfall was inherently point and click adventure, but in a revised version this is more of an interactive story in the style of Telltale Games. The author left the classic point and click interface, completely redesigned graphics and music, let the dub characters (one character is dubbed by a fan of the previous games) and even rewrote the story to partially follow a different game The Cat Lady to please its fans. Remake is thus not only a newly released version of the game.\n\nThe first major change and the hallmark of the game is that the environment of the camera is viewed from the side, and the main protagonist is controlled directly via the keyboard. In essence, therefore using only the keyboard. The game does not use the mouse at all, and after a while you will find that playing with just one hand is so easy. Backgrounds are a mix of photographs, rendered 3D models and cartoon characters. Today's players might argue that the game is graphically outdated, but according to me it is a raw and original visual concept that somehow belongs to Downfall.\n\nThe graphical representation is related to a story that certainly does not mince words and warnings at the beginning of the game, that this is a game for adults. After the opening sequence, where we introduce the main characters Joe and Ivy reveals, that among them there is something wrong. Couple arrives at Quiet Haven to spend the night. Ivy starts to behave strangely and soon lost. If you expect it will be a classic horror plot about kidnapped mistress and some monster holding her, you are far from the core. In fact, it is a very thoughtful psychological horror that you’ll be thinking about even after finishing. Downfall is not afraid to dish out some very gory scenes and two rather gross tasks. Additionally, it is often possible to choose dialogue options available in a journey, which then leads to a different end. There’s no need to spoil anything, but Downfall offers more than just one conclusion.\n\nThe puzzles are well designed and items needed to solve them are in sequential order as the narrative goes. You could say that their difficulties are among the simple, basically it is impossible to be stuck on something. Here it's all about the story. Fans will be pleased that the story includes some characters from other author’s games and it looks like it is going to be a sequel.\n\nThe only drawback is the use of already aged Adventure Game Studio engine, where you can’t simply change the game resolution from the standard 800 × 600 pixels, for example, on a notebook. It’s a pity author didn’t use some advanced engine.\n\nOverall this game caught me with its story and stylisation that I basically finished it in one sitting during the evening. It has achievements on Steam that reveal a few surprises, so playing time is extended. If you are into dark and unusual adventure games, I definitely have to recommend a new version of Downfall.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.\nFor similar reviews and fantastic giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/.","May 21","true","7.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

This is generally an extreme improvement, though also manages to be odd in amusing ways.  "The Cat Lady" managed to engulf all of the original "Downfall" into its own plot arc, and did so in a subtle way that worked very well.  Here, the Downfall remake attempts to reengulf "The Cat Lady," for an odd game-ception effect.  Fans of "The Cat Lady" are likely to be pleased, but any newcomers to this universe are more likely to just be clueless and baffled by the jarring and out of place late-game characters.\n\nAlso, while this version polishes some of the rougher patches of the 2009 story, I can't honestly say that this story is as good as "The Cat Lady."  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.  "The Cat Lady (TCL)" was AMAZING.  As such, it makes sense that this game would pull so much of its elements into itself to get that boost.  It's a fair move, and it works, but not completely.  The game suffers most just in comparison to the game it's copying: the sequel (this game) just isn't as good as the original (TCL, 2012).  Even though, technically, this is both the sequal (2016) AND the original (2009).","February 21","true","15.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","6"

I'm really happy that this game got remade and released on Steam though.  I think that Rem has a distinctive art style and sense of humor that permeates throughout both of his works.  Sure you could pick at the voice acting that it isn't always top quality but there's only so much you can do when there's so few people actually working to make the game.\n\nI think the story was excellent and can be appreciated even more for people that played through 'The Cat Lady'.

Now where do I start on this game? Downfall is an adventure game with an intriguing storyline. Personally myself, I have played both The Cat Lady and the origional 2009 Downfall. The art-style is similar to that of the Cat Lady. I was pleasently suprised at the amount of changes that Downfall went through from the origional game. Dissapointingly some of the puzzles from the original game were not put into this version of the game, which I enjoyed a lot (Doctor Z's manniquin, combat scenes). I did like how they changed it so that Joe didn't have splitting headaches and slept in the middle of the game as seen in the original game. I felt that it allowed the game to run smoother, and feel of an urgent need to find Ivy. Although I loved the tie-ins to The Cat Lady I can't help but be dissapointed that the twist ending of the original Downfall wasn't used within this verison of the game. Despite this, the game still came alive with the artwork, voice acting, and music used within the game. Overall, I enjoyed this game and wont hesitate to play it again. I suggest anyone a fan of The Cat Lady or similar point-and-click adventure games pick this up. You won't regret it.","February 15","true","16.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Everything you do, you do with the arrow keys. You find items, put them in your inventory, and use them to solve puzzles (which are pretty simple) However, the most important factor in this game is the story. And boy, what a story it is.\n\nThe game is very short, it will take you approximately 4-5 hours to finish - and that's if you're being thorough. Now, usually I would recommend picking up games of this length on a sale, this one however I think it's worth the full price. The replayability value in this game is insane. So many dialogue options and scenarios, and there are 3 possible endings. The good, the bad and the neutral. Though, the good isn't really all that happy either. Which I liked!\n\nThe good stuff\n* Dialogue - the script for this game is amazing. It's worth playing just for Joe's mean lines alone.\n* Artstyle - very unique and surreal. Hell, even the paintings in this game are great! Gloomy and dark with hints of color (red) throughout the game.\n* Soundtrack - the maker of this game is very good at choosing the right music for each scenario. I love all the soundtracks, and I find myself listening to them outside of the game as well. Really helps creating the atmosphere.\n* Replayability - I highly recommend taking your time to explore all the dialogue and all the outcomes. Will take you approximately 12-15 hours.\n* Puzzles - not too easy, not too obvious either. Clever.\n* Story - the story will mess with your head. It's weird, and I love it.\n* Price - good price for an amazing game.\n* Joe Davis - yep.\n\nThe not-so-good stuff\n* Audio - sometimes the audio just sounds... off. Some of the voice actors have a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mic, which sorta ruins the mood and dialogue sometimes. This was a problem The Cat Lady had as well.\n* Sometimes the controls feels slow and not responsive. Also a problem The Cat Lady had.\n\nI highly recommend playing this, especially if you're already a Cat Lady fan. Those of you with a BBW fetish might enjoy this as well.","April 15","true","14.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

The voices in the prologue/tutorial could have used a bit of work, but from watching on their Facebook page, it seemed like a last minute addition to add some kid voice actors into the game, as well as that scene.\n\nThe art style, you can easily tell its always in black and white with a splash of color, yet my mind seemed to add color without me even realizing such. Quite haunting and easy to recommend. Easy to learn controls, and the story, from the very beginning, makes you keep wanting to know more, while adding in more questions as it goes.\n\nIt is a bit hard to connect with Joe, seeing as a lot of his dialogue options are rather pushy, and I found myself selecting them all before being forced to choose the one I wasn't pleased with. But the way everyone sounds in the game, I've made him seem rather unsurprised about his situations.\n\nWas really hoping for 5iah to be on the soundtrack but, either I'm blind and cannot find the song, or it's simply not there for copyright reasons. Overall, a rather enjoyable game and a remake, and rather nifty that it comes with the original 2009 game as well.\n\nThe Dead Celebrities achievement had me grinning like a loon though =3","February 15","true","11.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Of all the gore and overt attempts at disgust that games and movies deal with these days, only few are truly effective. In games you are either stopped entirely and put into a cutscene of some kind or you face these horrors with obliviousness, whereby the characters does not even to what we know he or she must be aware of, and that conventionally horrify you. Downfall has an interesting movement in this regard, it falls somewhere between the loss of control of a cutscene, but within the world of the played character. A loss of control in this sense is what we in real life would call a reflexive reaction. We cringe, brace ourselves, shield our face, eyes, cower back, etc, and the same happens in this game. This is one part of the realism that underlies the entirety of this experience. And it is that same realism that manages to hit so hard, and actually horrify as every absurdly surrealistic scene has roots to the physical world; yet becomes otherworldly in the compound of these worldly parts.\n\nWhen I wrote about The Cat Lady, I mistakenly called it fittingly ugly. This was largely due to an inability to thoughtfully articulate what actually went on aesthetically in games of this ilk (only Downfall and The Cat Lady, as far as I know). Ugliness in regards to this game should entirely be replaced with the term unsettling, or uncanny. It is ugly in the sense that dissonance is ugly. It is jarring, but that does not necessarily mean that it is not suitable for the purposes at hand. In horror, the discordant, unsettling and dissonant are vital to engender a creepy atmosphere.\n\nBut Downfall falls far beyond the merely creepy, and actually lands in the sphere of horror, actual horror. And rarely with much pretense or by having disgust be the goal in and of itself, Downfall's disgust, conjured by the various scenes, serve a narrative purpose; they more often than not carry a symbolic value. This is in large due to the psychological aspect. Instead of straight up depression, as in The Cat Lady, Downfall instead deals with eating disorders or general self-hatred, basically dysmorphobia, where one has either a delusional or actual flaw that is exaggerated to the point of pathology. And it is this dysmorphic view that leads Joe Davis down this horrific path in his attempt to save his beloved wife, and the base which gives meaning to what you'd otherwise interpret as meaninglessly disgusting and surreal. Everything hearkens back to mental illness, allusions to schizophrenia and depression are as common as the dysmorphobia, and all add to the theme of the game, which I'd sum up as  the fight against the thoughts produced by mental illnesses, viz., our internal pathological struggles.\n\nAlong those lines the game struts. It flaunts its horror without being hemmed by shame, comfort nor laziness. But what does it have to say about beating these thoughts? Anything beyond the clichés? The dark room of the hateful thoughts about oneself are said to be counteracted by company, by appealing to the other. At the same time, as the other, we are told it is hopeless (depending on your actions in game, really, but this was the case for me). The multiple endings all add to the aforementioned realism, but vary in what they propound about the hopelessness of the ill mind, making the experience fragmented, divergent, depending on who you are and how you approach this topic, or these suffering people.\n\nThe choices of this game are somewhat subtle. And your actions are free in a sense, and it is hard to predict the consequences of these actions without playing the game multiple times. In a way that gives you replay value, but also a limited first-time experience. I prefer a one-time holistic experience. I do not necessarily think more time played means more value. But real choice, in games, are considered to be those that in some way affect the story or change the final outcome, and on that note, the choices in this game are real choices. But for those who do not necessarily want to play a game 4-5 times to exhaust all the options available to them, it becomes a source of frustration. However, I imagine the latter kind of people are a minority.\n\nWhile there are puzzle elements, they are rarely problematic. It's a matter of simple world association and paying attention to the dialog and at times the dialog options. Explore thoroughly and pay attention and nothing should be too difficult to overcome in this game. This can be construed as both a positive and a negative, there is no challenge, really, but there is also no frustration. The horror gets to play its part without having to be compromised by overly complicated puzzles. And despite there being no real challenge, there is satisfaction in figuring out the solutions of the quandaries of Joe and company.\n\nIt's a concise experience. It is genuine and simple in many ways, but it serves the purpose of making the symbolic relations shine so much brighter. It's clear, most of all. The equivocalness that may arise is not due to any fault in the game's ability to tell a story, but in the story itself and what it tries to portray, which tend towards equivocalness. Attempting to do this is very much admirable. To touch darkness as a sort of exuberant catharsis. To with your full body delve into absolute horror and see your way through it. Mainly because you are an observer, thereby excluded from it, but also by playing a character going through it, sometimes managing, sometimes not. Instead of alluding to psychological pathology as a pretext for silliness or surrealism, it is used with a great understanding of its reality. The imagery is forceful to signify the intensity of the feeling not everyone experiences, but can through this game. This game can intensify our understanding of these mental issues, or at least give us the blueprint of what such a game could look like. Because it can be done more smoothly, I imagine, with greater focus on inner experience in lieu of the focus on a flashy narrative. We can stay in the moment, in the atmosphere of an awful inner life, Silent Hill 2, along with games like Downfall and The Cat Lady, proved that. But what they have yet to figure out is how to truly create a game where everything leads to the same place, like in Spec Ops: The Line, for example. These games on emotional pain have yet to figure out a way to fully encapsulate themselves in their thematics; yet they remain on a very interesting path towards excellent game-creation, that eventually will have the added bonus of being truly emotionally fulfilling, profound and beautiful.\n\nhaha","May 21","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you still are not sure about this purchase you can read here in full length why you probably should buy this piece of art:\n\nTo be honest from the start, "The Cat Lady" by R. Michalski brought me up to this game as a fan already even before I played "Downfall" and I left as an even bigger fan of the whole story. Although "The Cat Lady" is a storywise prequel to what happens in this game, "Downfall" still stands there as an independent game which can be played without playing the other game first.\n\nJust a short summary of the story without spoiling anything: The marriage of Joe and Ivy Davis is not going too well, so Joe organized a trip to a nice country hotel as a chance to repair their broken relationship. After a fight between the two of them, Ivy disappears under mysterious circumstances and in order to save her Joe  goes on a quest through a creepy, disturbing and surreal environment embedded into the hotel they stayed in. Determined to save his wife Ivy, Joe is ready to go far into the abyss of human nature...\n\nSo much for the story. The player is playing as Joe Davis, exploring the scenery in "The Quiet Haven Hotel" using simple arrow commands to walk around and interact with the environment. To solve puzzles you are picking up items to use them on certain other objects. The difficulty of these was perfect for this type of game because they were not too easy but not hard enough to break the flow of the game in case the player gets stuck; but at the same time the puzzles weren't generic especially in terms of creativity due to them being incredibly disturbing sometimes. Another key gameplay feature is the ability to choose between dialogue options, making significant decisions occasionally (there are 3 possible endings depending on things you say/do on your journey). Furthermore the game supports full voice acting and the voice actors did a great job overall in giving the characters more personality and depth.\n\nNow, the pros and the cons for this game.\nFirst of all, the pros: Surrealism and horror are two terms which are made for each other and you will find a spectacular mix of the two of them in this game, crafted into a beautifully eerie environment; if you like things like that combined with a stunning soundtrack that always fits the situtation perfectly you will fall in love with this game (47 titles which can be bought separately as an addition to the game). Although it still is a game, much play time will be invested in plot development, this should be kept in mind when considering to buy this game, but luckily the story does not let the buyer down. I was totally content with the way the plot unfolded and unraveled (and especially with the appearing characters too!); all endings made sense and the game remained true to what it is, a horror game. Beside the plot which I liked anyway, the game also deals with real life problems (especially anorexia) in a hauntingly shocking way which I will remember probably long after playing it.\nNow the cons: The one thing I need to criticize the most is that for the full experience you should have played "The Cat Lady" already, because the endings just make so much more sense with the knowledge you gain from this game (although I certainly recommend everyone to play it anyway). Another negative thing is the tutorial sequence. It just seemed forced and it was mainly unnecessary for the plot itself  Robbie dying because of hand grenades, come on, just why . For the cost of this game a duration of 4-5 hours is not really much neither.\n\nSummary: I can completely recommend this game to fans of horror who like a nicely narrated story with well-made characters. The different dialogue options and endings invite the buyer to replay it, justifying the short duration of this game.","February 26","true","10.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I played the original Downfall a while back and now seeing the remastered version of it is amazing. This game has a unique plot and characters, and it always kept me on the edge of my seat. I really like how the choices one makes affects the game's outcome. I played through it multiple times and finally got all possible outcomes and achievements.

When I heard Downfall was being remade I was super psyched, and now it's finally out! Just finished my first runthrough, and I'm so pleased with this new version.\n\nGood\n-Voice acting! A little awkward in some places, but generally good. Shoutout to Chiseleya especially! Also a few familiar voices show up, and it was lovely to hear them.\n-Clearer, more streamlined plot, including integration with TCL.\n-The least intuitive puzzles/least fun segments of the original Downfall were removed or altered.\n-Even though I knew the plot of the game and generally what was coming, there were surprises and some moments were still genuinely scary.\n-TCL lovers will be extra, unexpectly pleased in the latter portion of the game.\n\nBad\n-Short! I finished in about five hours I think, but I also generally knew how to solve the puzzles/where to progress the plot from the original Downfall so it may be longer for others.\n-Answers a lot of previous questions about integration with TCL, but raises some new confusing ones. Maybe it'll make more sense the next play, though.\n-A few classic awesome elements of the original Downfall ended up scrapped or altered.\n-The plot might be a little TOO in your face and easy to understand now.\n\nIn general, I absolutely loved it and I'm looking forward to some more playthroughs. I'm definitely not disappointed with this remake, and even better it's different enough from the original that there's still replayability for both versions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanRelax/recommended/364390/","DeanRelax","Alexander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeanRelax/","228 products in account","The Cat Lady was my game of the year back in 2014 (even though it came out in 2012) and It's still one of the best games I've ever played story wise. So the expectations I had for this game were huge. This review will be filled with comparisons between these two games so if you haven't played The Cat Lady and are reading this review, just stop here and buy both of these games. And note that I did not play the 2009 original of Downfall because I didn't know it existed until I already heard they were working on a remake, so I wanted to save myself for this one.\n\nDid this game live up to my expectations? Both yes and no. Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome game and I highly recommend it to players that are into these kind of games. However, one reason that this game somewhat didn't live up to my expectations might be because it's a remake of an older game. I wanted this game to surpass The Cat lady which it didn't even come close to. The Cat Lady left me with a great satisfaction and a feeling for closure when I finally beat it (on all endings). This game did not give me that feeling, it gave more of a Telltale games ending, leaving you with a cliffhanger (at least with the first ending I got). Some might love these kind of endings and that's great for them. And some might argue that The Cat Lady is the sequel so it's not really a cliffhanger. This doesn't explain Joe's "cameos" in The Cat Lady though, as far as I know. There are some loose ends in this game that I hung up on and I'm not really a fan of games and movies where you have to interpret your own story or ending.\n\nThe second thing that made me a little disappointed was how short this game is compared to The Cat Lady. And yet again, I know that this is a remake and I won't argue against that. The Cat Lady took me around 15-20 hours to fully complete with all endings and 100% achievements (2 of the runs were with the help of a walk-through on YouTube). I completed this game in under 5 hours with 50% of the achievements. I don't see myself sitting for another 10+ hours getting the rest of the achievements and endings since this game was much more simpler than The Cat Lady (didn't get stuck more than a few minutes in this one while it could take me hours to figure out some parts in The Cat Lady).\n\nLast but not least I have to touch on the subject regarding the voice acting. This is something I pointed out as the biggest flaw in my review of The Cat Lady and sadly it wasn't improving in this game. I know, I know, this is a small budget indie game, and so was The Cat Lady but I just can't take some parts in these games seriously due to the lack of emotions from the actors (not all of them though). I always get the image in my head of a person sitting in front of their computer reading of a script with zero emotion and effort when that said character in on screen, and that kills a lot of the mysterious atmosphere in these two games.\n\nEnough of my bashing and rambling. I do still recommend this game and it's still one of the best horror/adventure games I've played in the past years and I would like to thank the developer who has given us these two great games. As a Cat Lady fanatic, I still hold that game highly over this one. I might edit this review in the near future after I'm done with my second play through. That's what I love about these games, they have a really high replay value.\n\nTL; DR: Do you like The Cat Lady? If not, don't bother with this one, otherwise buy this game ASAP. Haven't played either of them? Look up short clips of either game on YouTube (the trailers don't seem to convince people since a lot of negative comments on these games are people not understanding the actual gameplay) and buy both of them. It's not a game for everyone though due to its very dark and twisted story.","February 16","true","5.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

While my second playthrough started to hit some glitches (mostly just Joe sliding around the screen when I attempt to open doors, nothing that impacted actual game play or story) and I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out what to vary in actions to change my ending, I’d certainly recommend others buying this.\n\nThe indie source shows in a lot of the voice acting audio and some of the artwork in close up scenes, but it's nothing I can't live with.The Voice acting may drive people some people up the wall because I know some people really can't stand any issues with voice audio quality, but I will say it's improved immensely since The Cat Lady. So if you could put up with the recording issues there, you'll probably be just fine with this game.\n\nI'm certainly looking forward to more work by this developer.","February 18","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I heard a girl, who was obviously roofied or drunk spouting some of the most horrible dialogue ever (although after finishing the game I just think perhaps she has a speech impediment.) Then a guy having issues with AcCENTing Upon the Wrong SylLABles comes along with even more horrible lines. Finally, one of the most awesome songs ever kicks in.\n\nSo I got this because I knew I'd clown on it. I knew (and I was right), that it'd be Playstation Resident Evil 1 quality of voice work. And boy was I right. It's right on par with, or maybe even worse than, "Hope this is not... Chris' blood!?!" and "The master of unlocking." I'm all about horror, but this voice acting is downright horrible. It's great for a laugh, but it removes you from the story when everyone (except the Manageress) sounds like they suddenly forgot how to speak normally.\n\nSo it ends up being something other than intended, much like "The Room."  This game tries to be horror but ends up coming off as some kind of laughable B grade horror-comedy. It's sad too, because it seems to want to deal with some fairly serious subject matter.\n\nNow, that's not to say it's bad. It's great, and I highly recommend everyone play it. Sure, the dialogue is ♥♥♥♥, and a majority of the voice actors are about as wonderful as choking on a bag of ♥♥♥♥♥, but it can give you a laugh, the art is AMAZING, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nPlus, everyone should go on Bandcamp and buy the song "Boogeyman" by Black Casino and the Ghost that's on the trailer and at the end of the game. It's not on the soundtrack here (which I also bought) and it's well worth the .99 or so.\n\nIn the end, buy the game, have some laughs, see some cool art, and support Tommy Wiseau errr... the developer. And who knows, maybe he'll make enough money to hire decent voice actors next time, so I can play a horror game that actually comes off as a horror game.","March 7","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

This game included the expected blood and gore, as well as murdering animals and children, and a lot of talk of eating disorders and the accompanying thoughs someone would have when going through that. Because of that, this isn't really game for everyone (if you have an eating disorder, think long and hard about whether or not you can handle this game right now), but it is a good game.\n\nI think this is a game that you'll need to play after finishing The Cat Lady, as there are several references (and sections of the game) where you'll have no idea what's happening unless you know who Susan Ashworth is etc. It's not necessary to play the 2009 version of Downfall, though, unless you'd like to compare. The new version differs in story a bit, is much less colourful, and there's voice acting! Unfortunately, some of the voice acting was really off, and the inclusion of a "mandatory" prologue bit will put a lot of people off of finishing this, I'm sure. But please, if you're reading this, go through the prologue and you'll be happier once you start the actual game.\n\nI wasn't fond of the redesign of Susan and Mitzi (Susan looked awful, not going to lie), and I thought Ivy looked very different than her 2009 character, as did Agnes. I didn't care for Ivy at all, mostly because everything felt a bit forced and the mic would crack sometimes, but I think that overall, she was a good character and she did well being a new voice actor. I loved Joe, and I wish the game were longer so we could play as him a bit longer-- that's another thing, the game is shorter than I would have liked. Agnes was a pain at first, and again, very very different, but halfway through the game she became my favourite character. Really, I think the only characters who needed more work or didn't have their characters explored enough were Dr Z (there was a LOT cut out in this version of the game), Joe's family, and Ivy as I previously mentioned. Also, nobody really says much about the evil presence that wrecks everyone's holiday beyond the cryptic things you'd expect, and this was also the case in the older game, so I wish they'd done something with that.\n\nI think that the Axe Man was poorly used in the game compared to the 2009 version, but he was a threat and he did do what he was supposed to do at least for a little while. The game didn't have me as on edge as The Cat Lady, though, and that's a shame. I think the addition of "tendency hints" kind of ruins the game a bit, but I appreciate that they allowed you the option to turn them on and off.\n\nOne major criticism I have with the game isn't about the game itself, but about the Extras-- I felt like some of the dev bios etc. were really, really awkward to read. Some read like they were trying too hard to be edgy, and I took the game a bit less seriously after that.\n\nOverall, I do think it's worth playing this game. It was moving, uncomfortable, and disturbing, and I think that anyone looking to play this expects that going in. The game itself is gorgeous except for the new Susan Ashworth, and the dialogue is great (Joe has some of the BEST lines!). I do recommend playing this AFTER playing The Cat Lady and the 2009 version of Downfall, and I also promise that things get better after the prologue if you just get through it.","March 11","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now that I've had a chance to play it, I can say I liked it a lot. The art looks great and since much of Quiet Haven follows the original layout, it feels very nostalgic to be back there if you've played the first game. It's nice to see some parts of the story more fleshed out than they originally were as well. The voice acting is so-so. Some of the voice actors were rather good, others had some moments that I didn't care for. But nothing was full on cringeworthy for me. The only thing about this remake that bothered me was that it doesn't stay true to the original story and it felt like all the most controversial parts were changed or removed. Don't expect it to be quite as gritty as the old version. Still, this one is very much worth playing too and it's great to see this twisted love story retold like this.","February 29","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I get to the end of the game, it turns out I was off by one and I end up getting the bad ending, which resulted in me playing the game again to get the Golden Ending, and let me tell you, playing the game a second time is definitely worth it.\nThe controls are pretty much the same as from 'The Cat Lady' but with the addition of the quicksave/quickload option using the "F" keys which are a BIG help and such a good convenience, especially when you think you've made the wrong choice in a segment.

I appreciate all of the Steam users out there that take so much time writing near professional quality reveiws of games, for all of us who are undecided when we want to make a purchase. However, I am not that person, and I only write reviews when I am so very passionate about a game, and I feel the need to tell the world! The only problem is when I sit down to type it I cannot ever seem to articulate my feelings for the game and I end up not doing the game justice. I say "this game was amazing, I loved it, buy it." I run out of ways to truly explain it after a few sentences. That being said, please bear with me! For those of you scanning over the reviews, just trying to make a quick decision, I will spare you my lengthy drawn out babbling and say this: unless you are squeamish and don't like gore, JUST DO IT-PLEASE BUY THIS GAME-YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!\n\nI first played Downfall around the time The Cat Lady (TCL) was released. I loved TCL so very much and I was excited to not only find another game by the same devs but also a game that had a storyline that was intertwined with TCL. It was free to boot! The original version of Downfall, was lacking in the graphics department, (not complaining just an observation) but that did not matter whatsoever. The devs very wisely chose to use these "painted vignette" themed rooms, and the main character himself (Joe Davis) seemed like a vignette. Because of this specific artistic style, heavy atmosphere, amazingly haunting music, and story, story, STORY (OMG that story), the lack of graphical quality did not matter. Within minutes I was captivated by the story of Joe and Ivy Davis and had to understand what exactly was going on at The Quiet Haven Hotel. An hour into the game I couldn't stop playing and around 4am the following morning when I finished it, I wanted to play it again! Unfortunately I had to go to work, and I sat (exhausted) all day at my desk thinking about Joe, Ivy, "Sophie," all of it. I played through Downfall again over the next couple days. As far as I could tell then it did not have a branching storyline, as I got the same ending twice and don't remember any choices that were made where the screen dims or a sound is made letting you know you have made a game altering decision. Either way-I was still left with many questions, and I wanted MORE -sort of like when I was all done playing Silent Hill.\nI forgot about Downfall for awhile, and just recently I was browsing through my games and thought I'd give TCL another go as it had been years since I played. Then I thought, wait-let me play Downfall again first then I will play TCL again. I had just really "cracked" Downfall open and was a couple hours in, when I saw there was a remake just released-with better graphics, but more importantly voice acting and additional content. I was SO excited I purchased it without even reading a review or watching the trailer. I didn't need to-I knew it would be amazing, and I would have paid AAA+ pricing for the game without a second thought.\nThe remake was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! The game is fine polished now and graphics have improved tenfold while still maintaining that "vignette" feel to it. The voice acting is absolutely superb, which is tough because, just like when you read a book and then watch the movie remake if it, the actors have to look and sound the part that you imagined while reading it. Well-when a game is all subtitled, you envision the characters sounding a certain way, and if the sound is too far from that, it is a tough sell. Joe, Ivy, the "manageress" (think the devs coined that term-but I like it), Sophie, Harrison (he cracked me up-what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥)-and everyone else sounds just as they should.\nVoice Acting:\nIvy's accent was so very unique, and hard to put my finger on, almost like a Northern European that speaks English as their second language, and learned English from someone with an Irish accent. Whatever it may be, it couldn't be more perfect that someone like Ivy would have such a hard to "put your finger on" kind of accent-it's beautiful, mysterious and magnificant! Joe's accent which is best described as "I'm just a American dude, who is sarcastic, indifferent to the world and usually stoned"  is also very well fitting, and had me laughing at times. Harrison's voice hit the nail right on the head as a perfect d-bag, he reminded me of "Steff" in 'Pretty in Pink.' The "manageress" was phenomenal, the best in the game and whoever she is should seriously consider acting IRL. She nailed the affect in her voice giving it the feel of "I am an incredibly intelligent, insastiably horny snob, who always has an ulterior motive."\nThe Story:\nThis game falls into the horror genre, no doubt about that. I feel that is it very important to point out that, unlike so many predictable, slasher/gore/jumpscare fest games (many of which I truly enjoy playing BTW) this gem really does have a unique storyline, which does not follow any genre norms, or cliches. This game may mean very different things to different people, and thus it is difficult for me to try and "nutshell" the story, especially without spoilers. So, I will say that for me, this is a story of the human psyche and how the subconscious mind can take on a life of its own, and crush all hope of the conscious mind ever returning to "normalcy".  It is truly intriguing to me that the developers of this game are men, given the choice and more importantly the delivery of the story content. Not that I like to stereotype, but let's face it, we all have our biases and we do frame things with them everyday-ya just can't help it. I don't want to spoil the story here, but let's just say it touches on some very heavy subject matter, in a way that makes people truly see just how crushing, and sometimes even fatal, certain "mental illnesses/disorders" can be. I am not speaking from personal experience but I am a woman, and have a degree in the mental health field, which helps "set the stage."\nLast important bits to consider:\nI take my time when playing a game, but must not take enough time as I miss achievements! I have logged 15hrs of playtime, and finished ending "A." (in all fairness I would say 1-2hrs of that was idle time)\nThis game is extremely graphic-not just blood, guts and gore (which there is plenty of), but also in the presentation of it, and context it is delivered in. Not for children or the squeamish!\nTo truly enjoy this game properly, one must have a semi-quiet playing space, with volume turned up on your computer and dimmed lighting (doesn't have to be completely dark) is best to really enjoy it visually.\nThere are only two possible "jumpscare" moments in this game (it doesn't need them -trust me)\nI have missed more than half of the achievements and only reached one ending. I am not sure how many endings there are, and what they entail.\nDon't overthink your choices when reaching a branch in the storyline. There are too many of these moments in the game and it ruins the flow to overthink your dialogue choices. Just save often, and label the saves accordingly, then respond the way you would IRL or the way you want to make Joe respond.\nYou will most likely NOT need a guide or walkthrough to complete the game. It is not a puzzle game, but has some tricky spots. If you just interact with everything with a "pop up," and think about the tasks at hand you should be fine. If you are an achievement junkie, I highly recommend giving this an honest playthrough to fully absorb the story, in all its glory before reading any guides.

There are nods and allusions to both the original and TCL, but you honestly don’t have to be familiar with either one to play this game.  All the background information you need is given in the prologue; heck, you don’t even get this much in the original Downfall—it simply begins with a husband and wife seeking shelter from the storm in a hotel in the country.\n\nIf you’ve played The Cat Lady, you know what to expect in terms of graphics, sounds and gameplay.  The game’s color palette is almost exclusively black, white and red.  There’s voice acting! (More on that later.)  The interface is simple and easy-to-use with the names of objects you can interact with appearing on the screen whenever you walk passed them.  I’m not in the best position to judge the difficulty of the puzzles, having played the original Downfall in which many of the puzzles are the same, but I think they are easy, with clues that more-or-less tell you what to do whenever the solution isn’t obvious.  I’d say the difficulty level is lower than TCL.  Probably the designer wants players to enjoy the story that unfolds rather than getting stuck and spending a lot of time wandering around the hotel in search of what to do next.  I would have enjoyed some more challenging puzzles though; it’s a bit like one of those games where puzzles seem designed to keep you from getting ahead of yourself (e.g. you can’t get through this door until you find object X which is in the room where you meet Mary and that is because we want you to talk to Mary first).  In addition to the inventory based puzzles, you lead your character, Joe, through some conversations and places where he has to make choices.  These can affect the ending of the game.\nI’d give the voice acting an 8.5/10.  For the most part I really liked it (I especially liked the voice of Joe, the protagonist), but there are some places where the voice actors make an odd choice on which word to emphasize (this is a pet peeve of mine); also Joe often speaks lines softly where it seems natural that he would raise his voice.\n\nOK, I am a big fan of Downfall 2009 so I’m really aching to discuss my feelings about the differences between the remake and the original (And, hey, it’s included in the bundle so you can play both of them).  Some minor spoilers ahead…\n* Some background regarding Joe’s childhood that we don’t get until the very end of DF2009 is expanded and moved to the prologue here—I thought this announced right away that this was going to be a new take on the story.\n* I like how the Queen of Maggots is changed so her nature is more consistent with what we learn in TCL.\n* I prefer the twist ending in the remake to the one in the original.  It fits better tonally with the rest of the game and it is set up more, so it doesn’t seem to come out of nowhere.\n* Joe and Ivy’s relationship is developed more here and its changed some from DF2009.  I suppose it’s handled more maturely, it’s a more cohesive story and Ivy’s problems are more relatable.  That said, I miss the flashback with Lucifer in the bathroom.  I also miss the psychotic episode Ivy seems to be having when they first arrive at the hotel in DF2009 (screaming, seeing things).  In DF2009 it’s implied, at least at first, that this is a source of their relationship issues, but the problems they face in the remake are, I guess, more in keeping with the game’s theme.\n* I really miss Joe’s descent into madness and (at least potentially) evil in DF2009.  I remember loving the dark choices he needs to make throughout the game.  Here his interactions with Sophie are less intense.  In the original he says at one point that she deserves a more painful death(!), and I really miss the extra ingredient you have to add to the smoothie recipe.  Maybe this is just me, second time through DF2009 I decided to play Joe as a total a-hole.\n* In addition to thinking the developer might have a swung a bit too far in the opposite direction when it comes to the puzzles (eliminating some, giving the player big hints for others), I actually miss the chase scenes in DF2009.  They added a level of fear and exhilaration.\n\nSo that’s my 2 cents.  I would definitely recommend this game for its story, graphics and atmosphere and the multiple endings lend it replay value.  My one criticism is that, partly because of the lack of difficult puzzles, the game is on the short side.  It took me about 4 hours to complete it.","March 16","true","9.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Cat Lady had iffy voice acting but some characters (like Mitzhi) were good.  This, on the other hand, really, really drops the ball.  I think the only reason I got through the game was because I knew it was made by the folks who made the Cat Lady.  Unfortunately, it's just not as good (most likely due to it being a remake of an older game).\n\nI would skip this and get The Cat Lady.  The voice acting is really that bad.  I'm talking "Master of Unlocking" bad.  This is why developers need to treat voice actors like essential members of the development team, in my opinion.","February 26","false","4.3"," 10 of 38 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","10","38","2","0"

Downfall is a point-and-click adventure game, and fulfills all the functionality and tropes of a P&C, including obscure puzzles, heavy narrative focus, and dialogue trees that may offer narrative changes or alternate outcomes. I don't know for sure, one playthrough was bad enough.\n\nPros\n+Decent soundtrack\n+High-value trading cards, your initial 3 card drop could net you $1.50\n\n\nCons\n-Ugly, low-effort visuals, ridiculous walk cycle animations in a game based around walking from a to b\n-Unoriginal setting with no thought or creativity involved in its stages\n-8th-grade-school-play-tier voice acting, making skipping VA altogether preferable\n-Cringeworthy attempts at atmospheric horror that end up on-the-nose and laughable\n-Offensively bad representation of Anorexia Nervosa and other mental illness\n-Immature, heavy-handed shoe-horning of sexualtiy throughout\n-Lame, cliched story with a "twist" you can see coming just by looking at the trailer video\n\nIn summation, practically everything about this game is bad, and while it would be easy enough to chuckle as you worm your way through this as an $0.99 gag purchase, the fact that the developer is asking $13.99 for this dumpsterfire of a game is criminal.\n\nIF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY AN ADORING FAN OF THE FREEWARE VERSION OF THIS GAME, DO NOT BUY","March 31","false","2.2"," 5 of 31 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","5","31","0","0"

Using the already familiar art themes specific to The Cat Lady, the game bolsters the great idea of the original game into a true refined masterpiece. Unlike the original, the gameplay and puzzles are actually pretty intuitive here, with one or two small exceptions. Expect some gruesome and disturbing scenes and puzzles.\nUsing round, interesting or even mysterious characters, the game builds an emotional and often quite shocking story which will keep you gripped most of the time.\nApart from the obvious choices, some aren't that intuitive, so don't be surprised if you're left wandering what you did wrong when you get an ending different than expected.\n\nThe game is definitely recommended for everyone fascinated by horror or who simply enjoys this sort of art. I wouldn't, however, recommend it for someone simply looking for an emotional or engaging story.","April 14","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The remake made no sense and tried to hard to be the original instead of standing on it's own feet. Buy it on sale, not for full price like I did.\nI played the original right before the remake and actually prefer everything about the original. The original actually had me gagging at some points and not wanting to continue because I knew what was about to happen. This remake had me wanting to finish so I could get to the cameos at the end and then left me wanting.\nMy main issue is the plot. The remake skewed the story so much it didn't even fit in with what we were shown in the Cat Lady. It kept the same events and motivations from the first game but updated them to try to make them fit into the new game and they didn't. Characters were not fleshed out enough for their actions to make sense. Like the fact they kept the axe man from the original but didn't offer an explanation for him and he wasn't used to his full advantage in my opinion. And then he suddenly poofs and isn't seen for the rest of the game.\nSpoilers: In the original game, Sophie is trying to become fat for the man she loves and becomes morbidly obese. In this game, she's trying to become skinny but still has a recipe for a fattening smoothie?? And still ends up obese. Also her final incarnation has become demonic despite the remake never explaining why.  Ivy, in the original, doesn't eat so Joe feeds her to death and is revealed to be large at the end. When we see Joe and Ivy in the Cat Lady, Ivy is seen to be obese. In the remake Ivy is battling anorexia but when we are told about her true form at the end she is skin and bones, that Joe wasn't trying to save her, even though that's the whole point of the game. Also Ivy went from having mental problems in the first game to just being an unlikeable character with an attitude and a negative attitude about everyting.\nThe voice acting was not done well. There was not enough energy put into most of the characters. This made listening to them difficult and I wish there was an option to turn them off. I liked the cameos they included and when Agnes was around she was great to listen to. Everything was voiced, they never just had text on screen, which is something that I really appreciated.\nIn the original game you had to option to use the arrow keys to move or point and click your way around. This game used the same controls from the Cat Lady, arrow keys to do everything. It took a little getting used to but the inventory was easier to use in this style.\nThis was a well made game but for me there wasn't enough love put into it as there was in the original and I really wish they had either changed more or kept things more the same. Actions didn't make sense, the voice acting detracted from the experience, and movement was difficult to get used to. If you're looking for a new truly gruesome horror experience, I recommend the original. The remake is a different experience all it's own.","May 29","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mild spoilers.\n\nAs a recovering anorexic, I really enjoyed this game. Anorexia is a highly misunderstood subject. The fact that it's actuall a mental illness, and a serious one at that, is hardly ever even brought up. Most portrayals of anorexia depict it as skinny girls not eating, no more than than. This game delves into the true horrors of the illness. The obsessions, the paranoia, and just how difficult it is to pull away. The way it was explained by the memory of Sophie in the room of mirrors was incredibly accurate. This game was clearly made by someone who understands eating disorders, and I really appreciated that.\n\nOverall, gameplay was nice. It wasn't too long-- it only took me about an hour and a half to complete a single runthrough. The puzzles were fairly straightforward, but still provided a challenge. As in The Cat Lady, there's no real efficient way to move from place to place on the map (no quick transport, dashing, etc.), but the map isn't altogether too big. The plot was a bit nebulous at times. It was unclear what was meant to be real and what wasn't-- but maybe that was intentional, as a representation of Joe's mental illness. Confusing as is, the story was still very good, but all three endings were rather sad and dissatisfying, especially to fans of The Cat Lady. But horror games don't have to have happy endings, I suppose.\n\nTaking everything into account, I'd strongly recommend this game. Worth the money for sure.","May 17","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was definitely a game that kept my attention (which believe me, is hard) and constantly kept me craving more the further I got into it.  The story itself was a good 8/10, and without giving away any spoilers, threw me for several loops.\n\nOnly real negative things I can say about this game is the voice acting for a few of the characters were pretty bad.  At times I had just wished it didn't have any voice acting at all.  It's hard to say though what rating I'd give the voice acting, because some of the people were actually really good, it's just there were a few bad apples in there that really kind of ruined some of the moments for me.  Also, the beginning of the game at times was a bit hard to follow.\n\nAside from that though, this game was very good and was a good 5-6 hours of entertainment just from one playthrough.  I have a feeling I'll play through this game again in the future to check out what happens if I try out some of the different options, because playing through it once only got me a very small chunk of the achievements.  The puzzles as well were very easy to follow if you used the game's logic to solve them, which is something a lot of games have a hard time doing right, and just come off as confusing and end up losing my interest.\n\nTL;DR\n+Good story\n+Good puzzles\n+Great artwork/style\n+Good price for the amount of playability\n+Great video game for people who make Let's Plays\n-Bad voice acting at times\n-Sometimes the game was a bit pixelated and stretched out looking (I'm not sure if I had the settings wrong though)\n\nCheck out the video attached to watch my genuine reactions to this game. :D","May 16","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
