The puzzles themselves are pretty simple, but in addition to the old pixel hunt style, the game doesn't enable the hotspots for items or usable scenery until specific times.    Then, just to ramp up the frustration, there are timed puzzles, with the same constraints.   Suddenly scenery and items become arbitrarily active or inactive, with little time to experiment and search.   Feels like a serving of frustration with a side of screw you from the author.   Having a walkthrough helps, but it'll just ♥♥♥♥ you off when you see that your solution was correct -- you just weren't doing it the way the designer wanted you to, and at the right time that the designer wanted you to.","February 4, 2014","false","2.3"," 72 of 96 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","72","96","0","1"

This is a review based solely on my game experience.\n\nShort Verdict: A nice, short adventure game with a decent story going on. While it was a fun experience, it's too short and not that awesome to be worth its full price, which is low, by the way--US$ 4.36 (R$ 10,49) on Steam. If you have it already and you wanna play a quick adventure game, by all means, go for it. If you don't have it, I wouldn't spend much money on it. It's good, but nothing special. But don't play it for the story--do it only for the puzzles.\n\nPros:\nThe story is decent enough for the length of the game\nGood graphics if you consider when it was released (but nothing special, either)\nI enjoyed how the first-person view was implemented and how it makes you interact with the environment in this game\nThe timed scenes are really thrilling\nMost puzzles were nice and set to a decent level of difficulty\nThe world is fairly well-developed and so are the characters\nCons:\nWay too short--beat it in less than 4 hours\nThe story is a bit all over the place for those don't know anything about Nikopol\nSome puzzles are frustrating, especially the first timed ones, when you're still getting used to the game\nThere are some illogical things in the game, like a barred door being magically opened minutes later (close to the end of the game)\nSome plot holes and weird things, like why would a dictator hold elections? Why is everyone doing what they're doing? Nothing makes much sense\nBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$ 0.36 (R$ 0,89). For this price, yeah, I'd probably buy it as a single game.","November 2, 2014","true","3.6"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","1"

The art in the novel is what stands out the most and is a very dark, gritty,  and , industrial, steam-punk(architectural not the lame club scene), and is set in an alternate dystopian future where religions are now all powerful government parties and the ancient Egyptian gods themselves have returned to earth from space in a hovering pyramid spaceship. Despite being gods, with powers seemingly limited only by the imagination, they are still quite flawed sentient beings, who aregue and bicker and play board games to pass the time. They also require fossil fuels to power their spaceship and are stuck hovering over Paris. That is a basic run down of the story line for all you haters out there who "don't get the story line."\nSecondly, there is also a pretty popular Sci-Fi film based on the Nikopol story called "Immortal" that came out in 2004. I remember watching it on the Sci-Fi channel a couple times and you can currently watch the full movie on YouTube. I highly recommend it. The movie was directed by the author of the graphic novel Enki Bilal and is actually quite a ground breaking movie in its own right. It revolutionized the art of mixing computer animation with live action. In this dystopian future there is heavy polution, and many people have become sick and prosthetic artificial body parts are not only required for most people, but it is a huge fad like plastic surgery gone haywire, and has become all the rage. So you see these real actors with computer generated parts and they had to film every scene twice exactly the same way. There are also aliens, who are ironically enough, treated just like illegal aliens and have to go through customs and immigration lol.\nOK, so , on to the game. This was the first "point and click adventure" game I've ever really played, so it took some getting used to. The fact that this game is pretty closley based on the book and not the movie kept me pretty interested the whole time as it is stuff that happens to Nikopol inbetween the books. Yes the game is hard as hell and I did need a walkthrough on certain puzzles, but honestly, in a world where half the modern games are designed so  that a baboon could beat it on hard, it was a welcomed challenge. If you are used to point and click than you know what to expect. This game actually got me into more point and click adventure games such as Myst and a few others. If you are a fan of the movie Immortal(ad vitam) or the Nikopol Trilogy books than this game will blow your shorts off. If not and you kinda liked the crazy dark sci fi storyline, I highly recommend you check out all three.","July 25, 2014","true","7.4"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/11370/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Well, Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals is a short adventure game based on The Carnival of Immortals - or La Foire aux immortels, the first book of Enki Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy, a series of graphics novels that illustrates 2023 Paris as an incredibly dark political dystopia with science fiction elements. Aside Enki Bilal's genius in depicting the surreal and the grotesque in Nikopol series, this game is a heavily watered down version of the first book, from Nikopol Jr.'s perspective.\n\nIt's year 2023. After two nuclear wars, countless political confrontations and casual genetic mutations, the world has become disease-ridden and post-apocalyptic. We take the silent, oblivious artist Nikopol Jr.'s perspective as puppeteered elections for the nation of Paris approaches. He is a silent romantic in a degenerate era. With the appearance of an odd spaceship in the form of an Egyptian pyramid on Paris astroport, Alcide Nikopol's life is about to change drastically.\n\nBefore continuing with my review, I have to warn you: if you are to only play this game, without reading comics first, I suspect that you would be capable of understanding anything. As a stand-alone game, story presentation is mismatched and rushed. It is more than likely to complete the whole game without understanding anything about the affairs going around. The setting is not well-presented enough to capture the grotesque genius of the series and a great amount of characters, events, explanations are completely skipped in this bland interpretation. So if you've found the concept to your liking and got curious, drop the game and get yourself Nikopol Trilogy to enjoy an A+ quality creepy dystopia.\n\nOkay, now we've established the quality difference between graphic novels and the game, I'll focus on the game. Graphics might be considered beautiful in their own displays, and character animations are quite elegant. I especially liked the character designs for Egyptian characters - Horus and Anubis. Voice acting isn't marvelous, and the subtitles being nonexistent doesn't stand in the favor of the game either though.\n\nWell, when we talk about the gameplay, Nikopol has its list of downsides. Without the usage of a walkthrough, it is possible to miss an item and keep playing only to find that you cannot progress anymore due to the item not being available for you to grab anymore. On that department, I suggest saving a lot - which is another issue, with only 10 save slots given. Also, you are capable of dying in a handful of imaginative ways, considering that you are treated as a terrorist by the government from the start of your game. In that sense, no, this is not your casual point and click adventure. Puzzles are usually interesting and imaginative, and they demand prior attention to the storyline, so you have to keep certain facts at mind before trying to handle a puzzle. With the slightest mistake, you are prone to alarming security and getting shot down. Luckily, game restores your position before being shut down every time.\n\nAs an adventure game, Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals isn't anything unique or even interesting, with its grander equivalents around. As an Enki Bilal interpretation, it could present you a brief smile if you are already familiar with his work. If not, go fetch the comic book. Only after reading the original work, if you could say that you are still curious, yeah, go ahead. Otherwise, the game won't mean anything to you.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 11, 2015","false","3.7"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","2"

With action i mean that someone might be following you etc. and you need to do bunch of puzzles or move around really quickly so they won't catch you.

Finding the items needed for solving puzzles can get a bit frustrating, you'll have to pixel hunt to a certain extent, and it's frustrating not knowing what could be missing to progress, and pixel hunt all previous rooms/views to find the missing object.\n\nSome of the puzzles are nice especially the early/mid game "coding" with symbols/items.\n\nThe game world/setting started out promising in a dystopian future Paris, but it wasn't explained as much as I would have liked, and fell short. Same thing goes for the plot. It would probably make more sense if you've read the graphic novel, which I haven't, so for me the story wasn't that strong, and left me with a feeling of playing through an unfinished game.\n\nFor me, the weak story and gameplay outweighed the few positives of this game. It's still enjoyable to a certain degree, but not a game I would recommend anyone to buy, even at a sale.","December 27, 2014","false","5.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

It was over before I could even wrap my head around what was going on, which was primarily the result of its bad story telling. It could have actually been something quite interesting, but it fails to deliver the necessary background and plot to offer it a fighting chance.\n\nMost of the puzzles are very simple. Some sequences must be completed within a certain amount of time so it's not a traditional casual adventure. Frequent deaths were annoying, but the well placed automatic save points didn't kill the overall enjoyment.\n\nThe gameplay is fundamentally sound. Graphics are decent although it does only support letterbox aspect ratios so widescreen monitors end up displaying black borders on the sides. Overall, Nikopol is a mediocre adventure game, one I'd recommend passing up.","May 28, 2012","false","7.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

Again, only play if you like the theme or Adventure games.\n\nThe premise of this game is quite neat.  A dystopian Paris mixed with Blade Runner, Ancient Egypt, weird meta religions, totalitarism, and some old school 70s style flying vehicles.  Theme-wise this is my kind of game.  The story is based on the French graphic novel "La Foire aux immortels" [1980], which I have not read.\n\nAt heart, it is a traditional FPS rails adventure game.  There is not a ton of pixel hunting (but there are couple hidden ones that are beyond aggravating).  Most of the puzzles are straightforward and not too difficult.  I would have loved to explore the areas in full 3D rather than being stuck to rails.  This was a failing ingredient that the studio White Birds (founded by Benoît Sokal) seemed to stick with for some reason.  There was plenty of 3D modeling in the game and it wasn't half bad but doing a rails adventure game in 2008 is such a bad idea and limits the potential of the title.\n\nThe other negative was the voice acting.  The main character was fine but every single other voice was horrendous....detracted very much from the unique/weird story and presentation.  This was probably in part to the translation and inability of the studio to hire good English actors.\n\nAlso, the game is way too short for a story that is so strange...it at least needs to be episodic.\n\nWhite Birds became defunct in 2011.  I think if they had adapted with the community, and market by leveraging existing 3D engines/tools and changed their delivery platform (e.g. episodes or parts) I think this could have been really awesome.

Considering its point-and-click nature, I'd generally expect more out of an adventure game, an interesting story at the very least. Yet the most interesting parts of Nikopol are, a) the cinematography used in the cutscenes, and, b) the menu screen, one of the more unique implementations I've seen in recent memory.\n\nFew of the puzzles present in Nikopol are some of the most illogical I have come across, often requiring you to complete a sequence in a very specific way or you will either be forced to repeat the sequence from the beginning, or you will die.\n\nYes, you can die in this game but there are no consequences, you will simply be placed back where you were before you made your mistake, with the protagonist remarking on the methods of their death at the continue screen, providing little clues. I died no less than five times within the first 30 minutes of play. I do not enjoy being thrust into an action sequence when I'm searching for the smallest, insignificant of clues to progress forward.\n\nEven though I'm fairly adept at puzzle games I did require a fair amount of assistance to complete certain "logic" puzzles. It really ruined the immersion.\n\nThere's a myriad of typos and grammatical errors throughout the subtitles and in-game flyers. The voice acting was uninspiring and lacking any semblance of enthusiasm, although the original French version of the game may be more thrilling. The story was intriguing but the abrupt ending left me longing for more, I really wanted to know more about this alternate reality in which humanity exists oppressed in a Blade Runner-esque world.\n\nActually, the ending felt extremely abrupt, there were many questions left unanswered by an unsatisfying and cheap conclusion. Apparently this game is based on a French film with a similar premise, I suppose I'll have to search for it to understand whatever little subtext was offered in Nikopol.","December 30, 2012","false","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

This game is a first person point and click adventure done in the same style as Amerzone. Set in Paris of 2023 A.D. where the city is under marshal law and is being "watched" by a mysterious pyramid that floats above the sky. The length of the game isn't as long as the Syberia games, but you do get enjoyment out of the plot and the presence of the Egpytian gods. If you like the movies Brazil, Blade Runner, 1984, or Fifth Element, then this game is worth your time.","March 26, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However it brings to life quite interesting and gritty sci-fi world. Besides classic puzzles and pixel hunting adventure games are known for the game utilises timed sequences, where you need to think and act swiftly or face consequences (as to be killed or captured which ends the game). It features several cutscenes done in a style close to comic book storytelling - with bordered images, different angles of view and focuses. Music is quite good, voiceacting not as much and the game can be finished in like four hours, making it really a narrative quickie but still... it's nice. I would recommend it for fans or as an experiment for those who are not familiar with the source material but are curious enough and really likes adventures (grab it when discounted). Maybe you will get interested in the movie or books afterwards.","April 14, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world and plot itself are very memorable, filled with interesting characters and immersive details.\n\nWhile being an adventure game, it is by no means a relaxing point & click experience. The player is constantly made aware of an imminent danger, be it an enemy lurking behind a corner, time running short or sheer ignorance of what is behind closed doors.

The plot and storyline are intriguing and engaging, set in a dystopian science fiction far future. Even the voice acting is okay. Sadly, those are the only positive aspects of Nikopol. In this point and click adventure game, you should expect terrible pixel hunting, as well as puzzles that are quite unintuitive and will certainly require hints or walkthroughs to make any progress. Worst of all, is that if you do not pick up certain items in various rooms in order, or perform certain actions in a specific order, you will need to reload a saved game and do many portions of the game over. The focus on tiny details and prearranged orderly functions make for an irrational, boring, and forcefully repetitive experience that was not even present during the late 80s and early 90s of the genre's era. In order for you to understand which action takes precedence over others requires a walkthrough. It is a must. There is no other way to approach this game whatsoever. For the developers to think that this game design decision was appropriate is an absolute disaster, and should serve as an example for others to never follow. In addition, there are several events that are timed, and require the player to perform some actions quickly, and if they do not possess certain items that were left behind in other rooms, there is simply nothing that could be done except for reloading and starting over. The save system is another serious stumbling block. You are not allowed to quick save. Instead, "saving" only saves your last checkpoint. This means that because of how flawed the overall design is, if you miss an item in a previous room, and find yourself farther in an area without it, there is nothing you could do except restart from the last checkpoint. You cannot walk back and correct the problem. You must restart and do it all over again. Needless to say, the only way you will know that you are stuck besides not being able to execute any useful actions for a prolonged period of time, is a walkthrough. There are no other options. The game fails horribly at providing hints, or doing anything remotely resembling intuitive reasoning. It is a truly broken point and click adventure game that has no place in the genre, or in the professional field of game design.

Some puzzles lack any hint on how to complete them, and your left randomly trying things untill you eventually get the right answer.\n\nThe main gripe however, must be directed at the story. If you have read the orignal Nikopol graphic novel, or have seen the movie based on it, then youll probably be ok here. If you havnt however, then you will be lost pretty fast in whats going on.

The graphics are very nice and the controls are smooth. When you move into different rooms, you glide right in, unlike other point and click games, this one doesn't feel choppy at all. The main characters voice is sexy, which makes this game a lot easier to stand when you are getting frusterated (For females that is lol). I got killed by an oversized Resident Evil slug, caterpillar, mammoth horse thingy. Was great fun.","December 8, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is set in the same world seen in the movie. The story in "Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals" takes place in a future version of Paris, both filthy and beautiful at the same time. The atmosphere is a good enough reason to try it out. You will face lots of different puzzles throughout, and some of them are quite hard to solve. The story is fairly easy to follow, but there are a lot of weird things going on in this world (weird god figures and monsters included) that might confuse your mind. It might help to watch the movie first. I enjoyed playing through it. I only wish it had lasted a bit longer. I also experienced some performance issues some places, such as in the main menu and some of the video sequence, for some reason.","September 6, 2011","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
