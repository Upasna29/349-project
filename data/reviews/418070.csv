"http://steamcommunity.com/id/220racer/recommended/418070/","220racer","Master Debater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/220racer/","37 products in account","Over the years I’ve played a dozen iterations of screenscrolling games and their predecessors. I’ve played twenty odd games from Mario Brothers to Super Smash Brothers. I've gotten quite good at them, too. I’ve won the World Cup, the Champions League, the Premiership, the Championship, League One, Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga, and most importantly, the Romanian Second Division. By this point in the last game I played, I thought I was done. An assortment of minor annoyances and disappointments with Luigi's Mansion left me too frustrated to continue.\n\nIt didn’t last. This year's edition, while flawed, has fixed just enough of my quibbles to draw me back in. And as ever, Turbo Pug remains a fairytale generator. It’s perfectly possible to arrive at a struggling landscape with a grand history, implement innovative new tactics, and take your pug back to the top. It's just easy enough that you can do it, but just hard enough that you’re never quite certain you can. It’s balanced on a beautiful knife edge, and its greatest achievement is selling you the fantasy of sitting in the pug owner's chair.\nThe pugs on display this year are distinctly modern too, with a degree of fluidity and position swapping that feels authentic to today’s dog world. The fact that striker-less tactics (something real world pug owners have been dabbling with for years) have now finally found their way into the game’s preset formations shows a willingness to keep up with the times. If Luigi's Mansion felt oddly retro, Turbo Pug is cutting-edge.\n\nThat’s not to say that all my problems with Turbo Pug have gone away. I still think the game has a serious problem with bloat. People play Turbo Pug for a lot of reasons, and I’ve been aggressively reminded in the past that those who desire a "realistic" simulation actively enjoy the incredibly slow scouting and endless questions from the media. It’s not a position I can agree with, though. I find these time-sinks an irritating barrier to playing the runs, and as a result, Turbo Pug and I have been drifting apart for a while.\n\nThankfully, three years ago its creators at Space Cat Studios acknowledged this split in the fanbase by introducing Classic Mode, which has now been confusingly rebranded to Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, even though it plays just fine with a mouse and keyboard. It offers a stripped-down, fluid approach to play. It was a godsend, offering a version of the game that focused on what I felt was important.\n\nThe user interface, which in older iterations looked little better than colored spreadsheets, has become slick and intuitive.\nTurbo Pug typically comes with an army of borderline-inconsequential tweaks that together deliver a noticeable difference overall but individually are difficult to rave about. There are, however, several new features here that had a meaningful impact. Let's start with the new multi-pug feature, which is a perfect example of the series’ penchant for incremental improvement working well. For years now I’ve been mildly irritated by the fact that I can only have one pug, regardless of whether I wanted to have more than one pug. Now, with the click of a couple buttons, this problem is solved, and I can have many pugs to frolic the fields with.\n\nThen there’s Create a Pug mode. As far back as I can remember, Turbo Pug fans have used game editors to add their unique pugs to the game. There’s a whole culture of forums full of different pug designs like these. Now Space Cat Studios has acknowledged this strange social aspect of the game, and offers players the chance to create a pug in a far more accessible way.\n\nI’m also strangely entranced by the option to create an on pitch avatar for your pug, letting him yell and scream at his pug friends from the sidelines. They all look absolutely terrible, but there’s something strangely endearing about them too. For the record, yes, you can select either male or female pugs.\nYet at the same time, I have to acknowledge that the "full" mode of Turbo Pug is still very much not for me. Many of this year’s new features involve expanded media interactions, a part of the game that hasn’t worked well for a long time. I still get dog lovers interrupting me to voice their concerns that we don’t have enough dog treats, despite the fact that I’m not planning on feeding my pugs. I’m told I can dismiss their concerns assertively, cautiously, calmly, or passionately; unfortunately, I’m not really sure what the difference is.\n\nInterestingly, Space Cat Studios has said it plans to sell a standalone version of Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, with a release date of "sometime before Christmas." If you’re the same kind of Turbo Pug player as me, you may be better off waiting for that. For now, you can find Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition here in Steam. Many of the new features--the Pug Creator, Create a Dog Treat and a lightly tweaked tactics UI--are available in Simple Edition while almost everything I dislike has been cut. This, coupled with the fact that the match engine feels just a little bit more German Shepherd than Jack Russel this year, was enough to draw me back in.\n\nShoutouts: Sean, mom, papa john","November 11, 2015","true","9.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","24","27","19","2"

Being myself, a pug loving weeb, I clicked as fast as I could on the colorful fenomena of a game. No, I didnt even bother watching the trailer because who does that these days, right?\n\nAfter seeing the unbearable price, I called my economical manager to sort things out. We fought for hours and hours on end until I finally managed to get the money I needed. It had taken many loans but as said love for pugs blocked my self consciousness, no questions were ever made from my side. I downloaded the game in a hurry and then played it with joy, stearing into the eyes of the helpless little pug. The pug was life, the pug was love. No one had ever given me such love and compassion as the pug did, no one, ever. Even though the pug showed love, it also brought me evil. I started hearing the pugs little bark on random equations through out my day, and after getting several mental breakdowns on my work place, the beloved friend and boss of mine had had enough.\n\nMy love for pugs had let me down, leaving me starving on a urine stained street corner in the middle of NYC. My debts were skyhigh as my of my recent pug related loans, my economical manager had also left me, in shame that is. Now I stand here on weak legs with nothing but regrets, writing this review from a strangers macbook at a local 7eleven in hopes of no one falling in the same narrow path as I once did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/418070/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2876 products in account","I missed the sale on this, so when I became aware of the game, I purchased it. Judging by the tags which included Indie, 2D, Casual, and Difficult, I thought it was a platformer. It certainly looked that way to me at first glance, but I was wrong. This is actually an endless runner game with platforming elements, including obstacles.\n\nRight off the bat, I had a little trouble with the game, because the full-screen option didn't work for me. When at full screen, I saw that the top half of the screen was black, and the bottom half was cut off after the play game option. I had no recourse but to play in windowed mode which created or exacerbated graphical issues.\n\nThe next hurdle I came up against was the lack of controller support. To be fair, the game is not advertised as having full or even partial controller support, but it's been my experience that a lot of games have inherent controller support, or partial support, even when that functionality is not disclosed or advertised. Now, armed with the knowledge that this was an endless runner without controller support, I launched JoyToKey, which afforded me partial controller functionality. I still had to use the mouse to click play, and there was no reliable way to exit the game except for using alt+tab to simply close the open window, but at least I could finally play the game.\n\nGraphically, I had difficulty seeing a lot of the obstacles. The day/night cycles and weather element add depth to the game but made visual distinction even more difficult. As the screen got darker, or more muddled, I could reliably see less and less on this tiny windowed screen. This is not something you want to experience in a game like this where the screen is side-scrolling quickly, and you have little reaction time.\n\nIn regard to game mechanics, there's some solid work here. Once I began to utilize JoyToKey to enable partial controller support, I could tell that the controls were consistent and responsive. If a little more care was put into graphical considerations, I wouldn't have any difficulty playing this game, and it would still be a challenge.\n\nThere's no story or purpose to this game, other than challenging yourself to get a little further than you did before, so if that's what you're after, it's best to look elsewhere. There are also no achievements. This is simply a time-killer, a casual game that can be played in short spurts. Not every game has to be a "thinker," so I'm perfectly okay with that, and that fact did not diminish my rating.\n\nIn regard to level design, there wasn't anything that thrilled or impressed me, but there wasn't anything that I necessarily hated, either. There's definitely some repetition, and memory certainly plays as much if not more of a factor than skill when it comes to being successful at playing this game. While it's not something I'm likely to revisit, I can certainly appreciate it for what it is.\n\nOverall, I can recommend the game to those looking for a casual game that can be played for short periods of time and without becoming completely consuming or engrossing. I can also recommend it to folks looking for an endless runner and those who like platformers but would be willing to try an endless runner that includes platforming elements.\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","February 27","true","0.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

While offering nothing particularly novel, Turbo Pug remains fun, addictive, and well-designed for what it is. There are six characters to unlock, most of whom have the same abilities and will spend their days running through a randomly repeating set of the same old obstacles. Yes, Turbo Pug is way short on content, but a cute aesthetic and low price tag go a long way toward mitigating this shortcoming.","November 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a pretty standard runner. But this one has pugs! Should you buy a game just because you control a pug? I think the answer is yes.\n\nThere are weather changes as you play. Poor weather makes it harder to spot obstacles and getting hit by lighting will cause your pug to freeze for a second (even in the air). There are characters with different abilities (not many). I prefer to play as a pug because the cats sound so sad when they die and to me the pug's dying bark sounds of determination to get back out there and try again, which is also what I want to do.\n\nThe graphics and music are very nice. There's no controller support but the game only uses one button. There's not a lot of depth to the game but like any runner you just want to keep trying to beat your high score. The leaderboard unfortunately only shows the first ten names so you can't see what place you're in, and you can't view just your friends scores either which would be nice.\n\nOverall I've found Turbo Pug to be a satisfactorily puggy game and I give it 10 tummy rubs.","November 10, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought this game because it was on sale.  I didn't hate it, I just can't recommend it.  The only huge problem is that Turbo Pug doesn't support controls, which would be okay, but there seems to be some latency with the left click which is the only button that you use to interface with the game.  Turbo Pug isn't broken by any means, it's just not a very dynamic game.

We don't really come back to them because they're fun, or have any redeeming qualities. They're just there. We don't pay for them, either. Therefore I must assume I got this in some type of bundle or as a joke gift. Sitting in front of a laptop playing this just feels like the biggest waste of my gaming time possible. Semi random levels fly by with some weather effects as obstacles fly at you. You make the jump, or you don't. You eventually die and start again. Get a little farther this time. There's no end, there's no variety, there's no point. The play time is from idling to get cards, by the way.

It. Will. Change. Your. Life.... I came into this game thinking it would be all about a pug doing jumps and stuff, but I was completely wrong. The game starts off as you being born in a small town and through out the game you slowly gain fame. The main purpose of this game is to become a rock star. This game also shows the dark side of being a dog. In one part you must kill your owner and then live inside of his cospe because it is too cold outside. You must also watch your parents die and your owner's mom get her head eaten by spiders. Very scary game but also very amazing. Not only is the story amazing but the graphics are next next next gen. It looks like Crysis 3, with the engine of Fallout 2, and the controlls of Trials HD. I highly recommend this game.

It. Will. Change. Your. Life.... I came into this game thinking it would be all about a pug doing jumps and stuff, but I was completely wrong. The game starts off as you being born in a small town and through out the game you slowly gain fame. The main purpose of this game is to become a rock star. This game also shows the dark side of being a dog. In one part you must kill your owner and then live inside of his cospe because it is too cold outside. You must also watch your parents die and your owner's mom get her head eaten by spiders. Very scary game but also very amazing. Not only is the story amazing but the graphics are next next next gen. It looks like Crysis 3, with the engine of Fallout 2, and the controlls of Trials HD. I highly recommend this game. My rating for this game is 10/10 would buy again.","November 12, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Why is it that they die when they should be just paddling on the water?\nWhat makes them so suicidal? They willingly jump head first into spikes, lava, dead bodies, floating boxes you name it yet they just keep on chugging despite the odds.\nWhat makes the pugs so determined that they don't stop to look in the treasure chests? Who would keep running after just risking thier lives when they could instead just pick up some money on the way?\n\n\nQuestions aside here's some things that help you figure out if you should get the game.\n\nDo you have no money? Then buy this game cuz it costs less money than I'm worth so everyone can afford this.\nThe jack-o-lantern pug is my favorite because he's always lit.\n\nThere's literally so many pugs. So many pugs.\n\nThe music is top notch. Theres the song that has the guitar that changes around 2000 ish and suddenly gets hype as ♥♥♥♥. Then theres the other song that after listening to it a bunch you start humming that at school while sacrificing your friends to the pug gods.\nIt's also a great anti-depressant because you can kill pugs and listen to happy music at the same time. Plus no one has the balls to kill themselves after committing a holocaust worth of pug killings so it solves basically all the problems of society.\n10/10 pugs now rule my life","April 6","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a great price. As they say good things come in small packages, tottaly worth buying.  Few minor flaws but doesnt really inflict with the gameplay. You even have different types of weather which can influence your gameplay, when you get struck by lighting you can't control your character for a sec, which is a nice little future. Adds a little bit of difficulty to the game. Not that is already hard enough. But it defenitly is pleasantly frustrating.\n\nMenu can't be controlled with keys only with the mouse, which interferes with the flow of the game. I want to press space or enter just maintain the flow and quickly start a new game.\n\nCharacter may be a little to small, hard to play with sometimes.

They have added many different kinds of pugs which is awesome in the game, it's hard to see when it gets dark and when it gets stormy, the lighting will stun you for a few seconds which may mess up your run. The best part is when the pug pops, the music is very nice and I love how the pug sticks his tongue out.

This game is if not the best game on the steam store.  It tells one of the best stories in gaming that not everyone can pick up on in the first playthrough.  It tells the story of a pug running away from his past.  He has the face the trials of life, both physically and metiphorically.  On his long journey, he faces everything from his own imagination's problems, like desire (thus shown by currency) or his own physical fears, like heat and water.  He has to travel through a near future's war-based economy and landscape.  This can be shown the traps set up and the currency without a value.  Weather itself even poses a problem for him.  When defeated, the end can be shown in two different prespectives. The first is an infinite time loop.  He could very well be trapped in his own personal inferno that he can't cope with.  He has to keep traveling until he can conquer his inner fears or reach happiness.  Either that or whenever one pug is defeated, another follows his leaders path, giving the game a good sense of leadership and belonging.  The gameplay alone is a reason to buy the game.  It is simple yet innovative.  Unlike other games today, like Battlefront and Fallout, it brings something new.  Save your 60 dollars and buy this work of art.

It's very basic. There's very little depth to it. Just your basic endless runner, without any powerups and with a relatively small selection of randomized obstacles.\n\nIt does have fairly nice pixelated graphics, although sometimes it's difficult to see certain obstacles when it's raining. The music is fantastic too, although there's only two songs.\n\nThe only variation while playing is the different pugs (and cats) that you can choose from, which do alter the gameplay slightly, but not enough to give the game actual depth.\n\nOne last little note, there's lightning strikes that you can't avoid that, while not immediately killing you, stun your pug for a moment and usually cause it to fall into spikes or run into a wall. Which will inevitably cause the best players to eventually die not from a lack of skill, but unavoidable crap.","November 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

It isn't a bad thing, although it is just another lousy game with no story or real idea. The soundtrack is long enough for you to have the highest score, and still be listening. Although, once you die, the music starts all over again. Which gets very annoying, very quickly. For a cheap game less than $1 I didn't expect a good game, and to be honest, this isn't a good game. The only reason this is getting a yes is because of its price. Although, this is a very mind boggling game and is very difficult. I had alot of fun for 1 hour playing this game, and I think the game says its price.\n++PROS++\n- Good soundtrack, just let down by the repeation of the sound every time I died\n- 6 Players to choose from, both a pug and cat, and different varies of them.\n- Leaderboard\n- Consists of one key, a youngster could play it\n--CONS--\n- The repeation of a soundtrack\n- The pug points cannot be used to buy anything, and are only used on the leaderboard\n- The leaderboard only has one statistic to it\n- Dat font doe\n-----------\n-- 6 / 10 --\n-----------","November 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to jump your way over gaps, water, lava, and traps to make it as far as you can until you die. The music is nice and I love all the different types of animals (cape pug is my favorite). The only real problem that I have noticed is that during weather changes and the change from night to day normally drops the FPS to about 35 FPS for a second or two. Not that big of a deal but it can be annoying when it causes you to mess up and die. Also I would suggest that the developers add some more content to the game like maybe a shop where you can spend your pug points on new characters or boosts or something like that.\n9/10","December 2, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What more reason do you need to buy this game?\n\nOh, you need more? Well, for one it only costs a maximum of one total euro.\n\nIt is basically the same game as, say, Robot Unicorn Attack, but then instead of the Blind Guardian song you've got a pug. It's also less expensive than Robot Unicorn Attack, if I remember correctly. And it seems to have slightly more diversity, too. The landscape changes as you go on, together with the weather and the background music.\n\nYou can unlock different pugs/cats/a Penguin(?) and each has its own specialty which might help you get farther into the level (which gets more difficult as you progress), adding a bit more to the variety of the game.\n\nAlthough you might get bored of it pretty quickly, it's cute and cheap and if you've got a single euro to spare, this is worth it. But then again, I bought it because it has the word "pug" in it. It is the perfect game to play when you're supposed to be paying attention in class or at work, though.\n\n[Actual pug snorting sounds not included]","January 15","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It isn't a bad thing, although it is just another lousy game with no story or real idea. The soundtrack is long enough for you to have the highest score, and still be listening. Although, once you die, the music starts all over again. Which gets very annoying, very quickly. For a cheap game less than $1 I didn't expect a good game, and to be honest, this isn't a good game. The only reason this is getting a yes is because of its price. Although, this is a very mind boggling game and is very difficult. I had alot of fun for 1 hour playing this game, and I think the game says its price.\n++PROS++\n- Good soundtrack, just let down by the repeation of the sound every time I died\n- 6 Players to choose from, both a pug and cat, and different varies of them.\n- Leaderboard\n- Consists of one key, a youngster could play it\n--CONS--\n- The repeation of a soundtrack\n- The pug points cannot be used to buy anything, and are only used on the leaderboard\n- The leaderboard only has one statistic to it\n- Dat font doe\n-----------\n-- 6 / 10 --\n-----------","November 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What more reason do you need to buy this game?\n\nOh, you need more? Well, for one it only costs a maximum of one total euro.\n\nIt is basically the same game as, say, Robot Unicorn Attack, but then instead of the Blind Guardian song you've got a pug. It's also less expensive than Robot Unicorn Attack, if I remember correctly. And it seems to have slightly more diversity, too. The landscape changes as you go on, together with the weather and the background music.\n\nYou can unlock different pugs/cats/a Penguin(?) and each has its own specialty which might help you get farther into the level (which gets more difficult as you progress), adding a bit more to the variety of the game.\n\nAlthough you might get bored of it pretty quickly, it's cute and cheap and if you've got a single euro to spare, this is worth it.

You keep running forward until you fall into a pit or hit an object. This is a game that lives and dies by how addictive you are to clicking your mouse and its cheap one dollar price tag. After about five minutes in, I felt like I had seen everything. At fifteen minutes I had unlocked the twelve playable characters. Its worth a dollar, but if you're looking for something deeper than a mobile game on your computer, then look elsewhere.\n\nThe game does have a few things going for it: graphics and charm. The charm of a goofy little pug and unlockable chocolate pugs, rainbow pugs, cats, space cats and Santa hats adds a lot to a baron and starved game. The graphics have a great style and it fits that retro style. To make things more interesting, the day and night will cycle, and you'll see rain or snow happen. Its all random so it feels like the single level is dynamic and changing.\n\nThis single level throws patterns at you. One pattern has ramps and two boxes, another has two pits, there's one with a large pit and two floating boxes. Later patterns start having giant spikes and saw blades. The saw blades are dark, so seeing them at night becomes an issue. I will guess there are a mere ten or so patterns.\n\nThe control is simple; mouse click or use the space bar to jump. The space bar is less strain on your wrist, but then if you fail, you still need to use the mouse anyway to click play again. It would just be nice to have a keyboard work the menu, but why do that when you can throw a game out the door and make money? There is no support for controllers, which is never an issue, but with a game as sparse as this, its tough to think of anything to say to fluff out a review.\n\nEvery frame that you stay alive, you get a point. Then there are pug pellets for lack of a better term where then you get either fifty or one hundred points. Oh my! Puggles getting pellets getting points. Yes you is. Who's a good pug wagging his tongue while he runs? You is!\n\nWith each failure, you see your points, your high score and your overall accumulation of points. I assume the overall points unlock pugs, because the game never told me I had unlocked anything. To the game's credit, each of the playable animals does feel just a bit different. It seems like the lunar kitty has less gravity and other animals seem to run faster. Without a description of how they're different, you just need to play. I prefer the default two pugs that the game comes with to any that get unlocked.\n\nTo keep you in the game there's a leader board, but that's it. The game could have had more leader board integration such as challenge your friends or even online multiplayer where you compete on the same course. When someone loses you keep going and they drop out.\n\nAs I ran, I noticed a few glitches here and there. Nothing game breaking, but sometimes the hill terrain has a line. I've also noticed seems between the background where the background loops.\n\nTurbo Pug is a game that kept me occupied for a good ten minutes. There are better games out there that do the same thing, but Turbo Pug just looks better and has a better flavor than other forever runners. Its too simple to be played on anything but a phone when you're waiting for something else, but hey its still fun.","January 23","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But still... I feel that I at least owe as much to the community.\n\nThis game has:\n- Nice graphics, if obviously taken from a generic game graphics pack somewhere (and what's with the super-unfitting stuff like the bloody spikes and sawblades?);\n- Original and very cute character sprites;\n- Very pleasant music, if only two songs that very abruptly shift back and forth when you die;\n- Extremely simple but by no means horrible gameplay;\n- A cute pug.\n\nThis game does not have:\n- Any, and I mean even the tiniest, most miniscule inkling of depth, or reason to play whatsoever beyond the point of taking 5 seconds to see how cute your character's sprite and its run animation is.  There are no upgrades, no unlocks (except a rabbit avatar apparetly??), no obvious goal, no real options, no modes, no anything.  You, as a pug, automatically run and manually jump past basic obstacles made with generic, if decently used, graphical assets and collect pug head icons that add to a meaningless score.  that is it.  that is literally all there is to it.\n\nIt's cute, but not worth buying, not even for 49 cents.  There are many far better games in this style that you can play completely free in your browser all over the internet.  Could've been neat for a free app to show the dev's chops for making something cute and simple maybe, at most, but selling it for any price was silly.  Might have been worth it if it came with the two-song soundtrack though, I really liked those songs.\n\nWelp, I just spent nearly twice as long writing this review as I did playing the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053667401/recommended/418070/","76561198053667401","Homunculus","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053667401/","114 products in account","I've never seen as many baseless and inane negative reviews for a genuinely good game as I have for Turbo Pug. While I firmly believe that everyone's entitled to their opinion, I can't accept the amount of distorted, hyperbolic nonsense that’s being perpetrated about this game and I find it hard to tolerate the people who have the gall to berate the game solely because of its shortcomings.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTurbo Pug is a damned good game. However, it definitely has its issues. Space Cat Studios tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful.\n\nIt's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Pugs (who are supposed to be the "good guys" of this installment), and can become repetitive.\n\nMy most prominent grievance with Turbo Pug is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the biscuit system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Turbo Pug: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Space cat Studios titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three.\n\nThe only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra kibble. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Bad Rats except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Turbo Pug is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Space Cat Studio games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the biscuit system. Now that biscuit is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.\n\nThe bottom line is that Space Cat Studios sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Space Cat Studios games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Space Cat Studios carried it out in the wrong way.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAll the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Turbo Pug and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Space Cat Studios made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Turbo Pug can bring.\n\nEven though Turbo Pug falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Space Cat Studios game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been.\n\nPeople were quick to judge the Pugworld map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Space Cat Studios has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.\n\nI was also worried that granting access to Jowls and a Bone within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn’t. The jowls rely on uncommon fusion slobber goobs for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while weilding the jowls, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the Bad or Rat relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nGta V was a simplification of the Bad Rats formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Turbo Pug is a simplification of the Call of Duty:Ghosts formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of being a PC gamer. Space Cat Studios has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.\n\nTruthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Turbo Pug world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Turbo Pug for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.\n\nI highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won’t be disappointed.","November 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I've probably played it more than him in the meantime.\nTurbo Pug is an addictive, endless generated game with a catchy soundtrack.\n\nHower for me it seems that there are some things missing also :\n- onecan only jump. Some more ability to control our pug would be nice. (some horizontal movementspeed depending on the pug etc)\n- a 'life'system would also be nice. We could then be able to 'buy' lives with our earned pugpoints etc, and it would mean a longer run for the pug resulting in a higher score.\n\nOverall it's a good game but there is room for improvement.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherfuckingwaffleking/recommended/418070/","motherfuckingwaffleking","Waffle King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherfuckingwaffleking/","203 products in account","What The Pug Did I Just Waste My Money On - An Official Waffle King Review\n~Find more here.[www.nonm.co.uk]\n\nI'm a pretty attractive person. It's pretty nice, being attractive. I get to talk to the other attractive people, and I never feel like an unwanted burden to society. That can happen to the undesirables sometimes. The ones that are not as attractive.\n\n\nBut being as great as I am does indeed come with some drawbacks. Sometimes, I worry that I push people away. Being beautiful, intelligent, talented, and exceeding in all possible ways can put unwanted pressure on those beneath you. I worry sometimes that those around me might decide to just kill themselves when they realize nothing they can do will ever mean anything when compared to me.\n\n\nI mean, hey, if I was in your shoes I totally would. If I was an undesirable like you, no doubt would I be staring down the barrel of a shotgun and hoping that I'd drunk enough to not feel a thing.\n\n\nBut that's not the answer, most of the time. The world needs all kinds of people. Beauty can be perceived in a lot of ways. Some people loves huskies, for their striking appearance. Some love pitbulls, for their innate power and presence. Some even love pugs, for their charmingly disfigured appearance.\n\n\nSee where I'm getting at? Just adopt a pug or something already and maybe people would like you more. If you adopt a puppy, you can't be THAT bad. And at least the puppy will never think less of you. They don't know any better.\n\n\nIf you're in the market for pugs though, just make sure you don't accidentally get this pug.\n\n\nThis is probably the worst pug you could get. Worse than the one with distemper that's wheezing in a puddle of its own vomit and diarrhea.\n\n\nTurbo Pug is a pug-themed endless runner for the PC, available to download on Steam. At first glance, it definitely looks like Game of The Year material. But a darkness resides under its cheerful exterior. Like a distemper-ridden pug's steaming pile of mixed fluids and excrement on your loved one's bed that you covered up with a frilly throw pillow. They may not see it coming as they see it. They might smell something kind of off. But once you're in it, you're in it. And you'll wish you never had.\n\n\nThere's not much to Turbo Pug. It's an endless runner. Yeah, sure, short and simple games like that have a market. I'm not gonna knock it for being simplistic. That's kind of the genre. It's a really cheap game. Both cost and production value. It cost me pocket change. Like I'd bought lunch and threw whatever change they gave me into the trash accidentally. It really won't be missed. I'm not gonna go digging for my money back. It's just a little unfortunate. Gonna put a damper on the next 5 minutes of my life, until I forget about it and move on.\n\n\nRunners can be decent. They can pass the time in a painless and easy way. Turbo Pug does not do that. Turbo Pug is a grind. An eyesore. I'd rather stare into the sun to pass the time than play this. And that would require me to put on pants and go outside. I'd rather put on pants than play this game. If I had a rating system, that would be the lowest of low ranks, below 0. "IGN says 0/10" "Kotaku says No" "Waffle King says Made Me Put On Pants". That's what this game gets.\n\n\nTurbo Pug is the worst kind of endless runner. Bland, monotonous, and fails to hold your attention for longer than a minute. Reaction time between obstacles is short and brutal, meaning you're prone to dying awfully quick. Some obstacles even blend in with the surrounding background, and the screen scrolls so quick you'll often die before realizing what you hit. And it's always the same couple obstacles that'll kill you, because there's only so many in the game.\n\n\nIt's randomly generated, and yet only from playing it a handful of times I've already seen repeating areas. Like the game generates the level in chunks, and there aren't enough chunks to go around. Worse than life in gulag. Dark, cold. Chunks always spread too thin. Never enough for everyone. We starve.\n\n\nYou'll be sick of this game as soon as you boot it up. I'm not even kidding. Its stupid looping soundtrack, its stupidly simple gameplay, and its stupid art direction. You wouldn't believe how bad the art is, just from looking at screenshots. It might look good. Pixels are cute, pugs are cute. It's happy and bright, what's not to love?\n\n\nIt's nauseating to play. It hurts to stare at for longer than a minute. Trying to focus your eyes on the endlessly scrolling pixels as they race past you is headache-inducing. It's like no one play-tested this piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nOr maybe they did, but they just swept the complaints under the rug, like pug diarrhea. "Oh, Little Billy got eye cancer from playing this game? They're all swollen up and leaking thick, musky fluids everywhere? One of his eyes exploded, you say, and splattered the other children with mushy eye residue? Quick, get the other children to stop playing. This game is ready to ship, and we don't want their precious eyes exploding. We can sell those on the black market. Now get them back in the warehouse, if this game flops we need brand-name knockoff shoes to sell." is probably exactly how that conversation went.\n\n\nI like pugs. I really do. Pugs are nice. But you can't stick a pug on a stack of child corpses and call it art. It's illegal, and would get you banned from ever driving an ice cream truck ever again.\n\n\nSome people are husky people, some people are pitbull people, some people are pug people. But just adopting a pug won't make you any less undesirable. You'd still be boring, unpleasant to look at for long periods of time, and stupid. Much like this game. Adding pugs doesn't fix all of your problems. It'll just get people to notice you, maybe throw some spare change your way, and entertain the thought of you for maybe a minute. But only just. After that it's just painful and awkward.","January 10","false","1.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","45","9","20","6","0"

What makes it especially annoying is every time your pug dies the main menu reappears, making you launch from there.  There's no quick and easy restart function and if your pug so much as bumps into anything he's dead.  Maybe it's because I'm trying to play using only a keyboard & mouse on my PC, but all I do is sit here & hit the spacebar until my pug dies.

It’s totally fair to expose the truth AND my suggestions to your customers. Furthermore if you have nothing to hide, why you want a private communication?\nUntil now, none reward/ gift was sent, and this review will stay here until the 3 first top players confirm they got their reward.\n\nYou are trying to justify what’s going on by saying that is due by a misunderstanding of ALL your players?\nMaybe it’s YOUR FAULT if there is a problem of communication, no?\nYou think, my suppositions were not cool? But maybe your sense of organization wasn't cool, too. When we see multiples reset of leader board and problems of communication with your community.\n\nMy message is here to say: you have a part of responsibility.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI will not talk about this game itself during this review, because of my low experience on this game and it simply not my type of game, my review on this point will be not interesting.\nHowever, it will denonce the potential spoiler behavior of the developers of Space Cat Studios.\n\nThese men set up a competition (3 top players on leaderboard) for a period of 1 month, moreover a reduction of 50% was set up to push for consumption.\n\nThis commercial operation turns badly towards to the end of the competition period, when all tops player was removed of the leaderboard. One of dev just said to them "they are cheaters" and has closed the conversation with all of them. And the leaderboard shows new “players” on the top (whereas the leaderboard was virtually unchanged for several days).\nThe probability these new “players” belong to the developers themself are very large!\n\nMy friend Truie-en-sauce (STEAM PROFILE) who was first on this leaderbord, has already contact a dev by the past (he had provided a video directly to the developer, to prove his score at the beginning of the competition, because of a reset of leaderboard due to changes in the game).\nThe developer replied that he was ability to check the veracity of the records by scanning files of 3 first players and he doesn’t want a video.\n\nThese devs have:\n- Removes players of the leaderboard without any verification at the end of the contest Period\n- Probably place fictive player in the top\n- Profited by this period of competition and reduction to boost sales\n- Probably will never provide a single reward to anybody\n\nOne player of this leader board has made a video following the DEPRORABLE behavior of these developers:\nTurbo Pug Competition - Dev calls me a Cheater\n\nDo not buy this game in any case, asked to reimburse you if you made this purchase.\nThese men are possibly crooks and their place is not on steam, which is a platform for respectable peoples!","November 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","14","31","3","6"

The music tracks are pretty simple and use a dog barking SFX, but it's not done in an obnoxious manner. The game itself can be hard to see at times due to the visual effects, and the gray spikes blend in with the background a bit much. The worst aspect is the random thunderstorms, which can completely ruin your run. It's the only detrimental RNG factor, as the generated maps are all capable of being solved if you have the skill for it.

There are other controls listed such as 'fire' but none of them actually exist in-game as pressing the said button for such functions dont actually have such or even any result, theres also an option to use a Controller but the controller doesnt actually work in the game\n\nThe 'leaderboards' feature is also a lie as not only is the entire leaderboard just full of '9r' scores but they arent actually online scores, its just a made up leaderboard within the game\n\nThe 'procedurally generated levels' feature is a lie too as they arent procedurally generated but rather its just several different levels that get chosen at random\n\nthe game also has a 'graphics' setting which is a lie too (not to mention wtf would you need a graphics setting on a game like this anyways), changing the graphics setting does absolutely nothing and the game was made on GM8 so ofcourse you cant change the graphics settings...\n\nIt would be nice if when you held the Jump button, that you actually continued jumping every time you landed back down but as it is; you have to keep pressing the Jump button after every time you land\n\nTheres 6 'pugs' to choose from (2 of which look like cats but hey, they must be Pugs because the game says 'choose your pug') but they arent just cosmetic changes, and are unbalanced as its just the further you go down the list of Pugs, the more times that you can do an airbourne jump, so clearly, the one at the end of the list of pugs to choose from is the best. Oh, and why is there a gay pug?\n\nTheres only 2 songs and both are mindnumbing and don't suite the pace of the game, they also both start when your Pug dies instead of when you start the session, so you end up starting to play when the song is part way through\n\nSo yeah, theres a lot of miss-advertisement in this game and a lot of lies but the biggest lie of them all is this review, so yeah, you go out there and you spend that 69 pence because this game will bring a whole lot more happyness than what the tryptophan will give you in a 69 pence pack of bananas #y u so mad? peace","November 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","1"

I bought it for two quarters, and I hadn't realized how much fun you could have with two quarters. You might as well play it on beutiful graphic setting, since it can run at like a million fps. 10/10 Pros: Pugs and rainbows, cost 2 quarters (when on sale), Cons: I have been thinking for 30 minutes trying to think of a con. Like, I pay 2 bucks 50 cents on CS:GO cases, (btw, no Dragon Lore yet), and with 2.50$ I could just gift 5 of these games (when on sale) to all y'all! Thanks for reading my review, love the game. Byeeeeee.... Buy it. What are you doing... uhm... you can stop reading my review now. Stop. Now. Seriously. Uh... why don't you go buy the game... Or play it... Or stop reading my review. Okay. Bye now... Seriously. Oh? Do you want to know my inventory on CS:GO or something...? Click on my profile to see my inventory. Okay, bye. Bye. Goodbye. See ya. Stop reading this review!

The thing that bothers me the most is the visibility of spikes and blades - sometimes it's hard to spot them, because the colour blends with the background (especially while it's raining).\nThat surely was well-spend 0,59€. Thanks and keep working!\n\nWHAT I LOVE:\nPrice\nReally nice retro graphics\nFantastic soundtrack\nWeather changes\nPugs (of course)\nWHAT I WOULD CHANGE:\nColour of the spikes and blades\nThe difficulty level of unlocking the characters - it's too easy and after a few runs you have all the pugs and cats\nWHAT I WOULD ADD:\nMore pugs\nLevels with different background and obstacles\nSome kind of items giving you bonus skills for a short time (being immune to spikes etc.)","November 16, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
